HEADLINE: Shaking Up Air Fares' Status Quo;
Entrepreneur Seeks Break for Last-Minute Business Fliers

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
It's an expensive anomaly for corporate America: the biggest customers getting stuck paying the highest rates. But when it comes to the airline industry, and the steep fares that companies face for most last-minute travel, it has long been the normal state of affairs, seemingly impervious to even the most committed challenges.
Just ask Kevin P. Mitchell, an entrepreneur who has spent the last five years trying to give big companies more leverage. 
 Battling a system that he calls "inefficient and dysfunctional," Mr. Mitchell ran into a wall of opposition from the airlines and many big travel agencies, and appeared at several points to be heading for failure.
But now, in an outcome that serves as a reminder to entrepreneurs of the value of persistence and resourcefulness, Mr. Mitchell finally seems to be on the verge of shaking up the status quo. His solution: give the companies a way to fly without relying on the major airlines.
The rationale is clear. The average round-trip business fare increased 86 percent, to $820, over the nearly five-year period from May 1992 to January 1997, according to American Express Travel. And though business travelers account for more than half of the major airlines' revenues, they typically pay two to four times as much for last-minute tickets as leisure travelers who can book ahead.
Mr. Mitchell, who has the financial backing of blue-chip companies like Chrysler, Procter & Gamble and Black & Decker, expects to announce shortly an agreement with Frontier Airlines, Reno Air and possibly a third low-fare carrier that would guarantee them revenues for three years in return for starting service in cities sorely in need of airline competition.
Frontier executives said they liked the idea of minimal risk while entering a new market. "It's not a no-brainer, but it's as close as you can get to one in this industry," said Jeff Potter, marketing vice president of the Denver-based carrier.
The consortium that Mr. Mitchell runs -- the Business Travel Contractors Corporation of Lafayette Hill, Pa. -- has also been negotiating with operators of corporate jets to start a kind of flying car pool. Under one plan, a company like the Flight Services Group of Stratford, Conn., would fly small jets on routes chosen by the consortium's 45 member companies. They would depart at certain times each weekday, and seats would be available only to those companies' employees.
How much might all this save? The full fare between Philadelphia and Chicago is now about $800 round trip, although some corporate customers that regularly use that route might get discounts, which are common throughout the industry and typically range from 10 to 15 percent. By guaranteeing revenues to an airline to start serving that route, Mr. Mitchell anticipates a fare for all last-minute travelers of $220 round trip, with a further 15 percent discount offered to companies that join the consortium for a fee of about $3,000. The fare would be guaranteed for the term of the contract, except for adjustments to account for higher costs, such as a spike in the price of jet fuel.
Mr. Mitchell has become "the Ralph Nader representing the corporations in business travel issues," said Peter Buchheit, director of travel and meeting services for the Black & Decker Corporation.
But Michael E. Levine, executive vice president for marketing and international operations at Northwest Airlines, said the plan was doomed because the participating carriers would not be able to offer the frequency of flights that companies needed to get their people places at the last minute.
"It is moral and legal and well within the spirit of deregulation," Mr. Levine said of Mr. Mitchell's effort. But, he added, "I think it's impractical and won't work."
In any event, some Government officials recently started paying attention to Mr. Mitchell's consortium. Senator Bill Frist, a Republican from Tennessee, has agreed to speak this month at a conference that the consortium is organizing on airline competition. And Patrick V. Murphy, Deputy Assistant Secretary for aviation at the Department of Transportation, said his agency supported anything that promoted competition.
"We find it to be a very exciting idea," he said of the revenue-guarantee proposal.
It is not the first time that companies have tried to gain more control over business travel. As long ago as 1984, the Kimberly-Clark Corporation was frustrated enough to get into the airline business itself, founding Midwest Express, a low-cost carrier that provided the only direct service between Appleton, Wis., its headquarters at the time, and Atlanta, then its most heavily traveled route. The company, a paper-products maker now based in Dallas, took Midwest public in 1995 and sold its final stake last year.
These days, companies are trying a number of ways to rein in travel costs as part of an overall effort to contain expenses. Corporate travel budgets are a fat target since they are more discretionary than many other expenses. The efforts have ranged from cutting back on the number of trips to encouraging employees to stay over on a Saturday night to get a lower fare.
For all his more ambitious plans, Mr. Mitchell said there were moments when he considered ending the consortium venture, wondering whether he had made a mistake by walking away from a good job at the Cigna Corporation, the Philadelphia-based insurer where the idea for the consortium was born.
Mr. Mitchell's saga began in the summer of 1992. During a meeting with his division president, Mr. Mitchell, then a Cigna vice president responsible for a $60 million travel budget, explained that because of American Airlines' widely publicized "Value Pricing" plan, most corporate discounts had been wiped out. "What are we going to do about this?" he was asked.
Mr. Mitchell did not know. But the more he studied the industry, the more he was struck by how money traded hands in so many directions. Airlines were paying extra commissions to travel agencies to steer corporate customers their way, for example, and the agencies were giving rebate checks to corporate travel managers in return for the business.
When he called travel managers at other large companies, Mr. Mitchell heard similar complaints. Even some airline executives he reached confessed that they too would like a new way of doing business.
Mr. Mitchell shared his findings with top executives at Cigna, and they gave him a $250,000 budget to work on an idea. By the spring of 1993, Mr. Mitchell said, he had 20 Fortune 100 companies urging him on in his research.
Mr. Mitchell hatched an unusual plan -- he wanted airlines to offer corporate customers guaranteed fares that were stripped of all unnecessary costs, such as commissions and fees for computer reservation systems. He also wanted a simplified fare structure based on the length of trips. He thought companies could pay travel agencies flat fees for their services rather than airlines paying them commissions. Executives at a number of airlines -- also annoyed by the inefficiency of the system -- were intrigued and encouraged him to keep going.
After an antitrust lawyer suggested that he set up an independent company to pursue the idea, Mr. Mitchell faced the question of whether he should leave Cigna. That would depend, he decided, on whether he could get financial backing. He calculated that he needed $400,000 a year to get started, and asked each of the 20 companies that had supported his efforts for $20,000. Within a week, the first check arrived, and 19 more soon followed.
To Mr. Mitchell's surprise, word of his efforts had not leaked out to the media or to travel agents. But that changed in June 1994, and the reaction was swift and sharp. Airline industry pundits said Mr. Mitchell was trying to put travel agencies out of business. The consortium -- and a raft of supposed reasons why it would never get off the ground -- was the talk of travel industry conventions. Most observers soon wrote off the venture as moribund.
"The arrows were flying thick and fast," Mr. Mitchell said.
In hindsight, he said, the ridicule served a purpose. Since no one considered the venture a serious threat, no one sued, as Mr. Mitchell feared they might, on a claim that the group was planning to abuse its collective buying power. Although Mr. Mitchell was confident the consortium could withstand legal challenges, he worried that even the threat of litigation would scare away members.
By July 1995, the consortium won the blessing of the Justice Department, giving it a measure of protection. Mr. Mitchell then started developing proposals for individual airlines.
But some carriers were not interested in hearing from the group, contending that its proposal would force them to hire more administrative people and thus increase costs.
Other airlines considered the proposal but expressed concerns about the pace of change and the loss of control over pricing. Still, Mr. Mitchell thought that if he could get just one big carrier interested, others might follow.
He set a deadline of March 29, 1996, for formal responses. Southwest Airlines agreed to the proposal, but it was already a low-fare carrier. The reaction from every other major carrier was the same: no.
"This was now years of work leading up to this great climax," Mr. Mitchell said. "It was clearly a disappointment."
Mr. Mitchell was no longer convinced it was worthwhile to keep trying. But the remaining members of the consortium -- a number had dropped out -- disagreed. They said the main reason they supported the effort was that it was a thorn in the side of the airlines.
Charles Braswell, manager of general services for the Chrysler Corporation, said that he had already seen benefits in the form of deeper fare discounts that he attributed to membership in the consortium. "I looked at it as a long-term initiative from the start," he added.
Mr. Mitchell regrouped, and set his sights lower, hoping to get airlines to agree to offer guaranteed fares for six months on specific routes. The airlines rejected that plan last August.
Mr. Mitchell then switched gears, using the guarantee of revenues to entice carriers like Frontier and Reno Air to enter new markets. Once he completes contract terms, he hopes to get new service into Philadelphia, Detroit and Cincinnati this summer.
In the meantime, he is talking to operators like Flight Services to see if the economics of a corporate-jet airline would work.
"The market is so big, and the problems are so varied, there is room for multiple solutions," Mr. Mitchell said.
He added that he could not guess what he would be doing a year from now. The consortium's story has been one of "complete unpredictability," he said. But once the program is up and running, he may start tinkering with something else.
And what might that be?
"Health care," he said, quickly adding, "Imagine the enthusiasm."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Money From Stocks Buoys Short-Term Issues

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
With the exception of the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, Government securities were mostly higher yesterday, as investors moved money out of a plunging stock market to the more secure short end of the Treasury market, temporarily at least.
The results of yesterday's Treasury bill auction were stronger than expected, and for the same reason, analysts said. The bidding outstripped the amount of available securities. 
 Rates dropped modestly at the auction, with the three-month bill averaging 5.18 percent, down from 5.26 percent last week, and the six-month issue at 5.31 percent, down from 5.33 percent.
The 30-year bond fell 5/32, to a price of 94 7/32 to yield 7.09 percent, up from 7.08 percent on Thursday. The market was closed on Friday.
The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index was released yesterday morning, but market analysts said it gave no real clue about what to expect from today's release of the report of the National Association of Purchasing Management for March. Investors holding securities with long maturities did express some fear of a strong national purchasing report and an even stronger Friday employment report, which led to a mild selloff at the long end of the market.
David Shabelman, Treasury market analyst at MMS International, San Francisco, said the two reports would be the focus for the Treasury market this week. "A strong N.A.P.M. would increase concerns of a strong jobs report," he said, "but traders do not expect sellers to be too aggressive until the market's oversold condition is alleviated."
He added that "new lows will promote profit taking and short-covering, as traders position themselves in front of the employment report."
The Chicago purchasing managers index was 57.5 in March, above the 56.2 in February and the forecast of 57. However, the component that measures the length of time it takes to make supplier deliveries dropped to 46.8 from 56 and could be interpreted to mean that demand was down.
Patrick R. Dimick, Treasury market analyst at UBS Securities, said the technical picture was continuing to deteriorate, and for the second trading session the market had set new lows. "Closing near those lows today suggests the bears are still firmly in control," he said.
"I think that a 6.50 percent yield on the two-year note is a popular objective," Mr. Dimick added, "which means that investors looking to bargain-hunt probably won't surface until we back yields up to that level."
Currently the big game in the market is trying to identify support levels and recognize the buy levels, he said. "The success or failure of bargain-hunting strategies, I believe, will be dependent on economic data rather than technically dependent," he said.
The consensus for today's report from the purchasing managers index is 53.5, while the consensus for the unemployment report on Friday is that about 190,000 jobs will be added to the economy.
"The next Federal Open Market Committee meeting is not until May 20," Mr. Dimick said, "and we will have two full data cycles from which to handicap the outcome of that meeting."
Other data reported yesterday included personal consumption, up three-tenths of a percent in February. January's figure was revised upward to 1 percent from seven-tenths of a percent, suggesting that first-quarter consumption will increase to above 5 percent.
Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber, said: "It's well worth emphasizing that many important economic statistics, including consumer spending, inevitably move in spurts that invariably trigger financial market overreactions. The January consumption spurt this year reminds us of the February and May spurts last year that were followed by two much softer months."
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	 	Average Price	98.691	97.316	Discounted Rate	5.18%	5.31%	Coupon Yield	5.32%	5.53%	High Price	98.693	97.326	Discounted Rate	5.17%	5.29%	Coupon Yield	5.31%	5.51%	Low Price	98.688	97.316	Discounted Rate	5.19%	5.31%	Coupon Yield	5.33%	5.53%	Accepted at low price	10%	35%	Total applied for	$37,979,234	$37,156,243	Accepted	$7,062,059	$7,040,293	Noncompetitive	$1,417,759	$1,211,688	
 
Both issues are dated April 3. The three-month bills mature on July 3 and the six-month bills on Oct. 2.

HEADLINE: HIGH COURT RULES CABLE MUST CARRY LOCAL TV STATIONS

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
A deeply divided Supreme Court awarded a major economic and political victory to the broadcast television industry today by upholding a Federal law that requires cable television systems to carry the signals of local over-the-air broadcast stations.
The 5-to-4 decision, with a majority opinion by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy and a crucial concurring vote by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, rejected the cable industry's argument that the 1992 law was an unconstitutional intrusion on cable operators' editorial autonomy, a form of Government-compelled speech that violates the First Amendment. 
 But today's ruling focused less on free-speech issues than on supporting Congress's right to judge what approach would best insure a competitive communications marketplace. And the ruling means that even with the prospect of new competition from satellite television and other technologies, Federal regulators can continue to treat cable operators as local monopolies that control the public's access to television programming.
Justice Kennedy said that in imposing the "must carry" requirement after years of hearings and debate, Congress had acquired sufficient evidence that cable systems had both the economic motive and the practical ability to inflict serious economic injury on broadcast stations simply by refusing to carry their signals into the 60 percent of American homes that are wired for cable.
As to whether local broadcasters would suffer economic harm if the must-carry law was overturned, the evidence was less than conclusive and was subject to conflicting interpretations, Justice Kennedy wrote. But, he wrote, "we are not at liberty to substitute our judgment for the reasonable conclusion of a legislative body."
Typically, households that subscribe to cable do not have aerial antennas for receiving over-the-air signals from local broadcast stations. And in the case of densely settled urban areas with high-rise buildings, like Manhattan, over-the-air signals of some weaker stations can be difficult to receive even with an aerial antenna.
Congress passed the must-carry law in an effort to insure that the broadcast stations could be viewed on cable subscribers' television sets. The law requires cable systems with more than 12 channels to reserve one-third of their channels for the retransmission of local broadcast signals.
Because the must-carry rule has been in effect since 1992, television viewers are not likely to notice any immediate impact from the decision. And, cable operators, for the most part, had no immediate plans to remove many local broadcast channels, anyway.
The true impact may come a year or two from now, when a national satellite television network planned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation is to begin offering at least some local broadcast channels to its subscribers. It remains unclear whether the News Corporation's system will be obliged to observe the must-carry rules -- a technical impossibility, since the 500-channel satellite network could not carry signals from all of the nation's 1,544 local broadcast stations.
Today's decision, in Turner Broadcasting System v. Federal Communications Commission, No. 95-992, ended a five-year legal battle whose outcome remained in doubt until the last minute. The case produced two 5-to-4 Supreme Court decisions, totaling 147 pages, in addition to tens of thousands of pages of testimony and documents produced in two hearings before a special three-judge Federal District Court.
The District Court had twice upheld the must-carry provision, which is part of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992. Three years ago, a Supreme Court opinion by Justice Kennedy vacated the earlier of the District Court decisions, ruling that the Government had to present more evidence to justify the law's assumption that the broadcast industry's economic viability was in jeopardy without guaranteed retransmission of its signals by the increasingly dominant medium of cable.
While the Court's initial decision led many people to conclude that the cable industry had the upper hand and would ultimately prevail, there were two aspects of Justice Kennedy's 1994 opinion that proved crucial to the broadcasters' victory today.
One aspect was a matter of First Amendment doctrine. The Court concluded then, as now, that the must-carry provision was "content neutral," meaning that the Government was requiring retransmission of the broadcast signals without respect to the actual programming. As such, the law had to pass only an intermediate level of First Amendment scrutiny: that it further an "important governmental interest" without burdening speech more than necessary.
The second important aspect to the 1994 decision was the economic theory that the Court offered as a potential justification for the regulation: a view of cable television as an anti-competitive "bottleneck" through which broadcast signals had to pass and from which the broadcast industry needed protection. Justice Kennedy wrote today that it was necessary only to regard this theory as a reasonable one for Congress to have embraced, without necessarily putting the Court's own "imprimatur" on it.
While agreeing with the result today and joining most of Justice Kennedy's opinion, Justice Breyer wrote a separate opinion to say that he did not agree with the Court's economic analysis. He said that in his view, the law was justified by the need to insure that the broadcasting industry remained financially healthy enough to provide "a rich mix of over-the-air programming" for the 40 percent of American households that do not subscribe to cable.
That "speech-enhancing" consequence of the law, Justice Breyer said, would help these viewers more than it would hurt cable subscribers who might lose access to some cable channels as operators complied with the requirement of devoting one-third of their channels to broadcast retransmission.
One cable network in particular, C-Span, which carries the proceedings of Congress and other public affairs programming, has complained that cable operators have often squeezed it out to comply with the must-carry requirements. Brian Lamb, C-Span's chief executive, said today that his network had lost access to 3.5 million viewers since the must-carry requirement took effect.
Justice Breyer's vote was the focus of intense interest because he is the only Justice who was not on the Court at the time of the 1994 decision. His predecessor, Justice Harry A. Blackmun, had joined the majority in voting to apply only the intermediate level of First Amendment scrutiny. So it was evident that if the other Justices all adhered to their positions -- as in fact they did today -- then Justice Breyer would be in a position to control the outcome.
The others in the majority today were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens and David H. Souter.
The dissenters were Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice O'Connor wrote a 32-page dissenting opinion, which the others joined. Three years ago, these Justices had argued that the law should be analyzed under the strictest First Amendment scrutiny. Today they said that the law failed even the less-demanding constitutional test that the majority had applied.
Far from being a "measured response to Congressional concerns about monopoly power," Justice O'Connor said, the law was based on bad economics, unproven assumptions and inadequate attention to technological developments.
Justice O'Connor said that because "marginal" broadcast stations were the only ones that cable operators would not voluntarily carry, the notion that the viability of the broadcast industry as a whole was at stake was "entirely mythical." She said the Court "trivializes the First Amendment issue at stake in this case" by deference to "a highly dubious economic theory."
Further, Justice O'Connor said, "growing use of direct-broadcast satellite television also tends to undercut the notion that cable operators have an inevitable monopoly over video services entering cable households."
The principle of judicial deference to Congressional judgments, Justice O'Connor said, "does not require wholesale deference to judgments about rapidly changing technologies that are based on unquestionably outdated information."

HEADLINE: Crime Reports Drop Sharply In New York

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
New York City's falling crime rate continued to plummet during the first quarter of 1997, according to preliminary police statistics released yesterday, and the decline was fueled by particularly steep drops in two of the crimes that by turns most frighten and annoy New Yorkers: murder and car theft.
Murder dropped more precipitously than any other major crime: 194 people were reported killed during the first three months of the year, a 27 percent decrease over the same period last year, when 266 people were reported killed. The next steepest drop was in car thefts: 13,004 cars were reported stolen during the first quarter of the year, down 20 percent from the same period last year, when 16,329 cars were reported stolen. 
 Overall, reports of the seven major crimes -- murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, grand larceny and car theft -- dropped by 15.6 percent over the same period last year, despite the milder winter. Experts say that harsh winters, like last year's, are much more likely to keep criminals from venturing outdoors.
And once again the crime statistics provided welcome news to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is making the drop in crime that has occurred on his watch the centerpiece of his bid for re-election. In the last four years, reported crime has dropped by more than 43 percent in the city. The drop in car thefts, in particular, may be of interest to voters in Queens and Staten Island, strongholds for Mr. Giuliani where that crime has been an issue. The new figures reinforce a perception that the city is safer, and virtually eliminate any hope that Democrats had for making crime an issue in the mayoral race.
Although reported crime dropped in commands across the five boroughs, some areas experienced greater drops than others. The steepest declines were in northern Brooklyn, the Bronx and northern Manhattan; the smallest were in Staten Island, Manhattan south of 59th Street and southern Brooklyn.
Of special interest to police officials was the fact that the steepest crime drop in the city was in northern Brooklyn, where the Police Department is running a pilot program that consolidates all its divisions -- housing, narcotics, detectives and others -- under the control of one locally based commander, Assistant Chief Joseph P. Dunne. Crime reports there dropped 21.3 percent.
In other boroughs, detectives answer to the Chief of Detectives at One Police Plaza in Manhattan, narcotics detectives report to the commander of the Narcotics Division, and housing officers are accountable to the chief of the Housing Bureau. In Brooklyn North they all answer to the same man.
In the neighborhood covered bv the department's other major new initiative, the anti-drug campaign in northern Manhattan, the drop in crime, 16.3 percent, also outpaced that in the rest of the city. In northern Manhattan, Federal, State and local law enforcement agencies are working to drive out drug dealers with aggressive policing tactics.
Given the unusually mild winter, especially compared with the previous one, some criminologists expressed surprise at the continued decline in crimes that are usually committed outdoors, like auto thefts and shootings.
"The police have an old maxim, something to the effect that the best cop is a cold day or a snowstorm," said Andrew Karmen, a professor of criminology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. "It is in a severe winter that you expect a drop, not a mild one."
If any statistic offered a sore point for police officials, it was that ticket-writing by police officers was falling faster than the crime rate. Many officers have been staging an unofficial ticket-writing slowdown since contract negotiations between their union and the city broke down in January.
The statistics released yesterday showed that summons writing was still way down. There were 591,974 parking tickets written so far this year, a 36.2 percent decrease over the same three months in 1996, when 927,866 were written. And there were 201,728 moving violations issued, a 34.5 percent decrease over the previous year, when there were 307,771.
Commissioner Howard Safir sent high-ranking supervisors into the field to make sure officers wrote tickets and summonses, even suspending firearms training for weeks at the police shooting range while its supervisors were sent to the streets. But the figures showed that despite these moves and others, the slowdown appeared to be persisting.
Otherwise the news was welcome. "This is terrific; crime continues to drop across the boards," Professor Karmen said. "And as long as the factors that influence it continue to remain, there's no reason to think the drop won't continue."
Among the factors Professor Karmen cited were the decline of crack, the economic upturn and the more aggressive policing strategies.
In Brooklyn, Deputy Chief Joseph J. Esposito said that the strategies appeared to be paying dividends, strategies like the focus on "quality of life" crimes, the beefed-up warrant enforcement, flooding drug-infested areas with officers and questioning everyone who is arrested and put into the system. "When you concentrate on the little things, the big things fall into place," he said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Manages a Slight Gain After Showing Early Losses

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rallied to end slightly higher against most currencies yesterday, recovering from a decline caused by another stiff drop in American stock prices.
Traders attributed the dollar's comeback partly to a growing economy and rising American interest rates. The higher rates have helped depress stock prices. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 157.11 points, or 2.3 percent, yesterday. 
 Currency trading was thin yesterday in the aftermath of the Easter weekend; most markets were closed Friday, and many European markets remained closed yesterday. The light volume exaggerated price movements, so currency traders were reluctant to read too much into the behavior of the dollar.
"We piggybacked on the asset markets for much of the day, but the dollar rallied and we're closing right about where we opened up," said Robert Katz, a currency trader at the MTB Bank Corporation in New York.
In New York, the dollar settled at 123.80 Japanese yen, up from 123.48 yen on Thursday. The dollar was at 1.6770 German marks, up from 1.6736. The British pound cost $1.6395, up from $1.6315.
The dollar weakened sharply when the stock market opened and the Dow Jones average immediately tumbled, raising fears that investors would flee American assets and cause a diminishing demand for dollars. At its lows of the day the dollar cost 1.6620 marks and 123.65 yen.
The catalyst for the stock market's drop was another batch of stronger-than-expected economic data, including a report showing that personal income rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in February, the biggest monthly gain since June 1996.
The figures strengthened expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again at its next policy-making meeting, in May, to try to slow the economy and impede inflation. Last Tuesday, the Fed raised rates for the first time in more than two years.
The dollar showed some strength against the yen early yesterday on further weakness in Japan's stock market and expectations that the Bank of Japan's quarterly economic survey due tomorrow would show that the economy was still recovering slowly from its long slump.

HEADLINE: U.S. Incomes Accelerate, Led by Wages

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
Growth in Americans' incomes accelerated during February, led by gains in wages and salaries, a reminder of the concerns raised by the Federal Reserve's chairman that rising wages could add to inflationary pressures.
The Commerce Department said today that personal income rose nine-tenths of 1 percent last month, while personal spending crept up three-tenths of 1 percent. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News had expected a rise of seven-tenths of 1 percent in personal income and of four-tenths of 1 percent in spending. 
 Wages rose by $50 billion at an annual rate last month, the largest gain since April 1994.
 February's income gain came on the heels of a January spending spree. While incomes rose four-tenths of 1 percent in January -- the gain was revised upward from the three-tenths of 1 percent reported initially -- spending jumped a revised 1 percent. The spending gain was previously reported as seven-tenths of 1 percent.
"You're going to see an increase in spending in the months ahead," said William V. Sullivan, a Dean Witter economist. "This is a vibrant economy."
Americans' personal outlays make up roughly two-thirds of economic activity, and consumers' eagerness to spend is spurring the economy at a pace that worries investors and Federal Reserve policy makers. Last week, when they decided to push up the overnight bank lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.5 percent, they cited "persisting strength in demand" that could eventually cause economic imbalances and spur inflation.
 Demand, spurred by job growth, near-record consumer confidence and exceptional gains in stocks, helped push economic growth to a 3.8 percent annual rate during 1996's fourth quarter. In the first quarter, growth has been running at close to a 3.3 percent pace, said Evelina Tainer, chief economist at IndoSuez Carr Futures in Chicago. "The first quarter is just zooming along," she said before today's report.
Given the income gains and other signs of economic growth, consumers are likely to continue to spend, and the Fed policy makers may feel the need to push up rates further to cool their enthusiasm. Last week's quarter-point increase "is a drop in the bucket given the economic momentum we have," she said.
 In today's report, the Commerce Department also said disposable income, or the money left over after taxes, increased eight-tenths of 1 percent in February. The savings rate rose to 5.5 percent from January's 5.1 percent, the highest since a 5.6 percent rate last September.
 Consumers' interest payments to businesses, which are counted separately from the overall spending figures, increased half a percent during February, slower than a gain of nine-tenths of 1 percent in January.

A Broker of the Bosnia Deal Is the Choice to Lead NATO
Wesley K. Clark, an Army general who helped broker the 1995 peace settlement in Bosnia, was nominated by President Clinton to take command of NATO and all American forces in Europe. General Clark, a former Rhodes scholar from Arkansas, would take up the post in July after Senate confirmation. The incumbent, Gen. George A. Joulwan, is retiring. A3 

Arabs Vow Boycott of Israel
Foreign ministers of the 22-nation Arab League ended a two-day meeting in Cairo with a decision to freeze relations with Israel and to reactivate the Arab economic boycott of Israeli products. The resolution was made to protest Israel's decision to build a Jewish housing settlement in East Jerusalem. King Hussein of Jordan said the resolution was not binding; Israel dismissed it as "strange, wishful thinking." A3
 
Italy to Search for Refugee Ship
Prime Minister Romano Prodi of Italy ordered a search for remains of a ship full of Albanian refugees that sank after being struck by an Italian Navy warship, but said the naval patrols of Italy's southern shores would continue. Mr. Prodi said that the patrols were prompted by reports that criminal organizations were behind the refugee flow, and that they were not intended to deter Albanian refugees. A6
 
Cambodian Rivals Call for Calm
Rival Cambodian officials agreed on a cooling-off period after a grenade attack on an opposition political rally killed at least 16 people and wounded 120 others. Co-Prime Ministers Hun Sen and Norodom Ranariddh, whose competition has paralyzed the Government, agreed to avoid angry words and hasty actions while a special commission investigates. A6
 
India and Pakistan End Talks
The first high-level talks between India and Pakistan in over three years ended without any breakthrough. None was expected, given the crisis precipitated in India by the Congress Party's decision to withdraw from the coalition Government of Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda. He has until next Monday to win a parliamentary vote of confidence. A6
 
Key Zaire Town Falls to Rebels
Rebel forces led by Laurent Kabila in eastern Zaire captured Kamina, a railway hub whose fall cuts off Lubumbashi, the country's second-largest city, from the capital, Kinshasa. The rebels also decided, for "security reasons," to bar Rwandan Hutu refugees from the city of Kisangani, complicating efforts to send the refugees home, according to United Nations officials. A8
 
U.N. to Stay in Guatemala
The United Nations will extend its human rights mission in Guatemala and widen its mandate to oversee adherence to the country's recent peace accords. Both the Government and former leftist rebels asked the mission to stay until the end of March 1998. (Reuters)

Cult Investigation Winds Down
The authorities released the last two names of the Heaven's Gate cult members found dead in the mass suicide and said they were wrapping up their investigation because they had no evidence that any crime had been committed or that other people had been involved in the 39 deaths. A18
 
Curb on Liquor Ads Suggested
President Clinton is planning to ask the Federal Communications Commission to decide whether to ban or sharply limit liquor advertising on television on the grounds that it is a potential inducement to young people to experiment with drinking. The action was prompted by the decision by the distilled spirits industry last year to lift a decades-old policy against television advertising. A12

HEADLINE: Altering Labels, Not Clothes, China Sidesteps Trade Limits

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG

 BODY:
Every day, shiploads of clothing cranked out by China's prodigious textile industry are unloaded on the docks of this commercial crossroads and taken by truck to back-alley factories. Nimble-fingered workers add a few finishing touches and, most important, a label that reads, "Made in Hong Kong."
Thus altered, the garments are sent to retailers in Europe and the United States as the exports of Hong Kong in what American officials say is a vast effort to circumvent European and American limits on imports of Chinese textiles. 
 This clandestine traffic in suits, shirts and gloves has long roiled trade relations between the United States and China. And American officials fear that it could expand further after July 1, when Hong Kong comes under Chinese control and movement of goods through the former colony may become even easier.
Billions of dollars are at stake. A painstaking study by the United States Customs Service found that in 1992, while China's textile exports totaled $13 billion, the world's countries reported importing more than $23 billion worth of textiles from China.
In a section titled "The China Syndrome: Clothing That Multiplies En Route," the study said that only some of the discrepancy could be explained by statistical confusion.
American officials say the illegal exports harm American workers and the dwindling domestic textile industry. Critics of China also say the long history of evading the rules calls into question Beijing's willingness to abide by terms under negotiation, the most important of which involve China's drive to join the World Trade Organization.
The issue's prominence is another sign of a major shift in Asia's economy. Textile manufacturing fueled the growth of Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea after World War II. But today, clothing companies in the region have shifted their factories to China, where workers are paid $50 a month, as against $1,300 a month in Hong Kong. American officials say China's textile empire produces far more than it can legally export, though it, too, is facing pressure from even lower-wage countries like India. China, said one American official, "would clothe most of the world if we let it."
There is no intention to allow that.
Nearly all of the world's developed nations set limits, or quotas, on the quantity of textiles that they import from any single country. Those rules reflect the production patterns of an earlier era, and places like Hong Kong and Macao are allowed far more exports than they now produce.
International trade laws will continue to treat Hong Kong and China as separate entities for the next seven years, with separate quotas, even though Hong Kong will become part of China this year. "We're waiting to see how it plays out," said one American official. "If we don't have the same level of cooperation, we'll have to look very hard at what our next step would be."
The quotas themselves are a vestige of a previous era, and will eventually be phased out.
In its annual report on foreign trade barriers, the Clinton Administration argues that China's illegal shipments are still a major problem, but expresses hope that they will be reduced under a four-year pact signed this year. That agreement lowers China's quota for 14 apparel and fabric categories and calls for stronger enforcement measures.
Hong Kong's underused quotas have long provided an opening that many Chinese factories and Hong Kong companies cannot resist.
In some instances the phony label -- "Made in Fiji," "Made in Macao" -- is sewn into the garment before it even leaves the factory in China. In other cases, once the garments reach Hong Kong, the "Made in China" label is taken out and replaced with one that reads, "Made in Hong Kong." Other times, the labels are sewn in Hong Kong and the garments repacked in their original boxes, with a piece of tape that says, "Made in Hong Kong" slapped over the "Made in China" markings on the outside.
Trade and employment statistics suggest the scope of illegal exports through Hong Kong. While Hong Kong's textile work force has declined by two-thirds in the last decade, its exports to the United States are mysteriously up by almost 50 percent, according to Hong Kong government data. At least 90 percent of the textiles and garments sold in the United States with a "Made in Hong Kong" label are in fact made in China, said two senior Hong Kong textile executives, who sell different types of textiles.
The three largest Hong Kong exporters of men's suits and jackets to the United States have a combined work force today of some 400, people in the industry say. Yet those companies exported nearly 200,000 suits and jackets to the United States in 1994.
Hong Kong companies shipped 60 million pairs of work gloves to the United States last year, even though the companies employ fewer than 100 workers, a senior executive in the industry said. Nearly all of the gloves were in fact made in China, he said.
In a complaint that runs to nearly 300 pages, the American Textile Manufacturers Association has accused The Limited Inc., which operates retail outlets like Abercrombie & Fitch, Victoria's Secret and Lane Bryant, with falsifying documents, smuggling and other violations of American laws to get Chinese-made goods into the United States via Hong Kong, say American officials and persons close to the association.
The Justice Department and Customs Service are investigating the allegations before deciding whether to file criminal charges against the company, the officials said. If the Government does not act, the association plans to file a civil action against The Limited, officials close to the institute said.
The Limited, a publicly held company based in Columbus, Ohio, would not comment directly on the allegations. A company official said that he had heard that the industry had filed a complaint, but that he had not seen it. The company's general counsel, Samuel P. Fried, said The Limited was "committed to full compliance with the spirit and letter of all legal requirements of goods into the United States."
After years of prodding from the United States, trade officials in Hong Kong have begun to crack down on some of the local companies that export Chinese-made textiles as their own.
And for the first time, American customs agents have been allowed to inspect Hong Kong factories where false labels are said to be sewn on, though the agents are allowed into factories only if the company permits. They are not allowed to examine a company's books.
Illustrating the scale of the problem, and the difficulty of curbing it, American officials and Hong Kong textile executives point to Penisula Knitters, which is headed by Henry Tang Ying-yen. He is one of Hong Kong's most powerful political leaders, and he has been implicated in export violations.
A few years ago, Mr. Tang was fined $250,000 by the British authorities after being caught trying to smuggle Chinese-made cashmere sweaters into England, American officials said. The sweaters were destined for the United States, the officials said, where with a "Made in England" label they would have fetched a far higher price than with a "Made in China" one.
Mr. Tang is chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, a quasi-governmental business organization, and has been appointed to the executive council that will come into power when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese control on July 1.
The United States is investigating whether Mr. Tang illegally shipped four million Chinese-made sweaters to the United States last year, American officials said. Mr. Tang declined to discuss any aspect of either case, other than to say that he had paid a fine in England. "We don't engage in transshipping," he said, using the term for the illegal exporting of goods originating elsewhere.
Mr. Tang, who said Peninsula Knitters sold "tens of millions of dollars" of sweaters to United States companies annually, dismissed the issue as a minor problem, the result of a few "unscrupulous operators." And he called American efforts to curb it "barbaric."
The Customs Service has primary responsibility to stanch the flow. But several senior agents said illegal textile exports were not a high priority for the agency, which also handles higher-profile cases involving drug trafficking and money laundering.
Justice Department lawyers find the cases difficult, time-consuming and expensive. And the State Department has been reluctant to be too vocal in its criticism of China or Hong Kong, critics of the Administration's record said.
One of the most contentious issues is whether an American importer knows that the garments have been made in China and not Hong Kong.
"They know where the stuff comes from," said an American law enforcement official. "Proving it in court is another matter." The companies generally insist that they do not, saying they buy from Hong Kong manufacturers or through Hong Kong agents.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Signs Bill Favoring Rent Regulations

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Joined by an array of elected officials who vowed to wage war in Albany to protect rent regulations, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday signed a bill declaring that the state laws are still necessary for the 1.2 million rent-stabilized and rent-controlled apartments in New York City.
The action essentially informs the State Legislature that a housing emergency continues to exist in the city, and urges that the current rent laws be extended to protect "public health, safety and general welfare." 
 But the largely symbolic legislation does little more than clear the way for the bitter partisan battle to begin in earnest in Albany, where the Republican leader of the State Senate, Joseph L. Bruno, has proposed eliminating almost all rent regulations -- except those for the poor, elderly and disabled -- by mid-1999. Mr. Bruno has threatened to let the current laws expire on June 15 if the Democratic-controlled Assembly defies him.
Before signing the bill yesterday, Mr. Giuliani gave no indication of what he would like to see happen in Albany should a compromise be forced on the issue. But he said his administration was pushing for a faster resolution to avoid 11th-hour bartering that could chip away at current protections and to end the "psychological torture" that he said delays would cause for renters.
The Mayor stressed yesterday that the city's determination that the laws were necessary should, in an ideal political world, be honored in Albany. "The State Legislature and the Governor should give great deference to this decision," he said. "This is the political will of the City of New York."
The city makes the determination every three years by surveying the supply of rental apartments in the city. This year, the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development found that there were slightly more than two million rental apartments and that the vacancy rate was 4.01 percent. Under city law, if the rate is below 5 percent, a housing emergency exists, making rent regulation necessary to protect renters from the market pressures that such a shortage creates.
The rent-regulation laws cover about one million rent-stabilized apartments in the city and an additional 100,000 that are rent-controlled. Rent control applies to about 100,000 prewar apartments, where tenants have no leases and where rent increases are usually limited to 7.5 percent a year. Under rent stabilization, renters have leases and increases are tied roughly to inflation and to the landlord's maintenance costs.
The Republican Mayor was joined yesterday by two of his most important allies on the issue, State Senators Frank Padavan, a Queens Republican, and Roy M. Goodman, a Manhattan Republican, both of whom have staked out a position against their party leadership on rent regulation.
The two face their first battle next Monday, when the full Senate is scheduled to vote on whether a Democratic-sponsored bill extending the current regulations should move from a committee to the Senate floor.

HEADLINE: Interest Rate Increase Scarcely Harms Workers

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Greenspan's Whim" (Op-Ed, March 27) by Prof. James K. Galbraith:
So much silliness has been published since the increase in a key interest rate that it is discouraging to see Professor Galbraith weighing in with more of the same. 
 Professor Galbraith suggests a harm done to "the American worker" and a windfall for the banking industry, which he identifies as the constituency of Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
But the resulting quarter of a percentage point increase on credit card balances and some loans is of slight consequence when weighed against the beneficial effects for both labor and capital of maintaining the economic expansion and high employment without serious inflation.
Professor Galbraith says Mr. Greenspan has "hinted that he wants to deflate the stock market."
But no one knows whether the interest rate increase will help forestall a bursting of the stock-market bubble. Surely Professor Galbraith knows that "the American worker" is in the stock market up to his eyeballs, directly and by way of his Individual Retirement Account, 401(k), pension fund and other retirement savings.
I hope we don't get a chance to experience a real bust in stocks. All these new "investors" and their 30-something mutual fund managers are likely to panic at the wrong moment, and the consequences could inflict more permanent pain on the average American worker than a small interest rate increase could do.

HEADLINE: Federal Insurance for Pensions Has a Surplus of $869 Million

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
The Government corporation that insures the pensions of 41 million Americans announced today that its largest insurance fund had posted the first surplus since the agency was created in 1974.
In its annual report to Congress, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation said that at the end of 1996, its single-employer pension insurance fund had a surplus of $869 million, based on assets of more than $12 billion and liabilities of a little more than $11 billion. 
 The financial health of the insurance program marked a turnaround since 1993, when it had a deficit of $2.9 billion. At the time, some economists raised alarms about the long-term economic security of millions of workers and predicted that taxpayers might have to pay for a bailout of the corporation that would dwarf the rescue of the failed savings and loan industry.
Today, President Clinton -- who has been holding near-daily events to showcase small-scale Administration initiatives -- used the change in the Federal agency's fortunes to promote his record on pension protection and call on Congress to pass legislation that languished last year, which would require more thorough audits of pension funds.
"Our people deserve to know that if they work hard throughout their lives, the money they worked for and that they saved is not being squandered or left unprotected," Mr. Clinton said, after officials announced the corporation's surplus in the Old Executive Office Building.
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation insures that if employers who pay premiums to the corporation are granted bankruptcy protection, the Government will meet the companies' obligations to their retirees. The agency insures the pensions of more than 42 million people in about 50,000 private pension plans.
The corporation's multi-employer pension insurance program, covering industries like trucking and construction, has had a surplus since 1982. But its main program, the single-employer pension insurance program, covering about 34 million people, has run a deficit until now.
Administration officials attributed the surplus in the program at the end of 1996 partly to the healthy economy and the fact that there had been no major losses from agency takeovers of failed pension plans. In addition the corporation's investment income exceeded $900 million.
Officials also said that legislation pushed by Mr. Clinton and passed by Congress in 1994 gave the agency new enforcement tools and required that private companies with underfinanced pension plans pay higher premiums. Income from premiums paid to the program totaled more than $1.1 billion in 1996.
Despite the rise in its own fortunes, the corporation reported that inadequate pension plan financing persists across all industries; 15 million workers and retirees are covered by underfinanced pension plans.
In fact, the corporation reported that the gap between promised pension benefits and the money set aside to pay for them increased in 1995, the last year for which figures are available, to $64 billion, more than double the gap reported at the end of 1994.
Officials attributed the growing gap largely to a drop in interest rates in 1995. When interest rates drop, the projected revenues of private pension funds also drop.
Ellen Seidman, a special assistant to the President, said that the legislation passed in 1994 was expected to lead to more fully financed pension plans in the next decade, and "dampen down this kind of fluctuation you get with the interest rate changes."
With dozens of Labor Department employees as his audience today, Mr. Clinton also announced that new Government rules went into effect last month requiring employers to deposit employee contributions to 401(k) plans within 15 business days after the end of the month in which the contribution was made.
And he said that the Labor Department was setting up a toll-free number -- (800) 998-7542 -- that workers could call for information on pension rights.

HEADLINE: Where Africa's Hopes Lie

BYLINE: By Chester A. Crocker; Chester A. Crocker, a professor of diplomacy at Georgetown University, was Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs in the Reagan Administration.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
As with any crisis, the civil war in Zaire points to both danger and opportunity. Zaire, with nine neighbors, is the continent's third-largest state -- four times the size of France. What happens in Zaire can make or break sub-Saharan Africa. If the country remains a vast zone of economic decay and political failure, it limits and threatens a whole region. A Zaire on the road to reconstruction and development could open the way to a regional renaissance. There is no more important challenge in Africa.
If this were not Africa, we might be having a serious strategic debate. But Zaire epitomizes a region Americans treat as a strategic backwater. As African states have increasingly differentiated themselves into winners and losers, economically and politically, Zaire has helped to anchor the losing team (along with comparably vast and illgoverned Sudan and Nigeria). 
 Mobutu Sese Seko and his Ngbandi clan may have cornered the market for parasitic kleptocracy and sheer bad governance. But they have no monopoly on African corruption, brutality or economic shortsightedness. In fact, it took foreign intervention, and the spillover effects of the Rwandan genocide of 1994, to spark the current rebellion in Zaire.
Historically, foreign intervention (French, Belgian, American, Moroccan) has primarily favored the Zairian Government. Now, the pattern is reversed: Those neighbors of Zaire that felt the sting of Mr. Mobutu's meddling have turned the tables by backing the Tutsi-dominated rebel alliance led by Laurent Kabila. For Uganda, Rwanda and Angola, it is payback time.
But if the Zairian parties to the conflict fragment and continue fighting, the country's neighbors could become mired in the chaos, adding weight to Africa's losing team. On the other hand, a negotiated transition to a stable post-Mobutu Zaire could bring a powerful boost to the entire region. Failure to capture this potential would be a real lost opportunity not only for Africa but for the rest of the world as well.
Here's why. Zaire is the bridge between the 11 nations of Southern Africa with real potential for development and the rest of Africa, including pockets of progress in East Africa. Zaire's enormous hydropower capacity could meet the electricity needs of much of Central and Southern Africa. The copper belt, which Zaire shares with Zambia, could catapult the African copper mining industry to world-class status.
Mr. Mobutu's recent return to the spotlight in Kinshasa does not mean that a political comeback is in the works or that we have to choose between him and Mr. Kabila. Mr. Mobutu, who has dominated and misruled Zaire since 1965, has been disengaging from real authority for years and may soon be history. His "regime" is less a government than a collection of security services loosely linked to an ineffectual cabinet and an unpaid civilian bureaucracy sharing the capital with nearly 800 fractious parliamentarians and members of the elite political class.
But before we celebrate Mobutu Sese Seko's political demise, we should look at the larger picture. This is not about Mr. Mobutu, who, as a cold-war partner of the West, was at best a truculent and difficult client. It is about how and when he goes, what and who fills the vacuum and whether the Zairian military and political establishment breaks apart, sowing seeds of future turmoil not only in Zaire but throughout the region. It is by no means certain that the political status quo will fall like one ripe fruit into the hands of the rebel alliance. Nor is it guaranteed that the alliance will hold together as it positions itself to take over the country.
Then there is the question of whether Zaire remains intact. For more than three decades, Mr. Mobutu sounded this very theme to extract support from abroad, and we largely accepted his warnings. Given the cold-war competition and the secessionist challenges to the unity of the former Belgian Congo in the early post-independence years, this was understandable. But now that Mr. Mobutu is gravely ill, the threats to national unity and territorial integrity are barely visible. Interestingly, none of the major figures on the Zairian stage are calling for secession. One legacy of the Mobutu regime may be a surprising level of national consciousness among Zairians.
Some argue that Zaire is ungovernably large. But Zairians do not appear to want their country dismantled. And besides, where would the new boundaries be drawn? Who would decide this?
In any case, Africa does not need more mini-states. It most certainly does not need outside encouragement for ethnic opportunists and tribal militias. Warlordism, not self-determination or liberty, would be the result. A divided Zaire invites neighbors to assert and protect their interests. Already, forces from Angola, Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi are operating on Zairian soil.
The United States must choose a strategy for dealing with the conflict in Zaire, a challenge it has so far studiously avoided. American statements, signals, actions and inactions have left important partners, such as France, South Africa and Ethiopia, mystified if not wary. Are we, as the French-speaking rumor mill has it, tacitly supporting Mr. Kabila or his backers? Do we, as some seem to believe, want Zaire dismembered? If not, what are we doing to stop it? Are there circumstances in which we would support a multilateral humanitarian mission, as Canadian, French and United Nations officials have proposed?
We have consulted with European and African allies. We have supported the United Nations wish list for Zaire, which includes a cease-fire, troop withdrawals and elections. We have also made preparations for a military evacuation of Americans from Zaire. This is the foreign policy equivalent of sending in the director of FEMA.
Instead of waiting for events to take their course, we should decide to prevent Zaire from being torn to pieces -- and make that goal a high priority. This means exerting the political will to create and sustain a united front of Zairians, Africans and Western allies committed to a negotiated transition from chaos to a stable post-Mobutu era. The full weight of American influence should be directed at anyone who stands in the way.
Because precious few players in the region have real clout, the closest possible coordination with the Europeans -- and especially France, the other major power in Central Africa -- will be critical. There are policy-makers in both Paris and Washington who continue to view each other's approaches to Africa with distaste and suspicion. This has only aggravated the divisions among some 20 African countries over the conflicts in Zaire and Sudan.
Squabbling between France and the United States over influence and prestige, as well as strategic differences, is an unacceptable luxury in today's Africa. Working together would help unite the Zairians, and Africans in general. This is what leadership and leverage are all about.

HEADLINE: Welfare Recipients Taking Jobs Often Held by the Working Poor

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Josephine Araujo was already an hour into her shift when Sarah Thompson punched in for work on the 17th floor of the towering Jersey City Medical Center. Ms. Thompson was not happy to see Ms. Araujo, but she hid her annoyance in small talk. And soon the women were going about their duties, taking patients for X-rays, rehabilitation, blood tests.
Ms. Thompson and Ms. Araujo, near in age and engaged in the same tasks, nevertheless see themselves at opposite ends of the work force. Ms. Araujo, 42, is on welfare and has been working at the hospital since last summer, but not for wages. Ms. Thompson, 44, had been a full-time, salaried employee for 27 years, until December, when her hours were cut to 20 a week from 40, and her pay to $11,000 from $22,000. Ms. Araujo picked up some of her work. 
 "What infuriates me," said Rex Reid, an administrator of the welfare program in the Jersey City area, "is that you read in the newspapers that hospitals like the Jersey City Medical Center are laying off workers, or cutting their hours. And at the same time, we get requests from the Medical Center for welfare people."
Job displacement is entering the debate over welfare reform. Across the country, thousands of people on welfare are going to work, but often not at new jobs created for them, as President Clinton envisioned when he signed the welfare-to-work legislation last fall. Frequently they do work once done by regular employees, like Ms. Thompson. Under the new Federal law and a proliferation of state laws, welfare officials are required to send people on aid out to jobs, even to jobs that do not pay during indefinite training periods.
Many others on welfare compete successfully for low-wage jobs that might otherwise have gone to the working poor not on welfare, nearly 30 percent of the work force. And although they are coming off welfare, many have the advantage of a year or more of child-care subsidies and transportation allowances.
"What we have is a limited number of chairs," said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, "and there are a lot of potential workers circling these chairs, waiting for someone to get up."
Regardless of who gets the job, wages are held down, economists say, contributing to the income inequality that is such a national issue today. With the American economy thriving and unemployment low, employers frequently find themselves scrambling to find enough entry-level workers. Normally, they raise wages to lure people who would not otherwise be willing to take these jobs. But with the injection of so many welfare recipients as workers, the wage pressure is dulled.
That's evident at SOS Staffing Services, based in Salt Lake City, which placed 70,000 people in temporary jobs in Western states last year. Earning $6 to $8 an hour, these people worked on factory assembly lines, in warehouses, as office clerks and in telemarketing. Five thousand of the 70,000, or 7 percent, had come to SOS Staffing while still collecting welfare benefits, and roughly the same percentage are coming off welfare this year into temporary work through SOS, said Richard Reinhold, the company's chairman.
"Without the welfare people," Mr. Reinhold said, "we cannot fill all our orders for temps. To get enough people without them, we would have had to raise the wage -- not by a lot, maybe 5 percent -- but we would have had to pay more."
The migration to work is required under laws that penalize welfare recipients for failing to move into some sort of work before their eligibility for welfare is up. But President Clinton spoke against job displacement, calling instead in recent speeches for millions of new jobs to accommodate welfare workers.
Some of the latter do move into newly created jobs. "Empowerment zones" in downtown Detroit, for example, are attracting small companies like GFC Industries, an auto parts maker. GFC has trained and hired 21 neighborhood people, many of them on welfare, to work in a recently opened factory. But more often, welfare recipients move into existing jobs, or they hold down wages simply by coming into the work force, as the SOS temps are doing, or they remain on welfare for an unpaid training period. In New Jersey, Ms. Araujo's state, that period can last two years or more without an employer's ever being required to hire the trainee.
Clinton Administration officials recognize the problems, but say they see the glass as more than half full.
"Of course, sometimes individual workers get jobs that otherwise might have gone to someone else," said Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, "but the economy expands as they go to work and other firms hire more people. There is every reason to believe that helping welfare recipients get back to work raises the total number of jobs."
Mr. Summers added that the working poor not on welfare got help from other Federal programs, like the earned-income tax credit.
Displacement falls most heavily on the 38 million working poor holding jobs that pay $7.50 an hour or less. The majority of these workers, like the majority of people on welfare, have only high school educations or less. They have faced competition in the past from immigrants and from groups of disadvantaged Americans who have benefited from earlier public jobs programs.
But no federally subsidized jobs program since the Depression has involved as many people as does the welfare-to-work push. And none have pressured state officials to shift welfare recipients to work so quickly. Each state is required to meet annual job quotas, or lose some of its Federal block grants for welfare. By the turn of the century, nearly 50 percent of all adults receiving welfare assistance must spend at least 30 hours a week in some sort of work. As a result, more than four million people on welfare will go to work, according to various estimates.
Economists say they have not devised ways to measure the job displacement that is already part of the transition.
"There is no research at all yet," said Rebecca Blank, a labor economist and poverty expert at Northwestern University.
But the anecdotal evidence is accumulating. In Baltimore, nine public schools brought in welfare recipients at $1.50 an hour, well below the minimum wage of $4.75 an hour, rather than renew contracts with agencies that supplied cleaning people at $6 an hour. The new workers continue to receive federally financed welfare benefits, at no cost to the schools.
Similarly, the Citywide Bus Company, which transports children to the Baltimore public schools, is training welfare recipients, also at $1.50 an hour, to be aides. That makes Veronica Jiggetts nervous. She has been an aide for eight years on a bus for disabled children.
"One of the welfare workers was on my bus one morning," said Miss Jiggetts, who earns $6.60 an hour and works 25 hours a week. "I had to show her how to lift these kids and buckle them into their seats, and I felt bad because I thought she could take my job from me.
"So I went to the office and asked, What were they trying to do, take away my job? And they said, 'No, Miss Jiggetts, we are not trying to take you off your job.'
"But the way it looks to me, I might not be invited back for September."
The Industrial Areas Foundation, which is organizing low-wage workers in Baltimore, drew a thousand people to a rally in the city on March 16, the largest protest thus far of worker displacement from welfare changes. Their protest was directed, in part, at the fact that people like Ms. Araujo and the bus aides on welfare are allowed to work without being covered by the minimum-wage law and the various protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Marriott Hotels, held up frequently as a model in implementing welfare to work, recognizes that those coming from welfare into housekeeping, reservations, the kitchen and other Marriott jobs have an edge over the working poor without welfare. The chain has trained and hired 650 welfare recipients nationwide since 1991, but once on the job, earning $6 to $8 an hour, these workers continue for months to receive child care and transportation subsidies that inflate their incomes, said Joan Tully, director of Marriott's community employment and training programs.
The chain also gets a tax credit to employ people from welfare in jobs that, as Ms. Tully notes, might otherwise go to non-welfare applicants for whom the hotel can get no tax credit.
"Something has to be done to offset the extra cost of hiring these workers," she said, "but, yes, the jobs we have pay off more for them than for working poor not on welfare. The working poor are getting the short end of the stick."
Similarly, the City of Richmond, starting today, will send 2,000 people on welfare into existing but unfilled jobs at more than two dozen companies that have signed up to participate, at wages of $7 an hour or less. Some 4,000 additional welfare recipients, in need of training, will be fed into jobs more slowly. The participating companies include AT&T, National Car Rental, restaurants, nursing homes and Norrell Services, a temporary help agency.
This influx of workers will stabilize pay scales in the city, said Keith Wine, Norrell's manager in Richmond, who noted that the metropolitan area, with an unemployment rate of 3 percent, suffered from labor shortages.
"Everyone has been raising wages to get people," Mr. Wine said, "and this will make it possible to hold pay steady."
The displacement issue shows up most vividly in the programs that send people out, ostensibly for training, to do tasks without pay that once were done by regular employees who have had their wages reduced or their hours shortened. That is the situation Ms. Araujo and Ms. Thompson find themselves in. In New York City, they show up by the thousands in the Parks Department or as street cleaners or in sanitation or as receptionists, often handling work that laid-off city workers once did.
But while Ms. Thompson hopes that her hours will be restored so she will not have to take a second job to pay her mortgage, and Ms. Araujo yearns to be hired by the hospital, the medical center's managers say neither will happen. Budget constraints forced a cut in Ms. Thompson's hours, the managers say, and Ms. Araujo is listed not as a trainee but as a volunteer.
"The workfare program is to get welfare people into the rhythm and habits of going to work," said Jonathan M. Metsch, the medical center's president, "and we folded it into our volunteer operation. This is work volunteers normally do in hospitals. There is no issue of displacement."
The Giuliani Administration in New York City has a similar stance. The cuts in the regular work force cannot be reversed; the city lacks the money, said Richard J. Schwartz, who until February was Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's senior adviser on welfare reform.
The workfare people -- 36,000 in New York City -- are a windfall, Mr. Schwartz said. If they were not out cleaning streets or working in parks, he said, the streets would simply be dirtier and the parks more unkempt than they now are.

HEADLINE: Debt Issues Fuel Gain in Underwriting

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Stock and bond underwriting rose 12 percent in the first three months of 1997, even as rising interest rates indicate a potential slowdown in sales over the coming year.
The first-quarter surge was fueled by the sale of bonds and other debt, which rose to $239.3 billion in the first quarter, compared with $214.6 billion in the similar period of 1996. 
But higher interest rates, a weakness in technology stocks and investor trepidation about corporate earnings growth dampened underwriting volume in other areas. Sales of common stock in the United States declined 7 percent, to $21.3 billion, according to the Securities Data Company. The most drastic drop in equity issues came in the underwriting volume for initial public offerings, which fell nearly 30 percent, to $5.9 billion, from $8.6 billion in the first three months of 1996.
"The recent volatility in the marketplace and the rise in interest rates has begun to affect the new issue market," Brian Hehir, co-chief of global equity markets at Merrill Lynch & Company, said. "It had its most impact on the I.P.O. volume, which is down. And the new-issue backlog is only about $13 billion at a time when we should be approaching our seasonal peak."
In the first quarter, the securities industry underwrote $273.3 billion worth of domestic debt and equity issues, up from $245 billion in the comparable period last year, according to Securities Data.
Merrill Lynch remained the top debt and equity underwriter over all, a position it has held since 1988. Merrill underwrote 312 deals worth more than $44 billion. Goldman, Sachs & Company came in second, followed by Salomon Brothers, J. P. Morgan & Company and Lehman Brothers. The five firms collectively accounted for nearly 60 percent of all underwriting fees.
The total disclosed fees collected by all underwriting firms fell by 9.8 percent in the first quarter to $1.8 billion, according to Securities Data. At Morgan Stanley Group Inc., underwriting fees fell almost 42 percent in the first quarter to $132.6 million. But Merrill; Goldman; Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., a unit of the Equitable Companies; Lehman Brothers and J. P. Morgan reported higher income for the three-month period, indicating that the largest firms, with the most access to global markets, are tightening their grip on underwriting and are able to offset declines in the United States with activity in Europe, Asia or Latin America.
Interest rates rose in the last month as investors anticipated the Federal Reserve's decision last week to increase the overnight lending rate in an effort to stem inflation. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds, a benchmark for setting prices on other debt, climbed above 7 percent for the first time since September. The 4 percent drop in the Nasdaq composite index in the last month only increased the uneasiness among investors.
"We've seen a weakness in the secondary markets in telecommunications and technology areas, traditionally a big part of the markets," said Marc L. Paley, the managing director at Lehman Brothers who is in charge of equity syndications. "To the degree that the secondary market is volatile, it'll hurt the new issue market in a major way."
But interest rates are not yet so high as to discourage companies like Raytheon and Norfolk Southern and other companies engaged in strategic acquisitions from entering the bond markets, said John Massad, a partner at J. P. Morgan in charge of debt syndication. Certainly the cash is there. Attracted by the higher interest rates, insurance companies, pension funds and mutual funds continue to funnel money into bonds.
"The rise in interest rates has been relatively modest, and relative to historic levels, interest rates are still at attractive levels," Mr. Massad said. "So companies are still issuing debt. The volume may be off as much as 20 percent in the coming quarter, but we don't expect a dramatic decline. These rates are still attractive to issuers."
But rising interest rates may affect the junk bond market, which saw a 20.6 percent jump in offerings in the first quarter. Donaldson, Lufkin, the leading firm in the field, underwrote the largest high-yield bond so far of the 1990's, the $2 billion sale of debt by Tenet Healthcare.
"This was a very attractive time to issue long-term capital," said Bennett Goodman, who heads the high-yield bond department at Donaldson. "Interest rates were very low, and the typical high-yield bond had a 9.5 precent coupon, while Treasuries were yielding 6.5 percent."
But with interest rates rising on high-yield bonds, corporations may opt to go elsewhere for money. "High yield bonds may not be as attractive as bank debt or selling equity related security," Mr. Goodman said. "Right now there's a very hot bank-debt market, and that'll begin to cannibalize the high-yield market."

HEADLINE: Newt Gingrich on China

 BODY:
It would be understandable if the Chinese leadership were confused about America's China policy after the recent visits by Vice President Al Gore and House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Mr. Gore arrived with a conciliatory message about improving relations and seemed hobbled by the White House fund-raising mess. Mr. Gingrich delivered a forceful statement of concern about China's human rights abuses and suppression of dissent, and even threw in a gratuitous commitment to defend Taiwan militarily if it was attacked by China.
Mr. Gingrich is entitled to his views, and his comments about China's record were refreshingly candid compared with the oblique criticism favored these days by the Clinton Administration. But Mr. Gingrich was presumptuous to speak for the United States, particularly on the sensitive issue of Taiwan. It is not for Congressional leaders to set the terms of American foreign policy or to make blanket commitments about the use of force. 
 That said, Mr. Gingrich's comments on the Chinese political scene were in some ways more honest than Mr. Gore's anemic formulations. The Clinton emphasis on engagement and trade has severely undercut American support for human rights and democracy in China.
Mr. Gore seemed to go out of his way last week to praise "a significant advance in the process of democracy" in China that few others have been able to detect. He also appeared to downplay American concerns over China's heavy-handed approach to Hong Kong, which will revert to Chinese control on July 1.
In contrast, Mr. Gingrich chose Hong Kong as his platform to warn Chinese leaders that attempts to confine freedom to economic issues while refusing to allow it in politics would surely fail. He referred explicitly to "the lack of basic freedom -- speech, religion, assembly, the press" in China today. The Speaker maintained this same blunt tone in his talks with Chinese leaders. It would not be a bad idea if Administration officials adopted the same straight-speaking approach.
The Administration, like its predecessors, has wisely left the Chinese to think hard about how America would react to an invasion of Taiwan by the mainland. Washington and Beijing have long understood that good relations depend on China's dealing peacefully with Taiwan. Beijing is not likely to mistake a lack of specificity for softness, particularly after the dispatch of two American aircraft carrier groups to waters off Taiwan during last year's Chinese missile tests.
That Mr. Gore and Mr. Gingrich offered such divergent messages may well be explained by the political predicament each man faces in Washington. Mr. Gore, eager to protect his Presidential aspirations in 2000, was cautious to a fault while in China, so anxious to appear evenhanded that he ended up looking ineffectual. Mr. Gingrich, battered by his ethics case and virtually invisible in Washington in recent weeks, returned to center stage in China carrying the banner for a more assertive China policy.
Some China specialists have encouraged the Clinton Administration to keep the Chinese off balance by mixing conciliation and confrontation. That may work in theory, but after the Gore and Gingrich visits the idea looks untenable. The only impression the Chinese got was that the United States does not have a coherent China policy, or even a clear chain of command.

Governors Island: A Gift That Bears a Close Look

 BODY:
Is Governors Island slipping away?
"They are dithering," Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said last week, complaining that city and state officials had failed to respond to a 1995 offer from President Clinton to help transfer the island for $1 if New York would present a plan for its public use. Now, the Senator said, without a plan in place, many in Congress want to sell off the scenic 173-acre tract in New York Harbor as excess Government property, and have been encouraged by a Federal estimate of its value to developers: $500 million. 
 Advisers to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki, who have engaged in sporadic infighting over control of economic development projects, insisted that internal rivalries were not affecting Governors Island, which is to be vacated by the Coast Guard this summer. The island, less than a half-mile from Manhattan and Brooklyn, has been a military installation for over 200 years, and combines a historic district of elegant 19th-century buildings with broad open spaces and sweeping views of the city.
At City Hall, officials acknowledge that their response to the President has been slow, but not for lack of attention to an economic equation that they say is far more complex than most New Yorkers realize.
Joseph B. Rose, the director of the Department of City Planning, is one of the top strategists creating a plan for Governors Island. He discussed the island's prospects yesterday in an interview with Thomas J. Lueck:

Q. Why not simply jump on the President's offer of a spectacular public space for $1?
 
A. Just to maintain the historic buildings and infrastructure on Governors Island would cost somewhere between $30 million and $60 million a year, and the city is not in a position to make that kind of expenditure. I don't mean to sound ungrateful for the President's willingness to make it available, but the Federal Government is unloading a financial responsibility that is not acceptible unless we have uses for the island that will cover the expense of operating and maintaining it.
 
Q. But if the island is worth $500 million to developers, by one Federal estimate, don't you run the risk that private interests will grab it?
 
A. Nobody who has any familiarity with the island, its condition, the constraints on development and the realities of the real estate market would take a number like $500 million seriously. When the Coast Guard said it was leaving, there was some speculation about large-scale real-estate development but when people saw what they were up against they headed for the hills. In fact, we haven't encountered anybody who is willing to make an offer at any price, and it is not clear that the island could be sold. It is important that we make it clear to the Federal Government that it is not going to sell this thing and make a lot of money.
 
Q. Other islands in big cities, like Roosevelt Island in the East River, have been developed. What is the problem here?
 
A. Access is the big one. You can only get to Governors Island by ferryboat, and that service has been costing the Coast Guard $6 million a year to operate. We have examined the idea of building a bridge, and that would be incredibly expensive because it would go over important navigational channels. A bridge would require vertical clearance of 150 feet, and it just won't be built.
 
Q. If we are limited to ferry service, couldn't the city expect a private ferry operator to step in?
 
A. Yes, any plan is likely to rely on privatized ferry service. But to justify frequent service, you have to have the appropriate uses on the island. Bed-and-breakfast accommodations wouldn't make it work.
 
Q. Since it already runs Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty, shouldn't the Federal Government turn Governors Island into a national park?
 
A. That would certainly be consistent with the responsibilities of the park service, but it has expressed no interest in extending the Federal obligation to Governors Island. Perhaps that is why the White House is willing to dispose of the island so cheaply.
 
Q. So you are looking for nonprofit organizations that would use the island and pay for its maintenance. Can you be more specific?
 
A. The island is designed as a campuslike setting, and the easiest transition for its historic buildings would be to some kind of educational complex. Perhaps with accessories like a hospital. What is required would be a large institution that would find the island attractive and would have residential and facility needs sufficient to justify a large investment.
 
Q. The public has been kept off Governors Island since the Revolution. Would it finally have access?
 
A. Yes, that is a top priority. It matters less to us that the city owns the island than that its historic buildings are protected and it is opened up for public access.
 
Q. Senator Moynihan said the city and state must act quickly, suggesting that a plan for the island should be submitted by the end of the year. Will you be ready?
 
A. I don't know if there is any particular deadline, but the Senator's sense of urgency is appropriate. That is not so much because Congress can turn around and sell it for $500 million, but because the maintenance and reuse of the historic buildings on the island could be jeopardized after the the Coast Guard leaves. Even though there is a Federal obligation to maintain them, history shows that buildings like these tend to fall apart when they are not being used. And the bureaucracy involved in the disposition process at the Federal level is certain to take time. So time is the real enemy here, and we expect to have a plan in place well before the end of the year.
 
Q. The Regional Plan Association has made proposals for what it wants on the island, like a marina and bed-and-breakfast accommodations. Will those ideas be considered?
 
A. We are always ready to listen. But those proposals are vague and irresponsible, because they are being made without any recognition of the realities and costs confronting the island. We know from history that rhetoric without any grounding in economics is a recipe for disaster. In this case, the R.P.A. has provided very little of value.

HEADLINE: A Bad First Quarter for U.S. Stock Funds

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
The average mutual fund investing in American stocks had its worst performance in more than two years during the first quarter, and funds specializing in United States high-technology companies were particularly weak, losing an average of more than 6 percent. But a mutual fund that invests in heavy industry in the former Soviet Union gained more than 40 percent.
If the first quarter of 1997 left American investors without a gyroscope, there is likely to be more confusion in store. Since last week, when the Federal Reserve lifted interest rates for the first time in two years, the stock and bond markets have suffered a small convulsion of selling, capped by the biggest two-session decline since August 1990. 
 That has some financial advisers telling investors to dig in and expect the rough time to continue for several months.
"We're getting more defensive," said Louis Stanasolovich, president of Legend Financial Advisors of Pittsburgh. "We certainly are not telling people to sell their entire portfolio, but we are advising them to look to put new cash to work in different areas, making sure their portfolio is diversified away from the S.& P. 500."
So far, mutual fund investors have stayed the course, slowing their pace of new mutual fund purchases since the beginning of the year but not yet pulling money out on a broad scale. Some sectors of the fund industry, though, have already started to suffer redemptions -- technology funds and, more recently, the most aggressive types of general equity funds -- raising once again the question of how investors will react to a broader, or extended, market downturn.
Over all, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago fund tracking organization, the average domestic equity fund gained 2 percent in the first quarter. That is the weakest quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of 1994, when domestic stock funds lost 1.3 percent on average.
Thus far in 1997, the best-performing mutual funds have been those that cast their nets overseas. According to Morningstar, funds specializing in Latin America gained about 16 percent on average since Jan. 1, while more general emerging market funds gained about 9 percent. And the fund that invests in Russian heavy industry, Lexington Troika Dialog Russia, gained 46 percent in the first quarter, making it one of the period's best performers.
Among funds that invest in a broad array of American stocks, those following a "value" style performed better than those investing in "growth" stocks, and large-capitalization funds did better than their brethren that invest in companies with smaller market values.
Large-cap value funds, which buy shares of big companies that are trading at relatively low price-to-earnings ratios, and large-cap funds that buy a blend of value and growth stocks, outpaced the field, gaining an average of about 3 percent, according to Morningstar. Funds favoring small growth companies, or those whose sales and earnings are growing quickly but which often trade at high price-earnings multiples, took the hardest hit, losing about 11 percent on average.
Some sectors that performed most poorly, like technology, have also suffered net redemptions. According to AMG Data Services, an Arcata, Calif., company that tracks mutual fund flows, investors have withdrawn more money than they have placed into technology funds for seven of the last eight weeks.
And in each of the last two weeks, both aggressive growth funds, which buy shares of the smallest, fastest- growing companies, and broader growth funds, which buy the stocks of slightly bigger companies, have suffered net outflows, AMG said.
What has some people on Wall Street worried is that it might not take huge redemptions by mutual fund investors to erode some of the stock market's strongest underpinnings. Rather, a pronounced slowdown in new purchases of mutual funds by individuals could be enough to trouble a broad array of investors and thus damage the market.
Melissa Brown, a quantitative analyst at Prudential Securities, said she was not yet worried by the trickle of money exiting certain fund categories. "Some people could make the case that liquidity is going away," she said. "But I'm more concerned with cash levels of equity funds," which gives an indication of their future buying power.
At the end of February, domestic equity funds held 5.3 percent of their assets in cash, the lowest level since January 1977. Over all, including international and specialty funds, cash levels in stock funds equaled 5.7 percent of assets.
Even if funds are not hit with redemptions, forcing them to sell shares to raise cash, their current low levels of cash might cause problems, Ms. Brown said. "They might not be set up to buy anything," she said. "All of the support that's been going to the market could go away."
The question of how investors will react to a market downturn is a subject of constant debate within the mutual fund industry. The Investment Company Institute, a trade group, last year produced a study showing that stock fund owners had not liquidated shares en masse in any stock-market setback since 1944.
Rather, the trade group said, investors spread out their response over time. A shift from inflows to outflows of cash was traced to adjustments in the pace of share purchases rather than in changes in rates of redemptions.
But with the rapid growth of the mutual fund industry in the last few years, many market analysts wonder whether investors will continue to be as steadfast as in previous market downturns.
Indeed, the amount of money in equity mutual funds at the end of 1990, just after the stock market experienced its last broad decline of 10 percent -- an event Wall Street calls a correction -- was about $247 billion. That is only 13 percent of the $1.8 trillion invested in stock funds at the end of February.
"Almost all of the money in equity mutual funds hasn't really been through a bear market," Ms. Brown of Prudential said. "It's hard to say what those people will do" if stock prices continue to decline.
 Because of the erroneous calculations, the chart also misstated the return for the Vanguard Index 500 fund. It gained 2.6 percent in the quarter, not 4.92 percent.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 2, 1997, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article and a chart in Business Day yesterday about how mutual funds did in the first quarter misstated the performance of domestic equity funds because of calculation errors by Morningstar Inc. The average equity fund lost 1.6 percent of its value in the quarter; it did not gain 2 percent. A related article appears today on page D2.

An Ecce Panis for Columbus Ave.
A new Ecce Panis bakery opens today at 282 Columbus Avenue (73d Street). It is the third store for the company. The other Ecce Panis bakeries are at 1260 Madison Avenue (90th Street) and 1120 Third Avenue (65th Street). In addition to the sourdough, Tuscan, raisin, ciabatta and rosemary breads, and sweet and savory focaccias for which the company is known, the bakeries will also sell baguettes and a new olive bread. The company's new wholesale bakery in New Jersey has made the expansion possible.

Culinary Careers
Career opportunities in the food industry will be discussed on Monday from 6 to 9 P.M. at the French Culinary Institute, 462 Broadway (Grand Street). It is free, but reservations are necessary: (212) 219-8890. 

Beer and Food to Taste
Beers from more than two dozen of this country's microbreweries and food from 21 New York restaurants will be offered for tasting at Bridgewaters in the South Street Seaport on April 14 from 5 to 8 P.M. The occasion, an American Institute of Wine and Food benefit, will admit nonmembers at 6 P.M. Tickets are $30 for members, $40 for nonmembers. Information: (212) 447-0456.

Off the Menu
 
Not Coco Pazzo Clones
The conversion of the restaurants in the Sfuzzi chain to Coco Pazzos has started with the opening tomorrow of Coco Opera, 58 West 65th Street. Pino Luongo, whose company, Toscorp, owns the restaurants, is not creating Coco Pazzo clones, despite similar frescos on the walls and some recipes in common. He has simplified the name to avoid confusion. Coco Marina, in the World Financial Center, is also to open this month.

A Hop From Market to Table
Milos Estiatorio (Greek for Windmill Restaurant), opening in May at 125 West 55th Street, will be a market-restaurant with a difference. Diners can select fish or shellfish displayed on ice and priced by the pound, and then watch as it is grilled in the open kitchen. Seafood prices will start at $18 a pound for farmed salmon. Vegetables and other dishes will also be on display.
Costas Spiliades, who has owned Milos, a similar restaurant in Montreal, since 1980, is spending $4 million to build the 150-seat Milos Estiatorio, designed by Charles Morris Mount. It will occupy 9,000 square feet of space with 26-foot ceilings.

More Choices From Sofia's
Sofia's Fabulous Pizza, on the second floor at 1022 Madison Avenue (79th Street), will open a cafe this week at street level, with coffee, juices, sandwiches, gelati and, yes, pizza. Sofia's expects to open a second spot this spring, at 29 East 61st Street.

Triplets for World Trade Center
Tony May, who owns San Domenico on Central Park South and Hostaria in Port Chester, N.Y., plans to open Gemelli at 4 World Trade Center. Although Gemelli means twins, the 9,500-square-foot restaurant will have three parts. The first, a midprice Italian restaurant, Gemelli, is to open in June, to be followed by Pastabreak, for quick-service pasta on the Trade Center's concourse. In the fall, Mr. May plans to add a self-service restaurant.

Dining Companions
Two new dining guides to New York City fill some gaps. "The Authoritative New York City Kosher Dining Guide" by Bela Flom (Bela Flom Enterprises, $19.95) covers all boroughs with descriptions and evaluations of 220 restaurants, including prices, hours and information about the type of kosher supervision and how strictly it is enforced. Neighborhood maps are also given. The book is available in bookstores or by mail by calling (718) 332-8547.
With reviews of only 400 restaurants, "Passport to New York" by Peter and Amy Meltzer and John F. Mariani (Passport Press, $10.95) is hardly encyclopedic. But the listings in this pocket-size guide are fairly detailed and include some places, like Patroon, Quilty's and Firebird, that opened late last year. The guide also offers previews of places that are due to open.

HEADLINE: Success on Recycling

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Yes, recycling is growing in Manhattan. But left unsaid in your March 31 news article were two bits of good news: First, the best-performing community districts will now reach 35 percent or more diversion of recyclables from total waste, showing that the requirements of the recycling law are achievable. 
 Second, all wastepaper collected in Manhattan will be delivered by barge to the city's first paper mill on Staten Island. If a second mill, being developed by the Natural Resources Defense Council, gets built in the Bronx, every ounce of wastepaper collected by the Sanitation Department will be recycled into new paper products within the city's borders.
Those jobs and economic activity sure beat shipping garbage -- and dollars -- to landfills outside New York City and are a testament to the importance of staying the course in expanding the recycling collection system.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls on U.S. Warning Over Japan's Trade Surplus

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply yesterday, hurt by a warning from Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin about Japan's trade surplus and by expectations that a Japanese economic report would show surprising strength.
Those factors fueled speculation among currency traders that the two-year-old retreat against the dollar might be coming to an end. That helped push the dollar to a three-week low against the yen, a six-week low against the mark and a 10-week low against the pound. 
 Uncertainty about the direction of the United States stock market after two days of heavy losses also weighed on the dollar. But traders said Wall Street's mixed finish on Tuesday was a secondary influence and the primary force driving currency dealings was the yen's strength.
"We've broken away from levels where we've been at for weeks," said David Becker, senior dealer at Bank Austria in New York. "Once we breached some technical levels, it just propelled itself. That's what's been dominating the market today."
In late trading in New York, the dollar settled at 121.76 yen, down from 123.80 yen on Monday and the lowest level since March 10. The dollar fell to 1.6656 marks, from 1.6770 marks Monday, and was the lowest since Feb. 10. The pound rose to $1.6528 from $1.6395 and was the strongest since Jan. 21.
The yen was bolstered by expectations that the Bank of Japan's widely watched quarterly survey of business sentiment, known as the Tankan survey, would show unexpected optimism about Japan's economic outlook and could presage rising interest rates in Japan. Those rates have languished at record lows since September 1995, depressing demand for yen. The Tankan report is due to be released today.
Mr. Rubin hurt the dollar further in remarks to reporters in Washington before his three-day Asian tour, which begins Friday in Tokyo. He said Japan had made progress in reducing its trade surpluses "but the issue is not to have it go back the other way."
The remarks were viewed as a warning that Japan should not use a cheaper yen to export its way back to strong economic growth. A lower-priced yen makes Japanese goods more competitive abroad.

HEADLINE: Unfazed by Gingrich, China Agrees With Some of What He Said

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, April 1

 BODY:
The Government indicated today that it was essentially pleased with remarks over the weekend by Newt Gingrich, who said last week during a visit to China that he accepted a one-China policy but asserted that the United States would defend Taiwan militarily if it was attacked.
The one-China policy has been at the heart of relations between the United States and China since President Nixon established ties with Beijing in 1972. In signing the Shanghai Communique then, the United States and China effectively deferred the issue of a resolution to the simmering civil war that has kept Taiwan and the mainland divided since 1949. In the meantime, a robust economic boom in the region has drawn the two enemies close together. 
 At a news briefing today, Shen Guofang, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, said of the House Speaker's visit: "Mr. Gingrich mentioned several times in Beijing that he opposed Taiwan independence and approved the principle of one China. He also expressed that the American Government and the American Congress will stick to the principle of one China."
With little rancor, Mr. Shen highlighted the positive points in Mr. Gingrich's remarks, which were made to reporters in Shanghai on Sunday, before the Speaker and his party of 12 members of Congress left for Tokyo and a final stop in Taiwan before returning to the United States.
Mr. Shen did not take issue with Mr. Gingrich's pointed warning that if the mainland should use military force against Taiwan, "we will defend Taiwan. Period." The Chinese spokesman said: "Referring to what he said in Shanghai, China has always stood for the position of peaceful unification" with Taiwan.
"However," Mr. Shen said, "the Chinese side will take necessary measures if Taiwan declares independence or if foreign powers interfere in the Taiwan issue." What those measures might turn out to be, he said, "is the internal affair of China."
Mr. Gingrich's remarks on defending Taiwan seemed to undermine the "strategic ambiguity" by which the United States has avoided issuing a direct warning to China over the use of force, in part because such a warning might incite the pro-independence forces on Taiwan.
The White House issued a statement on Sunday that while it did not rebuke Mr. Gingrich, said that he "was speaking for himself." The statement reiterated that the United States was committed by the Taiwan Relations Act to provide an "adequate self-defense" for Taiwan, while also insisting that both parties "peacefully address the Taiwan issue."
But some China specialists argued today that Mr. Gingrich's formulation, balanced between his public commitment to "one China" and a determination that no party can solve the Taiwan issue by force, amounted to a clear statement of American political sentiment in the wake of the 1996 Taiwan crisis. In March of last year, China carried out military exercises off Taiwan as the island was holding its first direct popular vote for President. Beijing viewed the election as undermining the one-China principle.
Other specialists worry that Mr. Gingrich's remarks were not sufficiently nuanced. Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a China scholar at the University of Michigan, said Mr. Gingrich seemed to commit the United States to defending Taiwan even if Taiwan took provocative steps like making unilateral statements that could be construed as declarations of independence.
"If this point is left unclear in Taiwan, there are potential downside risks to his statements in China," Professor Lieberthal said.

HEADLINE: Merrill Investigating Derivatives Accounting

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: LONDON, April 1

 BODY:
Merrill Lynch & Company said today that it was investigating some "unreconciled balances" in its equity derivatives accounts in Britain after a change in reporting lines for the derivatives business last year.
Merrill said no clients' funds were affected by the inconsistencies in the accounts and that they would not result in any material impact on its business or earnings. 
 "This matter is entirely about internal accounting at Merrill Lynch," a spokesman, Richard Silverman, saud. "No clients have been affected financially in any way, and there will be no meaningful repercussions from this matter."
The investigation comes amid increasing concern in Britain about derivatives accounting after the disclosure last month by National Westminster Bank P.L.C. that a former trader had built hidden losses of as much as 90 million ($147.6 million) in interest rate derivatives during the last three years.
Mr. Silverman said there were no such losses in Merrill's accounts. He said Merrill had informed Britain's Securities and Futures Authority of the unreconciled balances and would keep it apprised of the inquiry.
The inconsistencies in the balances were discovered after Merrill changed its accounts reporting structure late last year to have the equity derivatives business in London report to Merrill Lynch International, a Britain-regulated entity, from Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York.

HEADLINE: Data Point to More Growth, But With Inflation in Check

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 1

 BODY:
Evidence mounted today that the economy accelerated markedly in recent weeks, though inflation appeared to remain in check.
In what analysts considered the most important of three fresh sets of strong figures, corporate purchasing executives reported that their index of factory activity climbed in March to match its highest reading in more than two years. 
 The employment component of the index rose after 24 consecutive months of contraction in the number of factory jobs, and suppliers needed more time to deliver goods.
But the report, by the National Association of Purchasing Management, also showed an easing of the group's prices-paid component, a gauge of inflation.
That at least temporarily offered some hope to the securities markets that another increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve was not imminent and perhaps not inevitable. The Fed raised rates last week for the first time in more than two years because of fears that strong growth would lead to a resurgence of inflation. Today, the stock market recovered from an early setback and the Dow Jones industrial average finished with a gain. Bond prices rose slightly.
The economy is displaying "really robust growth," said James E. Annable Jr., chief economist at the First National Bank of Chicago. But the figures showing inflation still well contained, he said, mean that the Fed still lacks "a smoking gun to be aggressive" about further increases in interest rates.
And while more economists, including Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch, decided today to raise their estimates of first-quarter growth to 3.5 percent or more, he and others expressed confidence that the economy would slow significantly in the quarter that began today.
"The economy's going to cool down," declared Maury N. Harris of Paine Webber, contending that it was being temporarily buoyed by the actions of home buyers worried about mortgage rates moving up further and employers afraid to delay hiring for fear that workers would soon become unavailable.
Also today, the Conference Board, a business research group, reported that the index of leading indicators rose strongly in February. And the Government reported that construction spending that month posted the biggest gain since March 1994.
But it was the surprisingly large increase in the purchasing managers' index, to 55 points in March from 53.1 in February, that captured most of the attention since this gauge is not only more current but contains price and supplier data that policy makers consider particularly useful.
But the report's price index fell to 50.9 points from 55.1, "indicating a slower rate of price increase," the association said. Only 15 percent of the corporate buyers reported paying higher prices, down from 18 percent in February, while the proportion of those paying lower prices climbed to 16 percent from 9 percent. The rest found prices unchanged.
The supplier deliveries index, which rose to 53.6 points from 51.3, showed 8 percent of executives reporting vendors less able to meet order schedules, compared with 5 percent in February. At the same time, 4 percent reported faster deliveries, up from 2 percent.
And factory jobs, reversing a two-year decline, surged in March to a reading of 51.6 from 45.4 percent, suggesting that Friday's Government report on the March labor market will show revived growth. In the association's report, a reading over 50 indicates an increase while one of less than that represents a decline.
The Conference Board's index of leading indicators, intended to predict turns in the business cycle, rose five-tenths of 1 percent in February, after a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent in January; it was the biggest since February 1996. Nine of the 10 components in the report contributed to the increase, paced by a reduced number of people making first-time claims for unemployment insurance and by slower deliveries by vendors.
The only negative was the interest-rate spread, a recent addition calculated by subtracting the Federal funds rate from the rate on 10-year Treasury bonds. A narrower differential suggests slower growth ahead or, should short rates exceed long ones, recession.
The Commerce Department's tally of new construction showed activity rose 2.3 percent in February from January, to an annual rate of $603.8 billion, the fastest in almost a year, as warm weather aided projects.
Today's statistics seemed to conform with a quarterly survey of 3,000 executives by Dun & Bradstreet that pointed to "a strong upturn" in the economy this spring.
"After more than a year of very stable expectations, business optimism has rapidly increased to a level comparable to the peak expectations set in 1994," said Joseph W. Duncan, the company's chief economic adviser. "In nearly every key industry, the proportion of firms that expect higher sales and profits is rising."

Inflation Data Help to Lift Bond Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices for Treasury securities rebounded from early losses yesterday as new data suggested that inflation was still subdued, even as manufacturing continued to hum along.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 8/32, to 94 16/32; the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 7.07 percent, from 7.09 percent on Monday. GovPx, a bond pricing service, said that the trading volume was about 40 percent above average for a Tuesday; by late in the day, the value of securities traded was more than $100 billion, only the eighth time this year that level had been reached. 
 Among the reports released yesterday that showed a strong economy was one from the National Association of Purchasing Management, whose index of manufacturing conditions rose to 55.0 points in March from 53.1 in February, a bigger gain than expected.
Another report, on construction spending, showed a 2.3 percent rise in February, which was also more than expected. And the index of leading economic indicators increased for the 13th consecutive month during February, rising half a percent, a bit more than expected.
The strength of the reports combined to put early pressure on the bond market. Investors sold on visions of more rises in interest rates by a Federal Reserve concerned about inflation because the economy shows no signs of slowing down.
But prices recovered after investors took a closer look at the purchasing managers' report, noticing that the prices-paid component, a gauge of inflation, fell to 50.9 points from 55.1 last month. The market's gains were held in check because of traders' wariness about the employment report set for release on Friday; strong monthly job reports in the current expansion have caused concern in a bond market already worried about an overheated economy.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said that, like the purchasing managers' report, the other economic releases were not quite as unfavorable for bonds as they initially seemed.
The leading indicators were strong, he said, but that index "has not been the best guide to the economy's recent performance, as it certainly gave no indication beforehand of the economy's strength over the past two quarters." And while the construction report was strong, he said it might have been skewed by unusually mild weather in February.
In any event, bond prices recouped their early losses and then some.
Still, more strong economic news may be headed the market's way. Mr. Fine said that the report on factory orders for February, set for release today, is expected to mirror the performance of its largest component, orders for durable goods, which were earlier reported to have risen sharply.
"While this will not surprise the market," Mr. Fine said, "it will nevertheless add further credence to the concept that G.D.P. growth during the first quarter continued to advance at a pace well above the Fed's desired trend rate of maximum, noninflationary growth. Most assuredly, the expectation of another Fed tightening move on the horizon is alive and well."
Elsewhere, the Treasury sold $10 billion of 14-day cash management bills and $17 billion of 19-day cash management bills through auction to cover the Government's short-term cash needs outside the regular borrowing schedule.
The average rate for the 14-day maturity was 5.37 percent and the average for the 19-day maturity was 5.42 percent.

Violence Leads Netanyahu To Plan a Washington Trip
Two explosions occurred in Gaza, each of them killing a Palestinian man. The Israeli authorities said they were botched suicide bombings. In the West Bank, Israeli police officers fatally shot two Palestinians. As the sense of crisis heightened, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu abruptly scheduled a visit to Washington on Monday, and King Hussein of Jordan called for a more active American role. A1 

Israel Favors Conversion Bill
The Israeli Parliament gave preliminary approval to a bill that would give Orthodox rabbis sole authority to conduct conversions to Judaism in Israel. Conservative and Reform rabbis in Israel and abroad denounced the bill, saying it would alienate the majority of diaspora Jews. Non-Orthodox conversions that took place abroad would still be recognized in Israel. A6
 
Pakistan Curbs Its President
Pakistan's Parliament unanimously eliminated a law allowing the country's appointed president to dismiss elected Governments and to appoint chiefs of the armed forces. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who sought the change, said it had been approved by President Farooq Leghari. The law, in effect since 1985, had previously been used to dismiss, on charges of corruption and misrule, Governments led by both Mr. Sharif and his rival, Benazir Bhutto. A7
 
Chinese Reporter Is a Suicide
A Chinese journalist committed suicide in Beijing shortly after being recalled from his post as Washington bureau chief of the New China News Agency. Colleagues said he had been discovered arranging for himself, his wife and daughter to defect to the United States. The journalist, Wei Gouqiang, had written critically about the United States. A4
 
China Sidesteps Gingrich
The Chinese Government took remarks made by Newt Gingrich in Beijing last weekend in stride. It emphasized the House Speaker's acceptance of the one-China policy and played down his blunt assertion that the United States would come to Taiwan's military defense if the island were attacked. The White House said that Mr. Gingrich was "speaking for himself," but did not rebuke him. A4
 
Bosnia Orphans Leave Germany
Germany sent 30 Bosnian children back to Sarajevo, four years after they were dramatically rescued from an orphanage during the siege of that city. State officials said the children's guardians had repeatedly pressed for their return. Germany has said it will deport tens of thousands of Bosnian Muslim refugees, but many of their homes lie in territory now controlled by Bosnian Serbs. A8
 
New Prime Minister for Zaire
Zaire's Parliament elected Etienne Tshisekedi as Prime Minister. Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator who twice dismissed Mr. Tshisekedi for refusing to yield to his wishes, was expected to approve the decision. A5

Top White House Aides Tried to Help Hubbell
President Clinton's chief of staff and other top advisers and confidants mounted a campaign in 1994 to help find lucrative employment for Webster L. Hubbell, one of Mr. Clinton's closest friends who was facing a criminal investigation, the White House acknowledged. Aides said Mr. Clinton may have been told of the effort, but was not involved in it. A1
 
Presbyterians Bar Gay Clergy
The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) said a majority of its regional groups had voted to amend the church's constitution to block anyone who is sexually active outside of marriage from being a clergy member, elder or deacon. The vote was intended to settle a debate within the 2.7 million-member denomination about ordaining non-celibate homosexuals, but some opponents of the measure promised a campaign to repeal it. A1
 
Winter Arrives in New England
Boston and the rest of New England struggled under the indignity of more than two feet of snow in April -- the region's third-biggest winter storm on record. Hundreds of thousands were without power, and schools and offices closed throughout the region. Snowdrifts blocked highways as far south as Pennsylvania. A10
 
Rules on Health Benefits Issued
The Clinton Administration issued rules preventing employers from denying health benefits to new employees because of pre-existing medical problems like heart trouble. The rules put into effect a law passed by Congress last year to make health insurance more easily available to people who switch jobs. A15
 
Suicide Note Cites Cult
A 58-year-old man was found dead under a purple shroud in his home in Northern California. He left a suicide note suggesting that he hoped to join members of the Heaven's Gate cult on a space ship in the trail of the Hale-Bopp comet. But officials said they knew of no other link between the man and the 39 cult members who committed mass suicide. A16
 
Labor Begins Political Push
Organized labor began a weeklong advertising campaign against its political foes. Unusually, it aimed at seven Democrats along with a dozen Republicans. The ostensible issue was $20 billion in corporate tax breaks, but the A.F.L.-C.I.O. seemed to be trying to take advantage of what it perceived as a leadership vacuum in Congress. A18
 
Shuttle Launching Is Delayed
The space agency delayed a launching of the shuttle Columbia by one day to install thermal insulation on a coolant loop. The shuttle is now scheduled to lift off on Friday. (AP)
 
Social Security Chief Chosen
President Clinton has settled on Kenneth S. Apfel, a former aide to former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, to be Social Security Commissioner, a White House official said. Mr. Apfel, 48, is the associate director for human resources at the Office of Management and Budget. (AP)

Arbitrator Backs Giving New Jersey Most of Ellis I.
An arbitrator recommended splitting Ellis Island between New York and New Jersey. The museum and major monuments would go to New York, but New Jersey would get the 22 acres built on landfill that it claimed, plus a share of the taxes generated by the island's staff and visitors. The United States Supreme Court must ratify the division. A1

Meningitis Outbreak Is Halted
A meningitis outbreak that killed two toddlers in New Jersey has apparently been halted by giving preventive medication to 200 people, the authorities said. They said the disease, which left a relative of one of the toddlers in a coma, spread when babysitters let them play together. B2

HEADLINE: Solomonic Ruling Would Divide Ellis Island

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

 BODY:
Ruling in a dispute that has kept New York and New Jersey at loggerheads for 200 years, an arbitrator appointed by the United States Supreme Court recommended yesterday that Ellis Island be divided between the two, drawing the line largely where New Jersey wanted it.
The recommendation, which invites inevitable comparisons to King Solomon's ruling dividing the baby, leaves the museum and the major monuments of the famous immigration station in New York's hands. But New Jersey would gain control over about 22 acres of landfill added to the island, starting in 1890, for the construction of hospital and administration buildings. 
 Since the island is a national park, the recommendation is not expected to change its day-to-day operations.
But the change would be a blow to New York, which has claimed bragging rights over the island that has become the symbol of the immigrant experience. Forty percent of Americans trace their roots to someone who arrived in the New World via Ellis Island from 1892 to 1954.
New Jersey wants to claim any economic benefits if restoration plans lead to a hotel or convention center, and wants to build a footbridge to attract tourists. The state would also gain a share of the taxes generated by the 425 people who work on the island and the $5 million in food and souvenirs snapped up by 1.65 million annual visitors.
New York officials and preservationists attacked the decision, claiming it would create a jigsaw-puzzle-like pastiche of divided control that would become a legal nightmare.
"Beyond our legal proof, New York's claim to Ellis Island is clearly and indelibly inscribed in the hearts and beliefs of the millions of immigrants who set foot here," said Dennis C. Vacco, State Attorney General of New York. "This recommendation is not just contrary to the history of Ellis Island, but if allowed to stand, could threaten its future as well. For the first time, Ellis Island would be exposed to a hodgepodge of preservation rules."
New Jersey officials gloated, and wasted no time in ranking themselves right up there with New York as an immigrant gateway.
"This is a recognition of New Jersey's place in history," said Gov. Christine Todd Whitman. "It is a matter of pride for the state. It's a recognition that both New York and New Jersey have served as a gateway for millions of Americans who have made a real difference in the state and across the nation. We are very pleased with it."
The recommendation is expected to be reviewed by the full Supreme Court in its term starting in October. The Constitution, envisioning the day that states might summon gunboats to settle their disputes, gave the Supreme Court jurisdiction over such border skirmishes.
Lacking the time to hear full-blown trials, the Court appoints a special master to serve essentially in the role of trial judge and jury, listening to evidence and making finds of fact and law. Since the nation's birth about 175 disputes have been handled in this manner. The hearings in the Ellis Island case were held in summer 1996.
After reviewing any responses to yesterday's recommendation and hearing brief oral arguments, the Court can accept, modify or throw out the recommendation of the special master. In theory, the Justices do not have to defer to the master's recommendations. But in practice the recommendation is almost always accepted.
The recommendation by the special master in this case, Paul R. Verkuil, a law professor who started work yesterday as dean of Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University, would give New Jersey virtually everything it claimed. An 1834 agreement to settle three decades of squabbling drew the border down the middle of the Hudson, giving New Jersey underwater rights over what became the landfill portions. Mr. Verkuil emphasized a 1908 ruling by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes that gave New Jersey the right to tax a railroad on landfill on its side of the Hudson River.
No one disputed that the original rock given to New York in that treaty, sometimes referred to as prototypical Ellis Island in court documents, should remain in New York's hands. Mr. Verkuil chose to give New York about five acres, defined by the low tide mark. Otherwise, not only would the boundary have split the main building, but tourists coming off boats would have had to cross through New Jersey territory to get to the museum.
New Jersey treated the case as a boundary dispute, while New York attempted to show that it was a property case, with the Empire State's long connection to the island giving it the right to claim sovereignty over all 27.5 acres. The landfill was added in 1890, 1899, 1908 and 1936, during the island's heyday as the country's main immigration station.
The two sides marshaled obscure annals of history, law, immigration, geography, tidal flows and marine biology in their arguments, excavating a mountain of documents from historical archives across the nation.
New York used evidence from postcards to poetry to bolster its case. Mr. Verkuil was dismissive of much of this, incredulous over testimony from a man who said he remembered his family's ties to New York when his father lived on the island. The man would have been 1 at the time. The special master also said he could not give weight to the New York argument that starry-eyed immigrants were focused on the New York City skyline when they entered the harbor.
"Because no poll was taken, we will never know for certain in which state most immigrants perceived they were landing," he wrote, again stressing the importance of the 1834 border pact. "It hardly matters in any event."
New York officials were stunned by this aspect of the ruling.
"It must have been a fix," said Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. "Ellis Island is obviously part of New York. My recollection is that all those people who were coming here were coming to New York."
New York State officials, including Gov. George E. Pataki, noted with some satisfaction that the heart of the island remained in its hands and vowed to try to overturn the special master's recommendations.
"We kept the good stuff," said Judith T. Kramer, the assistant attorney general who led the presentation of New York's case. "But this nightmare is exactly what the preservationists wanted to avoid."
The special master ordered a survey to determine boundaries. But critics noticed that pieces of the main buildings, including the kitchen and laundry, would be in New Jersey. That raises the question whether workers in those buildings would pay taxes to New Jersey, or whether anyone injured there would seek compensation from New Jersey.
It also raised the hackles of preservationists, who argue that New Jersey's preservation laws are weaker than New York's. Many compared the decision unfavorably to the Biblical ruling by King Solomon.
"I think splitting the baby doesn't do much for the baby, and I think this is a mistake," said Peg Breen, president of the New York Landmarks Conservancy. "You cannot go out there without getting a sense of fear, a sense of hope that the immigrants felt. It is not just the main hall, but all those buildings that are haunting."
She said New York had more stringent laws that would protect those buildings, some of which have been threatened with destruction to make way for a proposed hotel and convention center that was later dropped.
"It should not just be petty squabbling over who is going to get more tax revenue but over who can best protect it," Ms. Breen said. "I suspect New Jersey's interest is mainly economic and that bodes ill for the future."
New Jersey officials took umbrage at the charge that this was their main motivation.
"Money has never been the main point," Governor Whitman said. " The public at large seemed a little bit baffled by the whole thing.
"It seems like they should have better things to argue about," said Dennis Corrigan, a Michigan resident visiting the island with his wife and two young sons.

HEADLINE: New Strife Leads Netanyahu To Schedule a Visit to Clinton

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, April 1

 BODY:
Two explosions in Gaza early this morning that Israel said were suicide bombing attempts and the fatal shooting of two Palestinians in the West Bank gave fresh impetus to the spiral of violence between Palestinians and Israelis, even as the political front continued to crumble.
Each explosion killed a Palestinian man. 
As the sense of crisis worsened, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu abruptly scheduled a visit to Washington to meet with President Clinton on Monday.
In Washington, King Hussein of Jordan said the crisis required "a more active U.S. role."
"Minds have to be put to work and heads need to be knocked together," King Hussein told a small group of journalists at his Washington hotel. "The United States is in the position to be the arbiter and the partner of all concerned. But the United States should not be just the messenger. That's what a new phase requires."
With the United States offering few new ideas publicly on how to break out of a dangerous impasse, the Israelis and Palestinians seemed unable to do more than trade blows and recriminations and brace for more trouble.
The explosions in Gaza occurred 15 minutes apart near Jewish settlements inside the Gaza Strip and along roads used by the Israelis, at an hour when children were about to set off in school buses. But no Israeli vehicle was passing by, and the casualties were all Palestinian, including several people riding in a taxi.
A suicide bombing at a Tel Aviv cafe on March 21 that killed three Israeli women and the Palestinian bomber broke a yearlong lull in such attacks.
An anonymous caller to Israel Radio claimed responsibility for today's explosions -- the first near the settlement of Netzarim and the second near Kfar Darom -- in the name of Islamic Holy War, a militant Palestinian group that has struck in Gaza before. The caller said the attacks had been carried out in the name of the "Abu Ghneim commando." Abu Ghneim is the Arabic name for the hill in southeastern Jerusalem on which Israel began breaking ground two weeks ago for a controversial new housing project.
But in Gaza, Palestinian officials and witnesses said the explosion near Kfar Darom appeared to have been caused by a grenade thrown or fired from an Israeli Army jeep at a man in a Palestinian police uniform standing by the road.
A witness said the man had been waiting for a lift when a soldier fired the grenade at him and he was killed. Five passengers in a passing Palestinian taxicab were wounded.
Israeli officials insisted that both explosions had been attempted suicide bombings. They said one of the bombers had been in uniform.
Mr. Netanyahu said the explosions "proved that the green light hasn't changed, and that appropriate measures have not been taken by the Palestinian Authority." The reference was to Mr. Netanyahu's charge last month that Mr. Arafat had given an indirect "green light" to Islamic terror groups to unleash attacks on Israel.
Mr. Arafat, sitting down to a meeting with representatives of countries that donate money to the Palestinians, treated the charges with the same disdain with which he has reacted to all of Mr. Netanyahu's charges of recent weeks: "What will be the reaction from our side, to control more and more?" he asked. "For every pressure there is a reaction. This is natural law."
A resolution by Arab League ministers recommending that Arab countries retreat from relations with Israel and resume economic and political boycotts, though threatening few immediate consequences, added to a sense of a Middle East flashback to the dismally familiar state of confrontation.
In the West Bank, Israeli soldiers shot two Palestinians to death. One, outside a Jewish settlement near Hebron, was said by the Israeli authorities to be trying to commit a robbery.
The more portentous killing occurred outside Nablus, where a Palestinian police officer in civilian clothes was shot to death during a stone-throwing melee near an Israeli checkpoint that began with a student protest against the Jerusalem housing development.
Palestinian hospital officials said he had been hit by a real bullet. Israeli Army officials said they had used only rubber bullets, which are in fact metal slugs encased in rubber.
Nablus is regarded as a dangerous flash point because of the presence inside the Palestinian-ruled town of Joseph's Tomb, a walled site used by Jewish militants for religious study. Six Israeli soldiers and two Palestinians were killed there during rioting in September. This time, Israel has stationed tanks and personnel carriers around the town in a sign that it is prepared to go in if the shrine is endangered.
Palestinian security officials said the victim, Haitham Mansour, 20, was an undercover officer and was standing near the protests when he was hit.
The incident was on the 13th day of violence over Israel's decision to proceed with the housing development in Jerusalem, with no sign yet of a way out.
In Israel, an American initiative has come to be viewed as the sole possible solution to the crisis, since Mr. Netanyahu is effectively trapped between the hard-line demands of his conservative coalition and the refusal of Mr. Arafat to continue any contacts.
Mr. Netanyahu's charge that Mr. Arafat has given a "green light" for terror attacks -- which he has angrily rejected -- has further exacerbated relations. Israeli officials say cooperation on security matters has deteriorated.
The prevailing expectation is that Washington will try to build an initiative around Mr. Netanyahu's proposal to set aside the existing framework of agreements and plunge directly into intensive talks on a final settlement, perhaps bringing the two sides together in a setting like Camp David, which President Carter used in 1978 to broker the Israeli-Egyptian peace.
Senior American officials in Washington said they were intrigued by Mr. Netanyahu's proposal to move quickly to an accelerated negotiation on the final status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and of Jerusalem. At a meeting with The New York Times in New York on Monday, King Hussein said he was open to the idea.
In Washington today, the Jordanian King called on Mr. Netanyahu to deliver on promised confidence-building measures for the Palestinians like an airport in Gaza, access to ports for trade, quicker transit for goods and safe passage between the West Bank and Gaza.
Mr. Netanyahu contends that the existing process, established under the 1993 agreement in Oslo that outlined the negotiation process, will only create one crisis after another.
The search for a new approach has led to considerable speculation that Mr. Netanyahu might form a "national unity" government with the opposition Labor Party, which would potentially make him less dependent on right-wing support. In an interview with Israeli army radio today, Mr. Netanyahu said he was "definitely considering" the option but had not come to a decision.
The "big question," Mr. Netanyahu said, was whether such a coalition would actually create a broad consensus, or would paralyze the Government instead. "Would it be a government of unity or two governments?" asked Mr. Netanyahu.
In an interview published today in the Israeli daily Maariv, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said, "By God, this is the worst situation in the peace process since 1977," the year in which his predecessor, Anwar el-Sadat, made his historic visit to Israel. "You have succeeded in frightening the world," Mr. Mubarak said. "You have pushed all of us into a very difficult situation."
To which Mr. Netanyahu retorted that Egypt was "doing its utmost, I am sorry to say, in a pretty systematic way, to shut the gates of normalization and openness."

HEADLINE: Private Schools to Share in Giuliani's Extra Textbook Aid

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
In November, facing criticism of his cuts in the education budget, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said he was giving $70 million to the Board of Education to replace the dog-eared, outdated textbooks used by thousands of public school children. But school officials now say that because of a provision in state law, more than a fifth of that money will go to buy books for students in parochial schools.
Board of Education officials said they had initially assumed that they could use the entire $70 million to replace woefully outdated textbooks for the city's 1.1 million public school students. But as parochial school officials swiftly pointed out, state law requires that any government money earmarked for books be distributed to all children in the city -- including those in nonpublic schools. 
 About 21 percent of New York City children attend private schools, a vast majority in Roman Catholic schools; hence, about 21 percent of the Mayor's money, or about $14.7 million, will be used for books for private school students, according to a March 31 memo from board officials to school superintendents.
"The law is the law is the law, and this is what the law requires," said Lewis H. Spence, the deputy chancellor for operations. "I think most of us thought it was for the public schools."
Giuliani administration officials said yesterday that they were initially unaware of the state requirement that dollars designated for textbooks had to be offered to all children living in the city. Under state law, city education aid that is not earmarked for books does not have to be shared with private school children, state education officials said.
"The Mayor intended to make books available for public school children," the Mayor's spokesman, Jack Deacy, said yesterday. "They are being made available. Within that, the law requires us to make allocations for other needy students who need new books, and we're going to do that."
Mr. Deacy said the Mayor had no further plans to increase textbook financing for now.
While independent private schools like Dalton and Riverdale would also be eligible for a share of the aid, Mr. Spence said none had requested it.
Catherine Hickey, Superintendent of Schools for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, which has about 73,000 students in Manhattan, Staten Island and the Bronx, applauded the Board's decision to share the textbook dollars. But she also noted that unlike textbooks in many public schools, textbooks in the Catholic schools were relatively new, written about five or six years ago.
"We are not in a situation where our textbooks are 20 to 30 years old," Dr. Hickey said.
She added that the private-school share of the textbook money, roughly $65 to $70 a child, would be used to buy supplementary materials and literature. The money cannot be used to buy religious materials.
The Board of Education will divide its $55 million share based on the needs of each school, rather than allocating an equal amount per student, officials said.
Discussions about sharing the $70 million began shortly after the Mayor announced in November that he would grant the extra money to the board. At that time, the Association of Non-Public School Officials pointed out to Board of Education officials the state regulation that requires textbook money to be made available to nonpublic school children, said Dr. Hickey, a member of the association.
State money earmarked for textbooks, totaling $35 a student each year, has always been available to nonpublic school children. But city education aid is generally not designated for particular items, like textbooks, and therefore does not have to be shared, school officials said.
But last year, the City Council voted to earmark $12.5 million a year for textbooks over the next four years. After complaints from Dr. Hickey's group, the Board of Education agreed to share that money with private schools. The major beneficiaries will be students in the Archdiocese schools and the Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, which has about 73,800 students.
Board of Education officials also released new regulations yesterday intended to give district superintendents and school principals greater flexibility in buying books with the money allocated by the Mayor.
According to the March 31 memo, schools may buy books directly from wholesalers and bookstores, instead of sometimes lengthy and cumbersome contracts made by the central Board, if that is "more economically beneficial" to the school. Nor do they have to go through a competitive bidding process, as they do now for purchases over $250.
State money, the biggest share of dollars spent on books, can be used to buy books only from a catalogue approved by the Board of Education. The list includes only those books that are reviewed by Board officials. Under the new rules, teachers will be able to recommend books to be included in the catalog.
The memo says the regulations apply to the Mayor's special allocation. But Karen Crowe, a spokeswoman for the Chancellor, said, "We're going to use this as a template for all future purchases."

Fiscal Oversight for Camden

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
The final straw came last November, when Mayor Arnold W. Webster of Camden refused to lay off 67 city workers to balance his 1997 budget, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said yesterday. Convinced that the city was unable to cope with its financial crisis, the Governor said she would submit legislation to create a fiscal oversight board. 
 The board, made up mostly of state officials, would have final approval on hiring decisions and contracts, said Christopher B. Wolf, a spokesman for the State Department of Community Affairs. Mayor Webster welcomed the board as a step that might help solve the city's problems.

For Now, Pettitte Puts Money Matters Aside

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, April 1

 BODY:
When Andy Pettitte strolls to the mound against the Mariners on Wednesday night, his focus will be on their mighty lineup. Fortunately for his own team, Pettitte said he would not be thinking about the way in which the Yankees have treated contract matters in his brief career.
"All I want to talk about is baseball," Pettitte said before the Yanks lost tonight's season opener at the Kingdome. "The other stuff bothered me at first, but I'm over it." 
 It does not take an accountant to realize that Pettitte has reason to be miffed. A person familiar with Pettitte's situation said the Yankees were poised to sign him to a three-year, $4.2 million contract last year when George Steinbrenner suddenly squashed the plan. The Yankees probably wish they had signed the 24-year-old left-hander to that deal, because it would be very economical right now.
"That's still an option," General Manager Bob Watson said of the possibility of signing Pettitte to a long-term deal. "What was going through everybody's mind about Andy around the All-Star break last year? His elbow. You have to wait and let the things shake out. He went through the post-season and answered all the questions we had about him in spring training."
But Pettitte won an American League-high 21 games and finished second to Toronto's Pat Hentgen in the Cy Young Award race, so his price has surely escalated. He may prefer to wait for arbitration after the 1997 season.
Like Bernie Williams, whose opening-day deadline for a multiyear extension was likely to pass today without an agreement, Pettitte has enough evidence from his performances on the field to dramatically increase his salary through arbitration. Williams and the Yankees agreed in February to a one-year, $5.25 million deal to avoid arbitration. With another season of 17 victories or more, Pettitte could ask for more than $3 million in arbitration and win.
"That's the price you pay," Watson said. "We would have looked bad if his elbow blew out. I've always said, I'll pay for performance. If you put up the numbers, I'll pay you."
Randy Hendricks, Pettitte's agent, would only say that he is not averse to discussing a long-term deal during the season before adding, "I don't want to comment on anything."
Hendricks watched the Dodgers sign Hideo Nomo to a three-year, $4.5 million contract after his rookie season, and must wonder why Pettitte has not been given similar treatment by the Yankees. Granted, Pettitte was not as dominating or as much of an icon as Nomo, but he was the premier rookie pitcher in the American League when he went 12-9 with a 4.17 earned run average in 1995.
And after the multiyear contract failed to materialize last season, Pettitte found himself lumped together with Mariano Rivera ($550,000, a 328 percent raise) and Derek Jeter ($540,000, a 350 percent raise) when the Yankees signed him to a $600,000 contract for 1997.
In 1995, Pettitte won 12 games, while Rivera was 5-3 with a 5.51 earned run average in 19 games and Jeter had only 48 at-bats. So why was Pettitte, a two-year player, given financial treatment similar to that of the one-year players following the 1996 season? And when Pettitte's contract was revised after his first year, it was increased by only 38 percent, from $109,000 to $150,000. That was enough reason to be miffed.

Data Show Strong Growth But Little Inflation
Evidence mounted that the economy accelerated markedly in recent weeks, though inflation appeared to remain in check. 
 Purchasing executives reported that their index of factory activity climbed in March, and separate reports showed that construction spending and the index of leading indicators rose in February. But an inflation gauge in the purchasing managers' report declined, comforting the stock market, where a selloff was stemmed after two days. [Page D4.]

Chrysler Light-Truck Sales Slip
Sales of Chrysler's high-profit light trucks -- sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks --fell two-tenths of 1 percent last month from March 1996. Honda's sales fell 6.6 percent, but its new CRV, above, proved to be a big hit. Analysts said that flattening sales of the Big Three's trucks would hurt their profits. [D4.]

A Class-Action Struggle: Can Air Be Too Clean?

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
Despite a couple of jokes about the spotted owl, no one on the affirmative side of tomorrow night's meandering "Firing Line" debate -- "Resolved: The Environmentalists Are Going Too Far Too Fast" -- comes out flatly against pure air or water or for killing elephants. Led by William F. Buckley Jr., they maintain that their opponents are making mountains out of molehills, or maybe it's the other way around.
The environmentalist contingent (Mr. Buckley calls them "eco-freaks") retort that untrammeled industrial growth is throwing nature off balance with dire consequences for the future of the human race. 
 The encounter shifts ground depending on who is leading the charge. Jerry Brown (he's the fellow without a tie or jacket) issues jeremiads against even trammeled growth, except perhaps of trees. He comes out for "a happy asceticism."
Speaking for the corporations mistrusted by the environmentalists, Jerry J. Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, grants that some Government regulation is needed but expresses confidence in his clients to behave responsibly, make money, make jobs and make life pleasanter for all without ravaging the land or polluting the air and the water. His assurances are greeted with some skepticism.
If Mr. Jasinowski has rarely met a corporation he could not defend, the professional environmentalists -- George M. Woodwell, the director of the Woods Hole Research Center, and Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club -- have never met an ecological cause they could not champion. Mr. Pope uses some of his time for fund-raising pitches: "At the Sierra Club we don't believe there's such a thing as water that's too pure for our kids to drink, air that's too clean for our parents to breathe." Debaters on both sides make obeisance to the American People as if they were running for something.
Richard L. Schmalensee, director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, labors to get the argument off the rhetorical plane and onto ground where trade-offs might be found between the bottom line and higher aspirations. He does not have much success.
Along the way there are smoggy exchanges about global warming, developing countries, cost-benefit analysis and political pressures. One issue mentioned now and then, some international treaty awaiting approval, remains as murky as an algae-topped lake. It might have been helpful if Michael Kinsley, the entertaining moderator, had now and then taken a moment from cracking wise to explain what was being talked about.
 
'Debates/Debates'
'Does Paula Jones Deserve Her Day in Court Now?'
PBS, tomorrow night
(Channel 25, New York, at 8)
Warren Steibel, the producer of both "Firing Line" and "Debates/ Debates," offers an appetizer tomorrow, an argument about whether President Clinton, or any President, should be discommoded by being sued while in office.
The political right, represented here by Arianna Huffington, has been chiding feminists for not being as caring toward Paula Jones, who says the President came on to her without provocation, as they were toward Anita Hill; the left, represented by Susan Estrich, has been maintaining that the Presidency must be allowed to carry on the nation's business without distraction. Ms. Huffington and Ms. Estrich have allies tomorrow night, but if you have encountered these two opinionizers before -- and they are hard for viewers of television talkies to avoid -- you will know what to expect.

Dollar Up on Japanese Data And Talk of a U.S. Rate Rise

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar rebounded yesterday from Tuesday's losses against the yen and the mark, bolstered by a modest Japanese economic report and by expectations that the Federal Reserve would again raise interest rates.
Expectations that the Japanese central bank's quarterly economic survey, called the Tankan, would show strength had helped depress the dollar earlier this week. 
 While the report, released yesterday, did show some improvement in the mood of Japanese corporations, it also pointed to insecurity about the future, leading to sales of yen. "The market was looking for more strength in the Tankan report than they got," said Dominick Presa, chief foreign-exchange dealer at Dresdner Bank.
The report's key index rose to +2 in March from -3 in the previous survey in November, the first positive reading since November 1991. But this strength contrasted sharply with the mood outside manufacturing industries, where the index plunged beyond most expectations to -6 from zero in November.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 123.25 yen, up from 121.76 yen on Tuesday. The dollar rose to 1.6765 German marks from 1.6656. It also gained against the British pound, which fetched $1.6431, down from $1.6528. The dollar was higher, as well, against most other currencies.
Also helping, dealers said, were news reports that heightened expectations of further interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve. An article in The Washington Post quoted a Fed governor, Laurence H. Meyer, as saying that the United States economy was "really strong" and suggested that recent data pointed to another rate increase in May. A report by Bridge News, the former Knight-Ridder financial service, quoting unnamed Fed informants also cited the prospect of further rate rises.
Higher United States interest rates tend to make dollar assets comparatively more attractive.
The dollar gained yesterday even as stocks again fell sharply. "I think the market got caught leaning the wrong way" after the selloff in the dollar on Tuesday, Marc Chandler, senior currency analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, said.

HEADLINE: Russia Dilutes A Treaty With Belarus, Then Signs

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 2

 BODY:
The Presidents of Russia and neighboring Belarus initialed a charter today that would pave the way for a union of the two republics.
But the charter, hastily rewritten in Moscow on the eve of the meeting, was a watered-down version of the more ambitious document on full integration that President Boris N. Yeltsin and his Belarussian counterpart, Aleksandr R. Lukashenko, had been prepared to sign. 
 The charter is not yet binding. Under pressure from liberals inside Mr. Yeltsin's Cabinet, both Presidents agreed to hold off ratification for a month, to allow public scrutiny -- as well as additional amendments by Kremlin aides intended to lessen Moscow's responsibility for its indigent neighbor.
Russia and Belarus have been negotiating closer economic and political ties since 1993. Lately, some of Mr. Yeltsin's top foreign policy advisers, including Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, had been lobbying to speed integration as a geopolitical response -- at least a symbolic one -- to the West's plan to expand NATO eastward.
But other presidential advisers worried about the huge cost to the Russian budget and market reform efforts that closer ties to Belarus's faltering and still tightly centralized economy would bring.
Mr. Lukashenko, who has spoken admiringly of Hitler and Stalin, only deepened doubts with his increasingly authoritarian behavior. He disbanded Parliament late last year when it declined to approve constitutional amendments aimed at increasing his power.
More recently, he angered Washington by expelling an American diplomat he accused of being a spy. The Belarussian President also outraged the Russian press by expelling a Russian television journalist, whose supposed infractions included his Israeli citizenship.
Russian television reported that Stanislav S. Shushkevich, a well-known democratic Belarussian politician and a former Speaker of Parliament, was detained today by security forces in Minsk, the capital.
Mr. Lukashenko's agreement with Mr. Yeltsin, intended to help Russia restore a portion of its collapsed empire, ended up serving mostly as an illustration of the growing influence inside the Kremlin of liberals loath to be too closely identified with Belarus.
After the signing, Mr. Lukashenko talked about the inevitability of unification. Mr. Yeltsin emphasized what kept the two republics apart.
"The union does not create a single state," he said. "Each side maintains its sovereignty." He noted that though economic links would be strengthened, adopting a common currency would take years, not months.
Mr. Lukashenko did not hide his disappointment that Russia had backed off at the last second from a closer union.
"Preparations for the document unfortunately did not take place without bitter opposition," he said at the signing ceremony in the Kremlin.
A predominantly Russian-speaking country of 10 million, Belarus formed, along with Ukraine and Russia, the Slavic heartland of the Soviet Union. It has neither oil nor a nuclear arsenal, but it does have a growing, if ill-defined, sense of nationalism.
In Minsk, riot police officers brutally beat dozens of demonstrators during a clash outside the Russian Embassy as thousands of other protesters marched through the capital chanting, "Independence!" to underscore their aversion to a union with Moscow.
In Russia, where polls suggest that closer ties to Belarus are more popular, the most fervent opposition was displayed inside Kremlin walls.
In a last-minute flexing of his political muscle, Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly B. Chubais and other economic reformers in the Government persuaded Mr. Yeltsin to overrule his foreign policy advisers and back away from a tighter embrace of the troublesome Belarussian President.
The Kremlin turnaround on the treaty was so quick that it took the Russian Parliament, dominated by nationalists and Communists, by surprise. Parliament had already debated and approved the earlier version, which called among other things for a supreme council -- an executive panel made up of representatives of both countries -- to make decisions affecting both republics.
Chairmanship of the council would have alternated between the Presidents of Belarus and Russia every two years, a provision that opponents painted as an invitation to Mr. Lukashenko to set policy in Moscow.
Even though they were not informed of the last-minute changes in advance, Communist and nationalist leaders praised today's agreement as a sign of progress in the move towards reunification. The leader of the Communist Party, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, called the treaty "the most sober step by President Boris Yeltsin in the last five years."

HEADLINE: New Orders To Factories Rose Again In February

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
New orders received by United States factories rose in February for the second consecutive month, the Government reported today in the latest sign of strong economic growth.
Orders rose eight-tenths of 1 percent -- to a seasonally adjusted $325.9 billion -- after an unrevised 2.5 percent gain in January, the Commerce Department said. Analysts had expected a gain of 1 percent for February. 
 The manufacturing strength in February was driven by orders for industrial machinery, electronic equipment and fabricated metals. Factory inventories, meanwhile, increased four-tenths of 1 percent in February after rising five-tenths of 1 percent in January.
"The factory sector is bubbling at an increasingly rapid pace," said Christopher Low, an economist with HSBC Securities Inc. in New York. And Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. in New York, said, "We're seeing a solid pace of order flows."
On Tuesday, a report from the National Association of Purchasing Management showed manufacturing activity strengthened in March from a month earlier to the fastest pace in two years. The purchasing managers' index rose to 55 points in March from 53.1 in February. But the report's price index fell to 50.9 points from 55.1.
"There appears to be a turnaround in the manufacturing sector, but it doesn't appear to be accompanied by any significant pickup in inflation," said Cary Leahey, senior economist at Lehman Brothers in New York.
Still, today's factory orders report heightened concerns on Wall Street that Federal Reserve policy makers would follow up last week's increase in interest rates with another tightening.
The data "could lead them to tighten in the future, if not in May then certainly in July," Mr. Moran of Daiwa Securities said. Fed policy makers meet next on May 20.
Outside of the volatile category of aircraft and other transportation equipment, orders rose 1.6 percent in February. Excluding the military industry, factory orders climbed nine-tenths of a percent in February.
By category, orders for durable goods, made to last three or more years, advanced 1.5 percent in February, as previously reported, after increasing 3.8 percent in January. Orders for nondurable goods, including food and clothing, increased a tenth of a percent in February after rising nine-tenths of a percent during January.
The Commerce Department also reported that shipments, a gauge of current demand, rose nine-tenths of 1 percent. Unfilled factory orders, a measure of pent-up demand, increased nine-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices End Mixed Ahead of Job Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices for Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, as the bond market remained concerned that continuing strength in the economy would lead to more interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/32, to a price of 94 17/32, a slight enough move that the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, remained at 7.07 percent, unchanged from Tuesday. The yield on a seven-year note rose a hundredth of a percentage point, to 6.83 percent. 
 Bonds were relatively unchanged partly because investors were unwilling to make big bets on the market's direction before the release of the unemployment report for March, which is scheduled for tomorrow.
Because recent data have sketched an outline of a robust economy, many economists have raised their expectations of the strength of the job market report. The bond market watches the monthly report closely because it is one of the best gauges of whether the economy is growing quickly enough to increase inflation, which erodes bonds' value.
A report on February factory orders, which was released yesterday, was weaker than expected, but investors largely ignored it because other economic figures have been so strong recently. Orders to United States manufacturers rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in February, the Government said. That was less than the increase of 1 percent that economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had expected. In January, orders climbed 2.5 percent.
Carroll J. Delaney, research director at Stires, O'Donnell & Company, said, "It should be fairly obvious to even a casual market observer that the bears are definitely at the controls of this train for the moment."
Jack Ablin, director of fixed income and senior fund manager at the private bank of BankBoston, said, "Just about everyone is focused on Friday's employment numbers, and I think the other thing bond investors are watching is the stock market, trying to figure out if the least Fed action will have an impact on corporate profits."
Stock prices resumed their declines yesterday after steadying the day before, with most major indexes falling more than 1 percent. The drop in stocks began after the Fed, as a pre-emptive strike against inflation, adjusted the target Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, to 5.50 percent from 5.25 percent. Banks, in turn, almost immediately raised the prime lending rate that they charge their best customers to 8.50 percent, from 8.25 percent.
Mr. Ablin said that the bond market expects the Fed to raise interest rates again, in May.
"From a strategy point of view, we are looking at this as an upgrade opportunity," he said, meaning that investors should consider investing in longer-term securities. "We think that the longer-term interest rates will be a lot more stable than the short end going foward. We could eventually see a narrowing of the yield spread between the short maturities and the longer maturities."
The Treasury said yesterday that it planned to sell $8 billion of its 10-year inflation-indexed notes on Tuesday, $1 billion more than at its initial auction of such securities in January.
Rather than issue securities with a new coupon rate, the Treasury said it was reopening the inaugural issue, which has a maturity date of Jan. 15, 2007, and a real, or inflation-indexed, coupon of 3.375 percent. The move is intended to build liquidity.
At the January auction, demand for the inflation-indexed notes exceeded supply by 5 to 1, which is about double the demand for a typical Treasury sale. Yesterday, the inflation-indexed notes traded at a price to yield 3.57 percent.

HEADLINE: Consultant Barred From Fed Meetings

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve, still smarting from the unauthorized disclosure last September of highly sensitive financial information, has acted to clear up what it called a "misunderstanding" that resulted in an outside consultant taking part in a meeting at its Chicago regional bank where classified data were discussed.
The action came after Representative Henry B. Gonzalez of Texas, a longtime critic of the Fed who is the ranking Democratic member of the House Banking Committee, complained that the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago had allowed a Northwestern University professor to participate in two policy briefings early this year. 
 The professor, Martin Eichenbaum, confirmed today that he attended the meetings and said that he had been notified that his presence would no longer be allowed. He said he had found the rules about the permitted role of consultants vague and thought that people like him had participated in policy sessions at some of the other 12 regional Federal Reserve banks.
But Joseph R. Coyne, a spokesman for the Fed, contended that the rules were clear and that Mr. Eichenbaum's experience in Chicago resulted from a "misunderstanding."
There appears to be no connection between Mr. Eichenbaum's attendance at the meetings and a highly publicized news report last year that eight district banks had requested approval from Washington to raise their discount rates. That report was widely seen as based on a leak from Chicago, prompting an inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

HEADLINE: Toyota Seeks To Halt Buying Of Dealerships By Republic

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 2

 BODY:
Toyota took legal action today to block Republic Industries from buying up its dealerships, the first attempt by an auto maker to slow the rapid consolidation of automotive retailing by publicly traded companies.
Toyota filed a petition today asking the Texas Motor Vehicle Board, a state agency that rules on disputes between auto makers and their franchises, to halt Republic's recently announced deal to acquire a Toyota dealership in Houston. But the petition was broadly worded, asking the board to affirm Toyota's position that it is not in the public interest to allow anyone to acquire a lot of dealerships quickly. 
 In addition to the Houston dealership, Republic bought a Toyota dealership in Miami at the beginning of this year and announced another deal on Monday to buy a Toyota dealership in Tempe, Ariz. James E. Press, a senior vice president for sales at Toyota, said that Republic had notified Toyota of plans to acquire 59 of its dealerships over the next 18 months, accounting for 20 percent of Toyota's nationwide sales.
Mr. Press said that Republic had not yet proved that it could run even a few dealerships, much less dozens, with the quality of customer service and repair work that Toyota requires. "They're not operating a dealership that we know of for more than four or five months," Mr. Press said in a telephone interview. "Isn't it reasonable that we would want to slow things down and see how things work before we turn over 20 percent of our volume?"
Republic, which has already become the nation's largest automotive retailer, was quick to criticize Toyota's move. "We think the action is without merit," said J. Ronald Castell, Republic's senior vice president for marketing and communications. Republic has already completed without difficulty the acquisition of a dealership in Midland, Tex., that sells Chevrolet, Buick and Mazda cars, said Mr. Castell, who declined to comment on Toyota's specific concerns.
Toyota has a policy of trying to prevent any person or company from acquiring more than one dealership every nine months. Toyota has also maintained a policy until now of barring any person or company from owning more than seven Toyota dealerships and three Lexus dealerships.
Franchise agreements with car dealers give auto makers the authority to veto the transfer of franchises to anybody the auto makers deem unsuitable. But state laws put many limits on the auto makers' ability to exercise this veto, so most dealership transfers are routinely approved. State regulatory agencies like the Texas Motor Vehicle Board administer these laws.
Auto industry officials expressed surprise that Toyota had chosen to make its stand in Texas, where the vehicle board has a reputation for siding with dealers against auto makers. Because Republic bought its second dealership in Texas less than three months after its first purchase, Mr. Press said, Toyota had to take action there.
"We're playing the hand that has been dealt to us," he said.
According to Automotive News, an industry publication, Republic reached agreements through March 20 to acquire 73 dealerships with $4.7 billion in combined 1996 sales.
Republic has already concluded broad dealership acquisition agreements with the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company and less formal arrangements with other auto makers, although not with Toyota. The agreements provide a legal framework for the auto makers to approve each acquisition quickly as they come along.
In exchange, auto executives say, Republic has promised at least some of the auto makers that it will continue to participate in regional advertising purchases with smaller, independent dealers. That limits Republic's ability to use its greater sales volume to demand better rates for advertising than its competitors can negotiate.
In a filing a month ago with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Republic also disclosed that it had agreed to sell its G.M. and Ford dealerships back to the manufacturers if a change of control occurred at Republic that either manufacturer viewed as unacceptable.
Chrysler officials have already said they will not allow any individual or company to buy more than 10 of their dealerships nationwide, more than 6 in any of the company's 25 sales regions or more than 2 in any market. Other auto makers have not disclosed any limits on the acquisition of dealerships but are widely thought to have them.
G.M. and Ford have been particularly receptive to Republic because they want to reduce the number of their dealerships. Ford has close to 90 dealerships in the Los Angeles area alone, and they tend to compete with one another instead of going after Japanese rivals. Toyota has no need or desire to reduce the number of its dealerships, Mr. Press said.
H. Wayne Huizenga, Republic's chairman, said in an interview last month at the company's headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., that Republic would be able to find economies of scale from running many dealerships.
But consumer advocates are beginning to worry about the consolidation of automotive retailing. "Consumers may end up with higher prices and fewer model choices if a significant segment of the market is controlled by Republic or any other group," said Mary Ponder, a senior projects director at the Consumer Federation of America.
Republic has been buying large dealerships with good reputations for customer service. While some big dealers have welcomed Republic's acquisitions as a chance to sell their operations for a handsome price, many smaller dealers have been worried that Republic will monopolize some markets and drive them out of business.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
When the benefits are mostly modest, what price clean air?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
CLEANER air: it's the law, but it may not always be a good idea. That appears to be the view of officials from the Treasury, the Office of Management and Budget and the President's Council of Economic Advisers, whose recently disclosed comments question the rationale for the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed air quality standards for ozone and soot.
Criticism from insiders -- notably, the council's estimate that the costs of the ozone standard would exceed the measurable benefits by at least 11 to 1 -- will likely feed Congressional efforts to block the standards, and may yet lead the White House to compromise. But win, lose or settle, the battle illustrates both the escalating stakes on environmental policy and the inadequacy of the law as a guide to how much is enough. 
 The Clean Air Act requires the E.P.A. to set maximum exposure standards for six pollutants. The standards are purely health based: the goal is to reduce exposure to the point where no one is harmed.
This sounds great, and certainly played well politically when the law was written. But the current debate suggests just how hard it is becoming to translate the wishes into rational policy. Take ozone, which can exacerbate lung diseases -- notably childhood asthma. According to the E.P.A.'s independent Science Advisory Committee, there is "no bright line" beyond which exposure is harmless to those at risk. Even natural background levels of ozone exceed the legal limit.
What to do? After pointing out that all the possible options on the table would have a very small impact on asthmatics, the board labeled the choice a "policy judgment." The current ozone standard is 120 parts per billion. Of the eight members willing to stand up and be counted, three favored a reduction to 80 parts per billion, one favored a range of 80 to 90, three favored 90 and one favored a range of 90 to 100.
The committee was equally at sea on a standard to cover soot particles ranging in size from 2.5- to 10-millionths of a meter in diameter. Their failure to find a consensus was driven by what George Wolff, the chairman, called the "many unanswered questions and uncertainties" in separating the health impact of very small particles from those of larger soot particles and the other pollutants typically found in smog.
The E.P.A.'s response to all this was better safe than sorry. While the proposed rules would relax the standards on transient spikes in pollution that are less likely to be serious health hazards, new controls would greatly increase compliance problems for relatively dirty regions, including Southern California, New York City and Houston. And they would push hundreds of counties with relatively clean air into noncompliance. Business interests, along with a number of governors, cried foul.
Denying E.P.A.'s call to virtue is no small matter, however, since few members of Congress are ready to be seen as running dogs of coal, oil and auto interests. Indeed, the proposed standards might have easily slid into the rule books were it not for the skepticism in internal Administration documents.
An analysis by the Council of Economic Advisers is particularly troubling. The E.P.A. estimated that the costs of compliance would run from $6.6 billion to $8.5 billion annually, while the benefits would be worth $51 billion to $112 billion. Alicia H. Munnell, a member of the Council of Economic Advisers, demurred.
By her estimate the costs of the ozone standard alone would run between $11.6 billion and $60 billion a year. And the benefits, she argued, would be modest, with hospitalizations for asthma in New York City falling by less than a half percent. Translating health benefits into dollars, she estimated that for the nation the annual benefits would run to less than $1 billion.
There is room for compromise, particularly on ozone: keeping the proposed standard at 80 parts per billion while lengthening the averaging period from eight hours to a full day and permitting more days of noncompliance would be no harder to meet than the current, 120-parts-per-billion standard. And while the E.P.A. has not tucked tail and run, the agency's administrator, Carol M. Browner, is quick to point out that "we haven't made a final decision."
The much bigger question here is whether Congress will ever rewrite the law, allowing the E.P.A. to weigh dollars against lives. Some day, some way, Americans will have to come to terms with the fact that they can't have it all.

HEADLINE: PATAKI TO COMMIT $100 MILLION SHARE TO A HUDSON PARK

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki has decided to commit $100 million in New York State money toward construction of a long-delayed waterfront park on crumbling piers along the heart of Manhattan's neglected Hudson River shoreline, officials said yesterday.
The $300 million Hudson River Park, conceived after the defeat of the Westway highway and development project in 1985, would lie along five miles of waterfront like green beads on a string of bicycle paths and walkways. Interspersed with open space would be commercial enterprises. 
 Disputes over proposed designs, the cost and the appropriate mix of green space and commerce have stalled action until now, with the area between Battery Park City and 59th Street remaining mostly a gloomy gap of temporary roads, parking lots, barbed wire and sagging piers.
Now, though, many longtime proponents of a waterfront park say everything is finally in place to break the deadlock. "The Governor's commitment is really the linchpin for moving ahead," said Carol Ash, the executive director of the Nature Conservancy of New York State, a private conservation group.
The $100 million contribution, which Mr. Pataki is expected to announce today, would be generated over the next six years from both the Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act and the state's Environmental Protection Fund.
Even with the pledge of state funds, a number of hurdles remain for the park plan. A draft analysis of the environmental impact of the project is scheduled to be released by the Hudson River Park Conservancy, a subsidiary of the Empire State Development Corporation later this month for public comment. The plan must also go through New York City's land-use review process and will be subject to Federal and state environmental permits before the first construction can begin -- at the earliest next spring if it is not blocked by lawsuits, according to several state officials.
Under the administrations of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Mayor David N. Dinkins, the state and New York City had each agreed to commit $100 million to the park project, which would occupy a mix of land, piers and waters controlled in part by the state and the city. But until now, only the city had formally committed money to the park. The source of the remaining $100 million has yet to be spelled out.
In his printed statement, Mr. Pataki said, "The Hudson River Park is a project whose time has come." He qualified his endorsement of the plan, saying he would reserve specific comments until a review of the environmental impact of the park plan is completed later this month. He said the remaining $100 million would come from income from leases and from private sources. Pataki administration officials declined to elaborate on the nature of the private sources.
The city's $100 million commitment is already in the budget, said David Klasfeld, chief of staff to Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro. He said the Giuliani administration looked forward to working with Mr. Pataki on creating the park. "This is a terrific project that will allow people to make the greatest utilization possible of the waterfront," he said. "We're enormously pleased that the Governor has stepped forward."
Mr. Pataki's planned announcement is to come one week after he met with the Hudson River Park Alliance, a coalition of a dozen environmental and civic groups that has pressed for the long-delayed state money since last November.
Several people who attended the meeting, which had first been sought four months ago, said Mr. Pataki told the group that the amount of retail business mixed in with green space in the latest park plan would be the most that he would support, raising hopes of some environmental groups that commercial interests would not cut into the percentage of public space in the plan.
In his prepared statement, Mr. Pataki elaborated on that pledge, saying he would create a task force, including community groups and state agencies, to insure that existing and future leases for commercial purposes in the planned park area mesh with the goal of the park -- which is to invigorate and open up the waterfront.
He also responded to another concern of community groups, saying he would order the State Transportation Department, which controls the piers and waters south of 34th Street, to account for rent received since 1982 from commercial enterprises that have occupied some piers. The money, as much as $45 million, was supposed to be devoted to park expenses, but much of it appears to have gone into other projects. Some Manhattan civic groups suspect that the money went to transportation projects in other parts of the state.
In his statement, Mr. Pataki said any past revenue that flowed elsewhere would be made up for with new payments into a dedicated account for the future park. He also proposed that income to the state from future leases go directly to park projects.
Members of the Hudson River Park Alliance hailed Mr. Pataki's support for the park, saying it could be the move that spurs action.
"The city and the state have always been a bit like Alphonse and Gaston on this," said Barnabus McHenry, the chairman of the Hudson River Valley Greenway Communities Council. "It's always been, who steps first?"
Mr. McHenry said the plan could vault New York City from a laggard on waterfront revitalization into a leader. "No city has ever built a park on piers like this," said Mr. McHenry, whose group helps coordinate shorefront revitalization from the Battery to Troy, N.Y.
But even with Mr. Pataki's support and the prospect of state money, the riverfront park still faces a host of problems, said Albert K. Butzel, a lawyer who worked on the legal challenge to the Westway plan for the riverfront two decades ago and who now heads the park alliance.
The New York State Department of Transportation has been issuing leases for so-called temporary uses of the waterfront, like the Aquamarine Restaurant, he said, that could become so entrenched that they will not easily give way to the park plan once it begins.
Mr. Butzel complained that while the state had been quick to approve commercial operations like parking lots and restaurants, it had turned down requests for interim uses of some piers and adjacent land for sports or recreation. Mr. Butzel also raised concerns about a decision by the city in 1995 to create television studio space on Pier 92 and Pier 94 at the north end of the Passenger Ship Terminal, when both had been designated for a mix of public and commercial uses. As part of that lease, the park would also lose a tree-lined four-block esplanade along the river between 52d and 54th Streets.
He said Mr. Pataki's proposed review of leases might help prevent further loss of parkland.
Mr. Klasfeld, in the Mayor's office, defended the plan for television production space. "Studios are greatly need in the city," he said. "And the park needs economic development to support itself." If a current proposal for studios fails to gel, then the city could reconsider what to do with those piers, he said.
Once reviews of the project's environmental impact are complete, with the state and city money flowing, the first phase of shorefront rehabilitation -- west of Greenwich Village -- could begin as early as next spring, Mr. Butzel said. "It's been a long wait," he added.
H. Claude Shostal, the president of the Regional Plan Association, a private urban planning group in Mr. Butzel's alliance, said the main threat to the park plan was this kind of "nibbling away."
Right now, he said, the Hudson River Park Conservancy, the state agency responsible for the plan, has no binding powers. The cut in public space on Piers 92 and 94, for example, came after an informal letter of agreement between the city and the state, with no outside review, he said.
"Even though the Governor is making an overall large commitment," he said, "unless the city and the state can work together to firmly defend this park, it could suffer incremental death, one bite at a time."

GRAPHIC: Graph/Map: "A CLOSER LOOK: Planning a Park Along the Hudson"
Gov. George E. Pataki promised $100 million for the Hudson River Park plan, which supporters hope will finally push the idea into reality. The Hudson River Park Alliance has raised concerns about the fate of several parcels:
In 1995, New York City changed its plans for Pier 92 and Pier 94 from a mix of public and private uses to a television studio complex. In the process, the park would lose a four-block-long esplanade.
Sanitation Department still has plans to build a large garage for garbage trucks at the Gansevoort peninsula, an area large enough to accommodate a complex of ball fields.
Soccer and baseball leagues in Greenwich Village sought to create ball fields on part of Pier 40, but the State Department of Transportation instead leased the entire pier for four years for parking and other commercial uses.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Gephardt Vs. Gore

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
I can't believe I'm writing this sentence, but it's true: The race for the Democratic Presidential nomination for the year 2000 is already having a profound, and unhealthy, affect on Clinton foreign policy.
Here's what's going on. One of the biggest foreign-policy questions before the Clinton Administration in its second term is: Do we want to keep expanding Nafta throughout South America, and sign more free-trade agreements with other countries around the world? 
 You'd think this was a no-brainer. President Clinton hailed Nafta as one of the great achievements of his first term, and Vice President Al Gore led the Summit of the Americas in Miami in 1994, which proclaimed free trade throughout the hemisphere as its goal. But since then, Nafta and "free trade" have become almost dirty words for the Clintonites, thanks to some foul political winds that have swirled together recently.
First, the anti-globalization movement, led by Pat Buchanan, is still with us, arguing that free trade and global integration cause stagnating wages. (Wrong. What primarily hurts lower-skilled workers is rapidly advancing technology that replaces them with machines, computers and voice mail, not free trade.) Combined with this is a growing sense that Mexico has become a drug-infested, financially strapped state and that somehow Nafta is to blame. And combined with this is a sense that China, with its human rights abuses, low wages and closed markets, is the new archenemy of American labor and should be punished. All this has put advocates of free trade on the defensive.
Now add the politics. Representative Richard Gephardt has emerged as the leading challenger to Mr. Gore in 2000. Mr. Gephardt, long a critic of Nafta, smells the new public mood. He is positioning himself to take advantage of it and to saddle Mr. Gore with the free-trade argument. Mr. Gephardt hasn't come out explicitly against more free-trade accords, but on Feb. 26 he circulated a 12-page letter to his Democratic Congressional colleagues that attaches so many labor, environmental and political conditions to any new free-trade agreements as to make them virtually impossible. Noting in his letter that "many Americans see themselves as victims, rather than beneficiaries, of recent trade agreements," Mr. Gephardt urged that Congress go slow in granting the President any new "fast-track" authority to negotiate more free-trade agreements. That's a pretty good strategy for tying up the anti-Nafta labor vote and A.F.L.-C.I.O. endorsement for 2000.
Said C. Fred Bergsten, head of the Institute for International Economics: "Gephardt is playing to the losers from globalization. He isn't playing to all those Americans working in export jobs which pay much better, not to mention the millions who benefit from low-priced imports of shoes, clothing and other attractive products. Clinton must confront this issue directly."
For now, though, the Clintonites, who are rightly focused on getting the budget passed, have been reluctant to take on this extra battle. The Administration has stopped talking about extending Nafta to Chile, which last year was considered a slam-dunk. So Chile is signing its own free-trade accords with Canada, Europe and Mexico and leaving the U.S. behind.
But the battle is coming. Congress has to decide this year whether to give Mr. Clinton fast-track authority, and that's going to really turn into a national debate on how we feel about globalization. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore should come out swinging, not ducking. At a time when the U.S. is the job-creating envy of Europe and Japan, at a time when U.S. companies dominate their European and Japanese competitors in virtually every post-industrial business -- from software to package delivery -- the U.S. has everything to gain from more free-trade agreements. Our market is already the most open, so we only gain from getting more access to others'. And there is no reason we can't accompany more free-trade accords with reasonable programs to assist and retrain the minority of lower-skilled U.S. workers who might lose jobs in the transition.
Mr. Gore's defeat of Ross Perot in the Nafta debate was politically his finest hour. He and Mr. Clinton could demolish Mr. Gephardt on this issue if they really engaged it. Without their leadership, though, the country that led the world to liberalization and market access agreements is going to end up leading the world in retreat, and we will all be poorer.

HEADLINE: Anti-Tobacco Groups Push for Higher Cigarette Taxes

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
In a drive to reverse a recent surge in teen-age smoking, anti-tobacco forces are pushing for a combination of state and Federal tax increases that could raise the cost of a pack of cigarettes by more than $1.
Buoyed by public revulsion at disclosures that tobacco companies have been aiming at teen-agers for years with sophisticated advertising and marketing techniques, advocates are lobbying for tax increases in 19 states and hope to have campaigns going in all 50 by next year. 
 Also, Congress is considering a bill introduced last month by Senators Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, to nearly triple the Federal excise tax on cigarettes, to 67 cents a pack from 24 cents.
With polls showing that a vast majority of Americans -- and even most smokers -- support raising taxes to discourage adolescents from lighting up, politicians from both parties are rushing to attach their names to that rarity, a tax rise that seems not only safe, but positively virtuous.
"Raising tobacco taxes is our No. 1 strategy to damage the tobacco industry," said John D. Giglio, manager of tobacco-control advocacy for the American Cancer Society. "The tobacco industry has found ways around everything else we have done to reduce smoking by teen-agers, but they can't repeal the laws of economics."
The anti-tobacco lobby's goal is to raise state cigarette taxes to a uniform $2 a pack nationwide in the next several years, from the current range of 2.5 cents in Virginia to 82.5 cents in Washington State.
If the Federal Government increases its tax to 67 cents as well, the average cost of a pack of cigarettes would rise to $4.23, from $1.80, as the result of the tax increases alone. That, opponents of smoking believe, would be enough to drive millions of smokers, adults and teen-agers alike, to kick the habit and dissuade hundreds of thousands of young people from taking it up.
Utah and Arkansas have already approved small cigarette-tax increases this year, and increases of as much as $1 a pack are being debated in Maryland, Alaska and Maine. Anti-smoking forces say chances are good for passage in those states and in Alabama, Hawaii, New Hampshire and perhaps New Jersey, Wisconsin and Wyoming as well. South Dakota, Virginia and Wyoming have rejected cigarette tax increases this year, but the Wyoming measure is expected to be revived.
While the number of states considering higher taxes is lower than in some previous years, both advocates and opponents of the measures say the energy and money behind the current effort make it more formidable than ever.
"Any legislator can introduce a bill," said Walker Merryman, a vice president of the Tobacco Institute, the industry trade association. "What is different is the seriousness of these efforts.
"Our industry is the subject of a coordinated, energetic campaign to raise cigarette taxes. All we can do is redouble our efforts."
The anti-tobacco forces say the campaign has strong grass-roots support. State Representative Con Bunde, a Republican who is sponsoring Alaska's bill, agrees. Three years ago, he would have got nowhere if he had pushed such a measure, he said.
"But now the debate is not about if we will raise the tax, but whether it will be a dollar a pack or $1.29," Mr. Bunde said.
Mr. Bunde, a bush pilot, said he thought the same forces that shaped the debate in his state were at work across the country.
"What changed is that Republicans went home for the election last fall and found that while generally speaking, no one likes more taxes, tobacco taxes are an exception," he said.
Opponents of smoking say they turned to the cause of higher cigarette taxes after the industry blunted efforts to limit cigarette vending machines, restrict where people can smoke and, in California and Massachusetts, broadcast government-financed anti-smoking messages intended for teen-agers. By next year, they say, they hope to have campaigns under way in every state. They expect support for their cause to grow as the result of the Liggett Group's break with the industry last month. Liggett, the maker of Chesterfields and L & M's, acknowledged that nicotine was addictive and that the industry had long picked young people as targets.
The movement to make cigarettes more expensive comes as many states, flush with budget surpluses, are considering cuts in income or sales taxes or one-time refunds. But even champions of lower taxes like the looks of this increase. In Maryland, Gov. Parris N. Glendening, a Democrat, is backing a bill to double cigarette taxes in tandem with a bill to cut state income taxes by 10 percent. Last week, Maryland legislators rejected the cigarette tax increase, but the bill could be revived this week.
"The issue the Governor is raising is, What can we do to prevent kids from starting to smoke and to get those who have started to stop?" said Ray Feldmann, a spokesman for Governor Glendening.
The two main groups behind the current drive are the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in Princeton, N.J., which has committed $100 million to anti-smoking efforts, and the American Cancer Society, which has committed $10 million. The money is being used to hire organizers, distribute voter education materials, hold conferences and take surveys. The two organizations are also the main financial backers of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, a national tobacco-control advocate.
"Legislators read polls," said Dr. Steven Schroeder, the foundation's president, "and the polls tell them that this is probably the only tax that has widespread appeal. People know it is a deterrent and that the longer you can delay kids from starting smoking, the less likely they are to become smokers."
That is a truism that the tobacco industry has long understood -- and worried about. An internal memorandum at the Philip Morris Companies from 1981 said the company should "take seriously" a statement by the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Mass., that higher Federal excise taxes could be used to reduce smoking by young people.
"It is clear that price has a pronounced effect on the smoking prevalence of teen-agers," the memorandum said, adding that the bureau's estimate that a 10 percent increase in cigarette prices would lead to a 12 percent decline in the number of teen-agers taking up smoking was "of greatest significance to the company."
Asked about the memorandum, a Philip Morris spokeswoman, Mary Carnovale, said, "We don't want kids to smoke and we want stricter enforcement of state laws, restrictions on vending machines, stopping cigarettes through the mail, stopping sampling, things of that nature."
An informal survey of teen-age smokers in New Jersey, however, suggests it will not be easy to get them to stop. At the Monmouth Mall in Eatontown, Wanda Morales, 18, of Long Branch, said a 50-cent or $1 increase would be enough to make her discard her pack-a-week habit because "I want to quit anyway." But hardened puffers said they would be more resistant. Thirteen-year-old Karl Becker of Atlantic Highlands, who started smoking at the age of 11 when a friend offered him a cigarette, conceded that $5 a pack "would make me rather upset." But, he added, an extra dollar or two would not bother him.
And in Union City, teen-agers taking lunchtime drags at a bodega two blocks from their high school said nothing could induce them to quit.
"It kills all the stress, you know?" said Robert Diaz, a 17-year-old sophomore. "It makes me feel good."
One of his friends, Mike Perez, 14, pulled a package of Djarum cigarettes out of his pocket.
"These cost $4 a pack already, but that's what I like," he said. "Those companies, you know, they make it all look so nice -- bright colors, lots of kids smiling. I just can't let my grandma find out I smoke."
In Albany, bills that would raise cigarette taxes from a nickel to a quarter per pack, with the money going to finance health care for children of the working poor, have been introduced by Democrats but are not moving toward passage.
Smoking by teen-agers had been declining for years, but that trend has reversed in the 1990's. According to annual surveys by the University of Michigan, the portion of high school seniors who indulge went up to 34 percent last year, from less than 28 percent in 1992.
Part of that increase, Mr. Giglio of the American Cancer Society said, reflects an upward swing in drug and alcohol use, but part of it results from steep price reductions on Marlboros and other heavily advertised cigarettes in 1994. The median price of a pack of cigarettes, including taxes, has fallen since 1993, a Tobacco Institute report shows, to $1.80 last year from $1.84 in 1993. Adjusted for inflation, the decline would be even greater.
Even William F. Shughart, who has served as an expert witness for the cigarette industry, said that raising cigarette taxes would reduce teen-age smoking. "They are more price-sensitive than adults," said Mr. Shughart, a senior fellow with the Independent Institute, a libertarian research center in Oakland, Calif., and the Self Professor of Economics at the University of Mississippi. He added, though, that higher taxes could not be justified because the costs to society of smoking were more than covered by existing cigarette taxes.
Mr. Merryman of the Tobacco Institute complained about the anti-tobacco lobby's embrace of popular programs to spend the extra tax money on, like mandatory kindergarten in New Hampshire.
"Who is going to say they are against kindergarten for kids?" he asked.
But Eric Gally, an organizer with the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said public awareness that cigarette companies had sought to attract children was "beginning to erode the enormous clout that the tobacco industry has in state legislatures, and it is no secret how they have gained that clout -- through decades of contributions, by hiring the best lobbyists, by wining and dining legislators, sponsoring golf outings, giving tickets to sporting events."
Most teen-agers do not smoke, and some are vocal in their distaste for tobacco. Joe Lewis, 17, a senior at Wootton High School in Rockville, Md., and a member of a local group, Students Opposed to Smoking, says bumping up taxes by a nickel or a dime would have little effect. He advocates the full shock treatment.
"If cigarette prices went up by a dollar, a lot of kids would still try cigarettes once, like I did," he said. "But the younger ones, the seventh and eighth graders, couldn't afford it and wouldn't become addicted."

Anti-smoking activists are lobbying for higher state cigarette excise taxes to discourage teen-age smoking, hoping to raise the average state tax to $2 a pack from 34 cents in the next few years. Economists say that for every 10 percent rise in the overall price of cigarettes, 12 percent fewer teen-agers will start smoking.

Officials' Doubts Grow On Saudi Held in Canada
United States officials said they were increasingly doubtful that a Saudi arrested in Canada could provide a breakthrough in the investigation of the bombing last year that killed 19 Americans in Saudi Arabia. Senior Administration officials said that it was not clear that enough evidence existed to warrant bringing the man, Hani Abdel Rahim al-Sayegh, to the United States. Canada rebuffed a request by the F.B.I. to interview Mr. Sayegh until a decision is made on whether he should be deported. A6
 
Israeli Truck Is Firebombed
A firebomb caused a truck carrying Israeli soldiers to plunge off an embankment, overturn and burn near a Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank. The driver and 12 soldiers were injured. Elsewhere, two Jewish settlers were arrested for allegedly beating a disabled Palestinian man after their car was stoned. In Gaza, the Palestinian police reportedly arrested about 30 members of Islamic Jihad, a group that claimed responsibility for attempted suicide bombings on Tuesday. A6
 
Zaire Rebels Block U.N. Airlift
United Nations officials said rebel forces in eastern Zaire had blocked their plan to airlift 20,000 to 30,000 exhausted and hungry Rwandan refugees back to their homes from Kisangani. The proposed airlift is part of a broader attempt to rescue 100,000 Rwandan refugees who fled their camps when they were overrun by the rebel forces. A5
 
Russia-Belarus Pact Signed
President Aleksandr R. Lukashenko of Belarus initialed a charter with his Russian counterpart, Boris N. Yeltsin, that if ratified will pave the way for a union of the neighboring republics. But Mr. Yeltsin heeded pressure from liberals in his Cabinet, who oppose close identification with Belarus' centralized economy and the authoritarian ways of Mr. Lukashenko, and insisted on a weaker version stressing that both countries would remain sovereign.

Famine Near in North Korea
Red Cross officials warned of imminent famine in North Korea. They said kitchens were bare, children were weak and cattle were being slaughtered to save grain. A similar report was released by the United Nations World Food Program, which said it planned to double its $41 million aid appeal for North Korea, citing fears of starvation "on a massive scale." (Reuters)
 
Crew Innocent in Ferry Sinking
The international commission investigating the sinking of the ferry Estonia, which killed 852 people in September 1994, exonerated the crew, according to Swedish radio. The commission's report instead blamed the weak construction of the boat's bow door and vehicle ramp and heavy seas. The Estonia was en route to Stockholm from Tallinn when waves ripped off the door by which vehicles entered the ship. The German company that built the ferry blamed poor maintenance. (AP)

Democrats Are Shown Coordinating With Clinton
The White House released documents showing that President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore received a constant stream of very detailed information about party fund-raising before the 1996 election. Mr. Clinton has tried to separate his campaign from the fund-raising efforts of the Democratic National Committee, but the documents show the two were closely coordinated. A1

A Republican committee is breaking fund-raising records by taking advantage of the constant disclosures about Democratic campaign finance and old fears about Communism. B9
 
Strawberries Blamed in Illness
Strawberries imported from Mexico have caused 153 cases of hepatitis A infection among schoolchildren and teachers in Michigan, Federal health officials said. Thousands more children in Arizona, California, Georgia, Iowa and Tennessee were advised to get gamma globulin shots to help prevent the viral liver ailment. A1

HEADLINE: Disney Unveils Restored New Amsterdam Theater

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
So what if Michael D. Eisner, the chairman of the Walt Disney Company, referred to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani as Mayor Cuomo? There were no hard feelings. And anyway, no less a personage than Gov. George E. Pataki reassured Mr. Eisner that the Mayor did not plan to retaliate "and refer to you as Chairman Ovitz."
It was that kind of day. In an ebullient, even frisky, news conference yesterday that displayed the unusual bond between the public sector and a private company, the three men officially unveiled the $34 million renovation of the New Amsterdam Theater on 42d Street in Times Square. 
 The New Amsterdam, an Art Nouveau playhouse that opened in 1903, had devolved into a seedy movie house by the time it closed in 1981 and started to fall into colossal disrepair. It was two years ago that Disney signed a 49-year lease on the theater with 42d Street Development Project, a state agency, and yesterday's event -- which featured an erstwhile "Phantom of the Opera," singers in white togas and waiters with trays of lobster and salmon canapes circulating among the reporters and photographers gathered on the theater's stage -- was a lavish celebration of that occasion, which Mayor Giuliani referred to as "the turning point" in the revival of Times Square.
The city and the state, which helped subsidize the renovation, presented Mr. Eisner and Disney with a plaque; Mr. Eisner, for his part, presented the Mayor and the Governor with seats that had been salvaged from the wreckage of the old theater.
But ceremony was only a small part of things; the rest, of course, was promotion. Amid the mutual backslapping -- "It sounds like we are all congratulating each other, which in fact we are," Mr. Eisner said -- came the announcement that Disney would not only hold the world premiere of its newest animated film, "Hercules." in the New Amsterdam on the evening of June 14, but that afterward, a Hercules-themed parade would take to the streets, marching east along 42d Street to Fifth Avenue and then north to 66th Street, effectively claiming midtown for the Disney Company on a Saturday night.
David Klasfeld, the chief of staff for Rudy Washington, the Deputy Mayor for economic development, said that the city's costs for the parade, about $500,000, would be paid by Disney. "It might be unusual," Mr. Klasfeld said, for a commercial entity to claim the city's streets for a promotional event, but not unheard of. After the World Series, he said, the Yankees paid for the ticker-tape parade the city held in their honor.
Marcus Lovett, one of the many past stars of "Phantom of the Opera," began the festivities with a song from "King David," a musical oratorio by Alan Menken and Tim Rice that will be the first show performed in the New Amsterdam Theater; it opens a nine-day run on May 15 with Mr. Lovett in the title role. The news conference concluded with the curtain rising to reveal the spectacularly refurbished theater, and a choir perched in the balcony, singing two songs from the stage version of "The Lion King," which Disney is to open at the New Amsterdam in the fall.
It was in the spirit of show business that the Mayor and the Governor spoke. Far more animated and off the cuff than is his wont, Mr. Pataki chided the Mayor, saying that the singers in togas -- who were all women -- must have taken a cue from his appearance in drag at the Inner Circle dinner last month. Mr. Giuliani said he could teach the singers a thing or two, noting that they weren't wearing high heels.
In his closing remarks, Mr. Eisner hit upon the real theme of the day: the allies that opportunity makes. He told a story about walking along 42d Street with the Mayor more than two years ago, when Times Square was still on the rank and seamy side. He said he expressed his reservations about bringing Disney's family-style entertainment to a street dotted with pornography parlors. Mr. Giuliani fixed him with a stolid gaze, Mr. Eisner said, and stated more than once: "Michael, they'll be gone."
"I don't know where they went," Mr. Eisner said. "Fifth Avenue?"
Mr. Pataki couldn't help himself.
"New Jersey," he said.
While the assembled reporters tittered, Mr. Giuliani reached behind Mr. Eisner's back to shake the Governor's hand, though Mr. Eisner himself seemed a bit nonplussed.
"I didn't say that," he said. "The Disney Company loves New Jersey."

HEADLINE: Stocks Resume Their Slide; Dow Drops Another 94.04

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
A late selling wave swept stock prices down for the third time in four sessions yesterday, bringing the Dow Jones industrial average to within 70 points of where it started the year.
The Dow fell 94.04 points, or 1.42 percent, to close at 6,517.01. Broader indexes slid by comparable percentages. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.53 points, or 1.25 percent, to 750.11. The Nasdaq composite index slid 15.93 points, to 1,201.00. 
 The downturn is now the most severe since early 1994, when the Dow fell 9.6 percent during a period of rising interest rates. The Dow has fallen 8 percent since March 11, when it peaked at 7,085.16.
While most analysts believe that stocks are merely going through a "correction," or a modest adjustment after a sharp run-up in prices, others believe that rising interest rates, inflationary pressures and declining corporate profitability are starting to shake the underpinnings of one of the greatest bull markets in history.
"The basic fundamentals of the bull market are eroding dramatically," said Michael Metz, the chief investment strategist at Cowen & Company, who has long been bearish on the market. "The next big nail in the bull coffin will be a shift in asset preferences away from equities."
Yesterday's selling sent 27 of the 30 component Dow stocks lower. Those included I.B.M., down 3 a share, to 133 3/4; J. P. Morgan, down 3, to 96 7/8, and the Travelers Group, which lost 2 5/8, to 47 1/4. In the last five sessions, as the Dow has lost about 3.3 percent, only one component stock -- McDonald's -- has gained ground.
Stocks of banks and financial-services companies, which many analysts believe will be hurt by higher interest rates, were hit again. The S.& P. Financials index, which is down 9 percent in the last month, lost more than 2 percent of its value yesterday. Among the biggest losers were Chase Manhattan, down 2 5/8 a share, to 92 3/8; BankAmerica, down 3 1/4, to 100 1/8, and Citicorp, down 2 1/4, to 109 7/8.
Technology issues were also hard hit. The technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 index lost 1.6 percent, in part because of drops by Intel, which was off 2 5/16 a share, to 137, and Microsoft, which tumbled 1 1/4, to 92.
Yesterday's decline, which saw the Dow fall as much as 111 points late in the session, was once again exacerbated by heavy program trading, analysts said.
According to Birinyi Associates, a market research firm in Greenwich, Conn., there were 12 large computer-driven programs yesterday that took more than 79 points off the Dow. The biggest, which came at 3:27 P.M., was the sale of about 400 stocks worth an estimated $110 million. That trade alone took about 51 points off the Dow, Birinyi said.
"It's been mostly programs," Greg Schoenleber, an analyst at Birinyi, said. "The down days recently, if you look at the net effect, it's all programs."
But analysts said that computer-driven trades are not creating a downturn, they are simply quickening its pace.
The rise in interest rates -- and the fear of further increases -- has been the primary culprit, analysts say, because of investor concerns about what effect the rise might have on corporate profits as companies are forced to pay more for loans.
The plunge in stocks accelerated last week after Federal Reserve officials raised short-term interest rates as a pre-emptive strike against inflation. Though there have been few signs of inflation, investors are worried that the Fed will slow the economy, or even send it into recession, by continuing to raise rates.
In the meantime, analysts believe that as bonds see their yields rise, they are becoming more attractive investments relative to stocks.
Since the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond reached 7 percent last Thursday -- it closed at 7.07 percent yesterday, unchanged from Tuesday -- the stock market has struggled.
Even as worries of future Fed action stifle stocks, some analysts believe that interest rates in the bond market will fall later in the year, giving rise to another rally.
"When the Fed raises rates, you usually get a knee-jerk reaction from the market," said Richard Bernstein, director of quantitative research at Merrill Lynch & Company. "And that's exactly what we got."

HEADLINE: High Schoolers Taking Longer To Graduate

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
While dropout rates are continuing to fall in New York City's high schools, more students are taking five, six or even seven years to earn a diploma or pass an equivalency exam, according to Board of Education statistics released yesterday.
The percentage of students who graduate on time has remained constant. For instance, fewer than half the students who were scheduled to graduate in 1996 did, the report said. More than 35 percent of that class were still enrolled this year, in their fifth year of high school, and 16 percent had dropped out. 
 In the class of 1986, by comparison, a similar proportion -- about 47 percent -- graduated on time. But a significantly higher percentage of that class, nearly 25 percent, dropped out, while fewer -- just 28 percent -- stayed in school beyond four years.
Board officials applauded the figures. "Staying in school longer is not a negative for many students," said Margaret Harrington, chief executive for school programs and support services. In the past, she added, students who didn't make it in four years felt stigmatized and dropped out. "We said, 'We want you to stay in school,' " she said. " 'We want you to earn a diploma. If that takes five years, it takes five years.' "
The board statistics presented the most detailed profile of the students who began ninth grade in 1989 and should have finished in 1993. Just under 50 percent graduated in four years, while nearly 63 percent finished high school by the end of the fifth year. By the end of the seventh year, more than 70 percent had earned a diploma or passed an equivalency exam: the highest overall graduation rate since the board began tracking the numbers in 1986.
Robert Berne, the vice president for academic affairs at New York University, who has written extensively about the city schools, said that nationally, dropout figures appear to have stabilized, in part because of curricular changes and reform efforts that were started years ago but have now begun to yield results. Given the large pool of poor and immigrant students in New York, he said, the increase in graduation rates over all, he said, ought to be commended.
"The fact that students are finishing, in the end, is the important part of the equation," he said. "While there might be some disappointment citywide that it's not in the traditional four years, it still speaks highly of a system, given our diversity -- language, income and the like -- that graduation rates are going up. In the end, it's what people learn and not how fast they learn it."
Dr. Harrington, the former Queens high school superintendent, said that students were taking longer because many of them entered high school "over age and under prepared in reading and mathematics." In the 1995-96 school year, about a third of all 9th- and 10th-grade students in the city were older than the norm, 14 for freshmen and 15 for sophomores. Moreover, 15 percent of all high school students were classified as speaking limited English and 17 percent had arrived in the United States in the previous three years, according to the school-by-school report cards released yesterday.
Immigrant students actually graduated on time in slightly greater percentages than their native-born peers in the class of 1996: 51 percent of immigrants who came into the school system in middle school graduated from high school in four years, compared with 48 percent of non-immigrant students. Their dropout rate was also lower: 13 percent, compared with 17 percent among the native-born.
But limited-English speakers took longer to graduate, and a greater share of them dropped out. In the class of 1996, nearly 50 percent of English-speaking students graduated on time, while 41 percent of limited-English students who entered the school system before ninth grade finished on time. Board officials said that schools would have to offer at least three periods of English instruction in addition to the other academic subjects to raise their graduation rates, but that not enough money was available.
In the 1995-96 school year, the city spent nearly $1 billion of its $8.2 billion budget on the high schools, or $6,831 per student.
As in the past, graduation and dropout rates were marked by racial and sexual disparities. In the class of 1996, for instance, 53 percent of the girls graduated on time, compared with 43 percent of the boys. In the same class, nearly 70 percent of white students and 64 percent of Asians graduated on time, while only 38 percent of Hispanic and 44 percent of black students finished in four years. Ten percent of white students and eight percent of Asians dropped out, compared with nearly 22 percent of Hispanic students and 17 percent of black students.
At Murry Bergtraum High School for Business Careers in lower Manhattan yesterday, Sateima Powell, 17, discussed the quandary she had faced over staying in school or dropping out. Ms. Powell, a junior, had spent much of her sophomore year skipping and then failing her classes. She straightened out, she said, because she did not want to stay in school forever. "I'm just doing what I got to do," she said.
Down the street, Iris Romero, a 16-year-old sophomore, was doing what Ms. Powell regrets having done: skipping class and soaking up the sun. Many students drop out as sophomores, Ms. Romero said, because classes are boring and the outside world alluring. Even so, Ms. Romero and her friend, Patty Curo, a sophomore on her lunch break, said they would stick it out. "I want to stay in school, but I wish they would make it fun," Ms. Romero said.
Besides, said Ms. Curo as she sucked on a red lollipop, the economics of a high school diploma were clear. "I don't want to get a G.E.D. and work at McDonald's," she said.
In addition to dropout rates, the reports released yesterday showed that more ninth-grade students were passing the Regents examination in math: nearly 24 percent in the 1995-96 school year, compared with under 20 percent two years ago. Ninth-graders passing the Regents test in science also increased to 18 percent in the 1995-96 school year from 15 percent two years ago.
Those figures are increasingly important as state and city officials raise the high school graduation requirements. The bar has already been raised in recent years: students now have to complete three, instead of two, classes in math and science. In 1995, Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines eliminated low-level arithmetic classes and required Regents-level math courses of all high school students. And starting this year, all students must take a Regents-level English class.

HEADLINE: OPERA REVIEW;
The Appeal Of Modest Durability

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN 

 BODY:
One line of thinking advanced by the new production team at the New York City Opera is to stage standard repertory works less expensively than in the past so that the productions can be discarded and restaged more often. Operagoers who find it difficult to imagine some of the company's stagings becoming even less elaborate may find this alarming; yet its presentations of contemporary operas, mounted inexpensively because the prospect of their return was slim, have shown that inventiveness can be had on a tiny budget. And there is much to be said for the flexibility this approach can offer.
The alternative, after all, is for the company to continue to build durable but conventional productions meant to last decades. Harold Prince's 1989 staging of Mozart's "Don Giovanni," now at the New York State Theater, is one of those. Neither objectionable nor fresh and insightful, it is a good, basic "Don Giovanni" that strives to be nothing more. 
 The sets and costumes, by Rolf Langenfass, are attractive in their modest way and undoubtedly economical. Leafy trees frame the set, and a collection of pedestals is reconfigured for each scene, with flown-in elements (a bridge, for instance) and backdrops suggesting, however vaguely, Mozart's 13 changes of location. Albert Sherman, the stage director, moves the singers around the set with sensible efficiency, and Guido Ajmone-Marsan, who conducted on Wednesday evening, moved the production along briskly.
The singing was never less than serviceable but only intermittently better. Robert Perry was a frustratingly uneven Don. When he sang in his lower range, his singing was wonderfully rounded and full of character. But in the role's more lyrical moments -- in "La ci darem la mano" or "Deh, vieni alla finestra," for example -- his intonation and phrasing were slightly clumsy. There was, however, some admirable teamwork between Mr. Perry and Herbert Perry (no relation), whose vocally solid, comically agile portrayal of Leporello was a highlight of the performance.
Amy Johnson, who made her company debut as Donna Anna, has a lot going for her in terms of sheer vocal power, and if her soprano edged toward stridency on occasion, she mostly produced an attractive, well-focused sound. She also played Donna Anna more sympathetically -- that is, less icily -- than is typical. As her paramour, Don Ottavio, Mark Thomsen made all the right phrasing moves, but his constricted sound limited the warmth of his portrayal.
Deanne Meek's Zerlina was sweet-toned and graceful, and Jeff Morrissey, in his company debut, was a dramatically and vocally flexible Masetto. Oksana Krovytska was a fine Donna Elvira. Jonathan Prescott, in another debut, was a little awkward in his sword fight with the Don but delivered the Commendatore's lines in the finale with a suitable gravity and depth.

Under the Waves Again
In World War II, German U-boats sent merchant vessels to the bottom of the North Atlantic and occasionally retreated there themselves to escape depth charges. On the surface, survivors fought for their lives. At 800 feet, rivets popped, air was scarce, toilets were taxed, and 21-year-olds turned into old men in a grinder of depression and fear. 
 One of the more memorable antiwar films, Wolfgang Petersen's "Das Boot" ("The Boat") does as realistic a job as one can imagine of documenting life aboard a U-boat. The film, which was released in 1982, has been restored, with an hour added to its already formidable 145-minute length. (In its earliest incarnation, the movie was a 6 1/2-hour television show.) It opens today in New York and will play in 13 other cities. For that, there is home video to thank. "We had Petersen here working on 'Air Force One' with Harrison Ford," said Ben Feingold, the president of Columbia Tri-Star, the studio's video division. "We figured he could do a director's cut of 'Das Boot' at the same time."
Lured by the current "Star Wars" phenomenon, studios and their video divisions are increasingly looking to their libraries for a revenue-producing one-two punch, of big-film revivals in theaters that then do double duty in video reissues.
The longer "Das Boot" will be released on tape in the next few months. In the process, Mr. Feingold added, the studio is also cleaning up a venerable property for digital video disk and eventually digital television.

 
 
Familiar Tale Retold
 Cinderella has roamed home video in a panoply of animated and live-action guises, but no glass slipper ever slid on more opportunely than it has for "A Tale of Cinderella," a musical mounted by the New York State Theater Institute that is to be released on tape by Warner on April 15.
After taking a student production to Moscow in 1974, the institute, which is based in Troy, N.Y., received public financing to stage plays and musicals and send instructors and repertory actors into schools to work with students.
In the 1980's that led to "His Honor, the Mayor," a musical about Fiorello La Guardia that the institute produced with the public television station WNET. The show won five Emmys and was staged on Broadway, where the reviews were lukewarm, but, thanks to some hard-nosed economizing, investors got their money back.
"We went in there with low overhead," said Patricia Di Benedetto Snyder, the institute's director. Equally important, the show attracted Warner/Chappell Music, the music publisher, which in 1994 provided $400,000 to produce five musicals.
The first of these is "A Tale of Cinderella," a good-looking, award-winning rendering of the tale. Warner Home Video will share revenues with the institute. It's not Disney, but it is a money-raiser. "We won't hit with all five productions," Ms. Snyder said, "but it is funny it happened to a property called 'Cinderella.' "

Dollar Falls vs. Mark and Yen Ahead of Report on U.S. Jobs

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the mark and the yen yesterday after the release of strong German economic data and a report from the International Monetary Fund that said the yen had room to rise.
Nervousness ahead of American employment data for March and meetings between Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and top Japanese Government officials today also weighed on the dollar. 
 "The market is very afraid about whether Rubin will say more about trade in Japan and we're also cautious ahead of the nonfarm payrolls number on Friday," said Bob Near, a vice president on the corporate foreign exchange desk at the Bank of New York.
The currency market has been preoccupied for much of the week with United States concern about the size of Japan's trade surplus with the United States, which has risen in part because of the dollar's two-year rise against the yen. This has made Japanese goods more affordable in the United States.
In New York, the dollar settled at 122.65 yen, down from 123.25 on Wednesday. The dollar cost 1.6685 marks, down from 1.6765. The British pound cost $1.6464, up from $1.6431.
Strong German industrial output figures for February were behind the mark's strong performance. German production, driven by manufacturing strength and a seasonal rebound in construction, rose 1.9 percent in February from January and by 7.1 percent from February 1996.
The dollar weakened against the yen after release of an International Monetary Fund paper scheduled to be presented at a meeting of finance officials from the Asia-Pacific region over the weekend.
The report said that the yen's depreciation since reaching post-World War II highs in early 1995 had corrected misalignments, but also said that some of the yen's fall could be reversed. "The I.M.F. comments gave the market an excuse to sell the dollar against the yen," said Hillel Waxman, chief foreign exchange dealer at the Bank Leumi Trust Company of New York.
Over all, however, Mr. Waxman said that trading was fairly subdued ahead of today's March jobs report, which is expected to clarify prospects for another interest rate increase.

A good omen? Chief executives are holding on to their options.

BYLINE: By Judith H. Dobrzynski 

 BODY:
THE stock market has been nothing if not jittery in the last few weeks. But here is a positive omen that might comfort nervous investors: Most chief executives, loaded with stock options granted in the last several years, decided to exercise few, if any, during 1996. They passed up sure gains from the market's stunning 1996 rise, and took their chances on the ride in 1997 and beyond.
Consider George M. C. Fisher, the chief executive at Eastman Kodak, whose company's stock has plummeted by more than 20 percent in recent weeks in reaction to Kodak's flattened sales so far this year. At the end of 1996, Mr. Fisher could have used options to make a $27.6 million profit. Instead, he held on to all of them. 
 The actions of chief executives who did the opposite -- unlike their peers, cashed in a lot of options -- might be equally telling. They include Alan F. Shugart of Seagate Technology, who emptied his till of options and took a $7.3 million gain, and Norman R. Augustine of Lockheed Martin, who took 81 percent, or $20.3 million, of his possible gain.
Individuals have their own reasons for choosing whether or not to exercise options, of course. They may need cash to buy a new house or a painting. But the message sent by the collective action of the chief executives at 215 large companies can be read as a measure of confidence in their companies. Of all the options they could have cashed in, the median portion they chose to exercise was a mere 6 percent, according to an analysis by Graef Crystal, a pay expert based in San Diego.
The average gain from options among those 215 chief executives is higher -- 16.9 percent of the total gain possible if every option available had been exercised, Mr. Crystal calculated. That figure is up, from 11.7 percent in 1995 and 14.2 percent in 1994. But the average gain for 1996 is down significantly from what it was earlier in the 1990's -- 39.3 percent of the possible total gain in 1992 and 45.9 percent of total possible gain in 1993 -- when the stock market's outlook was not as bullish.
Before taking too much heart from these statistics, though, investors need to consider a few caveats. Compared with insider trading -- purchases or sales on the open market -- options trading is not as good a market indicator. Executives usually have plenty of time to use options, so much of the downside stems from leaving money from bigger gains on the table, rather than losing money used to buy stock. Most people who have options, experts say, exercise them too early, and financial advisers regularly tell clients to hang on longer.
"But," Mr. Crystal noted, "if the stock drops below the strike price, and stays there, option holders lose the whole thing." The difference between the strike price -- the price at which options are awarded -- and the exercise price represents the profit.
Taxes are another consideration. To avoid tying up money, option holders usually buy and sell the stock simultaneously. If they do, or if they buy and hold for less than a year, the gain is taxed at the ordinary income rate, which is about 40 percent for most chief executives.
"The gain is pretax, but an individual can only reinvest the after-tax sum," said Mikel M. Rollyson, a tax expert and former Treasury Department official who is a managing director at Morgan Stanley. If the stock is held for more than a year, any profit above the initial gain is taxed at the lower rate for capital gains.
Nonetheless, if an executive believes that his company's stock is going to plunge, on its own or with the market, he may lock in some profits. "Most C.E.O.'s have confidence in their companies," Mr. Rollyson said. "Personally, I think it would be a good time to diversify."
And some chief executives may be doing that. A look at the proxy statements of several companies showed several chief executives in the same camp as Mr. Shugart of Seagate. Charles R. Shoemate at CPC International cashed in 100 percent of his options for a $3 million gain, as did Drew Lewis at Union Pacific, with a $14.3 million gain, Hans Becherer at Deere & Company, with a $2.1 million gain, and James B. Williams at the Suntrust Bank with a $1.6 million gain.
Not far behind are two chief executives who exercised 94 percent of their available options: Arnold G. Lanbo of Kellogg, who made a $1.5 million profit, and Peter I. Bijur of Texaco, who took a $2 million gain.
John H. Bryan Jr. of Sara Lee exercised 88 percent of his available options for a $3.5 million gain, and Donald B. Marron of Paine Webberexercised 78 percent of his options for an $11.2 million gain.
Many corporate chieftains besides Mr. Fisher exercised none of their options, even though their payoffs could have been big. They come from many sectors of the economy and from companies whose futures may not be easy. They include Edward R. McCracken at Silicon Graphics, who could have pocketed $33.1 million; W. J. Sanders 3d at Advanced Micro Devices, with a potential profit of $17.3 million; Paul B. Fireman at Reebok, $60.3 million; Charles R. Schwab at Charles Schwab, $28.8 million; William W. McGuire at United Healthcare, $36.4 million; Roger A. Enrico at Pepsico, $12.5 million, and Arthur C. Martinez at Sears, Roebuck, $7.2 million.
Some chief executives seem to be hedging, by taking a few gains. Among them are Harvey Golub at American Express, who cashed in 10 percent of his options for a $3 million gain; Lawrence A. Bossidy at Allied Signal, who exercised 16 percent of his options for a $7 million profit, and Paul H. O'Neill at the Aluminum Company of America who used 58 percent of his options for a $6.1 million gain.

Government Securities Prices Remain Mixed for a Second Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Government securities prices remained mixed for a second session yesterday, as investors waited for today's report on unemployment to see whether the risk of another interest rate increase should be priced into bonds.
The Federal Reserve moved to raise rates last week after strong economic reports, in an effort to head off inflation. If the employment numbers for March are strong, the Fed may be more likely to continue tightening monetary policy. 
 Traders said Treasury bills, the securities with the shortest maturities, were most strongly bid yesterday after the Fed went into the market to buy bills of several maturities. The move, known as a bill pass, was intended to permanently add $4 billion in reserves to the banking system. Though that did not signal any change in monetary policy, the prices of bills were up substantially because of the move.
But the 30-year bond was unchanged at a price of 94 17/32 to yield 7.07 percent, while the yield on a two-year note fell to 6.37 percent from 6.39 percent. Yields and prices move in opposite directions.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said predictions about the number of nonfarm jobs added to payrolls, the most closely watched figure in the employment report, "are all over the lot, ranging from a modest rise of 100,000 to another sharp gain of 300,000."
"An increase of 240,000 or more will clearly be strong and disturb an already unsettled bond market," he said. "Whereas a considerably more moderate rise of say, 150,000, is likely to produce a favorable, though tempered, reaction simply because first-quarter employment growth will still be quite substantial."
Furthermore, he said, it would be difficult to determine whether a weaker-than-expected payroll number implies a trend or simply a partial offsetting of the strong growth seen in January and February.
And while the payroll number is the most closely followed, he said, market reaction is also highly influenced by other components of the report, including the unemployment rate, average hourly earnings and the index of aggregate hours worked.
"The unemployment rate, currently at 5.3 percent, is generally expected to drop a notch to 5.2 percent, which would make the Fed and the bond market squirm a bit," he said.
Hugh Whelan, vice president and portfolio manager at Aeltus Investment Management Inc. in Hartford, predicted that the payroll number would come in on the strong end of the range of predictions, at about 250,000 to 300,000 new jobs.
If that is the case, he said, short- sellers, who sell borrowed securities in the hope that they can later buy them back and make a profit, will feel no pressure to cover their short positions, contributing to the market's downward trend.
"Bulls may have to wait a while for the softer economic and/or inflation data they need so badly," he said.
Mr. Whelan said that if the report showed a strong gain in payrolls, a drop in the unemployment rate and a gain in hourly earnings, the yield on the long bond might soon reach 7.20 percent.

HEADLINE: In America;
Bogeyman Economics

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
God help us, there's a chance the unemployment rate will ultimately fall below 5 percent.
Can you imagine worse news? 
 The abject fear that this has engendered was captured in the lead story in The Washington Post on Wednesday. You could almost hear the knees of financial analysts knocking as you read that the Federal Reserve will probably have to raise interest rates again next month if this rampaging monster of an economy doesn't hurry up and slow down.
The Post story said: "The surge in growth, which began late last year and surprised both Fed officials and private forecasters by continuing undiminished into this year, is strong enough that it could soon drive the nation's jobless rate below 5 percent for the first time in nearly a quarter century, the analysts warned."
Warned. This news comes as a warning. It's as if the nation were faced with the threat of a cure for cancer. Be on the alert: Prosperity for the jobless is just around the corner. We have no choice but to confront it, turn it around and chase it out of the neighborhood altogether. In short, we have to get the unemployment rate up.
Inflation is the bogeyman. No one has seen it in several years, but the mere thought that at any moment it might spring back to life -- the financial markets' very own Freddy Krueger -- is enough to keep the well-heeled on constant edge.
"Not only do we have to stop inflation when it happens, but the Greenspan position is that we have to anticipate it and stop it before it starts," said Robert Borosage, co-director of the Campaign for America's Future, a progressive advocacy group.
Whatever motives are driving Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, the result is a brutal Catch-22 for the nation's working classes. The route to a brighter future for most men and women -- raises for those already working, and increased employment opportunities for those who want to work -- is economic growth. There is a consensus on the left and the right that growth is the answer to the persistent and potentially dangerous problem of economic inequality. The top 20 percent of Americans get nearly half of all the income. Fifty percent of American families have less than a thousand dollars in financial assets.
For a majority of Americans to do better, an expanding economy is essential. And yet, whenever there is evidence of anything beyond an anemic rate of growth, the policy is to step in and ruthlessly head it off. The effect is to slam the workplace door on millions of men and women in the bottom half, and especially the bottom fifth of the socioeconomic scale.
For those who think the so-called experts are doing anything other than flailing about in a theoretical thicket, consider their track record. These nattering nabobs of Nairu (the acronym for the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment) have for the longest time been trying to pinpoint the lowest level of unemployment the economy can sustain without triggering an acceleration of inflation. In other words, without raising Freddy from the dead.
For a while it was thought that the official unemployment rate had to remain above 6 percent to keep inflation still. But the jobless rate came down, broke the 6 percent barrier and nothing happened. The theory had to be adjusted. Perhaps 5.8 percent was the magic figure. Wrong. Unemployment fell through that barrier without a peep from inflation. Well, maybe 5.5, or 5.3, or 5.2.
There is still no evidence of accelerating inflation. But there is plenty of evidence that an awful lot of people are in need of jobs and can't get them. The Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan placed ads in local newspapers last month seeking applicants for 700 positions. More than 4,000 men and women showed up. The line of eager applicants stretched for many blocks.
And already there is evidence that the working poor are being forced into a cruel head-to-head competition with welfare recipients for precious low-wage jobs. Eventually more than four million welfare recipients will be sent into the job market.
The policy makers are masters of obscurity on the crucial issue of employment. For those at the bottom who are desperate for work, an honest look at current economic policies is a glimpse into the abyss.

HEADLINE: Layoffs Stun Bakery Staff At Melba Toast Company

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
When Reese Grosett went to his bakery production job Wednesday at CPC Specialty Foods, the country's leading manufacturer of Melba toast, he noticed his name on a freshly printed list of about 45 names posted on a wall.
It announced that today would be his last day in the job. 
 "There was no warning, nothing," said Mr. Grosett, 32, who has worked at the Bronx factory on Eastchester Road for nine years. "They just put up the list. I'm still in shock."
He was not alone in his surprise. Yesterday, as word got out about the layoffs -- mostly in the bakery production department, and starting with those lowest in seniority -- senior company executives paid an unexpected visit to announce that the company's $26 million-a-year Melba toast and flat breads business was for sale. The division includes the brand names Old London, Devonsheer and JJ Flats.
Gale Griffin, vice president of corporate communications at CPC International in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., said that the layoffs and the sale were not connected: the layoffs were seasonal, and the company hoped to sell the business to someone who would continue producing Melba toast. But the official line failed to quell the concerns of the 150 or so remaining employees, who said they feared that the two actions presaged the closing of another manufacturing facility in the city.
So yesterday, the employees, through United Industry Workers Local 424, appealed to city officials for help. "We're going to make every attempt to keep them in the Bronx," said Clint Roswell, a spokesman for the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer.
Charles Millard, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, said: "The city had previously reached out to CPC to discuss how we could help keep these 200 jobs in the Bronx. Unfortunately, the company has not yet met with us to discuss the many resources we have available and have explained to them. Of course, we will do everything we can to keep these jobs right where they are."
The mere possibility that manufacturing jobs could be lost is a sensitive one in a borough that has been trying to bounce back in recent years. There have been successes, like the renaissance of the South Bronx; there have been disappointments, like the closing of the Farberware plant -- which is down the road from the CPC factory -- last year.
CPC hopes to sell the squat, white-brick factory, which it has owned since 1987 but which has been around since 1968, within a month, Ms. Griffin said. The Melba toast business has been profitable, but the company felt that "the business will be better served by a strategic buyer who can devote the resources and attention to further grow its sales and profits," according to a company statement.
The sale is part of a strategy under which the $10 billion company will focus more on its core businesses, which include soups, sauces, bouillons and such brand names as Hellmann's and Skippy, Ms. Griffin said.
But this explanation did not sit well with employees. By afternoon, as the smell of toast spread into the parking lot, some of the workers who had had a chance to assess the situation were clearly not happy.
"I asked them, 'Why did they wait so long to tell us?; What's going to happen to us?' " said Iris Garcia, a bakery production worker whose name was on the list. "I didn't get a good answer, and now I'm worried."
For many employees, the factory, where jobs pay about $10 to $18 an hour, has been like another member of the family: about 80 percent of the employees are Hispanic, many are women, and many have worked there for 10, 20 or 30 years, said Frank DeFilippi, area director of United Industry Workers Local 424.
"That's what makes this tough," he said.

Under the Cairo Sun, the Leaden Skies Can Kill

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: SHUBRA EL KHEIMA, Egypt

 BODY:
Just upwind from downtown Cairo, the air on the dirt streets here is so thick with smoke that even the sheep have been blackened by soot. But a greater danger lies unseen: airborne lead in concentrations of up to 30 times the world health standard.
Part of the district is known as the Green City, but only out of nostalgia. From Dickensian factories manned by grimy men, what wafts southward is a toxic cocktail that by most estimates shaves four points from the I.Q. of the average Cairo child. 
 Under a 1994 law, such pollution is patently illegal. But the law has yet to take effect, so smelters still operate virtually without restriction less than 10 miles from the center of one of the world's most densely populated cities. They produce thousands of tons of lead each year from discarded car batteries that are imported in vast heaps from Europe and around the Middle East.
Attempts to catalogue pollution in Cairo produce a long list led by garbage, sewage and industrial dust. But almost everyone agrees that lead is by far the most worrisome, so ubiquitous in what people eat and drink and breathe that studies have found its concentration in the average person's blood to be higher than in any other city in the world.
Until recently, every one of the half-million cars that clog the capital burned highly leaded gasoline, and most researchers assumed that they bore principal responsibility for the problem, which the United States Agency for International Development has said is probably responsible for more than 800 infant deaths and more than 6,000 deaths from cardiovascular illness every year.
But more precise efforts to monitor air quality have found that at least half the responsibility lies with the smelters in places like Shubra el Kheima, where industry and residents share quarters with a heedlessness common across Greater Cairo.
"I think it could cause some illness," said Khalid Abdel Tawab, 26, a grimy-faced worker. He was eating a lunch bought from an outdoor stand across the street from a factory where batteries are sawed open and their innards melted in ovens to separate the lead.
Even at levels far lower than those present in the factory and its surroundings, experts say, lead causes significant health problems, most conspicuously by retarding brain development in children and, in adults, increasing the likelihood of strokes.
But Mr. Abdel Tawab, who works 10 hours a day, 6 days a week, for about $120 a month, insisted that he had not suffered any health problems in his 12 years on the job. He spoke with the kind of fatalism that has often made Egyptians slow to address health hazards. "I may start coughing in the future," he said. "Only Allah knows, and if it happens, it will be the will of Allah."
Until the late 1970's or so, the district's roads led only to agricultural fields along the Ismailia canal, and in an afternoon of conversations, many people complained about what has replaced the farms. The factory smoke stings the eyes, clogs the chest and, they said, produces so much soot that walls must be repainted three times a year.
But few knew anything about the dangers of lead, confirming a recent finding of researchers at the American University in Cairo.
About one-fourth of Egypt's 62 million people live in Greater Cairo, most of them packed into an area no more than 10 miles across. But even more stunning is how heavily the country's polluting activities are now concentrated in and near the capital city, where they account for about 41 percent of Egypt's thermal electric generating capacity, 48 percent of the country's motor vehicles, and a full 64 percent of industry.
With so many people and so much pollution in so small a space, experts say, the lead is present not only in the air in most quarters of the city, but also in food and water. And in part because no more than an inch of rain falls in an average Cairo year, the concentration of lead in some playground dust has been measured at levels that would qualify as contaminated at an American hazardous waste site.
In recent months, Egypt's Ministry of Petroleum has stopped adding lead to gasoline in most of its refineries, substituting a safer additive to provide an octane boost.
With the support of the Agency for International Development, the Government wants either to move or clean up the country's two major lead smelters, including the operations in Shubra el Kheima owned by Sayed Awadallah, which churn out 30,000 tons a year of lead pipe, lead sheets and lead ingots.
But so far, the effort has been stalled by a tension that runs through most environmental protection efforts in Egypt and is typified by the fact that the Environment Minister, Atef Obeid, is also Minister of the Public Sector, and thus oversees the state-owned enterprises that are among the heaviest polluters.
The environmental law approved in 1994 is not due to take effect until 1998, and even then companies deemed to have tried hard to meet new standards can win three more years' grace. And while the new anti-lead plan calls for Mr. Awadallah's factories to be transplanted outside the capital, his sons make clear that they are in no mood to pack up and leave.
They have demanded the right to continue importing old batteries, even though the environmental law lists them as hazardous waste. And even if they are helped to start up new, cleaner operations elsewhere, they have insisted that the factories in Shubra el Kheima will definitely stay in place.
"This is an industrial province," said Abdelnabi Awadallah, one of the sons, who said the installation of basic filters in the factories three years ago showed that the family was already doing its share to reduce emissions.
"There are 1,500 factories, and I doubt any of them have done as much," he said. "Why should we have to pack up and leave just because we make lead?"

HEADLINE: Slight Rise Posted In Jobless Claims

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3

 BODY:
More Americans applied for state unemployment benefits last week, Government figures showed today, but the fact that claims have held fairly steady suggested that the United States job market remained tight.
First-time jobless claims rose by 1,000, to a seasonally adjusted 314,000 in the week ended last Saturday, the Labor Department said. Analysts had expected an increase of 2,000 new claims. 
 That claims have held steady is "a cue that we're not getting any slackening in the labor market," said David Munro, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics Ltd. in Valhalla, N.Y.
Last week's increase comes after a revised 1,000 drop in claims, to 313,000, for the previous week, initially reported as a drop of 4,000. The four-week average for new claims, a less volatile measure of employment conditions, rose to 312,500 from 312,000.
Both new claims and the four-week average have remained below 320,000 for eight weeks in a row, the longest stretch under that level in eight years.
"The only question is how long will it be before we see significant wage increases," said Lynn Reaser, the chief economist of Barnett Banks Inc. in Jacksonville, Fla., and whether the Fed will act again soon to push up short-term interest rates.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
From Offices to Apartments in Lower Manhattan

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Leasing has begun at the first two major office buildings being converted to apartments in downtown Manhattan, bringing the vision of turning the area into a 24-hour community one step closer to reality.
Together, the projects are bringing a total of 780 studio to four-bedroom rentals onto the market. 
 A rental office opened on Tuesday at 45 Wall Street, which is being converted into 435 apartments. The $75 million conversion of the 28-story building, spanning the blockfront on William Street from Wall Street to Exchange Place, is being done by the Rockrose Development Corporation, an experienced Manhattan converter and developer, with Whitehall Street Limited Partnership, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Company.
Occupancy is expected to begin sometime in June, said Kevin P. Singleton, vice president and general manager at Rockrose.
Leasing is also under way at the 21-story building at 25 Broad Street at Exchange Place, though the official opening is set for May. It is being turned into 345 apartments at a cost of about $55 million by Crescent Heights Investors, a Miami-based concern that has converted 6,000 units, mostly in South Florida.
Occupancy of the rentals at 25 Broad Street, which marks the company's first foray into Manhattan, will start in August, said Russell W. Galbut, its chief executive officer.
While the projects are the first large-scale conversions ready for leasing, several other conversions are also under way. Since New York City's Lower Manhattan Revitalization Plan was enacted in October 1995, about 2,600 apartments in 17 buildings have been planned and are in various stages of development, according to the Alliance for Downtown New York, the local business improvement district.
Among the incentives that are part of the city's revitalization plan are a 14-year phased tax abatement program for the conversion of office buildings to housing. Zoning changes include reducing the minimum unit size in older buildings to an average of 900 square feet, from 1,800. Projections are that a total of 7,000 units will be created downtown through the year 2002, when the incentives end, said Carl Weisbrod, president of the alliance.
Financing for 45 Wall Street came from the Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company and the partners' own equity. For 25 Broad Street, it came from Ullico, the Washington-based labor union fund in cooperation with CS First Boston.
Both have started leasing at a time when Manhattan's rental market is tight. Because of that, along with offering large apartments at rents that are expected to be 20 percent lower than those in established uptown locations, the projects are likely to draw tenants quickly, brokers said.
The building at 45 Wall Street was built in 1959 as offices for the Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company and U.S. Trust. Last June, Rockrose bought the empty building from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, betting, Mr. Singleton said, that "there will be a burgeoning residential neighborhood downtown." Since then, the company has acquired 127 John Street, which it expects to convert to 576 apartments.
The conversion of 45 Wall Street, now more than 90 percent complete, will result in studio to four-bedroom apartments with 575 to 1,800 square feet on average. Some will have outdoor terraces provided by the natural setbacks of the wedding-cake-style building. Initial rents average $1,390 to $3,200 a month.
Most of the units will be studios and one-bedrooms "for the urban professionals we are targeting and believe will want to live close to where they work," Mr. Singleton said.
Twenty-five percent of the apartments have been designed as live-work spaces and 20 to 25 percent more will be marketed as corporate rentals. Amenities will include a golf driving range and putting green, a fitness center, two conference rooms and garage parking for 75 cars. There will also be Club 45, where tenants can gather or conduct meetings. Two apartments have already been leased, Mr. Singleton said.
At 25 Broad Street, the Italian Renaissance building that was built in 1897 as the headquarters of Paine Webber, the newly fashioned apartments will be mostly one- to three-bedroom units with luxury finishes and 10- to 15-foot-high ceilings. On average, the apartments will range in size from 800 to 2,400 square feet and initially rent for $1,750 to $4,800 a month.
"Our concept is to give people who could only afford rents of $1,700 to $1,800 the feeling of living in a white-glove building," said Bruce A. Menin, president of Crescent Heights, the developer. The original marble-clad lobby will be kept intact.
The three-bedroom units have been designed as live-work units and, at this point, "our concept is to have no more than 15 to 20 percent of the units" as corporate rentals, Mr. Menin said. Among the amenities planned are a health club, business center and storage space and laundry rooms on each floor. So far, leases have been signed on eight apartments.

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales In March Highest In Eight Years

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 3

 BODY:
Despite a decline at the Ford Motor Company, March car and truck sales were the strongest in at least eight years, getting the spring selling season off to a robust start.
Ford, the last of the Big Three American auto makers to report, said today that its sales fell 2.6 percent in March from a year earlier, when its sales were strong. But over all, cars and trucks were whisked out of dealerships at the brisk, seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15.8 million vehicles in March. Auto makers sold 1.4 million vehicles last month, up 1.5 percent from the corresponding period a year ago, when sales were also strong. 
 The robust results signal that the economy is still going strong, despite the Federal Reserve's modest interest rate increase last week, analysts said.
"The strength we're getting now runs the risk of turning into weakness in late 1997 or early 1998," said Jack V. Kirnan, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. "The complication here is that the Fed is going to raise rates again."
"These are terrific numbers," said David Bradley, an analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities Inc. "There's an underlying, fundamental strength in the economy that is manifesting itself in higher car sales."
Despite the decrease in overall sales at Ford, its pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and mini-vans proved popular in March, with sales rising 3.5 percent. But Ford's car sales slumped 9.9 percent.
Other American auto makers reported March results earlier this week. The Chrysler Corporation said its sales fell 3.4 percent in March. The General Motors Corporation said its sales rose 4.1 percent.
Besides Ford, Toyota Motor Sales reported results yesterday, and its United States sales were strong, rising 5 percent last month, with truck sales rising 11.8 percent and car sales rising 2.1 percent. The Toyota Camry recorded its best March results ever, with 40,217 sold.
Judging by the results so far, the Camry is likely to be the best-selling car of 1997. Toyota has sold 105,338 Camrys this year, well ahead of the Ford Taurus, with 88,135 sold this year, and far ahead of the Honda Accord, with 76,929 sold during the first quarter.
"Ford has already given up the best-selling car race for 1997," said Stephen J. Girsky, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. "It ain't over till it's over," he cautioned, but "it sounds like Camry's going to win."
Wall Street is delighted by that development because, analysts said, it shows that Ford has shifted its focus to winning profits, not sales contests. In past years, Ford has placed discounts on the Taurus, helping to spur sales results but thinning its profit margins. "That is a sea change for Ford to start putting profitability ahead of market share," Mr. Girsky said.
Other analysts agreed. "Ford management has made a fundamental shift in its thinking -- these guys have decided that profit is more important than market share," Mr. Bradley of J. P. Morgan said. "They have given up trying to make the Taurus No. 1."
While the Big Three lost 1 percent of market share to foreign auto makers -- mainly Japanese and European makers -- there were some signs of strength. The largest American auto maker, G.M., saw its market share climb again this month, as its redesigned cars and trucks started to reach dealer showrooms.
G.M.'s market share reached 31.2 percent of industry sales in March, up from 30.5 percent in February and 30.1 percent in January. "There is a modest upsurge from its trough in November of 29.6 percent," Mr. Bradley said.
Auto sales have been running better than expected so far this year, economists said. In February, the seasonally adjusted annual rate was 15.2 million. In January, autos sold at a 15.4 million annual pace. Economists expect sales to slow later, but Ford slightly raised its estimates for the year as a result of the robust sales.
At the beginning of the year, both G.M. and Ford said annual industry sales would likely fall between 14.7 million and 15.2 million cars and light trucks. Martin B. Zimmerman, executive director of government relations and corporate economics at Ford, said he now expected sales closer to the high end of his range, rather than the middle. Chrysler expects the industry to end the year with sales of 14.9 million.
"People are feeling very good about the economy and their own personal economic condition," said G. Mustafa Mohatarem, chief economist for G.M. "People are out there buying cars."
None of the Big Three's economists voiced complaints about the Fed's rate increase last week, even though higher rates eventually slow the economy, and thus auto sales.
For American auto makers, the only real cloud on the horizon is the stubbornness of the strong dollar, which makes Japanese cars less expensive, economists said. Japanese auto makers, helped by a weak yen, started the year with robust sales. "We do worry about the strength of the dollar," said Mr. Zimmerman.

HEADLINE: Tomoyuki Tanaka, the Creator of Godzilla, Is Dead at 86

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 3

 BODY:
Tomoyuki Tanaka, who frightened and fascinated generations of children with his series of films featuring an outsize, outdated creature named Godzilla, died on Wednesday at a hospital here. He was 86.
Mr. Tanaka was a prolific film producer with a serious edge and a flair for the experimental, and he worked on six films with the Academy Award-winning Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. But he is most remembered for creating the giant Godzilla, who swallowed bullet trains and knocked down buildings as he lumbered through the streets of Tokyo. 
 Years before Japanese cars and computers flooded the stores in the United States, Godzilla was among the first images that struck Americans when they thought of Japan. In his early days, Godzilla was mean, vicious and hideous, destroying everything and everyone in sight.
But in the later years, Godzilla sometimes took on a more benevolent role, defending the world from even more destructive prehistoric creatures like Megaro and Mothra. In a touch of anti-Americanism, Godzilla outdoes King Kong in one film in the series, though in the American version King Kong wins.
Godzilla became one of Japan's most memorable creatures, spawning a steady business in dolls, puzzles, video games and other toys for youngsters. In the United States, Godzilla films became so popular that by some accounts, a Godzilla film has been broadcast by some television station in the country nearly every week since 1960.
Just two years ago Mr. Tanaka, a former chairman of the Toho film studio, announced that he would make his last Godzilla film, "Godzilla vs. Destroyer." It capped a se ries of 22 such movies over four decades, seen, according to Toho, by a combined 85 million Japanese.
Mr. Tanaka was born in Osaka in 1910. He studied economics before joining Toho in 1940 to produce his first films.
Mr. Tanaka turned out more than 220 movies, only about one-quarter of them echoing war themes and exploring science fiction. His first Godzilla film, in 1954, was born of a desire to express the horror and fear that enveloped Japan after the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. At the time Japan was weak and poor, trying to recover from the devastation of World War II, and many Japanese were resentful of the American soldiers who then occupied the country.
In the early 1950's, a Japanese fisherman strayed too close to the Bikini atoll in the South Pacific when an American bomb exploded, and he was ultimately killed by radiation. In 1954, as Mr. Tanaka was returning home from a trip to Indonesia, his plane passed over Bikini and he suddenly came up with the idea of a story about a dinosaur aroused from millenniums of slumber by American nuclear testing.
Mr. Tanaka's plans to make a film with Indonesian partners had collapsed, partly because Japan had no diplomatic relations with the country at the time and the Foreign Ministry had therefore barred a deal.
"My plans to make a movie had failed, and so I returned disappointed," Mr. Tanaka said in an interview in 1984. "I felt like doing something big. That was my motivation. I thought of different ideas. I like monster movies, and I was influenced by 'King Kong.' "
"That was just the beginning," he said, describing the creation of Godzilla. "I went through many hardships. The first problem was the title."
After scribbling dozens of possibilities on a blackboard, Mr. Tanaka and his team came up with "Gojira," a mixture of gorilla and "kujira," the Japanese word for whale. (For the American market, the name was transliterated as Godzilla.) Then he and his team had to decide what Godzilla would look like. "We collected many pictures of dinosaurs," he told an interviewer. "The hardest part was the forehead. It took us 10 days to decide on the forehead."
Up to 1975, the Godzilla movies often suffered from poorly written scripts. The creature was put into slumber so Mr. Tanaka could reintroduce him to movie audiences in 1984.
Mr. Tanaka is survived by his wife, Chieko, and three sons.

No On-Line Busy Signal, But Fine Print: $6 an Hour
Hundreds of subscribers have complained about unexpected charges on their bills from America Online, stemming from their use of an "800" number to gain access to the service. In New York State, the Attorney General's office is looking into the situation. 
 Those seeking information from the company are informed that they will be subject to a surcharge for using the number, which provides freedom from busy signals. That charge, the company tells those who read through several computer screens of information, is $6 an hour. But subscribers have been passing the numbers to one another verbally, in offices and schoolyards and even over America Online. [Page A1.]
 
Optimistic Chief Executives
The stock market has been nothing if not jittery in the last few weeks. But here is a positive omen that might comfort nervous investors: Most chief executives, loaded with stock options granted in the last several years, decided to exercise few, if any, during 1996. They passed up sure gains from the market's stunning 1996 rise, and took their chances on the future ride. Market Place. [D6.]

HEADLINE: Civic Groups Warn State Over Pier on Houston Street

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
When Gov. George E. Pataki pledged yesterday to contribute $100 million in New York State money to help build a 50-block-long park along Manhattan's Hudson River waterfront, the last big roadblock to that long-delayed project fell.
But even before construction begins -- next spring at the earliest -- a fight is brewing over one of the first pieces of waterfront slated for rehabilitation under the plan: Pier 40, a 14-acre peninsula on stilts where Houston Street meets the river. 
 Even as they applauded Mr. Pataki's move, representatives of a variety of Manhattan civic and environmental groups warned that state transportation officials, who had temporarily leased the pier for parking lots and other commercial uses, were forgetting what the Hudson River Park project was all about: creating sun-spangled open space along the western fringe of crowded neighborhoods like Greenwich Village and Clinton.
After leaving Pier 61 in Chelsea, where Mr. Pataki announced the state's financial commitment, Tobi Bergman, a member of the board of the Greenwich Village Little League, headed to the New York State Supreme Court, where a lawsuit against the state's lease of Pier 40 was in its early stages.
He said his sports group and others had asked the state Transportation Department to set aside some land on the pier for temporary ballfields, to help introduce the community to the riverfront and to reinforce the idea that recreation remains the core of the park plan.
But last month the state denied the ballfield request.
Mr. Bergman is a member of a coalition of baseball and soccer leagues that joined in the suit with the Environmental Defense Fund, a private conservation group, charging that the four-year lease of the pier had not had a sufficient environmental review.
Mr. Bergman said: "People have been hearing for so long about the great parks that are coming that they give up. It's really important to get people excited about the waterfront and using the waterfront. These interim uses can help do that."
The dispute over Pier 40 is representative of a larger problem with the Hudson River Park, according to a variety of environmental and civic groups, many of which endorsed the plan yesterday.
The key weakness in the plan, they say, is the lack of any concrete defense against the increasing intrusion of commercial development.
The park plan was drawn up by the Hudson River Park Conservancy -- a subsidiary of the Empire State Development Corporation, a state authority that promotes economic development -- and has always included a mix of open space and commercial activity like restaurants and marinas. But several times in recent years, the groups complain, public space has been eliminated with little public oversight, and they fear that a short-term focus on commercial uses increases the possibility that the park, when finally built, will favor commerce over recreation. .
Pier 40 is particularly important because it is one of the first areas scheduled for restoration, said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, the chief scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund, a private group, and a longtime soccer-playing resident of Greenwich Village. He said it was important for the park planners to send a signal quickly that recreation is a priority.
Adding a ball feld to the pier would cut into income from leases, he said, but it would increase public confidence in the project. "If Pier 40 goes totally toward commercial development, that could subvert the whole plan," Dr. Oppenheimer said.
Mr. Pataki said yesterday that he would create a task force, which would include community representatives, to examine the merits or drawbacks of having a ballfield on the pier in the years leading up to the construction of the finished park. Under the current plan, the pier is slated to be ringed by stores eventually, with a ballfield in a central courtyard.
He said legislation would not be needed to insure that the amount of open space in the overall plan does not shrink.
In addition, Vincent McGoan, a vice president of the Hudson River Park Conservancy, said that no change to the park could be made without preparing a new environmental impact assessment. "There's no hidden agenda," he said.
Even some supporters of the park plan said that Mr. Pataki's support, while laudable, was not enough.
Andre Mele, the environmental director of the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, a private conservation group, said that even with the pledge from Mr. Pataki, a coalition of environmental groups endorsing the park plan was going to push for legislation in Albany to strengthen the waterfront plan so that more commercial activity does not intrude.
"We'll need layers of protection," Mr. Mele said. "It's like what sailors do: If you don't know the right knot to tie, tie lots of them."

Israel Abandons Quest To Extradite Hamas Leader
Israel withdrew its request for the extradition of Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook, the political leader of the Palestinian militant organization Hamas, who is in a New York jail. It cited fears of terrorist reprisals if Mr. Abu Marzook were tried, and hoped Palestinians would see the decision as a conciliatory gesture. A1
 
Swiss to Seize Salinas's Money
Swiss prosecutors concluded that around $100 million in Raul Salinas's accounts originated from drug traffickers' paying for protection, and prepared to seize it. Mr. Salinas is the brother of the former President of Mexico; it was the first time a law-enforcement agency of a Government had explicitly linked him to drug payments. A3 

Kohl to Run for Fifth Term
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said he would run for an unprecedented fifth four-year term in elections next year. Mr. Kohl, a champion of closer European unity, has served as Chancellor for more than 14 years. Unemployment is high and his Christian Democratic party is behind in the polls. A12
 
View on Gingrich Reversed
China criticized the United States for remarks by Newt Gingrich, the House Speaker, that it had peaceably accepted when Mr. Gingrich made them in Beijing earlier this week. The about-face came after Mr. Gingrich met with President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan and stressed that the United States would defend Taiwan from any military attack by the mainland. A6
 
Mr. Gingrich returned to Washington, took on one of his chief critics for calling him weakened and said he opposed an obscure I.R.S. regulation on Medicare taxes. Both moves were seen as efforts to stifle any challenge to his leadership. A27 
 
Zaire Rebels Reject Offer
The new Prime Minister of Zaire, Etienne Tshisekedi, called on rebels under the command of Laurent Kabila to put down their arms; in exchange, he offered them 6 of the 24 posts in his Cabinet. The rebels rejected the offer and insisted that President Mobutu Sese Seko surrender power. Mr. Tshisekedi pointedly excluded supporters of Mr. Mobutu from any Cabinet posts, and said he planned to meet with Mr. Kabila. A8

Clinton Defends 2 Aides Who Helped Hubbell
President Clinton said two senior Administration officials who helped line up employment for Webster L. Hubbell after he left the Justice Department and came under the scrutiny of Whitewater investigators had acted "just out of human compassion." He said the aides, Thomas F. McLarty 3d and Erskine B. Bowles, had done nothing improper. A1
 
Democrats Courted a Smuggler
Congressional investigators said that a Democratic Party fund-raiser had asked a drug smuggler, Jorge Cabrera, for a campaign contribution and that Mr. Cabrera had obliged with a $20,000 check from an account that included cocaine proceeds. Soon afterward, Mr. Cabrera attended a Christmas reception at the White House; three weeks after that, he was arrested. A1
 
Fallout From a Videotape
A mistrial was declared in a murder case in Philadelphia because of a training videotape made in the 1980's by the defense lawyer, Jack McMahon, when he was an assistant prosecutor. The tape urged prosecutors to, among other things, keep young blacks off juries. The fallout threatens to undermine Mr. McMahon's candidacy for district attorney, as well as a large number of convictions recorded in the decade since the videotape was made. A24

Hepatitis A Prognosis Improves
Investigators looking into the outbreak of hepatitis A infection from strawberries said they were still uncertain how the berries became contaminated.

HEADLINE: A New Kind of Detective For the Longer Goodbye;
The Experts of Divorce Get A Sizable Piece of the Action

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
The wife? Suing for divorce. The husband? Pleading poverty. In fact, as the owner of a secretive family business, the husband was moaning about the $2 million he'd just transferred to a creditor.
Then it was Richard Friedman's turn. He spent days analyzing the company's books and deciphering the stamps and signatures on the husband's canceled checks. Finally, Mr. Friedman noticed an endorsement written in hurried handwriting that he immediately recognized. 
 "He transferred the money all right, but it was to his girlfriend," said Mr. Friedman, who was hired to represent the wife. "The girlfriend actually endorsed the checks herself."
Mr. Friedman is a forensic accountant who specializes in divorce cases. He is an investigative number-cruncher who assesses the value of privately held corporations and family businesses, and ferrets out spouses' hidden assets.
And during the past few years in New York, Mr. Friedman and other such accounting sleuths have become increasingly engaged in the thriving industry of divorce.
The divorce rate is declining across the nation, but lately, in New York State, the number of divorces is on the rise. Also growing, particularly in Manhattan, is the size of the payouts in high-profile cases, the longevity of big-money proceedings and their financial and psychological complexities, according to lawyers and senior judges.
Census data suggest that nationally about 43 percent of marriages will end in divorce, in comparison with 50 percent a decade ago. But the number of divorces in New York State during the first half of 1996 jumped 9 percent to 29,259, in comparison with the first six months of 1995. The percentage of New York marriages that end in divorce is not known, nor is there a figure available yet for all of 1995, but the increase seems to be continuing.
"We've seen a rising volume in the matrimonial courts, and the colossus of wealth in New York has given us a large proportion of complex cases with complex issues," said Justice Jacqueline W. Silbermann, administrative judge for the matrimonial courts of New York State.
And in Manhattan, where most of the state's high-end cases are filed, the number of divorce actions increased in 1996 to 17,300 from 15,800 the year before. Social scientists attribute the increase to everything from the number of aging baby-boomers to the growing numbers of women initiating divorce. They cannot say if the trend will continue. They can say that something of a cottage industry is flourishing in New York, as experts sort out the contentious new subtleties of modern-day divorce.
Divorces are often complex. But Manhattan-style divorce is in a league of its own, thanks, many lawyers say, to the growing numbers of wealthy people filing for divorce, the often well-publicized wrangling among the rich over whose fault it all is, and the battling over what constitutes marital property in a state that has seen some of nation's most sweeping appeals court rulings on the subject.
"A whole new industry has developed with a new class of financially expert -- and very busy -- people such as appraisers and evaluation experts," Justice Silbermann said. "It is becoming a huge part of the city's economy, involving enormous sums."
As a forensic accountant, Mr. Friedman specializes in matrimonial actions. There is no central registry for such investigators, but Justice Silbermann and other court experts agree their numbers are growing. And increasingly they are focusing on the lucrative matrimonial trade in addition to work on civil suits and inheritance cases.
Justice Silbermann and others say there is now a booming business for those who call themselves forensic psychiatrists, who make clinical diagnoses while delving into spouses' prior employment, medical and psychological records; custody advisers, who assess children's relationships to their parents and design parental court strategy; and pension evaluators, real-estate experts and art and antique appraisers, all of whom put values on a spouses' possessions. Although no one can exactly measure the impact on the local economy, most agree it is huge and increasing.
"It has certainly grown to be in the hundreds of millions," said Stanford G. Lotwin, who has represented Donald J. Trump in his divorce battle with Ivana Trump, as well as the investor Carl C. Icahn and Claudia Cohen, the former wife of Ronald O. Perelman. The amount of money that changes hands in big-league New York divorces each year, Mr. Lotwin estimated, "is more than a billion."
In part, this upward spiral has been caused by "a series of New York appeals court decisions that are more and more inclusive in valuing marital estates," said Raoul Lionel Felder, who has represented Iolanda Quinn, the wife of the actor Anthony Quinn, and Robin Givens, the former wife of Mike Tyson.
For example, appellate judges have appraised not only the worth of celebrity but have also said that a license to practice medicine or law has an intrinsic value in addition to the worth of the practice itself. As a result, Mr. Felder said, the marital estate "is now an ever-expanding universe requiring valuations that are more and more complex."
Furthermore, divorce in New York, where marital assets are not automatically split 50-50, "is more complicated than in any other state," said Eleanor Alter, who has represented Christie Brinkley and other celebrities. In New York, divorce "has become a full-employment act for accountants," said David B. Saxe, a New York Supreme Court justice who has presided over matrimonial cases for four years.
Since many big-time divorces are settled and sealed, the business of divorce has often been secret. But recent court documents shed light on how lucrative the industry can be.
Take the recent resolution of a bitter battle between Stuart Kerzner, a Manhattan importer, and his wife, Rina. Certainly the size of the marital estate -- $7,661,483, according to court papers -- was hardly spectacular by New York standards. But the fees were precedent-shattering. Among the five divorce lawyers involved in the case, Mr. Felder was awarded $822,249.58; Judd Burstein $242,500, and Jay Goldberg $75,000.
Mr. Friedman, the forensic accountant on the case, was awarded $274,970.87. Furthermore, Judge Saxe, who presided over the case, noted that payments for other accountants and appraisers warranted "additional expert fees" of $200,000.
In another recent prominent case, Kay LeRoy, the wife of restaurateur Warner LeRoy, asked for lawyers' fees of $200,000, accountants' fees of $75,000 and appraisal fees of $25,000.
In general, Mr. Friedman charges $260 an hour and says that in a major case, "it can cost $10,000 to $20,000 before you bat an eyelash," for work that can get messy. Recently an angry husband made Mr. Friedman spend seven hours "looking at 50 cartons of documents in an unheated warehouse with two inches of water on the floor."
Elin Lake Ewald, president of O'Toole-Ewald Art Associates Inc., has a staff of 10 former museum curators to assess antiques, paintings, china and silver. Matrimonial cases -- some of the most famous in New York -- currently make up a fourth of her business. Her firm charges $300 an hour.
At times, Ms. Ewald has been forced to referee screaming matches. Once, the bitterness escalated when Ms. Ewald's staff judged that a husband's supposed Rembrandt valued at $6 million was a fake worth only $600.
Robert A. Marino, a real-estate consultant who specializes in appraising marital property, charges $250 an hour. "We often work as historians," he said, "assessing the value of property decades and decades ago."
Valuing pensions has also become a realm for specialists. The spouse with the pension often must pay a portion of its value to the partner in a divorce settlement.
"Even for cops and firemen these days, the value of the pension can be so great that after 15 years on the job, they can't afford to buy their wives out," said William R. Burns of Lexington Pension Consultants Inc. on Staten Island.
Forensic psychiatrists charge $200 to $350 an hour and "are being employed more because the courts are identifying the significance of an increasing number of psychological problems" such as post-traumatic-stress syndrome developed after marital abuse, said Dr. Steven A. Fayer, a Manhattan psychiatrist.
In one custody dispute, Dr. Fayer discovered documents proving that a wife had tried to conceal a history of alcoholism. The result: she was allowed shared custody, but only if she sought treatment for drinking.
Another reason for the growth in the divorce industry, Mr. Felder said, is that there are more legal practitioners willing to work in the increasingly lucrative field. "It used to be that divorce was to law what proctology was to medicine," said Mr. Felder, who charges $450 an hour.
For spouses trapped in the business of divorce, the process can be "unbearable," said Iolanda Quinn, who filed for divorce in 1995 after 32 years of marriage to the 82-year-old actor -- and whose life has been ruled by dueling forensic accountants and appraisers ever since.
"It is all so unnecessary, such a waste," the 60-year-old Mrs. Quinn said. "My advice is that people should do anything they can to avoid having a divorce."

HEADLINE: Official Attacks Plan for Mining Project

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: FOLKSTON, Ga., April 3

 BODY:
Standing at the Okefenokee Swamp, an alligator lounging behind him, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt took an unequivocal public stand today against the Du Pont Company's plans to strip mine along the eastern ridge bordering this wildlife refuge.
Mr. Babbitt rejected in advance any and all arguments that plans by the company to mine titanium ore would not harm the 395,000-acre Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge wetland, with its rare wildlife, forests of pine and cyprus trees, and swamps covered with grasses and lily pads as far as the eye can see. 
 "You can study this, you can write all the documents in the world," Mr. Babbitt said, "but they are not going to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there will be no impact."
"These studies can't possibly yield a conclusion which will be satisfactory to me," he said. "It isn't going to happen."
Mr. Babbitt said the proposed operation posed unacceptable risks to the water flows, as well as the wildlife and vegetation of the wetland wilderness at the headwaters of the Suwanee and the St. Mary's Rivers on Georgia's southern border.
The land Du Pont wants to mine for titanium dioxide, a whitening pigment used in paper and other products, is a nearly imperceptible ridge running down the entire eastern flank of the refuge. Indeed, Mr. Babbitt called it the natural levee that holds the swamp itself in place.
"It is apparent on the face of it that this refuge and this mining project are not compatible," he said while on a tour of the area.
Without waiting for E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company to apply for the required state and Federal permits, Mr. Babbitt came here to state his rejection of the project that in any case would be years from fruition. This highly unusual public effort by a senior Clinton Administration figure caught Du Pont off guard.
"We are surprised that the Secretary has taken a position before all the facts are known," said Jon Samborski, director of environmental affairs for the mining project. "We would not be proposing to do this unless we were confident that we can operate the project and protect Okefenokee at the same time."
Du Pont figures the cost of building the project at about $150 million and has been working closely with the wildlife service.
The giant chemical company has not yet applied for the required state and Federal permits for mining on the 38,000 acres it owns or leases here for a project that would not begin for several years.
While it was unusual for Mr. Babbitt to try to abort a development project at such an early stage, it was the latest example of the Administration's trying to hinder development just outside the boundaries of national parks, refuges and other sensitive public lands. Last year, the Government blocked a gold mine just outside Yellowstone National Park.
In the Okefenokee Swamp, the DuPont Company would need to sift the ore from the sandy soil. First it would clear-cut sections of trees and peel off a foot-thick layer of topsoil, then build mile-square impoundments and begin to dig. The company would float dredging barges on the brackish water that builds up in these pools to suck up the mucky sand, carving ponds to depths of 50 feet. A floating mill would separate the valuable minerals from the sand, and the unwanted materials would be used to fill in the wounds. After replacing the topsoil, the company would plant new pine seedlings and the operation would move to the next square in the grid, a creeping progression that would last for 50 years.
Fish and Wildlife Service scientists said they were worried that these changes could alter the little-understood water balances, and they warned that even slight changes could cause major effects in the finely balanced ecology of this wetland that is recognized worldwide as a significant biological resource.
John Kasbohm, an ecologist at the refuge, said the mining "threatens the very character of the swamp."
"If you change the hydrology, you change everything," he said. "The stakes are real high, the risks are real high. This mining operation is a very risky business."
The company would have to get permits from the Army Corps of Engineers before dredging and filling wetlands, and the Environmental Protection Agency can veto decisions by the Army Corps, although this power is rarely used. Mr. Babbitt's agency, the Interior Department, which includes the Fish and Wildlife Service and the refuge system, is consulted in these decisions but does not make the major decisions. An environmental impact study would probably be conducted in the deliberations on the permits, and Interior's scientists would play a crucial role in that process.
But Mr. Babbitt plainly has made up his mind already, and his view was only reinforced in a helicopter tour of the region, including a look at a similar mine in Florida.
He urged Du Pont to "do the people of Georgia and the people of the United States who care about God's creation a favor, by simply withdrawing the proposal once and for all."
He said that the titanium is readily available elsewhere, that the few dozen jobs involved are dwarfed by the economic importance of the refuge as a tourist attraction, and that logging timber is an acceptable way to develop the property without risking damage to the swamp.
But he said he was not contemplating any compensation for Du Pont, like trading other land or paying it not to mine. In contrast, when the Administration blocked the gold mine near Yellowstone it agreed to pay Crown Butte, the American subsidiary of the Canadian conglomerate Noranda, $65 million in other mineral rights on public lands.
Environmental groups welcomed Mr. Babbitt's stand, which they said was surprisingly strong.
"You couldn't pick a worse place to put a mine," said Josh Marks, a conservation organizer for the Georgia chapter of the Sierra Club.
Steve and Jo Knight, who last year bought a junk yard near the refuge and turned it into a campground, said they were dismayed by the project, which they thought would jeopardize their investment.
"It could kill the tourism on this side of the swamp," Mr. Knight said after Mr. Babbitt spoke to a crowd at the refuge, where 400,000 people visit every year.

About 200 management and blue-collar employees of Givaudan-Roure in Clifton will lose their jobs over the next 18 months as the Swiss company phases out its chemical manufacturing operation here. 
 Some 400 workers in corporate offices will remain, said Kathy DiBenedetto, a company spokeswoman. But the plant will be demolished as part of a consolidation of manufacturing operations in Europe, she said.

HEADLINE: Chicago 7 Survivor Hopes to Be No. 1 in Los Angeles

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 3

 BODY:
Early in State Senator Tom Hayden's half-hour campaign video -- a modest effort that is by far the most elaborate media element of his shoestring race for mayor of Los Angeles -- a woman accosts him at a farmers market with a well-groomed husky on a leash.
"Why are places so un-dog-friendly all of a sudden?" she demands. 
 "Oh, the city is hostile to nature in all its forms," Mr. Hayden replies drily.
"If you get to be mayor, are you going to change that?"
Mr. Hayden assures her, "Oh, the city's going to be wild with dogs."
It is only a moment in Mr. Hayden's quixotic bid to lead the nation's second-largest city, but it sums up the madcap, anachronistic feel of the quest. With polls showing him trailing badly behind the popular incumbent, Richard J. Riordan, in next Tuesday's nonpartisan primary, Mr. Hayden doggedly crisscrosses the city these days in a small yellow schoolbus proclaiming "L.A. Not for $ ale," a superannuated subversive with steel-gray hair and a merry prankster's mischievous air.
In the last 10 days, he has accused Mr. Riordan, Senator Dianne Feinstein, and her investor husband, Richard C. Blum, of complicity in the death of a worker on a subway project being built in part by a company in which Mr. Blum has a minority interest. (He declined Mr. Blum's demand for an apology.) He has called Mr. Riordan "a racist" (then apologized and explained that he meant the remark as a sardonic distillation of how the press would report his criticisms of the Mayor as "racially insensitive.")
It would be easy to poke fun at the gonzo tactics of this former '60's radical, former husband of Jane Fonda, former comrade of Cesar Chavez and 15-year veteran of the State Assembly, where he has crusaded on behalf of gun control, the environment and his view of social justice. But it would also be wrong.
For better or worse, this 57-year-old survivor of the Chicago 7 is Mr. Riordan's only real opposition, having joined the fray when more cautious Democratic candidates declined. And he is doing his best to shake up what he calls his "anarchic, sprawling city of enclaves."
"Much as I dispute the laid-back image that Easterners put on us, because we're actually very intense," Mr. Hayden said in an interview the other day, "there's a ring of truth to the description of the city because it's so de-politicized. There is no other city on the Pacific Rim that is in the trouble that L.A. is in: San Francisco, San Diego, Portland, Seattle, Vancouver, they all have vigorous positive neighborhoods, and if you go there they gossip about politics. L.A. is defined as a world in which everything is entirely private, including civic life."
There is a touch of the poet in Mr. Hayden, and on the campaign trail his observation has a poignant ring. On Wednesday, only three reporters trailed him as he stumped through the gritty port area of Wilmington, stopping to protest the layoff of safety workers at an oil refinery, to bemoan the plight of contract truck-drivers who work long hours for steamship lines without regular benefits or salary, and to warn that a city-sponsored coal export terminal under construction would spread harmful particles into the lungs of neighborhood children because the builders refused to cover its open pit.
"He is deeply insensitive to the issue of air pollution and he's an elitist who does not care about the health of people in areas such as this one," Mr. Hayden said of the Mayor before heading off to visit with drug addicts and prostitutes in a shantytown of unpaved, sewerless streets that locals call "the third world."
Asked several times just what he would do differently, Mr. Hayden talked of appointing commissioners more sensitive to neighborhoods, but also seemed nonchalant, once proclaiming, "I don't want to get specific." At one point he walked away distractedly from his own mini-news conference to grab a pineapple protein drink proferred by a supporter.
Mr. Hayden cannot afford standard television commercials, and has relied instead on radio advertisements, including one featuring an endorsement from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, and the infomercial video, broadcast a few times on a local cable channel. Local political experts confess puzzlement at his campaign.
"I initially believed that this campaign had very little to do with 1997 and everything to do with the year 2001, when the mayor's office is vacant and term limits mean Hayden will be out of office in Sacramento," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, an analyst at the Center for Politics and Economics at the Claremont Graduate School. "It seemed like the perfect shakedown cruise, but his rhetoric doesn't fit with that strategy."
Mr. Hayden said he simply decided he "could play a more effective role" as mayor than as a legislator, in a climate in which "both parties seem to be abandoning the inner cities as hopeless areas." He also uses more personal, mystic terms, borrowing an American Indian parable to chart his life's progress from rebellious eagle, to competitive midlife coyote to avuncular, experienced bear. "Being a mayor," he said, "is kind of like being a bear."
But the candidate insists he has no wish to be a "noble loser," and dismisses the assertion of his old friend Susan Estrich, who managed Michael S. Dukakis's Presidential campaign, that he is indulging in a midlife crisis.
"Susan is projecting," he said. "The midlife crisis is hers. She's suffering with being a former liberal; I don't have that problem. These critics are really talking about themselves; I'm just their ink blot. They would really like me to stop irritating their conscience. I really think I'm doing what I should at this point in my life and they're not."

HEADLINE: Haiti's Democratic Troubles

 BODY:
Two and a half years after American troops intervened to end a murderous dictatorship in Haiti, that country faces daunting troubles. Its ministries are inept, its Parliament paralyzed and its police quick on the trigger. Yet these problems represent progress of a sort. Haiti has gone from a government dedicated to brutality and corruption to one of inexperience and incompetence. That is a sign that the United States and the international community can best help by staying involved.
President Rene Preval is not a seasoned leader, but he has tried to be a responsible one. He has pushed through a fractious Parliament a desperately needed program to sell inefficient public enterprises and modernize Haiti's economy. The reforms would not only qualify Haiti for international funds that have been held back, but would also begin to lift the economy and help Haiti's poor. 
 The reforms have been blocked largely by Mr. Preval's political mentor, the only man in Haiti with a real political base, former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. While Mr. Aristide in the past has spoken for Haiti's people, his role now is negative. His supporters have brought parliamentary action to a standstill. Ironically, he is joined in his opposition to economic reform by some members of Haiti's elite, who have grown rich from the monopolies they hold in the protected economy.
But Mr. Aristide's opposition also shows that Haiti is in no danger of becoming a one-party dictatorship. A political split over economic policy is an appropriate disagreement in a democracy.
The abuses by the new Haitian National Police are extremely serious. In the 21 months since the United States established the force, police have killed about 50 Haitians. The police must be held accountable for these crimes.
The Government is beginning to do that. The police's Inspector General is investigating the killings. Most of those accused have been fired and some are in jail. This is one reason that the murders do not justify a cutoff of American aid and training. The violence has not been the result of a deliberate policy, as were the thousand murders each year committed by the most recent dictatorship.
The police need more training, resources and leadership. A related problem is Haiti's virtually nonexistent justice system. The Clinton Administration considers the building of a justice system a top priority. But reform efforts have been hurt by an overly centralized program that slights the realities of Haiti's largely rural courts.
For a few more months, Haiti could use the security and scrutiny provided by the 1,300 international troops remaining in the country. Some are due to leave in July, but Canada, which has 750 troops there, has said it will try to stay until the end of the year. The other troops should stay too.
If Haiti is to be able to feed itself and break the habits that come from centuries of occupation, dictatorship and mismanagement, it will likely need economic and technical help for years. It deserves such help. Haiti still faces serious problems. But thanks to the United States and other countries, it is now a democracy with a Government committed to solving them.

HEADLINE: A Cosmetics Heir's Joint Venture Is Tainted by Ukrainian's Past

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS FRANTZ and RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
Ronald S. Lauder and Vadim Rabinovich could scarcely be more different. An urbane former United States Ambassador to Austria, Mr. Lauder is heir to a cosmetics fortune, chairman of the board of Museum of Modern Art and a former candidate for Mayor of New York. Mr. Rabinovich, a self-made Ukrainian millionaire, spent nine years in a Soviet prison for theft and has been linked to a suspected Russian criminal figure.
But the two men are joined as partners in a television venture in Ukraine that has raised eyebrows among Western diplomats and businessmen here and in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, both because of Mr. Rabinovich's background and because of the apparently favored treatment the venture received from the Ukrainian Government. 
 The business alliance between Mr. Rabinovich and Mr. Lauder, recounted by principals in the deal and diplomats here and in Ukraine, is not unusual in the free-wheeling capitalism that has taken root in Central Europe and the former Soviet Union. Western companies hoping to wedge their way into previously closed markets often find they must turn to local partners whose ties to the government are essential but whose backgrounds stir ripples.
That can raise problems for publicly traded companies like Mr. Lauder's fledgling Central European Media Enterprises. Such companies have a legal obligation to disclose significant problems with their partners, particularly if they are to have a management role.
Mr. Lauder, the chairman and founder of Central European Media, declined to be interviewed for this article. But Leonard S. Fertig, its chief executive, said the company learned of the allegations about Mr. Rabinovich only after the deal was completed last fall. He said company representatives then discussed the matter with people at the United States Embassy in Kiev and were told there was no reason not to do business with Mr. Rabinovich.
"They concluded, in terms of what they told us, that there was nothing that should prevent us from doing business with him," Mr. Fertig said.
American Government officials acknowledged that embassy officials had told Mr. Lauder and other company officials about Mr. Rabinovich's conviction and his links to Grigory Loutchansky, a Russian whose company, Nordex, is suspected of having ties to criminal organizations. But the officials said the embassy had offered no opinion about whether to do business with him.
Mr. Rabinovich was jailed from 1982 to 1990 for theft from the state. He said in an interview that he had been chief of a construction brigade and had sold goods to private customers. He said he had committed no real crime and had been persecuted for being Jewish. He also said he had cut his ties to Mr. Loutchansky.
Mr. Fertig said the company had made inquiries about its partners in Ukraine before finalizing the deal and uncovered no problems. He said the inquiries had not focused on Mr. Rabinovich because he was not part of management or involved in the operation of the television station itself.
But current and former officials at the United States Embassy in Kiev said that the embassy was not approached by the company about Mr. Rabinovich before the deal was completed in October. A senior European diplomat said his country had cautioned its companies to avoid doing business with Mr. Rabinovich.
Mr. Lauder's partnership is between his Central European Media, which operates television stations in seven countries in the region, and Studio 1+1 Group, its local partner in Kiev.
Central European Media sought to expand into Ukraine a year ago. At the outset, Mr. Fertig said, its representatives were referred to Mr. Rabinovich and his partners by a close adviser and assistant to President Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine, who praised the Ukraine group. And when questions arose about the legality of the broadcast license received by the joint venture, the same presidential adviser obtained a letter declaring that the license had been awarded properly.
Mr. Fertig said Mr. Rabinovich was an investor in Studio 1+1 Group and had no role in its management. He said that Mr. Rabinovich's stake in Studio 1+1 was indirect, and that he was not certain how much of the business was owned by Mr. Rabinovich.
A year ago, John M. Deutch, then the Director of Central Intelligence, told a Congressional hearing that Nordex, the Vienna-based trading company founded in 1989 by Mr. Loutchansky, was "an organization associated with Russian criminal activity."
In addition, concerns about his business activities led the British Government to bar Mr. Loutchansky from entering the country, an action he is fighting in court.
Thomas R. Spencer Jr., a lawyer for Mr. Loutchansky, said his client had been subjected to unwarranted and unsubstantiated allegations. He said Mr. Loutchansky and his company had never been involved in criminal activities.
"These allegations have been circulating now for two years, and he has never been charged with anything," Mr. Spencer said. "No one has ever presented proof of the basis for these allegations."
An intelligence summary prepared by a Western Government, and corroborated by senior American diplomats, said Ostex, one of Mr. Rabinovich's companies, had been created as an arm of Nordex, a claim that Mr. Rabinovich disputed.
In the interview in his office in a modern building in Kiev, Mr. Rabinovich said he had worked with Nordex for about a year but had broken off the relationship two years ago because of bad publicity about Mr. Loutchansky. He said his companies, which are engaged in many businesses, had only legitimate interests.
Mr. Lauder, whose mother founded the Estee Lauder Companies, created Central European Media in 1994. He predicted last year that the company would have annual revenues of $1 billion within five years, but it has run up steady losses to date. The company reported last month that it lost $30 million in 1996 compared with losses of $18.7 million in 1995 and $20.5 million in 1994.
When the company sought to enter the Ukraine market a year ago, Mr. Fertig said, its executives were referred to Mr. Rabinovich and his partners in Studio 1+1 by Oleksandra Volkov, an assistant and close adviser to President Kuchma. Western diplomats and businessmen said Mr. Volkov also owned a piece of Studio 1+1, but Mr. Fertig said he was unaware of that investment.
Along with the recommendation from the presidential adviser, the company executives also were impressed by a photograph in Mr. Rabinovich's office that showed him with President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, according to a person close to the company.
The photograph was taken in late 1995 at a Democratic fund-raising party in Miami, Mr. Rabinovich said. He said he had not donated money to the Democrats, but had been invited to the event by Bennett S. LeBow, an American businessman whose interests include the Liggett Group, the big cigarette manufacturer. Mr. LeBow's Brooke Group and Mr. Rabinovich are developing a business center and luxury hotel in Kiev, according to a spokesman for Mr. LeBow.
Last summer, Central European Media negotiated a partnership agreement with Studio 1+1 Group that gave the American company a 50 percent economic interest in the operation, which was broadcasting about five hours a day on Ukrainian television.
Studio 1+1 received a license last fall to expand its broadcast time on Ukraine's commercial channel, UT 2, to nine hours a day, including prime time. The license, also sought by other companies, was issued despite a moratorium imposed by Parliament.
The head of the state agency that awarded the license, Viktor Petrenko, said in an interview that his agency had ignored the moratorium because it knew better than Parliament what was the best policy.
"I'm very happy that we did," Mr. Petrenko said.
Western diplomats said American and Ukrainian lawyers had questioned the legitimacy of the Studio 1+1 license because of the moratorium. Faced with those concerns, Studio 1+1 turned for help to Mr. Volkov, the assistant to President Kuchma. Mr. Volkov obtained a letter from the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice in January that the license was issued legally.
The Ukraine deal is important to Central European Media. In a stock offering last fall, which raised $132 million, the company said the Ukraine partnership had more than doubled its market reach.
A cablegram from the embassy to the State Department in Washington in September raised questions about Mr. Rabinovich's background and said he was "largely considered beyond the reach of the law in Ukraine," according to a copy provided to The New York Times.
Yet Mr. Fertig said his company had heard praise for Mr. Rabinovich as a businessman who is well regarded in Ukraine.
"We know him in the present," Mr. Fertig said. "In the present, the guy claims that half of his income is given to charity. He is extremely active in civic affairs. He is well thought of by people in the Government. We didn't know and really don't know who he was in the past."

HEADLINE: Protection for Farm Labor

 BODY:
Few laborers have as little clout with their bosses as farm workers. The work is unskilled and the labor pool huge and mobile. Many farm workers are illegal immigrants and therefore reluctant to report employers who do not pay the minimum wage or Social Security or fail to provide water and toilets in the field. Farm wages have been dropping for 20 years.
Because of the political power of big growers, the Federal Government has never been particularly helpful to farm workers. But now Washington is taking two actions that will give farm workers some much-needed protection. The Labor Department's wage and hour division last month announced new rules for growers who employ labor contractors to hire crews. The new rules will make it easier for farm workers to hold growers responsible when the labor contractors cheat them. 
 In addition, enforcement will be strengthened. The wage and hour division now has only three farm labor inspectors in Florida, for example, and they also enforce dozens of other laws. The lack of scrutiny gives employers license to pay workers $2 or $3 an hour and cheat them of Social Security and overtime. The division will add 200 workers in the seven states with the highest immigration: New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Texas, Florida, California and Arizona. They will focus on farm labor, garment manufacturing and janitorial services, which employ large numbers of immigrants.
Congress authorized the added staff to reduce employers' incentives to hire illegal immigrants. The staff will still be too small for adequate inspections, but together with the new contracting rules, the increased presence will help discourage growers from cheating their most vulnerable workers.

HEADLINE: Lawyers in Oklahoma Bombing Hope Rapport With Jurors Pays Off Later

BYLINE: By JO THOMAS 

DATELINE: DENVER, April 4

 BODY:
During this week's questioning of prospective jurors in the Oklahoma City bombing trial, one of the prosecutors, United States Attorney Patrick M. Ryan, asked Juror No. 294 whether his dog, a Labrador retriever, was golden or black. His own dog, Mr. Ryan volunteered, was a golden retriever.
At another point, Stephen Jones, who is leading the defense team, tried to sympathize with Juror No. 639, who said a close friend had died, by noting, "I had a similar experience myself." Then the juror explained that his friend had been killed in a robbery. Mr. Jones's friend had died in an automobile accident. 
 Coming from lawyers who also ask each juror whether he or she could sentence someone to death, the lighthearted questions and comments were anything but frivolous, jury experts say. The exchanges, however brief, give prosecutors and defense lawyers alike a chance to sow the seeds of cordial relationships with the men and women, now identified only by number, who may be chosen to deliver a verdict in the nation's worst terrorist crime.
"They're trying to establish a connection, a bond, in hopes that it might pay dividends at some point in a trial," said Robert E. Precht, the lawyer who defended Mohammed A. Salameh in the World Trade Center bombing and now is director of the Office of Public Service at the University of Michigan Law School.
"Things can go wrong in a trial," Mr. Precht said. "A jury's willingness to forgive a prosecutor or a defense lawyer for a mistake can be a real benefit."
As the trial against Timothy J. McVeigh opened here this week and lawyers for Mr. McVeigh's co-defendant, Terry L. Nichols, who will be tried afterward, listened in the second row, Judge Richard P. Matsch of Federal District Court questioned each juror for about 20 minutes. Then, in a procedure that is rare in Federal court, Judge Matsch allowed both prosecutors and defense lawyers to ask their own questions in sessions that sometimes lasted more than an hour.
Many of those questions were part of the lawyers' strategy to connect to the jurors. At one point, Mr. Ryan, who is the chief prosecutor in Oklahoma City, asked Juror No. 134, an avid sports fan, "Did you follow the N.C.A.A.?" adding, "Did your team win?"
The lawyer did not miss a beat when the young man replied, "My team never wins."
Robert Nigh Jr., a defense lawyer, told Juror No. 609, a retiree who likes to paint, "I do a little bit of painting myself." He added, "It's a subject that fascinates me."
All potential jurors had already filled out 40-page questionnaires with more than 150 questions on topics as diverse as their lives and job history, what books they read and what radio stations they listen to, and how easy it is for them to make decisions.
There have been awkward moments when the lawyers, most of whom are from out of state, failed to recognize the common names of employers like the bus company or the power company in Denver, and the jurors had to explain.
As each potential juror appeared in court, Judge Matsch explained, in a slow and friendly way, that the death penalty may be an issue in the case. If there is a conviction in a capital case in Federal court, he told each, the jury not only votes on guilt or innocence, but also on the penalty.
Patiently, repeating himself when necessary, Judge Matsch asked whether they had any religious, personal or moral opinion for or against the death penalty. If not, he asked them whether they thought, as a general matter, that they could consider death as a possible penalty, along with life in prison without possibility of parole or some lesser penalty.
"I don't believe in the death penalty at all, " Juror No. 523, a Denver librarian, said on Thursday morning.
Others waffled. One was Juror No. 762, a nurse who has worked in hospitals for 40 years. She told Judge Matsch on Thursday that she could impose the death penalty, but minutes later told Mr. Ryan that "only God can take a life."
Judge Matsch interjected mildly, "I'm not arguing, but I mentioned that the jury must consider the death penalty and whether that is a deserved punishment."
Mr. Ryan then asked the prospective juror, "Could you come into court and say, 'I sentence that person to die?' "
The nurse replied, "If it comes down to it, yes, depending on the facts."
Mr. Ryan then asked, "When Judgment Day comes, will it be held against you?"
She answered, "I don't know," and added that she would be willing to take the chance.
Joe Guastaferro, a jury consultant from Chicago, said in an interview this week that the possibility of death put "incredible pressure on the whole system, right from the first question in jury selection."
In the Oklahoma City case, Mr. Guastaferro said, "the prosecution has what appears to be an unlosable case and could blow it by not finding out who the person is who might have morals about the death penalty. The defense doesn't want to miss an opportunity to save a young man's life. It's like a pressure cooker. Anywhere there's a loose seam, it will blow apart."
The judge, the prosecutors and the defense lawyers all unearthed problems this week, although only the juror who broke into tears and suffers from a nervous condition was immediately excused. Any others who might be excused for cause -- like Juror No. 306, an unemployed pipe fitter who told Judge Matsch that he did not like the court system and that "in my estimation, you haven't been doing a very good job" -- come up for discussion in the judge's chambers each morning before the public session begins. So far, no information from these meetings has been released.
Potential jurors have been asked for their opinions on gun legislation and whether they had ever attended a gun show. Those with other experiences in the criminal justice system have been examined for evidence of bitterness or a desire for revenge. The stagehand who had once declared bankruptcy, the carpenter who had once been convicted of stealing a car battery, the self-employed window washer who had owed the Internal Revenue Service a large sum, through no fault of his own, all came in for more questions.
"Prosecutors, especially in a death penalty case, want strong law-and-order types," said Jeffrey Abramson, a professor of politics and legal studies at Brandeis University. "But here they don't want people who are too conservative, because it may bring anti-Government thinking. They have two balls in the air."
Mr. Ryan asked Juror No. 838, an investment counselor and former mining engineer who said the Government "indulged in overkill" at standoffs against zealots at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and near Waco, Tex., whether he would give fair consideration to evidence presented by the Government in this case.
The juror replied, "I'm inclined to be pretty logical and not terribly swayed by emotion."
"We do not want your sympathy," Mr. Ryan replied. "We want you to decide on the evidence. You understand that the Government is not on trial? This case is about whether the defendant committed the crime and which sentence should be imposed, should he be convicted."
Prosecutors also asked jurors whether they could consider only the evidence against Mr. McVeigh and accept the possibility that there would be unanswered questions.
"In the way the Government is going to try this case," said Mr. Precht, the lawyer in the World Trade Center trial, "a lot of it is going to be mind-numbingly boring. The jurors are going to have to listen to hours and hours of highly detailed forensic testimony. Generally, the prosecution is going to be looking for highly intelligent jurors who are not going to be distracted by sideshows. The defense will want jurors who won't be impressed by the Government's blizzard of evidence if they find a conspiracy theory fetching."
Mr. Precht noted that just before the trial opened, Mr. Jones accused the Government of failing to pursue possible conspiracy theories, including the identity of a suspect whose sketch was circulated around the nation. The Government now says this suspect, known as John Doe No. 2, may not exist.
"Jones is looking for someone who says, 'I understand this, but how about John Doe No. 2?' " Mr. Precht said. "The defense would hope for a deadlocked jury, a single holdout. The prosecution must find 12 people who will agree."

HEADLINE: U.S. Reports Solid Jobs Market, Pointing to a Stronger Economy

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
The unemployment rate edged down to 5.2 percent last month -- matching its lowest level in eight years -- as the reinvigorated economy continued to produce a bountiful labor market for legions of Americans.
While the Government reported today that employers added a slightly less-than-expected 175,000 workers to their payrolls in March, every other economic indicator pointed to strong growth that may well prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again soon. 
 Hourly earnings climbed to a point 4 percent above those of March 1996, the briskest annual increase of the long-running business expansion that reached its sixth anniversary last month. Meanwhile, overtime at the nation's factories was a record 4.9 hours a worker, making it more likely that industry would need to bid up wages further to attract additional skilled workers.
But what was good news for workers sent the bond market into a tizzy, pushing long-term interest rates higher on fears that the Federal Reserve, which only last week decided to raise interest rates for the first time in 14 months, could do so again as early as its next meeting in May. The shaky stock market, divided between worries over higher interest rates and hopes for healthy corporate earnings that are both outcomes of a stronger economy, gyrated wildly. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 6,526.07, up 48.72 points, but only after an initial slide of 72 points at the opening bell. [Page 36.]
The Fed's move last week is now widely seen as likely to become just the first of a series of interest rate increases. Indeed, even Merrill Lynch, which had expected the economy to slow enough on its own to stay the Fed's hand, joined the other camp after the Labor Department issued its monthly jobs report today.
"We are throwing in the towel and now assume that the Fed will probably tighten twice more," Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch, advised clients. This, he added, means that the economy should be "slowing sharply" by year's end.
But while many on Wall Street fretted, the Clinton Administration expressed confidence that price increases would be held in check and the economy would continue to expand at a healthy rate.
"The economy is continuing on a path of steady, sustainable expansion with strong job creation and low inflation," Janet L. Yellen, chief economic adviser to President Clinton and a former member of the Federal Reserve Board, said in a statement. She added in an interview, "I don't see any evidence of an acceleration."
Ms. Yellen pointed to the moderate rise in workers on employer payrolls as suggesting that inflation prospects were more benign than many analysts contend.
Not only did payrolls grow by a moderate 175,000, but the February increase was also revised to 293,000, or 46,000 less than initially reported.
Others drew modest comfort from the fact that a slightly smaller proportion of companies added to their payrolls last month than in February, a slight decline in the length of the private-sector workweek despite the rise in overtime.
"I really don't see cost-push inflation in these data," said Lincoln F. Anderson, economist for the Fidelity mutual fund group in Boston. "Companies are not reporting to us that there's a significant earnings squeeze from rising labor costs."
And Ms. Yellen, while acknowledging it to be a crude gauge, said that 4 percent wage growth and 3 percent consumer inflation over the last year should be regarded as in line with productivity improvement, which means that companies should be able to sustain decent profits without having to raise prices.
But many analysts are convinced that higher inflation is on the way. "Inflation is going to creep up," Todd Speiser, a trader at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, told Bloomberg News, predicting that the Fed was "going to put the brakes on some more in May."
Indeed, much of the report suggested a further tightening of the labor market, including the highest amount of factory overtime, 4.9 hours a week, since this was first measured in 1956 and a record percentage, 63.8, of the nation's civilian population with jobs.
Demand for workers, in fact, is strong enough that many more of the hard-core unemployed have begun finding jobs. The ranks of those out of work more than six months declined 75,000 last month after a 74,000 February drop. This group now accounts for 15 percent of the jobless, down from 16.9 percent in January.
Moreover, the payroll gain, the department said, would have been larger had it not been for a 27,000-job decline in construction that was largely the result of statistical quirks caused by unusual weather shifts this winter. Flooding in the Midwest may have also reduced the total, some analysts said.
Factory jobs climbed 16,000 last month, bringing the increase since September to 74,000, a modest rise but in sharp contrast to a loss of 319,000 from a March 1995 peak.
Almost two-thirds of the payroll expansion was in services, with retailing up 43,000, hospital services up 22,000 and finance adding 17,000, the report also showed.
The department's survey of households, a more erratic measure but the basis for computing the unemployment rate, showed an exceptionally large job gain of 745,000 that was more than enough to absorb an increase of 685,000 in the labor force. An undetermined amount of this increase was said to have reflected the entry of people formerly on welfare.
While there was an unusually big discrepancy between the surveys of employers and of households last month, the two show a close relationship compared with 12 months ago, analysts noted.
At 5.2 percent, the March jobless rate was at the same level as the rate that prevailed from August through October 1996. Before that, unemployment has not been so low since the 5 percent rate of March 1989. The unemployment rate in February was 5.3 percent.
Regionally, joblessness ticked one-tenth of a point lower in the Northeast and South and dipped three-tenths of a point in the Midwest, to 4 percent, the best of any area. The jobless rate climbed three-tenths of a point in the West, to 6 percent.
Some analysts pay particular attention in the labor market report to the index of aggregate weekly hours, which edged slightly lower after a big jump in February.
But this and the other less-than-buoyant figures today did little to diminish expectations that another Fed tightening of monetary policy was already in sight.
"It's almost certain they're going to move again in May," said Dominic Konstam, director of economic research at Credit Suisse First Boston.

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices Drop Sharply As Labor Data Show Strength

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell sharply after the March employment report showed brisk economic growth and rising labor costs. The data suggested that the Federal Reserve would again have to raise interest rates to contain inflation.
While the gain in the number of new jobs was less than expected, traders and analysts said they were concerned by other data in the report showing sharp rises in hourly earnings and in overtime. The labor cost data are expected to increase the pressure on the Fed, which raised short-term interest rates by a quarter-point last week, to push rates even higher. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond ended the day down 20/32 , to 9330/32 . The bond's yield, a benchmark for many consumer and corporate interest rates, rose to 7.12 percent, from 7.07 percent on Thursday. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, is the highest since it was 7.15 percent on Sept. 15.
Treasury prices fell after the Labor Department reported that 175,000 jobs were added to the nation's payrolls last month. The unemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent from 5.3 percent.
Prices fell even though the payroll number was less than market expectations of more than 200,000.
"The one number in the employment report that the market should have gotten the most comfort out of, the jobs gain, was the one number that was most suspect" because of seasonal and weather-related factors, Steven Landis of Bull and Bear Advisers Inc., said.
"Trying to find a reason to buy in this bearish market is like trying to swim upstream," Mr. Landis added.
Market participants were concerned about data in the report showing a higher-than-expected gain of 5 cents, or four-tenths of 1 percent, in average hourly earnings.
"The average hourly earnings monthly gain of four-tenths of 1 percent does appear to suggest that the impact of previous demand side pressures is finally beginning to impact the overall economy in a wider fashion," said Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation in Columbus, Ohio.
Mr. Chan noted that the gain in earnings was in both the goods-producing and service sectors.
"Other discomforting aspects of this report were the jump in manufacturing weekly hours and the corresponding surge in the number of manufacturing overtime hours," Mr. Chan said. "These developments tell us that while most of the consumer price inflation that we have been observing to date has been mostly concentrated in the service sector, that may not be the case for long as it begins to spill over into the goods-producing sector as a result of these growing labor cost pressures."

HEADLINE: Japan Pledges To Monitor Its Trade Surplus

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 4

 BODY:
Responding to American concerns, Japanese leaders said today that they would try to hold their resurgent trade surplus in check.
The remarks were welcomed by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who was making a one-day visit to Tokyo, in part to urge Japanese officials to take preventive economic measures. 
 Japan's once-gaping trade surplus, after falling sharply over the last three years, has been creeping steadily back up in recent months.
In 1996, for example, the surplus in the broadest measure, the current account, fell 31 percent from the previous year to $58.85 billion, the lowest level since 1990. But in January of this year there was a fivefold rise over the January 1996 surplus to $1.24 billion. And in February, Japan's trade surplus continued rising. Further increases in the surplus could lead to renewed trade frictions between the United States and Japan.
"Avoiding a significant increase in the current account surplus and increasing market access are of enormous importance to the nations of the global economy," Mr. Rubin told reporters today in Tokyo. "The nations of the global economy will be watching with great interest to see how Japan meets these challenges."
Mr. Rubin met Japanese leaders today during a brief stop on his way to the Philippines for a weekend meeting of finance ministers from the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
The current account surplus is the excess generated when a country sells more goods and services abroad than it buys. In Japan, it has fallen to 1.4 percent of gross domestic product, from 3.1 percent in 1993.
Japan has been struggling for the last few years to pull its economy out of recession. But American officials have said that Japan's economic recovery should be driven by expansion of the domestic economy, not by increasing exports to the United States and the rest of the world.
A Japanese official said today that Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka had "reaffirmed the objective of providing strong domestic demand-led growth in Japan and avoiding a significant increase in the current account surplus."
Neither Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto nor Mr. Mitsuzuka commented today on specific measures to stimulate the domestic economy.
Prime Minister Hashimoto reassured Mr. Rubin today that Japan's current account surplus would not expand dramatically, Japanese officials said. However, American officials have questioned exactly how Japan will stimulate domestic demand.
The Japanese Government has cut public spending and eliminated income tax cuts. This year, it embarked on an ambitious fiscal austerity plan to reduce its swelling budget deficit, and on April 1 the Government also raised a sales tax to 5 percent from 3 percent.
Still, Prime Minister Hashimoto maintained today that the Government's broad-based deregulation plans would "contribute to the stabilization of the financial system and the sustainable growth of the Japanese economy," according to the Kyodo News Service.
But Mr. Rubin said that he had advised Japanese leaders to consider additional measures if their current macro-economic policy did not prevent a ballooning surplus as the economy grew.
A weakening yen, which has fallen about 50 percent since the spring of 1995, has led to a boom in the exports of cars, electronics and other Japanese products, but Mr. Rubin said he had not discussed currency issues with Japanese leaders.
"I don't believe a nation's currency should be used as an instrument of trade policy," Mr. Rubin said.
Currency traders said Mr. Rubin's comments helped the dollar rise against the yen today because the remarks were less confrontational than they might have been.
The dollar also received a lift from today's employment data in the United States, which traders took to signal that inflation, which undermines the currency, remained under control.
In New York, the dollar hit a six-week high against the yen and rose sharply in most other currency dealings, settling at 124.31 yen, up from 122.65 yen Thursday. The dollar rose to 1.6854 marks, from 1.6685, while the pound fell to $1.6355, from $1.6464.

HEADLINE: Foreign Role in '96 Saudi Bombing Unproven, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John Shalikashvili, said today that the Pentagon did not have sufficient evidence about the bombers who killed 19 American airmen in Saudi Arabia last year to consider retaliation against foreign countries that may have played a role.
"We have a very clear history that we do not let terrorist acts go unanswered," the general said in an interview. "But what we do about it has to be left open until we know really what has happened. And we do not have that information yet." 
 Pentagon officials have suggested in the past that Iran and Syria might have provided support to those who carried out the bombing last June of an apartment complex in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, that housed American pilots and others from the Air Force.
The speculation about a link to Iran grew stronger this month after the Canadian Government arrested an Iranian-educated Saudi man and accused him of driving one of the two cars that accompanied a truck packed with explosives to the site of the bombing.
General Shalikashvili declined comment on the arrest in Canada "because there are negotiations going on," he said without elaboration. But he suggested that the investigation of the attack was far from over, although there was no conclusive evidence so far to show that any particular foreign government had provided assistance to the bombers.
"I will tell you that we're not there yet," he said. "Clearly there are nations out there that support terrorism directly or indirectly, but they have become much smarter about hiding their fingerprints."
"Sure, I'm frustrated," he said about delays in the investigation of the bombing attack at the Khobar Towers apartment complex. But he said delays were understandable, given the increased sophistication and stealth of Middle Eastern terrorists who make Americans a target.
"They are no longer the unsophisticated local dissidents that throw Molotov cocktails," he said. "They are very sophisticated in the whole structure they've set up -- how they train each other, how they call on each other for support, how they move. About the only thing we know is that we must go on the assumption that we will continue to be the victims of terrorism, and that terrorists will hit us again."
Another senior Pentagon official, speaking on condition that he not be identified, said that the investigation of the Dhahran bombing was likely to continue for at least several months and that it might never provide concrete evidence of the involvement of a foreign government.
He drew a comparison between this attack and the bombing of a Berlin discotheque in 1986 in which two off-duty American soldiers were killed, and for which terrorists working with Libya were eventually blamed. Two weeks later, the United States bombed Libya in retaliation.
"We retaliated only after we had concrete intelligence information showing the Libyans were involved with the disco bombing," the Pentagon official said. "There's nothing like that here. They're hiding their tracks better than they used to."
General Shalikashvili said military retaliation was only one of several options for the Clinton Administration if investigators found a clear link between the bombing and a foreign government.
"If the issue is what America's choices will be when this investigation is finished -- and if the investigation were to show some foreign involvement -- then I would say that America will have to make the decision what to do about it," he said. "There are obviously diplomatic tools, economic tools, and there are also military tools.
"I do not want to imply what kind of an act we will take. Those decisions have not been made yet."
Asked about the level of cooperation offered to American investigators by the Saudi Government, General Shalikashvili said he was not in a position to comment because the issue had not come up during his conversations with Saudi military officials.
The F.B.I. is overseeing the American investigation of the bombing. In the past, officials at the bureau and the Justice Department have complained that the American investigation was being hindered by a lack of cooperation from the Saudis.
Despite initial enthusiasm that the arrest in Canada last month might signal a breakthrough in the investigation of the bombing, senior Administration officials have since said it is not clear that there is enough evidence against the 28-year-old Saudi, Hani Abdel Rahim al-Sayegh, to seek his extradition to the United States.

HEADLINE: Physician, Unionize Thyself;
Doctors Adapt to Life as H.M.O. Employees

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

DATELINE: TUCSON, Ariz.

 BODY:
Sixteen years ago, a group of physicians here set up their own health maintenance organization. Two and a half years ago, they sold their practice and the H.M.O. to a California company, getting $3.2 million each. Then, in December, they joined a union to fight the very managed-care company they helped create.
That last decision was unusual, to say the least. The doctors were all specialists at the Thomas-Davis Medical Centers, Tucson's oldest and most prestigious clinic. They belonged to a profession that has always looked down its nose at collective bargaining. And, of course, they were millionaires. 
 Yet here they were, voting by an overwhelming 93-to-32 margin to join the Federation of Physicians and Dentists, an affiliate of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. It was the first time doctors employed by a for-profit managed-care company had unionized anywhere in the United States, according to the federation.
Their motive, it turns out, had little to do with money and almost everything to do with power. "We wanted to be the Mayo Clinic of the West," said Keith Shelman, a specialist in internal medicine and the union coordinator among Thomas-Davis doctors, referring to the famous hospital in Minnesota. But after the Tucson clinic's owner tried to ram through cost-cutting measures and new rules, he said, "there was no choice" but to unionize.
"It wasn't a dollar issue," he said. "It was the issue of not being allowed to be a good doctor."
As managed care has swept the country, with the number of people in H.M.O.'s doubling in eight years to 64 million, everybody involved is trying to cope with the furious pace of change. Consumer advocates complain that profit-driven managed-care providers often deny care to the chronically ill. Congress is debating whether to set Federal health care standards for the companies.
And everywhere, doctors are growing frustrated at their loss of decision-making powers, from gag rules that restrict what doctors can tell patients about treatment options to the practice of releasing patients hours after minor surgery instead of keeping them in the hospital overnight.
To escape such constraints, and to fight shrinking reimbursement rates, some doctors are turning to specialties like cosmetic surgery that are often not a part of managed care. Others, wagering that they can solve the problem by reporting to themselves, are setting up their own H.M.O.'s. And now, a growing number are thinking the once unthinkable: joining together in unions to improve their bargaining power with their new efficiency-obsessed bosses.
"Interest has increased exponentially in the last six months," Barry Liebowitz, director of the Doctors Council in New York, a union of physicians who work in public hospitals, said. "Doctors are having gag orders and drive-through mastectomies imposed on them. They are finding themselves in an economic morass, where professional control translates into economic control."
At Thomas-Davis, the disaffection boiled up suddenly. In 1981, the doctors who owned the clinic set up an H.M.O., Intergroup Health Care. By the mid-1990's, Intergroup Health had become the state's largest H.M.O., with 379,000 members, and the doctors had sold a 40 percent stake to the public. In November 1994, a California company, the Foundation Health Corporation, bought both the clinic and the H.M.O. for $688 million. The 133 physician-shareholders each got Foundation Health stock worth $3.2 million.
The working atmosphere remained relatively benign under the new owners. Then last July, Foundation Health decided to hang onto the H.M.O. but sell Thomas-Davis and another physician group in Sacramento, Calif., to FPA Medical Management Inc. of San Diego for $195 million, a deal that was to be completed by December.
While physicians say Thomas-Davis and its H.M.O. were self-supporting, Foundation Health contended that the clinic did not stand on its own and ran in the red. So, in August, Foundation outlined a plan to chop clinic overhead by $2 million a month. With FPA's endorsement, the plan involved cutting 26 doctors, including specialists such as dermatologists; increasing patient loads, and eliminating records clerks, which forced doctors to type their own charts. It also imposed new bureaucratic restrictions, even denying the obstetrics department chief the freedom to order the type of rubber gloves she wanted.
The physicians rose in revolt. Not only did Foundation Health's plan erode their independence, it bruised their pride. Here they were, they fumed, the elite of Tucson's medical society, and they were being treated like orderlies.
The move to unionize was incited by the iconoclastic figure of Robert C. Osborne, an anesthesiologist in the Tucson area. Dr. Osborne had once made $350,000 a year in his private practice, but his income had shrunk by a third as medical insurers curbed fees, and then plummeted when a local association of anesthesiologists expelled him in a dispute. Last May, he filed for personal bankruptcy, owing $91,000 in Federal taxes.
Feeling he had nothing to lose, Dr. Osborne started a one-man drive last June to interest local doctors in unionizing. "I was kicked out of the marketplace and ruined financially," Dr. Osborne said. "Why not try to make changes? I couldn't be hurt any more than I was."
At first, he generated almost no interest. But when Foundation Health began riling up the Thomas-Davis doctors in August, he took up their cause. Today, he is still in private practice, but finds time to organize nurses and other health professionals, and to educate them about intimidation tactics that he says they are likely to encounter from employers.
The flash point in the clinic's organizing effort, according to Dr. Shelman, came when a senior Foundation Health executive reacted to his complaints by telling him, "If you don't like it, leave." The remark so angered his colleagues, he said, that most of the doctors signed up.
Like the others, Dr. N. Philip Strause 3d might seem an unlikely recruit to organized labor. Dr. Strause, 58, had left a private pediatric practice in Boston in 1990 to join the Tucson clinic with an eye toward teaching and eventual retirement.
"None of us wanted a union," he said. "The administration forced us into it. We wouldn't have to have it if they would treat us professionally. Physicians heard a lot of talk and promises that didn't materialize. The administration was secretive. Our ability to control care was eroded. Our salaries were cut." Dr. Strause was especially upset that the clinic's list of outside specialists lacked a board-certified behavioral pediatric psychiatrist. To get his supervisor's approval to use someone off the list, he said, he sometimes had to threaten that he would advise his patients to seek legal counsel.
Dr. Strause still owns most of the stock he received in the original sale to Foundation, which has gained about 10 percent since then. Paradoxically, he said, that economic cushion is one reason he and his fellow physicians joined a union. "We're the only ones that can afford it," he said.
Even so, around 500 more Thomas-Davis employees, including its nurses and support staff, voted to unionize in February.
The unionization of the Thomas-Davis doctors is being watched closely across the country, and especially in Seattle; Albuquerque, N.M., and Las Vegas, Nev., where similar movements are in their embryonic stages. Until they acted, organized labor had attracted doctors almost exclusively from the public sector. Most of the 3,000 members of the federation, which is based in Tallahassee, Fla., and most of the 5,000 members of the rival Union of American Physicians and Dentists, which is based in Oakland, Calif., are government or university employees. Podiatrists formed a national union last October, also out of frustration with the erosion of their power in managed-care organizations, though they are not medical doctors.
But as the proportion of the nation's 650,000 doctors who are employees rather than private practitioners has surged, to an estimated 42 percent today from 24 percent in 1983, more will turn to unions for the power to bargain collectively, union advocates predict.
So far, the doctors at Thomas-Davis have not won any concessions. Before negotiations on any issues can begin, an FPA Medical Management appeal with the National Labor Relations Board in Washington, D.C., will have to be adjudicated. The company is challenging the doctors' right to organize on the ground that they are supervisors.
"The physicians did not give us an opportunity to show them how we will change things and permit them to run quality, profitable operations," James A. Lebovitz, FPA's general counsel, said.
If the company loses the appeal, the physicians would have limited leverage because they have pledged not to strike, saying a walkout would violate their Hippocratic oath. Even so, Dr. Shelman said, they would have attained their main purpose: the power to bring the clinic's owners to the bargaining table.
Not everybody at Thomas-Davis is a union enthusiast. "The major problem is that the physicians have not made the adjustment from owners to employees," and must now defer to their superiors rather than call their own shots, said Neopito Robles, 65, a surgeon who has been with the clinic since 1968 and opposes the union.
Dr. Robles said the quality of medical care at Thomas-Davis remained undiminished, and he does not believe the union could make it any better. "A number of us are being insulted by this," he said.
Moreover, the American Medical Association remains lukewarm toward unions. Kirk Johnson, the A.M.A.'s general counsel, acknowledged that interest in unions was growing among managed-care doctors who wanted to increase their say in quality-of-care issues. But, he said: "We would defend them if they were challenged. You do not need a union to do that. Once you do, you run the risk that professional values are going to be perceived as not the goal."
Some patients think differently. "If doctors are united, it will give them more power without fear," John Bevan, 67, said outside an adobe-brown Thomas-Davis clinic in Tucson. He detects a deterioration in his care in recent years. In the past, he said, "you got too much attention" from doctors who required seemingly unnecessary return visits.
"Now, you get too little," Mr. Bevan said.
Joan Harphant, 48, a 10-year Thomas-Davis patient with auto-immune disease, said she believed a union would allow doctors to "take charge of their clinics." She said, "Managed care doesn't allow them to treat sick people."

Charts: "Diagnosis: Managed Care"
Dr. Mark Hendrickson, a doctor at Thomas-Davis Medical Centers in Tucson, Ariz., says his support for a doctors' union stems from policies imposed by the corporate owners that affect how he runs his practice. Here are some of his complaints:
 
PATIENT LOAD -- Dr. Hendrickson has been told to increase his patient load from 1,800 to 2,200.
 
SCHEDULING -- With more patients, he must schedule appointments futher and further in advance or send more patients to the clinic's urgent care center.
 
REFERRALS -- Complicated procedures for approving referrals have slowed the process, taking up more of Dr. Hendrickson's time. He is also dissatisfied with the overall quality of the doctors to whom he can refer patients.
 
PAPERWORK -- Paperwork has increased significantly, for everything from referrals to prescribing medication. Instead of dictating his notes, Dr. Hendrickson says he must write them out himself.
 
STAFF -- His medical assistant spends more time on paperwork and less time helping him with patients, leaving the doctor to give instructions on taking drugs and to help with the filing.
 
TIME WITH PATIENTS -- Though he sees the same number of patients each day, the doctor says that all the changes mean that he spends less time with each one.

Clinton Holds Rally For Chemical Weapons Ban
President Clinton made a late push to win Senate ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. At a bipartisan rally, he shared the stage with James Baker, who negotiated the treaty as Secretary of State under President Bush, and other Republicans and military leaders. The pact, already ratified by 70 nations, will take effect on April 29, with or without the United States' participation. 1
 
Death Stalks Hutu Refugees
Hundreds of Hutu refugees from Rwanda have died from weakness and disease in makeshift camps in eastern Zaire, where about 80,000 of them are languishing. A United Nations plan to airlift them to Rwanda from the Kisangani airfield has been stymied by Zairian rebels, who have barred their way. The rebels, mostly ethnic Tutsi from Zaire, said they feared epidemics and the presence of armed Hutu militia leaders. 1
 
Few Clues on Saudi Bombing
The Pentagon lacks adequate evidence about the bombers who killed 19 American airmen in Saudi Arabia last year to warrant retaliation against foreign nations that may have helped them, said Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. A senior Pentagon official said the investigation into the bombing was likely to continue for months and might never yield proof of the involvement of a foreign government. 3
 
Turkey Lashes Out at Germany
Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan of Turkey angrily described recent attacks on Turks in Germany as the result of an "anti-Muslim campaign" there. A Turkish woman and her two children were killed in an arson attack in Krefeld, which the Turkish Government listed as the 17th such attack in 1997. German officials rejected the accusation and charged the husband and father of the arson victims with setting the fire. More than two million Turks live in Germany. 3
 
Strikes Proliferate in France
Strikes and the threat of more have swept across France. Pilots, hospital interns and bank employees have stopped work, and truck drivers have threatened to repeat their strike of last November. Unemployment, at 12.8 percent, is higher than ever, and the popularity of President Jacques Chirac has plummeted, according to polls. The strikers object to cuts in wages and state-mandated benefits they have won over the years. 4
 
Inmates Seize Colombia Jail
Inmates angry about prison conditions in Valledupar in northern Colombia released 2 of at least 10 hostages seized in a violent takeover but demanded bulletproof vests and helicopters before they freed the rest. Four guards were killed when about 10 inmates seized control of the prison on Thursday. The two released were a female guard and a teen-age girl who had been delivering a birthday greeting. (AP)

Jobless Rate Off to 5.2%, Raising Fears of Rate Rise
The unemployment rate edged down to 5.2 percent last month -- matching its lowest level in eight years -- as the buoyant economy produced a bountiful labor market for legions of Americans. 
 Although the Government reported that employers added only 175,000 workers to their payrolls in March, slightly less than expected, every other economic indicator pointed to strong growth that could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise rates again soon. [Page 1.]
 
Prices of Treasury securities fell sharply after the jobs report. The 30-year bond ended the day down 20/32 , to 9330/32 . The bond's yield, a benchmark for many consumer and corporate interest rates, rose to 7.12 percent. [37.]
 
Stocks Rise, Ending Losing Week
The stock market ended its worst week in two years with a fairly impressive gain, despite an employment report that pointed to higher interest rates ahead. After first falling on the employment data, stocks rallied in the afternoon, and the Dow industrials gained 48.72 points to close at 6,526.07. For the week, however, the Dow lost 215 points, or 3.2 percent. The Nasdaq composite also rose sharply -- 22.97 points, or 1.89 percent -- bolstered by a broad rally in technology stocks. Drug and biotechnology stocks also regained some of their earlier luster. [36.]
 
F.T.C. Bars Staples Merger Plan
The F.T.C. rejected the proposed $4 billion merger of two office supply discounters, Staples and Office Depot, in a 4-to-1 vote that set the stage for a possible court battle. The commission, acting over objections from some staff members, voted to seek a Federal court injunction against the merger, which would have created a chain with more than 1,000 stores and $10 billion in annual sales. [1.]
 
Pilot Leaders Back American Pact
Union leaders representing American Airlines' pilots endorsed a tentative contract with the carrier and will send it to their 9,300 members for a ratification vote. Investors took it as a sign that American was on course to put nearly three years of labor strife behind it, and shares of the parent AMR Corporation rose $3.875 to close at $86.375. [11.]
 
Gallo Wins Label Decision
Handing the E.& J. Gallo Winery a victory, a Federal jury in San Francisco ruled that Gallo's Turning Leaf brand did not deliberately duplicate the appearance of Kendall-Jackson's Vintners Reserve, a premium wine, in an attempt to deceive consumers. Kendall-Jackson sued Gallo, contending it had copied its label's multicolored vine leaves and the flared neck of its bottle. The jury said the similarities were common in the industry. [10.]
 
Ukrainian Venture Raises Eyebrows
A partnership between Ronald S. Lauder and Vadim Rabinovich for a television venture in Ukraine has raised eyebrows among Western diplomats and businessmen, both in Washington and in Kiev. Mr. Lauder is an urbane former United States ambassador to Austria and heir to a cosmetics fortune. Mr. Rabinovich, a self-made Ukrainian millionaire, spent nine years in a Soviet prison for theft and has been linked to a suspected Russian criminal figure. Their venture has apparently received favorable treatment from the Ukrainian Government. [4.]
 
France Mired in Labor Trouble
In France, economic troubles are bedeviling the Government of President Jacques Chirac. Unemployment is higher than ever, at 12.8 percent, and every day seems to bring a new French strike. This week alone, pilots of the money-losing state-owned domestic airline, Air Inter, grounded all flights to and from Paris for two days. [4.]
 
Confessions Sell, Publishers Find
In the publishing world, confessions sell. In an anxious and flat sales environment, publishers are buying the real life memoirs of brother-sister incest, drug addiction and cross-dressing seduction. Anorexia is a particularly high-fashion literary theme. [1.]

HEADLINE: F.T.C. Rejects Deal To Join Two Giants Of Office Supplies

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
The Federal Trade Commission, acting over objections from some staff members, rejected today the proposed $4 billion merger of two office supply discounters, Staples Inc. and Office Depot Inc.
The commission voted 4 to 1 to seek a Federal court injunction against the merger, which would have created an office superstore chain with more than 1,000 stores and $10 billion in annual sales. 
William J. Baer, director of the F.T.C. antitrust division, said that the proposed deal was an undisguised and illegal attempt to eliminate competition between the two chains and would inevitably lead to higher prices for consumers.
Today's action reflects a growing aggressiveness in antitrust enforcement by the F.T.C., which was relatively passive during the Bush and Reagan Administrations. But several legal and market analysts said that in this case the commission was moving into uncharted legal territory and they predicted that it would have considerable difficulty swaying a judge to its view.
The unexpected action came after Staples and Office Depot had agreed to sell 63 stores to their only other competitor in the office supply superstore market, Officemax Inc. Commission officials had earlier indicated that such a sale of some stores would address the commission's concerns about the merger.
Thomas G. Stemberg, chairman of Staples, denounced the commission action as "bizarre" and contended that the agency had negotiated with the companies in bad faith. He said, however, that he had not yet decided whether to fight the issue in court.
"I'm flabbergasted that the commission did not vote today to approve this deal," Mr. Stemberg said in a telephone conference call with reporters. "I'm amazed the F.T.C. is allowed to operate in this Alice in Wonderland fashion."
In the last two years, the F.T.C. required several supermarket and department store chains that sought to merge to divest themselves of significant numbers of stores to maintain competition in their regions. Last year, it blocked the proposed merger of the Rite Aid and Revco drugstore chains because, agency officials contended, the combination would leave millions of consumers with no low-cost outlet for prescription drugs.
The commission did allow the merger of two pharmaceutical giants, Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz, to proceed last year, but only after requiring that they divest themselves of $1 billion in assets to prevent the combined company from dominating several market segments.
Regarding the Staples case, James F. Rill, who served as the top Justice Department antitrust officer in the Bush Administration, said the F.T.C.'s argument rested on the theory that office supply superstores were a market in themselves, distinct from the much larger market for office goods sold through catalogues, discount chains and stationery stores.
"I find the market definition that's been developed here to be curious and narrow," Mr. Rill said. "If that's the basis of their case, they're in for a horse race."
But the consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who has opposed the deal, called the commission's action a "watershed" and said it was evidence that the Clinton Administration was serious about enforcing antitrust laws. "Today's action is more significant than just this case," he said in an interview. "The F.T.C. does not behave this way usually. Antitrust law has been pretty moribund and now it is stirring again."
Mr. Baer of the F.T.C. said that there appeared to be no way that the proposed combination could be altered to answer the commission's objections. "The vote today reflects a fundamental belief that this transaction as structured is flawed," he said at a news conference. "There isn't a settlement out there that will solve the underlying competitive problem."
Only one or two such merger disputes a year actually go to trial; most are settled or dropped before reaching a courtroom. Over the last 10 years, the F.T.C. has won about 60 percent of the cases it litigated, Mr. Baer said. "The reason is that these are the close calls," he said. "Only the tough ones go to court."
The commission was more closely divided than the 4-to-1 vote indicated. The dissenting commissioner, Roscoe B. Starek 3d, said that the agreement to sell the 63 stores to Officemax would solve the problem of decreased competition in those markets where only Staples and Office Depot now have outlets.
Another commissioner, Mary L. Azcuenaga, voted with the majority to reject the settlement, but she also expressed a belief that the merger as originally proposed was legal.
The staff, too, was sharply split, officials acknowledged, with a number of senior aides recommending that the deal be approved.
Today's setback for the proposed deal sent the shares of Office Depot tumbling $6 each, to $13, on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of Staples rose 62.5 cents, to $21.875, in Nasdaq trading. Office Max shares were off $1.125, to $11.875, on the Big Board.
James P. Stoeffel, who tracks emerging growth companies for Smith Barney, said of the vote, "Clearly, they're making this a test case based on some econometric models they've developed." He predicted that Staples would prevail in court if it chose to devote the time and money to a long legal battle.
"The F.T.C.," he said, "has fundamentally misunderstood what this business is about and who the competitors are and what Staples's strategy is. They have done a huge disservice to the very people they claim to be looking out for, the consumers."
Consumer advocates cheered the action, agreeing with the commission that elimination of one of the three players in the superstore segment would reduce competition.
Howard Metzenbaum, chairman of the Consumer Federation of America, said that it was "indisputable" that the merger would have cost consumers money and that the plan to sell stores to Officemax would not have substantially altered the effects of the deal. He predicted that the commission would win in court.
At the F.T.C., Mr. Baer cited pricing studies as the basis of the commission's conclusion that the level of superstore competition was the chief variable in the setting of prices for a variety of goods.

HEADLINE: Talking Shop

BYLINE: By Claudia Dreifus; Claudia Dreifus, a contributing writer to the Magazine, is the author of "Interview," to be published next month.

 BODY:
Once upon a retailing time -- 50, 100 years ago -- the great merchant princes came from enterprising Jewish-American families, and they were elegant showmen bringing new ideas to the more insulated corners of America. In today's global economy, store owners often come from abroad, and they remain entertainers. The modern-day shop is a happening. The contemporary merchant is at once a salesman, an impresario and a restaurateur.
 Here, three 1990's retailers -- Stanley Marcus, who was chairman of Neiman Marcus for 25 years and is still a consultant to retailers worldwide; Ingvar Kampard, the founder of Ikea, and Richard Branson, the balloon-traveling force behind the Virgin empire -- talk about how they sell by putting on a show. 
 Interestingly, two of these merchants -- Marcus and Kampard -- do a lot of their own shopping at Britain's Marks & Spencer, possibly the least entertaining store on the planet. Why? "They give good value," Kampard says quaintly.
 
Stanley Marcus, 92. President of Narrowcasting, chairman emeritus of Neiman Marcus.
 
Q: Your family has been in merchandising for more than a century. How would you characterize the state of retailing as we move toward the millennium?
A: It seems to me that the department store is in serious trouble. I'm talking about the rank-and-file stores, with Macy's and Bloomingdale's being something of an exception.
The department store was a product of the 19th century and became a very important institution as America went into the 20th century. It provided show places in developing towns like Terre Haute, Sacramento and Dallas. It was at the department store where people got away from provincialism. But today, they are beset by all sorts of competition -- catalogues, the Internet, discounters and highly specialized stores, like Toys "R" Us.
Around the 60's, the department stores began to be run by controllers, who were looking at every department in terms of profitability. And they said, "We can't make any money on refrigerators or stoves -- let's get rid of 'em."And they did. They did the same thing with electronics. The one classification of merchandise that is the most exciting new source of invention, they got out of. It's my contention that there are some things you have to carry even if you don't make any money on them.
I'd like to put together a think tank of people -- economists, futurists, city planners, a few department-store people -- to discuss reinventing the department store. I have some ideas of my own. For instance, I think that the department store of the future will have to have some kind of entertainment. It will have to develop a way of selling goods at lower markups. But I don't know if it's absolutely necessary for them to meet the discounters' prices -- so long as they offer the public better service and a more tasteful assortment.
 
Q: An entertaining store -- what would that be like?
A: I think food. A variety of food experiences at a variety of prices. And stores may very well present live entertainment. Outside New York, where there's less live entertainment, I could see stores having on-site concerts, offbeat performances that take advantage of the local idiom of expression. Exhibitions are also key -- like showing the origin of design through merchandising. For instance, I'm wearing a houndstooth-check tie. What is its origin? I think people would have a great interest in seeing how fashion originates and how things are made. In Japanese department stores, they dedicate one floor to an art gallery. Or you could have demonstrations of glassmaking or flower arranging, or an exhibition of the drawings of Frank Lloyd Wright.
 
Q: So what you're saying is that stores could become more like museums, while museums seem to be becoming more like stores?
A: Yes. I was in the Metropolitan recently, and I was flabbergasted when I saw the size of their store. They are selling everything from rugs to jewelry.
 
Q: Which stores do you see doing great merchandising?
A: Marks & Spencer. Because as Sir Marcus Seif himself says, they are "obsessed with merchandise." They are constantly looking for things that are newer and better. I also like what Jean-Louis Dumas does at Hermes, and Gordon Segal of Crate and Barrel. They're making a real strong attempt to lead the market to a higher plateau. Whenever you set a taste standard, you are being presumptuous, and these merchants dare to be that.
 
Q: If you were to redesign the suburban mall, what would it look like?
A: It would be located near where people live. A store of the next century could have imaginative vending machines, maybe designed by Disney. They'd wink at you or smile at you when you put your money in -- something to make it fun. You could sell cosmetics, underwear, slippers -- probably 30 to 40 percent of department-store stock -- in a vending machine. The machines would make many salespersons obsolete, and that would bring down the markup.
 
Q: Where do you shop for yourself?
A: At Neiman Marcus. I get a 30 percent discount. I also go to Sears twice a year, to see what's happening there. And I always learn something.
 
Ingvar Kampard, 70. Founder and chairman of the Ikea Group, with 134 stores in 28 countries.

Q: What is your background?
A: I am the son of a farmer who grew up in Augunnaryd, in the south of Sweden. I went to what I guess you would call a trade school. And it was there that I started to be interested in the way factories turn out products for the consumer. When I was about 17, I began to wonder why only the affluent could afford beautiful furnishings. Swedish design was very popular then, but it was too expensive. It seemed to me that if you could reorganize production and distribution processes, it might become possible to sell beautiful items the majority could afford. That was more or less the beginning of the Ikea concept. We started out in mail order and opened a small store in 1958.
 
Q: How do you keep prices low?
A: Well, for instance, the backs of most of our bookcases are not lacquered. For products that we lacquer everywhere, we'll use second-level materials rather than prime quality. Our designers must constantly ask themselves, How can we eliminate a few steps from the production? How can we save money on materials?And we pass on the savings. The designers, for instance, came up with the idea of packing the unassembled furniture into flat boxes, which saves on shipping, storage and assembly.
 
Q: You ask consumers to haul these flat packages home themselves and then assemble them. When I think of assembling it myself, it's a big barrier. Do people resent doing that?
A: Some do. And for them, we have a service: we'll assemble and ship the pieces, at an extra cost.
 
Q: Your stores have supervised playrooms for children, free use of baby strollers, private rooms for nursing mothers. Why the child-friendliness?
A: Because we want people to spend two or three hours in the stores and see what we have. Why push children to shop for furnishings? Who can make a decision with a 5-year-old clinging to their knees? We want to make it easy for young families to get their homes started. Or, put another way, we do nothing to stop people from buying from us.
 
Q: Why do most of the stores have a restaurant and a bistro?
A: For the same reason. We want people to spend time with us, to plan what they buy -- and we want to make all of that easy. We provide pencils and pads and tape measures and information about the various products. We have lockers for coats, tote bags to carry around impulse purchases, plenty of bathrooms, 50 or more sample rooms for people to inspect. So it's nice that they can go into the restaurant, have themselves a Swedish-meatball luncheon and plan how they are going create their living rooms. The store in Almhult, Sweden, even has a hotel with a swimming pool and a sauna attached to it.
 
Q: What's the idea behind all the special events?
A: To make shopping fun, pleasant. We are normally a destination store -- people travel maybe an hour and a half to get to us. Our most popular event is the Christmas-tree rental. You can rent a tree for $20, and when you bring it back we mulch it for your garden and give you a coupon for merchandise. It's a great way to increase traffic.
 
Q: Have you made a mistake that's turned into a fiasco?
A: Recently, we invested in a big sawmill in Russia, and it was a disaster. We lost everything. Also, I must tell you that I am a little bit ashamed of the Elizabeth, N.J., store, because we can't give good service to our customers. There are many queues, and many times it is overcrowded.
 
Q: Where do you shop for yourself?
A: I admire Marks & Spencer. They are very eager to declare, to give very good information about all they sell. They have also a reasonable price level, and you can trust the quality.
 
Q: How much of the culture of Ikea comes from the character of Ingvar Kampard?
A: Well, I'm known as a very thrifty person, and the stores are meant for people like me. I don't fly first class on the airplanes, and the stores' executives don't either. Once, I was in a store in Sweden and I saw cans of deep-fried chicken from Poland. I wondered what the Poles did with the chicken feathers. So I investigated, and it seemed that they were being thrown away. Then we began buying their chicken feathers and using them for stuffing throw pillows.
 
Richard Branson, 46. Chairman, Virgin Group, which includes Virgin Atlantic airline, Virgin Cola, V2 record company and the 13-country, 122-shop Virgin Megastores chain.
 
Q: You started your merchandising career in the 1970's, when you were publishing a youth-culture magazine called Student. Why go retail?
A: Because of an English post-office strike in 1979. I was 19. We had a little mail-order company, which sold records cheaper than everybody else. But then when the postal strike went on for seven weeks, suddenly the business was in danger of going [out] of business. And so I found a run-down empty floor in the back of a shoe shop, and overnight we moved all the mail-order records into it. We had pillows on the floor, headphones so people would listen to the records, and people would be smoking dope, and it was, you know, very much a sort of hippie post-60's store.
 
Q: Till you came along, British record stores were rather stuffy, solemn places.
A: Very stuffy. Moreover, they would sell an [Andy Williams] record next to a Frank Zappa record! There was no discrimination in taste. And, you know, we sold bootlegs and other things that the standard record shops would never dream of touching.
 
Q: Stanley Marcus says the future of retailing lies in stores having good restaurants and running cultural events.
A: I agree. We have live concerts. We have 600 listening areas and 100 laserdisk stations in the New York store. We're setting up Internet areas where people can sit down and play. There are couches in the classical-music section and a grand piano. And a good bookshop and cafe.
 
Q: Where does Richard Branson shop?
A: I don't. I'm afraid I'm a male chauvinist. I hate shopping. My wife, Joan, does the shopping. She goes to a lot of little boutiques. She loves the Gap, Banana Republic, Harrod's, Bloomingdale's.
 Yesterday, I bought something for myself for the first time in 10 years. I was going to the Grammy Awards, and my suitcase didn't turn up on a certain airline and I had no clothes.
 
Q: On your own airline?
A: On my own airline! So I went to Saks and got this Armani tuxedo, with a very pleasant person serving.
 
Q: What will the megastore of the future look like?
A: It will be a giant entertainment complex with a 30-screen cinema, a cafe, possibly a place you can put your children while you're shopping. Plus, the best record collection and a really good bookshop. You ought to be able to go into a Virgin Megastore and spend eight or nine hours there and not feel pressured to buy anything. It will be like a cultural emporium.
Now, the reason we have to do all this is because in the future the consumer will be able to pick up the phone and have records delivered. Films will come through the wires. The only way retailers are going to succeed is to make the whole thing a better experience than what they get by staying home.
 
Q: Retailing experts tell me that the Virgin Megastore at Times Square exists not so much for profit as to establish a New York presence for all your companies. Is that store really just a huge billboard?
A: Well funnily enough, the price of renting the billboard space outside on Times Square would cost us more today than the rent we pay for the whole store. So the store [is] a gigantic billboard.
It would have been worth us doing the Times Square store just to break even in order to get the exposure. Still, Virgin retail is a busines, and, fortunately, a very profitable business. We're opening about 13 new stores in the U.S. in the next 12 months.
 
Q: Do you see yourself as selling things other than entertainment and entertainment software?
A: Oh yes, we see ourselves as branching out into other areas. For instance, about a year ago, one of the airline's hostesses came to me and said that she'd just gotten married, and getting the wedding together had been a tough experience. She wanted to set up a shop called Virgin Bride, where somebody could see the best range of wedding dresses, have makeup and manicures done, people to do the hair, and then they could use Virgin Holidays to arrange the honeymoon and a planner to help organize the reception. If they wanted to get married underwater or whatever, we'd arrange that. So we've just opened Virgin Bride in London, which was her dream. And now we're looking at the fact that mostly about nine months later, all these girls will be pregnant, and we're considering Virgin Babies next. Maybe Virgin Dating. We could have all three.
 
Q: The whole life cycle. How about Virgin Funerals?
A: Virgin [what]?
 
Q: Virgin Funerals.
A: Well, it's something worth looking at. I mean, I never dreamed that we'd now have Virgin Pensions and Virgin Life Insurance and be moving into banking. So we're getting quite close to the funerals anyway.

But this design is in a strange moment right now. I think Bloomingdale's is smart enough to wait for it to come back into hipness." T.K.

 BODY:

 CARSON VALLEY
 By Bill Barich.
 337 pp. New York:
 Pantheon Books. $25. 
 A successful novelist must also be something of a magician, distracting his audience with grand gestures or intricate small turns, deftly camouflaging the tricks that support his fictional illusions. Usually this is the sort of act that takes many years -- and sometimes many books -- to perfect. But in his first novel, Bill Barich delivers a seasoned performance.
 Then again, Mr. Barich is hardly a neophyte. He's published a collection of short stories ("Hard to Be Good") and a book of essays ("Traveling Light"), many of which first appeared in The New Yorker. He's also written a lively travelogue of his home state, "Big Dreams: Into the Heart of California." In fact, California seems to have been his obsession for many years. Moving from its deserted seacoast towns to its abandoned mills, from the crowded Los Angeles suburbs to the desert interior, he writes about the environment, the people, the way of life, the philosophy, the perspective that is California. In particular, he is fascinated by the contrast between the needs of individual Californians and the relentlessly depersonalized machinery of modern American life.
 Mr. Barich draws on all these concerns in constructing the plot of "Carson Valley." Although the central focus of the novel is a love story, this action is set against a vivid social landscape. Almost every member of his cast of characters is involved, on one side or the other, in the struggle to maintain the independence of a small, old-fashioned vineyard in the wine country north of San Francisco.
 Anna Torelli is the vineyard owner's daughter, a Berkeley graduate who left her father's farm to marry a young lawyer from a family of stockbrokers and surgeons. Following a miscarriage and the failure of her marriage, she has sworn off all romantic entanglements. At the opening of the novel, she has come back to California to care for her mother, who is dying of cancer, and to try to reach a truce with her aging father, Victor, who is ready to relinquish responsibility for his business interests. Somehow, despite all her resolutions, she finds herself drifting into an affair with Arthur Atwater, grandson of one of her father's oldest friends, who has been hired to manage the vineyard.
 Arthur, a resolutely solitary man, lives in a trailer on the edge of the property. Though his previous history includes work as a roustabout, cabbie, carpenter and bartender (and though he has a tendency to disappear on a bender at the first hint of trouble), Anna admires "his integrity in facing the world as he truly was, without any mask." In Arthur, she finds, "there was nothing false. All his actions and convictions, right or wrong, admirable or despicable -- and he could be despicable -- had a wholeness about them, a richness and a roundness, as if he had cast off every imaginary and fantastic version of himself long ago."
 Threading through the narrative of Anna and Arthur's attraction is a history of the valley, coupled with an apprehensive look forward to its future. For as gentrification erodes the boundaries of the small vineyards, big business threatens them from within. Victor Torelli has reluctantly signed a contract with a larger wine company, under whose policies Atwater chafes. "You can trust a computer, or you can trust me," he tells Victor, unable to contain his mounting frustration.
 The economic and class structure of the valley helps to propel the domino-like action of the plot, drawing in not only the big-money vintners with their mansions in the hills but growers like Torelli, upon whom the vintners depend. Also affected, of course, are the field managers like Atwater and his Mexican-American crew boss, Antonio Lopez, as well as the hordes of legal and illegal Mexican laborers who descend on the vineyards at harvest time.
 With easy grace, Mr. Barich moves among the various perspectives of his characters: from Victor Torelli to his daughter, from Arthur Atwater to Antonio Lopez to Omar Perez, a young illegal immigrant. This shifting viewpoint has ethical as well as esthetic consequences, illuminating the individual tragedies of characters like Omar and Antonio, who might otherwise have remained in the background.
 By interweaving these characters' stories, Mr. Barich also allows them to challenge one another: he clearly intends for us to compare the long and solid marriage of Claire and Victor to the budding liaison between Anna and Arthur -- and to the dissatisfied union between Antonio and his common-law wife as they argue about whether he should give up the underpaid work that he loves to take a job with a construction company in the suburbs. Each situation forces the reader to confront the same questions about the truths and lies that are tangled up in romantic and familial love -- but they are seen from quite different angles. And as the characters refine their relationships -- breaking them off, cutting them back, pushing them forward -- the analogy with the work in the vineyard supports the construction of the book as a whole.
 Mr. Barich once lived on vineyard land in a trailer much like Arthur Atwater's, looking down on the same oxbow of the Russian River as the Torelli farm. He has done his research by living it, and the reader becomes absorbed in his descriptions of the vineyard's daily routine as it pushes toward the harvest. There are a few places where the narrative runs close to being overwritten, almost as if Mr. Barich had got drunk on the riches of the countryside around him, but he usually stops short of the brink, contrasting the lush backdrop of the natural world with the crude and quirky qualities of his characters.
 Buttressing his realism, however, there is also a sense of magic. Mr. Barich pulls in fate and luck with an elegant sleight of hand that guides his characters to their difficult destinies and sweeps the novel toward a denouement filled not only with deception, betrayal and sorrow, but with forgiveness as well.

HEADLINE: Hopscotching Around Asheville

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS; GLENN COLLINS is a reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
AS challenges go, it seemed to have a low degree of difficulty: to plan a spur-of-the-moment tour in October of western North Carolina around Asheville. After all, the region has an abundance of history, woodsy splendor and estimable attractions, not to mention that famous travel-poster highway that winds over the North Carolina border to Tennessee. Surely, organizing a five-day visit could be left to the very last moment.
But in a hasty blitz of armchair planning, my wife, Sarah, and I collided with a baffling reality: The guidebooks we consulted described a bewildering array of options and assumed -- incorrectly -- that we had weeks to linger in the region. The more we read, the more impossible it seemed to design a sampler that would hit the high points in some sensible fashion. 
 How to proceed? We sought emergency advice from friends in Durham. O.K., they said over the phone, You could stay in Asheville. But that wasn't the Smokies. Of course, you could visit the Smokies, but that wasn't at all Asheville. Then there were the scenic treasures of the Flat Rock area south of Asheville, and the glories of the Appalachian region to the northeast. And oh, yes, there was this Tennessee town, Gatlinburg, a sort of Disneyland of the Southern Highlands, described to us as "Reno without gambling, and not to be missed."
Confused as we were, the vacation deadline forced decisiveness. We picked five places to stay almost at random, and trusted to luck. Our goals? To indulge in a maximum of garden-variety tourism, to get in as much good eating as possible, and to add enough hard-core hiking to offset all the eating. Most important, we needed to economize since we'd already tanked our travel budget with an extravagant trip to Italy.
The compromise: We snagged a skinflint air fare, made reservations in expensive restaurants and booked cheap motels.
We got a low fare to Greensboro, half a state away from Asheville, which gave us a chance to explore the huge, exquisitely appointed showroom and, yes, museum at Replacements Ltd. Moments after landing in Greensboro we were accelerating north on I-85 in our rented Corsica to see this $52 million company, which maintains the world's largest inventory of old and new patterns of china, silver and crystal.
For those who are wild about antique porcelain and flatware, which we are, Replacements Ltd. is the Florence of table settings. Just the sight of all that tableware worked up our appetites, so afterward we rewarded ourselves with osso buco and salmon with sweet-potato pancakes in a smart Greensboro restaurant, Undercurrent.
Then the weather changed. Heavy rain was expected to engulf the entire Southeast the next day. Concerned that our scenic-view tour of verdant North Carolina was in jeopardy, we revved up the car and made the three-hour dash to Asheville.
The hill-bound jewel of Buncombe County has often been celebrated as a tourist paradise of stately homes, gracious squares and picturesque downtown streets sporting Gothic Revival and Art Deco architecture. We didn't have time to discover all of the antiques emporiums and cafes, but we enjoyed a tour of the Victorian boardinghouse that is the Thomas Wolfe Memorial.
The house, once owned by Wolfe's censorious mother, was described in "Look Homeward, Angel," and is timeless enough that visitors expect the young Thomas to appear at any moment, offering a prolix assessment of the town that now celebrates his memory. That night, a happy discovery was the restaurant 23 Page at the Haywood Park Hotel, where we had pecan-dredged mountain trout and black-sesame-seared sea scallops.
Our problem, when we returned to our motel, was the puzzler we'd started with: What to see when there is so much there there? Dreading the thought of cracking the guidebooks again, we resolved to take the lazy tourist's way out and collected a bunch of glossy brochures from the motel lobby.
Sarah liked the picture of Chimney Rock Park, dominated by a 2,280-foot-high thumb of gneiss overlooking Lake Lure. "Tourist trap," I said, "I can just tell."
Sarah was insistent, and so was the stationary front: Heavy rain would arrive in the afternoon. This made the slow drive south on I-26 behind logging trucks all the more frustrating. But Chimney Rock was a happy discovery. Tourist magnet though it is, the park is a spectacular privately owned nature preserve. We spent the morning exploring its steep hiking trails and 404-foot waterfall.
To our surprise, we also found that the centerpiece of the Sky Lounge gift shop was a vitrine-cum-shrine to the actor Daniel Day-Lewis and the filming of the 1992 movie "The Last of the Mohicans," part of which was made at Chimney Rock. A kindly cashier gave us a list of the film's other shooting locations and, impulsively, we decided to visit as many as we could.
But the weather front had arrived -- high wind, lashing rain and fog. We wondered: Could we beat the rain westward? We took to local roads and somehow managed to outpace the slowly approaching front. Racing an hour and a half to the Smokies, we hoped to have at least one chance to hike on a dry trail there. At last, booming through the overcast but rain-free landscape of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, we intersected the Appalachian Trail not far from Newfound Gap.
The A.T., as the trail is known in the hiking universe, is the 2,160-mile path that wends its way from Georgia to Maine. We unceremoniously dumped the Corsica on the shoulder of the road and stumbled onto the A.T. just as the mist rolled in and the storm began toying with the great forest about us.
The fog formed into spitting rain as the front finally arrived. But before us were the reassuring white tree-trunk blazes of the Appalachian Trail. The path was rugged but relatively dry; the ancient trees buffered the drizzle. We hiked several miles -- past steel fences used to keep out wild boar -- encountering no people and no boar.
We decided to turn back only when the light began to fade. When we finally reached the car, our most urgent problem was ravenous hunger. The map suggested that we were but 20 mountainous miles from Gatlinburg. So we continued on the twisty but picturesque Newfound Gap Road, reaching Gatlinburg in less than an hour.
There it was: a hillbilly tinseltown in the mountains. Passing prominent signs boasting variously of 1,000 and 2,000 available hotel rooms, we drove about, awed by a world-class conglomeration of tourist glitz and catchpenny gaud ranging from the Aerial Tramway and Sky Lift to the Celebrity Museum of the Stars and the Guinness World Records Museum.
We settled for what looked to be the least tacky eatery, an ersatz chalet-style dining palace where we were served an indifferent meal of frozen fish and tired roast beef. So we wandered the town some more, admiring the swagger of the wedding chapels where close to 20,000 couples are married every year, and then made the 34-mile drive back to our motel in Cherokee.
It was overcast next morning, threatening but drier. We quickly determined that the town of Cherokee -- home to the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians and tribal-owned gambling emporiums -- was the East Coast market leader in beaded moccasins. The friendly staff of the Cherokee Visitor Center directed us to a collection of glossy travel brochures so we could scientifically select our next destination. Rejecting the calls to whitewater rafting and petting zoos, we opted for the "spectacle of Linville Gorge and Falls." During the subsequent two-hour drive, we realized that this was another of the shooting locations for "The Last of the Mohicans."
Rain threatened again as we arrived at the parking lot of the Linville Gorge Wilderness Area. The brochure did not lie: We took several hikes to view a variety of perspectives at Linville Falls, a phenomenal Mixmaster of water pounding down through a tough quartzite ridge.
At the National Park Service Visitor Center nearby, we asked directions to Grandfather Mountain, another natural phenomenon that seemed to be a favorite of the brochure-writing industry. But 15 minutes later, our hearts sank as we approached the entrance to the mountain preserve. The laconic gatekeeper in the booth told us: "There is no view today. And our radio says there's a dark-weather line heading toward us."
We felt it was nevertheless our duty to plunk down the outrageous entrance fee (now $20 for two). We headed to the top of Grandfather Mountain to see its famous mile-high swinging bridge, the highest suspension footbridge in the United States. We vowed to walk it even in a typhoon.
As soon as we reached the summit, the sun emerged hesitantly from the fog. The horizon cleared. We discovered that we were above a glorious immensity of peaks, the southern Appalachian Mountains. We tramped out onto the sturdy but still-scary Swinging Bridge. Yes, it moved with our steps, ringing metallically as we traversed the chasm to the outcrop on the other side.
Scrambling to the summit, high above the cottony mist in the valleys, we gave thanks to the gods of mountains and weather. Owing to the discouraging honesty of the gatekeeper, we shared this perfect Kodak moment with only two other tourists. And before our eyes, an entirely different sector of the Asheville region had been revealed.
That night we stayed in the hamlet of Little Switzerland at the only real hotel we could afford on the trip: the Switzerland Inn, a homey Southern chalet with piney walls, a roaring fire and the woodsy hubbub of conversation in the lobby. The next day we hopscotched west through the overcast back to the Biltmore Estate in Asheville.
George Vanderbilt's famous 1895 mansion is the largest private home in America and it looks as if it very much yearns to be in the Loire Valley. The hefty admission price of $27.95 a person is worth every penny; the 250-room house, its grounds and winery kept us content for a whole day.
That night, in the neighboring sprawl of Biltmore Village, where the original construction workers and tradesmen once lived, we dined in the Criterion Grill, an unassuming local institution serving delicacies such as blackeyed peacakes -- sort of refried beans with a spicy salsa and black bean sauce -- and crab-and-corn flan, with crabmeat, corn, roast garlic and roast red pepper puree.
The next day, there was time for a last hurrah before the long drive to the airport in Greensboro. We headed northeast to Table Rock Mountain, the other-worldly setting for the concluding scene in "The Last of the Mohicans." After urging the Corsica 13 miles on a mercilessly winding gravel road, we parked and hiked 45 extremely vertical minutes to the summit, past rare mountain heather and Table Mountain pines (their bristles require fire to germinate). Our last overview of the region was a mountain panorama bathed in golden sun.
The tedium of the flight home was relieved by a satisfying realization: that only by stumbling around the North Carolina highlands had we been able to make any sense of the area. We knew now that four distinct tourist regions had presented themselves: Asheville itself, and the fascinations of Biltmore; the Flat Rock area to the south; the Great Smokies to the west, and the Appalachian high country to the northeast. We'd cherry-picked them all.
Next time we'll spend a week in each region. Just as the guidebooks had suggested -- had we only been able to comprehend them.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE & MONEY;
Surviving the Crush of Student Loans

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL; Saul Hansell reports on banking for The New York Times

 BODY:
It's getting to be a few years after graduation and some of the finer points covered in those 8 A.M. economics lectures are slipping away. Still, you remember enough to notice that your income is looking micro as your bills go macro. The monthly tab on your student loans reminds you of the recurring hangovers from those college homecoming parties.
 If this sounds familiar, you're not alone. With overall consumer borrowing now surging to record levels, more people are finding that their student loans are getting too heavy to juggle; some nine million student loans are in default, according to the United States Department of Education. 
 "We are seeing more people in their late 20's who didn't get the job they had planned for," said Joanne Budde, executive director of the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of San Francisco. Typically, Ms. Budde added, these young adults have several maxed-out credit cards and "a lot of student loans."
 It's true that student loans can burden graduates with debts in the tens of thousands. But the good news is that they can be among the most flexible for borrowers seeking easier terms.
 Chances are that your student loans come from one of two sources: A bank or private lender that granted you a Government-guaranteed loan (a Stafford loan, for example) or a loan made directly by the Government (a William D. Ford Federal loan).
 Both types give you a number of ways to ease the pain of paying off, depending on your circumstances: deferring all payments for awhile, making lower monthly payments for a time or consolidating several loans into one. If you are having trouble making your payments, the first step is to call your lender so you can check out the options.
 To qualify for a deferral, you must have returned to school, or have entered an internship or other training program, or be unemployed or facing various other financial hardships. Returning-to-school deferrals apply as long as you are at least a half-time student. Hardship deferrals last up to three years.
 If you don't qualify for a deferral, apply for a forbearance, under which monthly payments are reduced or even postponed for a period of time. Unlike a deferral, however, a forbearance does not stop interest from accruing.
 If you apply for either a deferment or a forbearance, be sure to include all of your loans. (If you don't know how many you have, hunt up the documents you signed originally or ask your lenders to help.)
 If you don't qualify to postpone some or all of your loan payments in these ways, you may be allowed to switch to other plans that offer lower monthly payments or longer terms -- for example, graduated pay-back plans and programs that tie payments to income.
 But if you have more than one loan, before you take advantage of such programs, you might want to consolidate your loans.
 Consolidation loans are available from the Federal Government's direct loan program and from private lenders alike. Parents, too, can consolidate loans, if they used them to finance the education of several children. But the loans of both parents and their children can't be consolidated together.
 Some lenders offer consolidation loans only to borrowers who have at least one of their student loans from them. Others will refinance anyone's loans. Sallie Mae (1-800-891-4599), the private entity that buys and services many student loans from banks, says it is the largest provider of consolidation loans in the country. Consolidation loans are also available from the Federal Government's direct student loan program. (1-800-557-7392)
 The terms for consolidation loans among the various lenders are similar, but it pays to shop around.
 The direct student loan program charges 8.25 percent for consolidation loans, for example, but Sallie Mae and other private lenders calculate the average rate on the merged loans and round that up to the next full percentage point. (Since most recent student loans carry an 8.25 percent rate, that means a rate of 9 percent.) So even if your lender is a private one, you might want to apply to the direct student loan program for a consolidation.
 Many private lenders, however, do offer ways to reduce interest costs for borrowers -- on consolidation and other types of loans.
 Sallie Mae, for example, will cut the interest rate by one-quarter of a percentage point for borrowers who have their payments electronically deducted from their checking accounts. And for customers who make the first 48 payments on time, the agency will cut the rate by 2 percentage points for the remaining term.
 Be aware, though, that the comparative savings resulting from these discounts can be small. Someone with a $10,000 consolidation loan to be paid back over 10 years would save a total of only $169 by taking advantage of both Sallie Mae discounts rather than by paying back at a direct Government loan at the flat 8.25 percent.
 And another caveat: While standard student loans have terms of 10 years, consolidation loans can stretch out to as much as 30 years, depending on the loan amount. And the price of such an extension can be enormous over the life of the loan.
 (Still, you should at least consider the 30-year option. While the normal advice is to choose the shortest student loan repayment period possible, in this heavily indebted time the reverse may be true. People with heavy debts generally would probably do best to arrange the longest payment period they can for their student loans and devote their spare income to paying down higher-rate debts first.)
 Whether you are paying down one big consolidated student loan or a few smaller loans, an alternative to extending the payback period beyond 10 years is a graduated payback schedule. Under this plan, lower payments are made in the first two or four years, followed by higher payments for the balance of the 10 years. For example, if a 10-year $10,000 loan at 8.25 percent has a monthly payment of $123, a borrower in the "graduated" program could pay $69 a month for four years and then $177 a month for the remaining six years. (That initial break, by the way, will add $1,294 to the total interest cost of the loan, bringing the interest cost to $6,012.)
 Another alternative: Borrowers whose incomes are highly volatile or just plain low may want to consider a repayment plan, offered by the Federal direct student lending program, that ties loan payments to a percentage of a borrower's income. In certain cases, this can mean the monthly payment is less than the interest charged -- a circumstance that increases the amount owed. But if the whole loan isn't paid off after 25 years of steady paying, the balance is forgiven.
 Sallie Mae and other private lenders also offer plans where repayment rates are tied to income, but borrowers must at least pay the interest each month and eventually all of the principal.
 Finally, if you are flirting with default on a student loan, you may need to rehabilitate your credit with your existing lender before finding refinancing with a new loan on better terms. This mainly involves making payments that are "reasonable and affordable" for three to six months to show that you are committed to paying back something. Depending on your plight, "reasonable and affordable" can be a level that is far less than the stated monthly payment on your loan.
 With so many financial options available, it's best to try to work out easier payment terms as soon as it's clear that you may have problems.
 Credit bureaus keep track of how many times you are late with your student loan payments. And the more of these black marks you have, the harder it will be to get a credit card, buy a car, rent an apartment or even get a job. Renegotiating the terms of a loan and paying it down as agreed, however, is viewed as responsible.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Linda Cardini;
Rural Portfolio, Partnerships and Jobs

BYLINE: By FRANCES CHAMBERLAIN 

 BODY:
LINDA CARDINI, executive director of the Connecticut Rural Development Council, former director of the Northwest Connecticut Council of Governments, is a native of Connecticut educated at the universities of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts who served as a city planner in Toronto, then in the suburbs of Orlando, Fla.
It was the chance to move from urban and suburban planning to something more environmentally based that brought her back to Connecticut. When discussions began three years ago about the state joining a national initiative on rural development, Mrs. Cardini's organization fully endorsed the move. In December of 1994 the Connecticut Rural Development Council was officially organized as a Federally funded group whose mission is to develop and implement strategies that can help improve the employment opportunities, incomes and well-being of Connecticut communities by strengthening their capacity to compete at home and abroad. 
 The council aims to provide coordination among Federal, state and local governments tribal councils, the private sector and nonprofit organizations, from all of which board members are drawn. The goal is to preserve the rich heritage -- physical, economic and social -- of rural Connecticut.
What sets the Rural Development Councils apart from other organizations, in fact, is that they are built on partnerships at a time when government funding for many programs continues to be cut back and partnerships become vital.
Of the 15 regional planning organizations in the state, five of the most rural gained seats on the Rural Development Council whose territory is the state's northwest corner.
In a recent interview in Winsted, Mrs. Cardini discussed the council's plans for the area. Following are excerpt from that conversation.
Q. As a relatively new organization, how do you let people know who you are, and what your mission is?
A. We held a forum last July in Torrington on techniques to preserve agricultural lands and open space. Congresswoman Nancy Johnson said towns in her legislative district needed this information, and so we advertised widely in the 44 towns, and drew about 100 people.
We also allocated funds to hire consultants to prepare a rural resource directory that describes agencies and programs that are potentially available. This will be printed, distributed, and put on the Internet.
In December of 1996, we co-sponsored, with the Connecticut Council of Small Towns and the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation, a forum on rural road and bridge standards. This was requested by the Northwestern and Litchfield Hills regions. We followed that up by being at the State Capitol in Hartford when legislation was proposed, asking for rural road and bridge design standards that emphasize repair instead of new construction. This gives communities the flexibility to respect historic, environmental and esthetic qualities so important in small towns.
We're not around to be adversarial, but to be informed, and inform others, about all sides of an issue. Our name might be misleading, also, because of the word "development." We're advocates for rural communities, not necessarily development.
Q. Do you find that people in Connecticut want development or not?
A. People want jobs. They want to feel there's a future here, for their kids to stay, to grow up, and have jobs. They tend to be more concerned about the quality of development. In towns with a population under 5,000, many are concerned about traffic from commercial development. Kent, for instance, is so clogged on weekends that the average resident doesn't go downtown on Sunday.
We need to balance the need for jobs, affordable housing and retaining the character of each community. Even the nine Northwest towns have very different views about what they want.
Q. What are the specific issues in the Northeast corner?
A. This area may face more of a challenge when the economy picks up because the land is relatively low priced, and the area is a reasonable commute from Boston, Worcester and Providence. Commuters may fine it very attractive.
A forum is in the works to make towns aware of techniques to preserve farmland, such as selling it to the state, or making a plan with landowners to create controlled subdivision and put easements on the rest of the land. You may not necessarily be able preserve the farm, but keep the quality and partial openness of the landscape.
Q. What is the plan for the Connecticut River valley?
A. The Connecticut River Estuary Planning Agency will host the next meeting of the council. We're out-reaching to that area, to see how we can be helpful. Planners from the Litchfield Hills and Northwestern region have asked us to consider organizing training for planning and zoning commissioners on topics like subdivision regulations and limits of their planning authority. We're looking into co-sponsoring some education programs for these boards of volunteers all over the state, including the Southeastern section.
Q. One of the issues that you mentioned was the impediments to businesses that operate out of historic buildings. How can your organization assist with this?
A. If the owner of an older home wants to convert it to a bed and breakfast, complying with requirements of state building codes and fire codes can be very expensive and discouraging to a business that is otherwise compatible in rural areas. If we're trying to encourage small businesses and economic activity in existing buildings, we want to know if there is something that can be done to ease up on such requirements.
The economic subcommittee is pursuing this issue now, at the request of a bed and breakfast owner in the Southeastern region.
Q. More urban areas have access to computerized mapping. What would be the advantage to these rural areas in investing in such technology?
A. The University of Connecticut has a geographic information system. If a town has access to a compatible computer, they can download the information. All towns are in the UConn database, but they need training to let them know about it, how to download it and make use of it.
The advantage is that computerized mapping is easy to update. Land parcel changes and land use changes can be recorded, and it is not usually cost effective for small towns to do this with manually produced maps.
Q. You have mentioned several different subcommittees. Who serves on these and what exactly do they do?
A. There are a lot of different people on the subcommittees. Some are Federal, state and regional public sector employees; serving on the council is part of their job. Others are volunteers from the private and nonprofit sector.
Our mission is to recruit new members. We're supposed to have tribal representation from the Mashantucket Pequots and Mohicans. We're reaching out to the planning and professional community. We also especially want to be in touch with architects and engineers.
Q. In what other ways can you be useful to the small towns?
A. We need to spend time training the chief elected officials in these communities. Most don't have a town manager, and we need to give them lots of information so that they can guide growth, attract new growth, manage change and still retain the rural character that they see as important for their community.
I've focused on the clients as towns, but the other element is local agencies. Are there things happening in a community or region that we could support, like inland wetlands commissions? By pulling people together we can improve resources and training.
Q. Has the Rural Development Council proven effective in other states?
A. This is a voluntary program, but 38 states now belong, including all of New England except Rhode Island. The Rural Development Council has a lot of potential.

HEADLINE: A Character Singer Steps Out of Character

BYLINE: By CORI ELLISON

 BODY:
THE PHOTOGRAPHS lining the foyer of Joyce Castle's compact, serene apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan invariably depict her as part of a group: with family, with colleagues. But on Tuesday evening, Ms. Castle, long the unofficial resident character mezzo-soprano of the New York City Opera, will take an uncharacteristic turn in the limelight, in the company's new production of Gottfried von Einem's "Visit of the Old Lady."
The opera is based on a play by Friedrich Durrenmatt, and Ms. Castle, in the role of the vengeful millionairess Claire Zachanassian, assumes the mantle of bona fide leading ladies from Lynn Fontanne (in a 1958 Broadway production) to Ingrid Bergman (in a 1964 film version) and Christa Ludwig (in the opera's premiere, in 1971). 
 "Yes, I guess it's the title role," Ms. Castle acknowledged. "I am the Old Lady. But to think of it as a star vehicle really doesn't benefit me at all. My way is to find my place in the story and figure out how I fit with the other characters. I'm a team player."
She comes by her team spirit rightly: at the time of her birth, her father was pitching in semiprofessional baseball. Her mother, a home-economics teacher and amateur pianist, started her on piano lessons at 5.
Growing up in Baldwin, Kan., a town of 2,000 some 40 miles southwest of Kansas City, Ms. Castle enjoyed a normal Middle Western youth, busy with church and school choirs, music camp and backyard theatricals. But even then, she was aiming for the stage. "Actually, early on I wanted to be a Hollywood movie star, so I could sing and act as well," she said in her typically deliberate cadences and nasal twang.
She honed her versatility at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, taking advantage of performance opportunities in theater, musical comedy and opera. Soon after graduating, she married the noted furniture designer Wendell Castle and relocated to Rochester, where she pursued graduate studies at the Eastman School of Music. In 1969, she joined the Western Opera Theater, the touring arm of the San Francisco Opera.
Her second marriage, to an American tenor active in Europe, ended after eight years in Paris. Then she returned to the United States and sang for Beverly Sills, the City Opera's general director.
"I remember her audition vividly, and my first impression still holds true," Ms. Sills said. "My mother used to say, 'Some performers bring their own spotlight with them.' And that's Joyce Castle. Before she even opens her mouth, there's this enormous stage presence, like a light around her."
Ms. Castle began her City Opera career modestly in 1983, with a small speaking role in "The Merry Widow." But she came into her own a season later as the charmingly lethal Mrs. Lovett in "Sweeney Todd."
Ms. Sills, realizing what a resource she had in Ms. Castle, made her a veritable pillar of the company in the next few seasons. A gallery of picturesque roles endeared her to the public and to critics alike: the maniacal Madame d'Urfe in Dominick Argento's "Casanova," the mischievous Fata Morgana in "Love for Three Oranges," the lovelorn Katisha in "The Mikado," the dotty Baba the Turk in "The Rake's Progress" and the "easily assimilated" Old Lady in "Candide."
The common denominator amid this diversity is a colorful, outlandish over-the-top verve. "How I connect with these bizarre people I don't know," Ms. Castle said. "But no matter how wild they seem, you have to accept the character as a real person and find a place within you where there's common ground."
For this striking, 5-foot-10-inch mezzo, biology has often been the common ground. "The way I look, my dramatic range and, luckily, my voice seem to match," she explained. "Look at me -- aren't I the perfect ingenue? I'm petite. I have blond, curly hair and blue eyes, just like the girl next door who should get the boy.
"I'm being sort of silly, but there's a little truth in it. Inside, I suppose, there's the person that would have sometimes liked to be the sweet ingenue."
Ms. Castle is finally easing into the dramatic repertory her coaches have long predicted for her. In 1986, she made her Metropolitan Opera debut as Waltraute in "Die Walkure," and she has returned every season since, as the Witch in "Hansel und Gretel," Orlofsky in "Die Fledermaus" and other characters. She recently sang Fricka in Wagner's "Ring" cycle in Seattle, Klytemnestra in Strauss's "Elektra" in Milwaukee and the Principessa in Puccini's "Suor Angelica" in Chicago. Her sizable, wiry, tangy voice is just the ticket for these roles: always supremely affecting and communicative, seldom pretty.
"I REMEMBER STEVE Sondheim coming backstage and saying, 'I just love it when you make your voice all . . . you know, nasty,' " she said. "Now, I don't ever think, 'I'm going to make this tone ugly.' I think about what I'm singing, and things happen on stage from the inside out. And maybe I sacrifice a note here or there. Maybe that's why you don't see me in the Bellini operas."
As Ms. Castle's career expanded, she kept up her connection with the City Opera under another general director, Christopher Keene. "Maybe three years ago, I ran into him in the corridor," she said. "He pointed his finger at me and said: ' "The Visit of the Old Lady." Gottfried von Einem. That's for you.' "
As fate would have it, "The Visit" is one of the first City Opera productions to bear the stamp of the company's new general director, Paul Kellogg, who assembled most of the cast and production team after Mr. Keene's death.
With "The Visit," Ms. Castle fortifies her high profile in 20th-century music. At the City Opera, she has figured prominently in the New York premieres of Mr. Argento's "Casanova," Hugo Weisgall's "Esther" and Bernd Alois Zimmermann's "Soldaten." At the Santa Fe Opera, she has appeared in works by Judith Weir, Krzysztof Penderecki and Aulis Sallinen. She also recently recorded Menotti's "Medium" for Cedille Records.
"I was good at math in school, so I think that's why I've never been frightened of any role," she said. "I did Ligeti's 'Aventures et Nouvelles Aventures' with the New York Philharmonic. That's just diabolical, unless you treat it as a mathematical problem."
Ms. Castle leavens this weighty fare with frothier "crossover" repertory, slipping in concerts of Gershwin, Porter and Bernstein anywhere from London and Stuttgart, Germany, to Jerusalem and Carnegie Hall. She was also selected by Stephen Sondheim to take part in an acclaimed Book-of-the-Month Club recording of his songs.
Typically, her wish list tends toward the quirky. "I'd still love to do the Nurse in 'Die Frau Ohne Schatten,' and the Janacek mothers, those lovely mothers, Kostelnicka and Kabanicha," she said. "And in another life, I'll do 'Turandot' and 'Werther.' I mean the tenor roles."
Could happen. And it could happen in any number of places.
"I've just done my taxes, so I know I was away from New York more than 200 days in the last two years," Ms. Castle said. "That's a lot of moving, but it appeals to me. I'm at home where I am these days. Maybe that comes from maturity. I'm a Gypsy in search of a role."

HEADLINE: Another Millennia Problem: Computer Files

BYLINE: By ADAM L. PENENBERG 

 BODY:
WHEN the year flips from 1999 to 2000 Long Island and the rest of the world could be faced with the computer glitch to end all glitches, potentially a $600 billion problem that could paralyze governments and bring companies to their knees -- all because, until recently, computer systems were designed to read two digits instead of four.
It is called the Millennium Bug or the Year 2000 Crisis and although the roots of the problem are maddeningly simple the economic and legal havoc it could wreak is not. Any company or organization that processes invoices, claims, debt collection and payments could be in for a rude awakening when the calendar says 2000 but the computer reads it as 1900. 
 "The issue isn't whether it's a crisis but how much it will cost," said Ira Morrow, a research director for the financial services industry at Gartner Group, a Connecticut-based high-tech think tank.
"When the City cabs gave wrong receipts on Feb. 29, people said, 'Oh, a computer foul-up,' " Marc Sokol, vice president of advanced technology for Computer Associates in Islandia, said. "Wait until the year 2000 when interest payments bounce or the government says you owe millions of days of interest on your taxes."
According to experts, including Mr. Morrow and Mr. Sokol, if companies and government do not fix the problem, the result would likely be computer chaos, an increase in business failures, debilitating litigation and higher taxes.
But thus far, Long Island business and government have barely begun to seek a cure. And they are running out of time.
"The firms on the Island haven't gotten their act together yet and as the millennium approaches most companies that deal with fixing the problem will be overwhelmed by firms making requests," Jerry Ottomanelli, manager of information advisory services for Ernst & Young, said. "Resources will be stretched. Major clients will be taken care of. Smaller firms won't. And the closer you get to 2000, the more the price will go up."
Software Productivity Research (www.spr.com). in Burlington, Mass., estimates that the Millennium Bug would directly cause 1 percent of Fortune 500 companies, 3 percent of small companies and 5 to 7 percent of medium-size firms to go belly up.
The reason? A lack of money, manpower and technical know-how. According to the New York State Task Force on Information Resource Management, created by Gov. George E. Pataki in January 1996, it would take, on average, one programmer one day to analyze, fix, test and implement one program to make it year 2000 compliant. In an organization with 60,000 programs, it would take 120 people working full time for two years to accomplish the task. Multiplied by every business and government agency with a mainframe in the American economy, the cost might exceed the combined gross domestic product of several nations.
Just getting the government up to code would cost billions. The White House Office of Management and Budget released a report in February that estimates the cost of upgrading the federal government's computers at $2.3 billion, although the Gartner Group puts the price tag at more than 10 times that, at $1.10 per line of code.
"The government's estimates are way too low," Mr. Morrow said. "There is no automated way to do this. It must be done computer by computer. We're not only dealing with 30-year-old code in some cases, but also the interfaces between systems."
The reason for software programmers' reliance on two-digit years instead of four was to save space. In a typical company database, e.g., employee personnel records, every time a date appeared -- date of birth, date of performance evaluation, date of the first day's work -- programmers crammed four digits into two, dropping off the 19 in the year. In a typical database, this amounted to millions of lines of additional memory.
"It was a habit and good programming practice to do this," said Mr. Sokol, who has testified before Congress on the problem. "When we wrote these systems, we had no idea they'd be running fifteen, twenty years later.'
Companies like Ernst & Young and Computer Associates, which counts the State University at Stony Brook and Kmart as clients, expects a growing share of their business to involve helping clients cope with the coming millennium. For a mainframe, this necessitates finding, fixing and rewriting large sections of code. But since this problem can occur in many different systems, anywhere in the software and, sometimes even hardware, and mainframes by nature are customized to the needs of the company, there is no 'silver bullet.'
Computer Associates is not the only company in the millennium game. A whole industry has begun sprouting up to manage the problem. Peter de Jager, a consultant, has a website dedicated to the Millennium Bug (www.year2000.com), which provides information and posts hundreds of advertisements for products specifically marketed to those seeking Year 2000 compliance.
Even insurance companies like Marsh & McLennan have drawn up policies to inoculate companies that either suffer losses or cause other companies to suffer losses.
"We're going to work both ends -- the victim and the victimizer," said Thomas Ruggieri, managing director of Marsh & McLennan Inc. "Even if a company tries to fix the problem, it's easy to miss something. Bringing code up to standard is a painstaking problem: all it takes is one bad line of code."
Marsh & McLennan, which developed the policies in consultation with the Zurich-American Insurance Company and Lloyds of London, plans to provide up to $200 million in liability coverage to companies facing debilitating lawsuits and huge damage claims to companies that are already Year 2000 compliant.
The New York-based insurance broker would also offer protection against a company's own profit-losses and extra expenses incurred from inadequate updating of its computer system. It also plans to cover losses sustained by a client if an outside computer system wreaks havoc with its system.
The American International Group, an insurance company, along with Minet, an insurance broker, has also developed a Millennium Bug policy that Marsh & McLennan plans to use to complement its offerings.
But there is one sector Marsh & McLennan would not offer coverage. "There is no way we would insure either the Federal Government or local governments," Mr. Ruggieri said.
Camaron Thomas, who heads the New York State Task Force on Information Resource Management, is also concerned, but for a different reason. "Local governments feed us so much information and if they aren't compliant, it could screw up our computer systems and vice-versa," Ms. Thomas said. "This is particularly scary when you think about what government provides: welfare and child support collections, tax refunds, government checks, licenses, lists of people under arrest or on parole. It could get real messy."

HEADLINE: Brookhaven Looks for Plans to Deal With Contaminated Water

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
CONCEDING that they may be powerless to stop a 10- to 12-year-old leak of radioactive tritium from a nuclear reactor at the Brookhaven National Laboratory for at least nine months, Federal officials are pressing plans to deal with contamination that the leak has caused.
In conferring with state and Suffolk County officials, lab officials have said the options to address the worst contamination -- high concentrations of tritium in ground water near the building that houses the research reactor -- are quite likely to be controversial, expensive, exotic sounding and, in some cases, potentially risky. 
 One choice, sometimes referred to as the ice-cube method, would involve freezing contaminated water near the reactor with an underground system of refrigeration pipes.
Other options include trapping the water in impermeable underground walls or pumping it into tanker trucks for shipment to Canada. Another alternative is to do nothing, allowing the tritium to degrade gradually and be diluted by uncontaminated water. Tritium loses half its radioactivity every 12.4 years.
Experimental methods with names like electrolytic enrichment, thermal diffusion, membrane filtration and isotopic exchange have also been discussed.
Last week officials from the Federal Energy Department, the owner of the lab, and the lab said that they were in the early stages of deciding how to proceed. The State Environmental Conservation Department and the County Health Services Department are also involved in the planning.
Any plan would be fully disclosed to the public before being approved, the officials said.
The tritium cleanup tops an array of problems that the 50-year-old lab faces as it tries to rebuild shaken public confidence in its ability to manage the 5,300-acre government complex, a Federal Superfund site since 1989 because of the disposal of radioactive substances and chemicals over many years.
Critics are demanding the permanent closing of the research reactor, which opened in the mid 1960's to produce neutron beams for experiments. The critics said the risks of operating the reactor and the extent of soil, water and air contamination caused by the lab had just begun to come to light.
A spokeswoman for the lab, Mona Rowe, said the tritium problem may possibly be handled under the Superfund cleanup. That effort has involved capping dumps where radioactive materials, including the carcasses of test animals, were buried and sinking wells to track underground plumes of contaminants. Volatile organic chemicals are being stripped from water and released into the air as part of the cleanup.
Officials said the problem of contamination near the reactor building was compounded because tritium, an isotope of hydrogen, was nearly inseparable from water. "We don't have a technology that can reliably and on a large scale pick out the water molecules that have the tritium component," said Frank J. Crescenzo, deputy manager of the lab office in the Energy Department.
A method in which water with tritium would be released into the atmosphere as a mist has been eliminated as a possibility, said Dr. Tara O'Toole, the Assistant Energy Secretary for Environment, Safety and Health. Officials said the method was discarded, in part because they expected it would meet strenuous public objection. Critics of the lab said the release of tritium to the atmosphere was unacceptable.
One critic, Jay M. Gould of the Radiation and Public Health Project in Manhattan, has said that statistical evidence links radioactive emissions from the lab to higher-than-normal rates of breast and prostate cancer in the vicinity of the lab in Upton. The lab vigorously denies that.
Another critic, Fish Unlimited of Shelter Island, is preparing to file a suit, contending that the lab violated Federal laws for clean water by discharging radioactive substances, including tritium, into the Peconic River.
The executive director of the conservation group, William N. Smith, said lab emissions into the headwaters of the Peconic, where the complex is situated, had introduced cancer-causing radioactive substances into waters and marine life in Peconic Bay and may have set off the brown tide algae that decimated scallops beginning in 1985.
Department of Energy and lab officials said the tritium leak, found in December after the lab dug test wells near the reactor, posed no danger to the 3,200 employees of the lab or nearby residential areas. The officials said their first objective was to prevent a plume extending at least two-thirds of a mile from the reactor building from spreading further toward the lab's southern boundary.
Last month they announced plans to pump water at the leading edge of the plume, where tritium concentrations are below Federal standards for safe drinking water, to a recharge basin near the center of the lab property. The officials said that by the time the water with tritium had seeped back into the ground it would be less radioactive and mixed with clean water.
The pumping is tentatively set to begin this month. But officials have agreed to report first to the County Department of Health Services. Joseph H. Baier, an environmental quality director for the department, said the county wanted assurances that the plume had been delineated and that extraction wells were at correct depths.
Mr. Baier said the county also had questions about a carbon-filter treatment that was supposed to remove non-nuclear contaminants from water piped to the recharge basin. He said the department believed that it might be premature to start pumping by this month.
"The tritium has been there for 10-plus years," Mr. Baier said. "If it stays for another month or two there is no danger."
Mr. Smith of Fish Unlimited said the plan would spread tritium to other areas of ground water and allow some particles to evaporate and become airborne.
Dealing with the more heavily contaminated water near the reactor building will be an even greater problem, officials said.
"If we pump that water out, put it in trucks and drive it to Canada, just think of the traffic risks," Ray E. Cowen, the regional director of the Environmental Conservation Department, said. "You have to weigh those risks against the 'no action' alternative."
A spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency, Richard Cahill, said it was "very early in the process" to decide how to handle the higher concentrations of tritium. "The options are grouped two ways," he said. "One is containment. The other is extraction and disposal."
Federal officials said they continued to believe that the tritium was leaking at a rate of 7 to 10 gallons a day for a 68,000-gallon spent-fuel storage pool in the reactor building.
The officials have announced plans to ship spent fuel from the pool to the Savannah River plant of the Energy Department in Aiken, S.C., in four installments, in May, July, September and November. The pool has to remain full while any fuel remains, officials said.
After all the fuel has been removed, the pool would be drained and repaired. A steel liner would also be added, in accordance with county regulations that the laboratory had failed to comply with.
Energy Department officials say they base their estimate that the pool has been leaking for 10 to 12 years on the distance that the plume of water contaminated with tritium has moved from the reactor building.
"The mistake here is that we should have put those monitoring wells in sooner," Ms. Rowe said. "Now we are basically canvassing the site."
Ms. Rowe said that lab officials now accepted the possibility that the reactor might not reopen and that they were concerned about the effects of the problems on the lab's future.
"I don't think the lab is immediately in jeopardy," she said. "What I see is that people are losing trust in us, and right now there is a sense that they just don't want to tolerate all of these environmental problems anymore."
Thomas Conoscenti, a regional economist, said closing the lab would devastate the regional economy. "You are talking about a lab with a very unique reputation," Mr. Conoscenti said.
But critics said the lab, opened in 1946 at the former Camp Upton, should not operate in what has grown into a heavily populated area.
A safety inspector in the Energy Department, Joseph Carson, wrote in a letter circulated to the media recently that the tritium leak was "inexcusable, if not criminal."
"There were too many warnings," Mr. Carson said, "too many regulations and standards that were ignored or violated, too many lies and unmet commitments and too many involved people who, for too many years, knew that the High Flux Beam Reactor spent-fuel pool -- unlined, with no leak-detection system, with high levels of tritium contaminated water -- was a nightmare waiting to happen to Long Island's fragile environment."
Mr. Carson, who was involved in an investigation by the Energy Department about a fire in the reactor building in March 1994, said he became a whistle blower to protest what he described as a culture at the department that punished those who raised safety questions.

HEADLINE: ATLANTIC CITY;
Counting Heads

BYLINE: By BILL KENT 

 BODY:
ATLANTIC CITY set another record in 1996: the city had as many as 34,041,548 tourist visits.
That makes the city the most visited tourist destination in the country, beating Las Vegas, Nev. (29 million), and Disney World (27 million), says Anthony Marino, a senior planner with of the South Jersey Transportation Authority. 
 "We're speaking of visit-trips here, not actual numbers of people," said Mr. Marino, who has compiled Atlantic City visitor statistics since 1978. "If we want to look at it in terms of distinct visitors -- how many people actually visited the city in 1996 -- it goes down to a range between 5 million and 8 million, some of whom come back as frequently as once a month. That's about how many people are keeping the city in business, and of that number, about 92 percent were gamblers, which is a good sign. Not everybody who goes to Atlantic City goes to gamble."
Thanks, in part, to him, Atlantic City has looked good on paper since the Boardwalk's first casino opened to record business in 1978, when Mr. Marino, a former sociology professor at Stockton State College, began compiling the city's most famous statistic.
"I had just started working as a demographer for the Atlantic City Expressway," he said, "and we got a call from the Convention Bureau asking if there was a way to determine how many people were coming to the city because of the casinos. Because I'm good with numbers, it sort of fell into my lap."
He couldn't use gate receipts, as Disney World does, to come up with his number. He could not use hotel stays, the basis of the Las Vegas statistic; most people who visit Atlantic City do not stay overnight.
And although New Jersey Transit, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Atlantic City Expressway, the Greyhound Bus Company and the Casino Control Commission compiled visitor statistics, no one had ever combined them and tried to distinguish the tourists from commuters, businesspeople and pass-through travelers to other destinations.
"I was lucky in one respect: Atlantic City is on an island," Mr. Marino said. "In 1978, there were only four ways you can get to it: by car, bus, limousine or air. When the rail service was restored in 1988, you had five."
In fact, there are six. Pleasure and charter boats from other ports dock at both Harrah's Marina and the Frank S. Farley Marina, opposite Trump's Castle, in the warmer months. Mr. Marino elected not to count "the few hundred" boat visitors because "the figures weren't easily available."
When he finally came up a methodology to isolate visitors, Mr. Marino checked his figures with casino executives. "They said it was close to their own calculations, maybe a little lower," he said. "That it was lower appealed to me because I would much rather have a conservative figure than an inflated one."
In 1978, Mr. Marino's calculation of 6.4 million visit trips "really turned heads in Las Vegas," he said. "It was the first indication that Atlantic City was going to become the tail that wagged the dog because most of that number was generated by one casino" -- Resorts International -- "that wasn't even open for the whole year."
Other demographers and tourism industry officials challenged his number. "Sure, a lot of people were skeptical," he said. "I was grilled for hours by Wall Street brokerage houses. I had all kinds of experts come in and try to tear my number apart. But it was solid."
Progress has not been steady, Mr. Marino has shown. After reaching 33.1 million in 1988, the number of visits declined in 1989, dropping as low as 30.2 million in 1993. "It really wasn't until 1995 that the city set another record, at 33.2," he said.
That number "turned even more heads around," he said. "I got calls from Wall Street brokerage houses like you wouldn't believe. They said to me that my number was the first indication that things were really beginning to turn around in the city after the recession. After that, you had Salomon Brothers and Prudential Bache coming out with reports that Atlantic City was worth a second look, and suddenly all these new casino companies wanted to get back into the town."

Nostalgia Time: A Beloved Revival Revived . . .

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

 BODY:
A DESIRE to return in thought or in fact to a former time in one's life, to one's home, or to one's family and friends." That's nostalgia, according to the Random House Dictionary of the English Language. Always was, always will be and -- all the rage or not -- it's always with us in some measure, this yearning that time and memory effect.
To chroniclers of the 1970's, a craze for nostalgia explained the unexpected success of "No, No, Nanette," billed in its Broadway revival as "the new 1925 musical." That sleek 1971 version of a creaky 1925 show (which spawned a flop sequel, "Yes, Yes, Yvette") is to play the Paper Mill Playhouse in Milburn from Wednesday through May 25. 
 During rehearsals of the Broadway reproduction, the adapter and director, Burt Shevelove, gave a pep talk to a disgruntled cast fed up with going over the same few numbers over and over, with no script in sight. "The world today is not a pretty place," Mr. Shevelove is quoted as saying in "The Making of 'No, No, Nanette,' " by Don Dunn (Citadel Press, 1972). "It is filled with terrible news every day, of Vietnam, campus riots, pollution, crime, inflation. The audiences that will come to see our show will have heard enough -- much too much -- about all those things.
"We must take their minds off those problems and make them concerned only with this: Will Nanette, this innocent little child, get her wish and spend a weekend in Atlantic City? Nothing else, nothing else at all, is important. This warm, sunny, lovely little show must be our valentine to the audience."
Safely assuming that today's audiences do not lack for disillusionment and seek escape into simpler times, the Paper Mill revival of a revival is in the surest of hands. Look no further for authenticity. During a recent rehearsal in a studio at 890 Broadway in lower Manhattan -- itself rife with nostalgia, having once been owned by Michael Bennett (after his "Chorus Line" success) -- the director, Donald Saddler, guided the dancers in the show's opening number, "Too Many Rings Around Rosie."
"The Paper Mill production will be exactly the Broadway production -- word for word," said Mr. Saddler, whose work as choreographer for the 1971 Broadway "Nanette" won a Tony Award. "And step by step."
In "Too Many Rings," Lucille Early, played by Virginia Sandifur, was perched on a piano, surrounded by four adoring chorus boys. Ms. Sandifur went into her lines. "My husband is going to kill me, but I had a bad week at mah-jongg," says Lucille, who has emerged from behind purple Bergdorf's boxes. She then explains, "There are hats and there are hats, but this, my dear, is a chapeau."
On the sidelines, Helen Gallagher, who won a 1971 Tony Award as best actress in a musical for her Lucille Early, was watching (but what was she thinking?) and practicing tap steps in place for her role as Sue Smith, played in 1971 by Ruby Keeler, one of the three reasons for the nostalgic hoopla over that "Nanette." The other two were Patsy Kelly as the maid, Pauline, and, most of all, Busby Berkeley, the show's nominal but, practically speaking, superfluous production supervisor." "I expect Ruby to come down and help me," Ms. Gallagher murmured. Miss Keeler died in 1993.
Mr. Saddler, who has choreographed various "Nanette" productions, including the London company (with Dame Anna Neagle, who was a 1940 Nanette in one of several film versions) and three national companies with Virginia Mayo, Evelyn Keyes and June Allyson, respectively, and supervised a St. Louis staging that starred Marge Champion.
"I didn't think I ever wanted to do this again," he said during the rehearsal break. "But the Paper Mill production will be as posh as possible, and I knew that I could protect the show. We didn't want to make fun of the period or comment on it, or camp it up -- only recapture it as homage. With respect."
Pointing to 20's magazine pictures and ads taped on the wall, much as he had done to inspire his dancers 26 years ago, Mr. Saddler continued: "There's no other frame of reference for these young people in the chorus -- the body language, the gestures of the 20's. Ladies sit down properly. They don't cross their legs, only at the ankles. A gentleman never stood directly in front of a lady; that was an affront. He turned this way or that. With respect."
In 1947, Mr. Saddler, a classically trained dancer, did the tango with Ms. Gallagher in "High Button Shoes" on Broadway when he played the younger brother of Nanette Fabray, who was replaced by Ms. Gallagher in the Paper Mill production after withdrawing for health reasons. Ms. Gallagher recreated Lucille in a 1973 Paper Mill "Nanette." Kaye Ballard, who plays the dour maid always getting ready to quit (the Patsy Kelly role) appeared as Pauline with Ms. Fabray in a recent "Nanette" production at the Civic Light Opera in Long Beach, Calif. The cast includes two Paper Mill veterans: Eddie Bracken as Jimmy Smith, Sue's philandering husband, whose "three wicked women" are trotted off to Atlantic City, and Lee Roy Reams as Billy, Lucille's husband and Jimmy's lawyer.
I T would be six days before the cast moved on to the Paper Mill stage, where chorus girls would walk on six spinning beach balls with an Art Deco design, just outside the Chickadee Cottage in Atlantic City and Ms. Gallagher would appear atop a double staircase, the refurbished 1971 design by Raoul Pene du Bois.
What are the joys of yesteryear to which Paper Mill audiences crave transport? The turkey trot, the Castle Walk, the polka, the Hesitation Waltz? The time when a lady would forgive anything if a gentleman danced with her? Or the 1971 prices of orchestra seats on Broadway: $12 weekdays, $15 weekends. Perhaps "the patterns and the beauty of dance" that Ms. Gallagher laments as having been discarded in musicals? Or a self-defining song like "I Want to Be Happy"? (Don't forget that the "Nanette" score also includes "Tea for Two.")
All of the above. As David Waggett, the show's assistant stage manager, said: "It's about time this show came back to town."

HEADLINE: New Channels and New Costs for Cable TV

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW 

 BODY:
MANY Cablevision customers may be confused over new channels that have popped up on their television sets recently, other channels that have changed locations and a sudden rate increase of several dollars a month.
That is because Cablevision is in the midst of a major rebuilding, connecting customers to a fiber optic network that will ultimately increase the number of available channels. 
 Cablevision's recent complete purchase of Madison Square Garden raises further questions about sports programs to be offered on Long Island like what that programming will be and how much they will cost.
"The purchase is new," the chief executive officer of Cablevision, James F. Dolan, said, "and we're looking for the company to be making programming available in different ways."
Of Cablevision's 660,000 subscribers on Long Island, 154,000 have been connected to the upgrade, called Optimum TV, according to a spokesman for the utility, Charles Schueler. Most of those are in Nassau County and western Suffolk County, where the population densities are highest, Mr. Schueler said.
By the end of the year, he added, Cablevision expects 250,000 to 275,000 homes to be connected.
The next areas to be upgraded are the remaining sections of the Town of North Hempstead and the Town of Huntington, with the remainder of the Town of Hempstead and the entire Town of Babylon to be rewired next year.
When the homes are connected, eight new channels appear automatically in the Family Cable service, including MSNBC; Fox News, a 24-hour news channel; a local weather service and WGN, a Chicago station that televises Cubs and White Sox baseball games and movies.
The new connection allows channels like E! Entertainment TV, Bravo, the MSG Network, the Weather Channel and Newsport to expand to 24-hour service, as well as opening access to 22 more optional channels.
The 80-channel Optimum TV plan offers individual channels or packages that cost from $34.95 to $76.95 a month.
Optimum includes ESPN2, the Food Network, the History Channel, the Independent Film Channel, the Learning Channel, Muchmusic, New Sport, Romance Classics, Sega and Starz!
Mr. Schueler said 65,000 customers had bought Optimum packages.
Different areas have different capacities, he said. Some communities have 58 channels and others have 80.
The rebuilding means a more reliable system with better quality, said Joe Azznara, senior vice president of regional operations. The original 30-channel system was built in the 70's.
"A fiber optic network creates state-of-the-art telecommunications," Mr. Azznara said, "which not only offers expanded channel capacity, but the ability to receive cable modem Internet service and interactive TV. In the future we will be able to provide video on demand and deliver residential phone service through cable."
The rebuilding starts with replacing old copper cable. In some cases the wires from utility poles to houses also have to be replaced, Mr. Azznara said.
"One of the most exciting benefits of a system with access to more channels," Mr. Azznara said, "is that it takes away the barrier of having to decide which channels to carry."
For the older systems, Cablevision's programming department surveyed customers to see what they wanted and what made economic sense, Mr. Azznara said, adding: "Our general philosophy is not to remove any channels. But in the older systems we maxed out on channels available. Recently we downloaded several channels that were formerly carried only on Rainbow packages to make them now available on Family Cable."
Those channels include America's Health Network, American Movie Classics, BET and Bravo.
Cablevision increased the charge for Family Cable by 7 percent, to slightly less than an additional $2 a month.
For a growing number of customers, the combination of rising monthly rates and limited programming has prompted the installation of satellite dishes. "Overall it is cheaper to own a satellite than to subscribe to Cablevision," said Jordan Schalk, owner of Sattech, a distributor and installer of satellite equipment in Brooklyn, "and satellites give you more choices in programming and customer features, as well as better picture and audio quality."
Of the four major systems on the market, one, Primestar, is available for rental service, said Mr. Schalk. After an initial fee of about $140 for delivery and installation, monthly packages range from $29.95 for 63 channels to $54.95 for 95, he said, adding that even the basic package includes Disney Channel and MSG.
Russ England, territory director for a local franchisee, Time Warner Primestar, said the business had grown steadily since it started in 1994, but he would not release the numbers of customers.
"Cablevision used to be the only game in town," Mr. England said. "But now more homeowners are choosing satellite dishes for enhanced programming and services. You're not affected by power outages and rate increases like you are with Cablevision. And as of April 23, we'll have access to 160 channels."
The lone problem, he added, is that customers cannot receive local broadcasting from the satellite and have to use regular antennas or buy basic cable service.
"Satellite providers," Mr. Dolan said, "are trying to play catch-up with cable. Cablevision is leading the way in rolling out the most efficient dependable and promising delivery technologies. Our network will bring customers popular new services like Telephony and Optimum On-Line Internet access that simply can't be delivered by satellites."
Cablevision would not release the number of customers who buy different packages, but said Family Cable remained the most popular tier, at a monthly rate of $25 to $30, depending on location.
For homeowners in most of Nassau and Suffolk who do not have access to Optimum TV, Cablevision options begin with Broadcast Basic, which provides 16 channels, for approximately $10 a month.
The next tier is Family Cable, which offers 46 to 56 channels, also depending on location. As an upgrade subscribers can order services a la carte or "build onto" Family Cable. For an additional $5 a month, Spectrum Services offer a choice of four out of five channels, from the Cartoon Network, Comedy Central, Encore, Flix and Sci-Fi.
So-called Premium services -- Cinemax, the Disney Channel, HBO, the Movie Channel, Showtime, Sportschannel and the MSG Network -- can be ordered individually or in combinations.
The monthly rate for the Family Plus One package is $39. For Family Plus Two it is $49, and the Family Plus Three Sports Package costs $54. Again, numbers are approximate and depend on locale.
At the top end of the non-Optimum packages are Rainbow Spectrum, which includes all five Spectrum channels, all sports channels and Cinemax, Disney and HBO for $65.
Rainbow Gold, which adds the Movie Channel and Showtime, for a total of 58 channels, costs $76.
Homes with Optimum TV have wider options, beginning at Broadcast Basic with 20 channels and ending at Optimum Gold with 80.
By contrast, residents of Manhattan, where Time Warner owns the cable service, pay a monthly charge of $14.55 for basic service, with 33 channels, and $31.37 for the 65-channel so-called standard package, the most popular. Customers can add other channels like Cinemax, Disney Channel, HBO, the Movie Channel and Showtime. The first premium channel costs $12.95 a month, the second $9, the third $8 and $6 for additional channels.
In another Time Warner region, Orlando, Fla., the 18-channel basic package costs about $8 a month. The most popular "standard" tier offers 48 channels for about $26. An eight-channel a la carte package runs 99 cents a channel and $3.72 for all eight.
On Long Island the rebuilding is just one part of the telecommunications breakthrough. Mr. Azznara said. The company is testing digital boxes for digital transmissions.
"This is our technological vision for the future," he said. "Programs can be digitized and stored as data in a computer, which will create a library of video. A customer can look at a menu and say, 'I missed "60 Minutes" last Sunday, so I'll watch it on Tuesday.' It will be video on demand."
In December, Cablevision started Optimum On-line Internet access via cable in the northern part of the Town of Oyster Bay, and it is studying residential phone service through cable, said Mr. Azznara.
"All of these services will allow Cablevision to become one-stop shopping for its customers for all of their telecommunications needs," he said.
Enthusiasm over the channel expansion, digital boxes and other new technology could be dampened by pending rate increases to finance the capital investment and the major spending to buy Madison Square Garden. Experts have estimated the cost of that deal at $650 million.
Mr. Azznara said the amount and date for the price increases had not been determined.
"Our bet for the future," he said, "is that many homeowners will want all of these exciting services."

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
Prosperity at the Wheel on the Route 1 Corridor

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
WITH the supply of office space once again in balance with demand, construction projects for specific tenants are beginning to emerge along the Princeton Route 1 corridor, stretching from New Brunswick 20 miles south to Trenton.
One example is the 235,000-square-foot building planned as part of the headquarters for the eastern region of Raytheon Engineers and Constructors at the 560-acre Carnegie Center in West Windsor. Completion is expected in about a year. 
 The company, whose parent is the Raytheon Company, an engineering, construction and diversified electronics concern based in Lexington, Mass., is also leasing an additional 243,000 square feet of space in two buildings at the park, where it will consolidate most of its three Northeast operations -- now in Manhattan, Philadelphia and Lyndhurst, N.J.
The leases will increase the occupancy rate to 99 percent at the center, where some 1.4 million square feet of space has been built so far, said Roger M. Steinhardt, director of marketing and leasing for the developer, Carnegie Center Associates. When fully built, the park will have 4.5 million square feet of buildings.
"Demand has finally caught up with the supply created in the mid-80's," said Mr. Steinhardt, adding that a 124-room Amerisuite Hotel was also under construction at the center.
Nearby, a Philadelphia-based developer plans a 160,000-square-foot building on 13.8 acres in the 2,200-acre Princeton Forrestal Center that it has an option to buy from Princeton University.
"We are seeing more business than we have seen in 10 years," said David Knights, executive vice president of Picus Associates, the firm hired by Princeton University to manage and lease the center. "The market is solid and has returned to normal behavior."
A total of 5 million square feet of space has been built at the center, which eventually is expected to have 11 million square feet.
Mr. Knights said there were 100,000 more square feet of commercial space in the pipeline at the center, which straddles South Brunswick and Plainsboro.
That includes a 153-room Marriott Courtyard hotel and the expansion over time of a biotechnology company from its present 50,000 square feet to 110,000 square feet.
The projects, industry experts said, provide fresh momentum to a market that like others in the state has not seen any major new construction since 1989. "There is a lot of new energy in the system," said Dianne R. Brake, president of MSM Regional Council, a private nonprofit group that tracks growth in Middlesex, Somerset and Mercer Counties.
As of the end of 1995, the latest year for which council figures are available, 61 million square feet of new commercial space were planned for the 32 communities in the corridor. The absorption of 1.1 million square feet of space in 1996 -- continuing a trend that started two years ago -- has left the corridor with few remaining large blocks of prime space.
IN the largest lease transaction along the corridor last year, Bristol-Meyers Squibb , a key participant in the market, took nearly 200,000 square feet. The deal filled the 220,000-square-foot building at 100 Nassau Park Boulevard in West Windsor, which stood nearly vacant for several years.
The leasing activity has pushed up average asking rents, particularly in the corridor's most built-up sector -- generally south of South Brunswick. It also caused a ripple effect in varying degrees throughout the greater Princeton market, where the vacancy rate in the six submarkets is 9.54 percent, said Gerald Fennelly, president of a brokerage firm in Hamilton bearing his name.
That area was hard hit in 1995 by corporate consolidations and relocations. Among the companies that left the area is Mobil, and Lockheed Martin is expected to leave soon.
But there is interest in acquiring the 800,000-square-foot Mobil complex in Hopewell at the southern end of the corridor, said William R. Mate, director of economic development for Mercer County, which is helping to market the site. Michael Kimmitt, a spokesman for the Mobil Technology Company in Fairfax, Va., said that negotiations were continuing with a "prospective buyer," which he declined to name.
At the same time Bristol-Meyers Squibb is selling a 450-acre undeveloped tract at the intersection of Interstate 95 and Scotch Road in Hopewell, where 3.5 million square feet of offices could be built.
"We have been approached by a major corporation to buy the site and discussions continue," said Robert J. Wolfe, president of Picus Associates. The buyer, many brokers said, is Merrill Lynch. While Mr. Wolfe would neither confirm nor deny this, he did say that the financial concern had "no intention of leaving" the 1.3 million square feet of space it occupies and owns in Princeton Forrestal Center.
With an overall vacancy rate of 8.1 percent, down from 18.2 percent about the same time in 1996, the Route 1 corridor is the tightest market in greater Princeton, according to Cushman & Wakefield, the national brokerage concern. Moreover, the vacancy rate is just 7.5 percent for Class A space.
The 16 percent vacancy rate for the entire 11-county northern and central New Jersey market is about double that for the Route 1 corridor.
STOKING the corridor's activity is the expansion of local companies -- from pharmaceutical and financial concerns to high-technology and biotechnology firms.
"The space left behind is looked upon as the new supply," said Raymond A. Sohmer, vice president at the Princeton office of Grubb & Ellis, a national brokerage firm. Even so, tenants looking for 50,000 square feet or more are having a difficult time finding it, he added.
That was also the case for Raytheon, a newcomer to the area. The company looked at 20 different sites in the Philadelphia and central New Jersey area before selecting the Carnegie Center site.
"We wanted to balance the commute of all employees who will be affected by this change," Charles Q. Miller, the chairman of Raytheon wrote in a statement. "So we looked for a mid-point between the current locations."
The consolidation also will reduce costs and increase efficiency, said Edward J. Powers, a spokesman, adding that as the company grows Princeton offers access to the region's pool of skilled professionals. He said the move, to be completed by the summer of 1998, will bring 1,400 jobs to the area, nearly 1,000 of them new to New Jersey.
Mr. Steinhardt of Carnegie Center said that having 250,000 square feet to offer Raytheon helped seal the deal.
BROKERS say that leasing activity in the Route 1 corridor is expected to continue into 1998, spurring more construction. The state's Department of Labor estimates that employment in Middlesex, Somerset and Morris Counties will grow from 694,865 in 1995, the latest figure available, to 804,100 in the year 2005.
The corridor's drawing card is its central location and proximity to Princeton and Rutgers Universities, said Peter W. Hamburger, a director at the East Rutherford office of Cushman & Wakefield. "Landlords have the upper hand now," he said.
Traffic concerns, once a looming issue along Route 1, have also been eased by $200 million in road improvements in the last decade -- among them the construction of several overpasses and the widening of Route 1 south of South Brunswick.
Some $75 million in additional improvements will be completed in the next two years, according to the state's Department of Transportation.
The challenge now is the corridor's lack of available space. The pressure is on corporations to go into build-to-suit properties if they want the Princeton cachet or to move nearby submarkets, said Mr. Fennelly, the broker. Others said companies could also move away from the area.
Average asking rents have increased and concessions to tenants have decreased, said Mr. Sohmer of Grubb & Ellis, noting that rents for Class A space are now $24 to $24.50 a square foot, up from $20 to $21 a square foot a year ago.
The climb in rents is enough to justify new construction, but tight financing will limit speculative buildings from rising, Mr. Sohmer said and other brokers agreed. Build-to-suit deals, or deals with substantial lease commitments from tenants, will be the near-term focus on the corridor.
That is the strategy the Aegis Property Group of Philadelphia will follow for the building it plans at Princeton Forrestal Center. James A Kinzig, a partner in the company, said construction would not start until half the building was leased.

HEADLINE: Suburbanization of Orthodox Jews

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
AT the Westchester Day School in Mamaroneck, Orthodox Jewish youngsters study the Talmud in sunny classrooms overlooking Long Island Sound, learn to apply the lessons of the Torah to their everyday lives and likewise celebrate their heritage by performing Israeli folk dances along the corridors. There, where the kindergarten's guinea pig is lovingly named Yitzhak for the slain Israeli leader Yitzhak Rabin, registration is booming, administrators report.
In White Plains, the crush of the lunch-hour crowd at a kosher delicatessen, the Lexington, attests also to the growth in the numbers of observant Jews in the county. With a little kibitzing, or easy-going banter, thrown in for good measure, corned beef sandwiches are served as the specialty of the house -- all under the watchful eye of a supervising rabbi. 
 At Young Israel of Scarsdale, too, Rabbi Jacob S. Rubenstein, spiritual leader of the synagogue, could not be more pleased that his flock has increased many fold in recent years -- the result of a successful effort, he said, to "bring a modern song to an ancient text."
The rabbi said that even though the Orthodox Jewish movement dates back more than 3,000 years, contemporary rabbis have been able to attract new members by demonstrating how the age-old rules of the Torah continue to be relevant.
Rabbi Chaim Feuerman, headmaster of the Westchester Day School, said enrollments are burgeoning there and at Jewish day schools throughout the country. The enrollment at his school has jumped to 413 students from 376 eight years ago when he first came to the school, he said, and, based on early registration, enrollments are projected to be as many as 450 for the coming school year.
The statistics are part of what Rabbi Shmuel Greenberg, the spiritual leader of Young Israel of White Plains, calls a new trend in Orthodox Judaism. "The notion that Orthodoxy removes one from the dynamics of the modern world is no longer valid," he said.
With words on their lips like "inclusivity" and "contemporary" and "relevant to all Jews," it was with dismay last week that many Orthodox Jewish leaders in the county heard a statement issued on Monday by a national Orthodox rabbinical organization asserting that the less strict Reform and Conservative teachings followed by most American Jews "are not Judaism at all."
The 600-member, Manhattan-based Union of Orthodox Rabbis of the United States and Canada, widely regarded as a right-wing fringe group, is the oldest organization of rabbis in the United States. At a press conference at the New York Hilton in midtown Manhattan, Rabbi Hersh Ginsberg, acting chairman of the union, urged Jews affiliated with the Reform and Conservative movements "to abandon their erroneous ways."
But Rabbi Rubenstein, who is the first vice president of the Rabbinical Council of America, the largest council of Orthodox rabbis in the United States, repudiated the statement by the smaller group, saying, "It is not our aim to isolate any Jew."
A statement issued by Rabbi Rubenstein's council, along with the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, said, "We consider the public pronouncement particularly painful in light of the current dangers facing the Jews of Israel and other communities across the world, which cry out for Jewish unity even in diversity."
With 350 families, Young Israel of Scarsdale is the largest Orthodox Jewish congregation in the county, and like many other Orthodox congregations in the county, it has reached out to both observant and nonobservant Jews.
"No synagogue," said Rabbi Rubenstein, "should be only for the pious."
Of the 39,000 Jewish households in Westchester in 1991, 2,000 of them -- or 5 percent -- were Orthodox, according to population studies by Bethamie Horowitz, principal investigator for a 1991 New York Jewish Population Study by the United Jewish Appeal. For all of New York City and Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester Counties, 14 percent of all Jewish adults said they were Orthodox in 1991, the study said. Those are the latest numbers for which statistics are available, but anecdotal evidence suggests the percentages are rising, especially outside New York City.
The recent growth in Westchester of Orthodox synagogues like Young Israel of Scarsdale and the Hebrew Institute of White Plains, which has about 300 families, reflect what Dr. Jeffrey S. Gurock, professor of American Jewish History at Yeshiva University in Manhattan, called "the increasing suburbanization of Orthodox Jews."
Outside of sections of Brooklyn like Borough Park and Williamsburg, the largest suburban concentration of Orthodox Jews is in Monsey in Rockland County. There are also enclaves of Orthodox Judaism in New Jersey and on Long Island. In Westchester, the largest congregations are in New Rochelle, Scarsdale and White Plains.
"As the infrastructure in the suburbs -- the synagogues, the day schools, the kosher eateries, for example -- falls in place, the congregants follow," Dr. Gurock said.
"Orthodoxy used to be synonymous with the lack of a secular education, and as such with the lack of occupational and economic mobility," he said. "While that's still true of some segments, in the last 25 to 30 years, we've seen a rise to middle- and upper-class status of people who have gone through Jewish day schools and gone on to become doctors, lawyers and other professionals and who balance a religious orientation with secular pursuits. The Orthodox Jews of Westchester reflect that."
Take the case of Eric and Roxanne Levine, who moved to White Plains in 1989, joined an Orthodox synagogue and commute to their jobs in Manhattan. Dr. Levine is a sociologist, and Ms. Levine is a lawyer. They are members of the Hebrew Institute of White Plains.
"It was a combination of factors that brought us here -- the desire to get away from the noise of New York City and the wish to purchase a home in a quiet neighborhood within walking district of an Orthodox synagogue," said Ms. Levine, who specializes in immigration law. "In eight years, we've seen quite a growth in the Orthodox Jewish community here. At first, there wasn't even a kosher bakery or a restaurant. Now it's all starting to happen."
Ms. Levine attends a women's monthly study group on the role of the female in Jewish law, run by Rabbi Chaim Marder, the spiritual leader of the Hebrew Institute of White Plains. The rabbi also oversees a monthly prayer group for women, who traditionally are separated from men during religious services but are able to come together one Saturday afternoon each month to read the Torah together and to sing, study and pray.
Although some Orthodox Jews criticize women's prayer services, Rabbi Marder said he sees it "as a window of opportunity to bring women closer into the religion." He continued: "The opponents ask, 'What will it lead to?' and they question whether lines are being crossed. But from my point of view, I understand that it's a struggle for many Orthodox women who are not allowed to run a service."
Debra Hoffman, who attends a women's prayer and study group at Young Israel of Scarsdale, said: "Basically, the traditional services are written by and for men, and traditionally Eastern European women were taught by their mothers at home, so they didn't receive the education that their brothers did. So while in some ways there may be a strong role for women in the religion, there is also a need for them to have a spiritual outlet as well."
While there are no firm numbers on the growth of Orthodox Jewry since the 1991 study, other studies of the baby-boomer generation indicate that in general its members, regardless of persuasion, share an increased interest in religion.
Dr. Levine, 44, who is the associate executive director of the annual campaign of the United Jewish Appeal Federation of New York, said: "For a lot of us baby boomers and for the Generation X'ers as well, we find that religion provides us with a system of values that is enobling and uplifting. The boomers are a searching, sometimes spiritually searching generation looking to match a sense of purpose with a life style that supports those values."
Or as Judy Tretin, a member of Rabbi Greenberg's synagogue in White Plains, said, "In a world with so many distractions, disappointments and pressures, our religion gives us hope and a sense of continuity."
Mrs. Tretin, who is the early-childhood administrator at the Westchester Day School, said she especially looks forward each week to the Sabbath, which Jews observe from sundown on Friday until sundown on Saturday. On that day in most Orthodox Jewish families, no cars are driven, no lights are turned on or off and the usual distractions of the week do not intrude.
"The day is like a festival that I prepare for all week," Mrs. Tretin said. "I don't know what I would do without it. It is the one time my family truly shares together."

HEADLINE: 7 Arts Groups Join In Internet Alliance

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI 

DATELINE: PURCHASE

 BODY:
THE seven largest cultural institutions in the county announced last week that they have formed an alliance in an effort to broaden their audiences.
Making up what is being called the AT&T Westchester Arts Network are the Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts, Historic Hudson Valley, the Hudson River Museum, the Katonah Museum of Art, Lyndhurst and the Neuberger Museum of Art and the Performing Arts Center, both at Purchase College. They will collaborate on a cultural calendar and a Web page on the Internet and will share resources ranging from market research to advertising dollars. 
 The move to transform these cultural institutions from competitors to collaborators in part reflects the recognition among their directors that there is diminishing government and corporate financial support for the arts and that pooling resources will save each organization money.
But as the institutions began to discuss the idea of an alliance and compared their mailing lists, they made a surprising discovery: though there had always been an assumption that the groups had a large shared audience, they found that in fact the overlap was small -- less than 5 percent of the names were cross-referenced on the seven separate mailing lists, said Howard Herring, executive director of Caramoor.
"It was a real shocker," Mr. Herring said. "Not only did we have very little overlap in our audiences crossing over from different kinds of institutions -- like someone who would visit a historic site and also attend a concert -- but also even within each discipline there was little overlap. Art lovers who would go to the Hudson River Museum might never go to the Neuberger or the Katonah. The same is true with music. People who go to the Performing Arts Center at Purchase don't go to Caramoor."
At first the executive directors were mystified by the behavior of the audience. They speculated that there were psychological barriers at work that sometimes cause people to overlook all cultural offerings in the county, let alone sample what each different institution is presenting.
"I talk to people in northern Westchester who drive past Purchase to go hear 'Orpheus' in New York City rather than here," Mr. Herring said. "Or they'll drive past Caramoor to get to Tanglewood to hear Mr. Previn conduct over a loudspeaker, yet at Caramoor you can listen to him naturally in a lovely setting."
He added that within the county there are also geographic barriers -- Westchester is notorious for its limited east-west travel -- which may discourage people from traveling to more than one or two of the cultural institutions in the county.
But whatever factors were precluding the audience crossover, those forming the alliance began to see the situation as an opportunity: there existed many untapped ticket buyers with an interest in the arts.
"It is encouraging to know that there is a market out there that is predisposed to culture and the arts but that hasn't yet explored everything the county has to offer," said Burns Patterson, a spokesman for Historic Hudson Valley.
The organizations searched for a patron to back their alliance, and AT&T, which has supported the arts in the county in the past, agreed to help not only with the calendar and the Web site but also with advertising and promotion.
"Our long commitment to the county and to the arts creates a natural partnership in a community where many AT&T employees live and work," said Robin Flowers, regional director of public relations for AT&T. "The arts are vital to economic development, and this partnership promises to bring the cultural treasures of this community to a diverse audience."
Each of the seven nonprofit organizations in the alliance attracts an audience of more than 50,000 people a year, but none are at capacity. The alliance has set a goal to increase their cumulative attendance by 5 percent by the end of this year. Mr. Herring estimated that the organizations collectively generate at least $68 million a year in revenues for the local economy.
The new Web site -- www.artsnetwork.org -- is now being designed.

HEADLINE: Support Waning For Social Services

BYLINE: By MAURA CASEY 

 BODY:
FIVE years ago in Willimantic it was common to see coffee cans in stores with the handwritten message: "Support the needle exchange."
The program was operated by activists who used the donations to distribute clean needles to a small number of heroin addicts. The activists were trying to help addicts whose habit of sharing needles is one of the primary methods of spreading the virus that causes AIDS. 
 Last month, Willimantic changed its mind. About 100 city residents attended a hearing in Hartford to ask that the state stop the needle exchange. Opponents of the program included Representative John Lescoe, Democrat of Willimantic, who had initially favored the state's 1994 endorsement and expansion of the program. Similar changes of heart have occurred in several of Connecticut's cities in the last two years.
* In 1995, Hartford's City Council imposed the first formal moratorium on new social services of any major city in the country. The city ended the freeze last year, but not before passing strict guidelines concerning where in the city new social service programs could open.
* Last year, Middletown passed its own ban on any new medical and mental health services; this year it extended that moratorium to January of 1998.
* The city of Groton, alarmed at the potential for social service programs to buy boarding houses that once housed Electric Boat workers, last year imposed a two-month ban on the practice until it could pass more restrictive zoning regulations.
* New London's City Council recently told the Department of Social Services that it did not want a planned satellite office of the department to open in the city, pointedly suggesting that the Social Services Department put the office in Waterford, the town next door.
* In March, the southeastern Connecticut Council of Governments moved swiftly to vote in support of a bill that would require community consent before the state could place a needle-exchange program in individual municipalities. The vote came after the group was told that Connecticut was considering Norwich, Groton or New London as the site of a new needle-exchange project.
Advocates of social services programs say that governments at all levels are offering less support for poor people.
In Connecticut, they say, the cities have traditionally supported social services but now have less and less money to do so. And, say observers, cities are becoming fed up with the unwillingness of affluent suburbs to share the burden of helping poor people.
"We're seeing the abdication of aid by governments, whether state or local," said Alison Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Connecticut Association for Human Services and director of the Nonprofit Cabinet, a coalition of social service providers.
In particular, she said, the new zoning rules in Hartford concern her. "The impact on social services won't be immediate, but you'll see it over time," she said, as programs close and the restrictions make it difficult for new ones to open.
Middletown's move to curb new programs came after the state announced plans to close several state hospitals in different regions and instead concentrate its mental health services at Connecticut Valley Hospital in Middletown.
That's when the city's Planning and Zoning Commission imposed a moratorium on new services, said Middletown's planning director, Bill Warner. The city successfully sued the state to force it to assess the impact of the consolidation on Middletown. But the issue goes further, he said.
"I definitely think cities are fed up," said Mr. Warner. "Cities have always serviced the needs of the poor. The region doesn't support the cities, but the cities support the suburbs with their services," such as hospitals and other nonprofit organizations.
Richard Brown, New London's City Manager, agreed. When the Department of Social Services announced plans to open a new welfare office in New London, he responded by pointing out that the six-square-mile city is already home to 24 nonprofit organizations and many social service agencies, all of which are exempt from property taxes.
"It is ironic," he said, "that the state and Federal Government doesn't spend money adequately to attract jobs to urban areas, but they'll spend huge amounts of money to renovate a halfway house."
Others made similar observations. Norwich's director of Social Services, Beverly Goulet said, "During the 1970's and 1980's, fewer and fewer jobs were located in cities, and instead of spending money to replace the jobs, government replaced them with social services. We abandoned jobs in cities, but the people who need help are still here. If we continue to neglect urban centers we'll never turn Connecticut around."
Ms. Goulet said that people in cities who have less access to jobs still need a safety net, but that government is less willing now to provide social services on the same scale as before.
Sometimes, Representative Lescoe said, a city's willingness to support services can be eroded by the manner in which government conducts the program. Willimantic supported the needle-exchange when it was a small, local effort, he said, but when the state took over, the project got out of hand.
Instead of involving 17 or 18 heroin addicts, the program eventually distributed needles to 300 addicts, giving out needles whether or not addicts returned used needles. City residents began to find discarded needles, some with blood still in them, on park benches, sidewalks and scattered in residential neighborhoods. People got angry, especially last year when a toddler stuck herself with a discarded needle.
"I'm not against the concept of needle exchanges. If it saves lives, fine," Mr. Lescoe said. "We weren't against the program, we just wanted the state to fix the problems." And that didn't happen, he said.
Mr. Lescoe said he has become increasingly concerned about the impact on cities of shouldering the burden of social services. "Urban areas get every social program. Every time you get rid of one, there's another to take its place. I can see five halfway houses from my porch on Jackson Street," he said. To enable local officials to keep better track of when and where the state intends to put new programs, he introduced a bill to force the state to inform State Representatives and Senators before the state spends money in a municipality, he said. Then, at least, officials could have a chance to react before a program opens its doors, he said.
The answer, say social service advocates and municipal officials alike, is for suburbs to share more of the burden and for city residents to have access to more jobs.
"We need to support our core cities," said Ms. Johnson. "We need to do a better job of providing services in surrounding communities. But building walls higher is not the answer."

HEADLINE: Who Says Service Is No Good?

 BODY:
We wonder which Connecticut the article ("It's a Service Economy, but Where's the Service?," March 16) was referring to. Not the one we know, and we've been right here in the middle of Connecticut for 27 years.
Our cars have always been serviced properly and reasonably. Our local gas station is always ready to help in an emergency. 
 The people who do repair work on our house are sometimes slow about getting here, but they do good work at a reasonable price, and a declaration of emergency brings them running.
Supermarket clerks do make mistakes, but they are corrected promptly and courteously. Nor is shopping in other stores a problem.
As for medical care, the Middlesex Memorial Hospital in Middletown is known for its skillful care and kind, caring treatment. Both of us have been patients there and could not have been better treated.
Perhaps the writer of the article lives in that part of our state that is really a suburb of New York.

HEADLINE: Lights Dimming At the Dog Tracks Where It All Began

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
BEFORE casinos on Indian lands. Before jai alai frontons. Before off track betting parlors. Before the wide assortment of games of chance available to bet on in stores and other places througout the state.
Before all that there was Plainfield Greyhound Park in eastern Connecticut, close to the Massachussetts and Rhode Island borders -- the first place in the state where one could legally make a bet, short of buying a lottery ticket. 
 The opening of the dog track in January of 1976 was, after the weekly lottery, the first step in the state's plunge into gambling as a means of raising revenues, ostensibly for education. Largely because of its location, which enabled it to draw bettors from two states familiar with dog racing, Plainfield Greyhound Park did well for about a dozen years. Influenced by that early success, the owner of a jai alai fronton in Bridgeport converted his operation into a dog track when fronton attendance began to falter. Two years later, the Bridgeport dog track -- Shoreline Star Greyhound Racing and Entertainment -- is in bankruptcy and racing has been suspended since Dec. 1, although bettors can still make wagers on televised out-of-state horse races, along with greyhound racing from Plainfield Park.
At the same time, attendance is down sharply at Plainfield, as is the handle, the amount wagered on the dog races. Indeed, the state now pays more money to regulate and subsidize the dog track than it receives in taxes from parimutuel wagering there.
In a recent report, the Division of Special Revenue, which oversees the operation of gambling operations in the state, projected that the state will put out $1.5 million more to regulate the state's two dog tracks during the forthcoming fiscal year than it will receive in parimutuel taxes.
The declining popularity of dog tracks and jai alai frontons have prompted state lawmakers to reconsider continuing to subsidize gambling propositions that the legislature helped create. Adding to the legislators' dilemma is the economic impact the gambling centers have in their areas.
Plainfield Park's decline, like that of dog tracks throughout the country, is mainly attributable to inroads made by casino gambling. In the case of Plainfield Park, the state's two hugely successful casinos, Foxwoods in Ledyard and Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, are less than a half hour's drive away. "Since 1988, the yearly handle, the attendance and the parimutuel tax paid to the state has been declining," said George F. Wandrak, the acting executive director of the the Division of Special Revenue. "And that was four years before Foxwoods opened. Foxwoods merely exacerbated the situation."
Acording to Mr. Wandrak, the handle for the 1987-88 fiscal year totaled $188 million and the attendance was 790,666. By comparison, for the fiscal year that ended last June 30, the handle was $32.6 million and attendance 288,319. Even more significant was the decline in the state's share of the parimutuel tax, which dropped to $490,000 in the last fiscal year from $8.2 million in 1987-88. "That's a drop of 94 percent," Mr. Wandrak said, "but it does not diminish regulatory attempts since the same number of races -- 120 -- and the same number of dogs -- 8 -- still compete in each race."
Mr. Wandrak was referring to the 15 inspectors from the Division of Special Revenue who are assigned to Plainfield Park to conduct kennel inspections, do analyses of the dogs' urine samples after each of a program's 15 races and, in general, to oversee the operation of the privately owned track.
Karen Keelan, the general manager of Plainfield Greyhound Park, said that the handle and attendance have increased this year. "Better weather has helped and so has the fact that we've sold our signal to more facilities outside of the state," she said. That was a reference to the beaming of races from Plainfield to other betting centers.
Ms. Keelan also said that state government projections on subsidizing Plainfield Park are misleading. "They're talking solely about the parimutuel taxes and not including other tax money we generate," said Ms. Keelan, referring to admissions, sales, payroll, property and income taxes that the track generates. Mr. Wandrak conceded that point and noted other benefits to the Plainfield area. "Plainfield Park is a major employer in Plainfield, which, after Hartford, is the second-poorest town in Connecticut," said State Representative Michael Caron, a Republican from Plainfield. The challenge, Mr. Caron said, was for the park to diversify. "We've got to have vision here and do something different," he said. Among the possibilities he suggests are high-stakes bingo games and three-on-three basketball games on which wagers would be made. "They bet on jai alai in Connecticut and hardly anyone understands the game," Mr. Caron said. "But everyone understands basketball, so why not bet on it legally?"
Although Ms. Keelan did not mention three-on-three basketball games as alternatives to greyhound racing, she agreed that Plainfield Park must diversify if it is to survive. "About three-quarters of our space is unused," said Ms. Keelan, whose father was one of the original owners of Connecticut Yankee Greyhound Racing Inc., which owns the track. "And I can see cordoning off an area where minors would be admitted to go to a movie theater, be able to go line dancing, practice golf and do other things."
That, however, would require a change in state law, which now prohibits anyone under the age of 18 from entering a gambling installation during a racing season.
Greater diversity may also be the solution if success is to come to Shoreline Star in Bridgeport. "We need some other form of gaming if we're going to succeed," said Steve Alford, the general manager of the dog track. "We'd like to get slot machines, but it doesn't look like that will happen."
Under a compact worked out between Lowell P. Weicker Jr., then the Governor, and the Mashantucket Pequots, who run the Foxwoods Casino, slot machines cannot be installed at any non-Indian gambling venue in Connecticut. In exchange, the state receives 25 percent of all slot revenues from Foxwoods and, since it opened last year, the Mohegan Sun Casino, too.
Situated alongside the now-vacant Bridgeport Jai Alai fronton, Shoreline Star suspended live racing last Dec. 1 after 13 months of activity. Racing is scheduled to resume on May 1, but, Mr. Alford said, that is contingent on the infusion of money from new investors. "There has been interest," Mr. Alford said, saying that Robert Zeff, the owner of Shoreline Star, has had talks with a number of prospective investors.
Though it is is a state-of-the-art dog racing center, the Bridgeport track drew poorly, averaging about 1,000 to a racing session. "We opened up on several wrong assumptions," said Mr. Alford, who had been the general manager of a dog track in Kansas City, Kansas, which went bankrupt because of competition from nearby riverboat gambling.
"We actually thought we'd be the most successful dog track in the country," Mr. Alford said, "and that traffic would be backed up for 15 miles on I-95 before race programs began. After all, we were going to be the only dog track in the New York metropolitan area and would have 16 million people to draw on. But business was soft at the start and relatively slow for the rest of the year. And the bad winter weather last year hurt us, too."
Of the three parimutuel installations where live competition is held, the Milford jai alai fronton, last of three built in the 70's that is still operating, seems to have fared best. "We had a major drop in attendance after Foxwoods opened, but business has gotten better," said Leonard Meyers, the owner.
Mr. Meyers said the Milford fronton generated $30 million in off track betting last year, of which $1 million was paid to the state in taxes. "O.T.B. accounts for about 40 percent of our business," he said. "And you have to take into account what we do for the local economy. We have about 300 employes and a $6 million payroll, and we're one of the town's top five taxpayers. We think the state should be proud of what we do and should boost us."
If anything, the state may make it even more difficult for the parimutuel installations to survive. Tax reductions may again be available from the legislature, but Gov. John G. Rowland has proposed that the tracks absorb the cost of urine testing, on which the state is paying about $700,000 a year.
Ms. Keelan and Mr. Alford each said that absorbing the urine testing costs would be very difficult. "No other state tests as much as Connecticut does," Ms. Keelan said. "Most other states which have dog racing test only the winner and the favorite if the favorite finishes out of the money."
Mr. Wandrak said he was opposed to any reduction in testing. "We test as extensively as we do to insure the integrity of every race," he said. "It also helps insure the health and welfare of the dogs."
But State Senator Alvin W. Penn, a Democrat from Bridgeport, said, "Maybe we can lower the amount spent by testing on a random basis. And we should look into the possibility of finding facilities that do the testing cheaper," he said. Currently, the urine testing is done at a chemistry laboratory at the University of Connecticut.
Senator Penn, who is a chairman of the General Assembly's Public Safety Committee, which concerns itself with legalized gambling, said he also thought that diversification might be the answer to resolving the plight of the two dog tracks.
And State Representative Moira K. Lyons of Stamford, who is the House Majority Leader, said, "At some point we have to look and see if it makes sense to continue subsidizing facilities that are not generating sufficient revenues.
"We want to be supportive," Ms. Lyons said, "but they're going to have to come back to us with some new concepts; they're going to have to be more creative."

HEADLINE: How the Board Game Got Its Spots

BYLINE: By BILL KENT 

 BODY:
MONOPOLY is officially attributed to Charles Darrow, an unemployed Philadelphia heating contractor, although earlier versions of what has been called "the real estate game" date back to the late 19th century. Mr. Darrow's version, from 1929, was at first rejected when he offered to sell it to Parker Brothers. The Massachusetts game company thought the game was too long and had too many rules and no clear-cut finish.
The fact that it was based on Atlantic City streets, landmarks, railroads and utilities was not considered a strong selling point. The game was based on the city's boom in real estate speculation in the 1920's, when stone hotels like the St. Charles, the Ritz-Carlton and the Claridge began to replace the wooden ones in the Boardwalk area. Mr. Darrow was living nearby at the time. 
 When sales of game sets that Mr. Darrow manufactured began to pick up at Wanamaker's department store in Philadelphia, Parker Brothers decided to buy the game to take advantage of what was considered a fad. The company predicted that demand for the game would fade by around 1935.
It was wrong.
Monopoly made both Parker Brothers and Charles Darrow rich. He retired to travel the world and grow orchids. Parker Brothers, now owned by Hasbro in Pawtucket, R.I., hopes a total of 100 million Monopoly game sets will be sold by the year 2000.
When the first legal casino hotel opened in Atlantic City in 1978, Parker Brothers released an updated version of Monopoly that let players build casinos. Called Advance to Boardwalk, it never became popular. Nor is it likely that Parker Brothers' Monopoly CD-ROM version, released last year, will ever supplant the board game, which Hasbro says is currently the most popular 20th-century board game in the world.

HEADLINE: YOUNG NEW JERSEY;
Report Finds Clouds Over Children's Lives

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Social troubles that hurt the health and well-being of New Jersey children are seeping into the suburbs, the 1996 Kids Count report says.
Child abuse, poverty, juvenile crime and infant mortality still occur far more often in cities than in suburbs, and most aid programs continued to be directed at inner-city families. 
 But statistically, the largest jump in these social troubles occurred in the suburbs in the first half of the 1990's, according to the report, released last week by by the Association for Children of New Jersey.
The report is an annual snapshot of the well-being of New Jersey children. It examines 13 factors, including the number of children receiving food stamps and welfare, the number of teen-age deaths, the incidence of child abuse and juvenile crime, the number of babies born with low birth weight, infant mortality rates and other factors. It then compared the incidence of these social problems to previous years.
Overall, New Jersey continues to show scant progress in improving the well-being of its children, said Cecilia Zalkind, the associate director of the children's association. New Jersey again ranked 19th in the country on the national Kids Count report.
"We haven't dramatically worsened, and we haven't dramatically improved," Ms. Zalkind said. "It is as though we've accepted almost a permanent underclass of kids."
Six counties -- Somerset, Burlington, Cape May, Middlesex, Hunterdon and Sussex -- had increases of more than 20 percent in at least four of the factors surveyed. With a few exceptions, the comparisons are made from 1990 to 1995.
Bergen County had the largest increases in problems, with a 116 percent jump in the number of juveniles sent to institutions after committing crimes and a 44 percent rise in the number of child deaths.
Burlington County also hd significant increases, including a 33 percent jump in juvenile arrests and a 58 percent rise in family problems, a term used by the state Division of Youth and Family Services to describe parental problems that could lead to child abuse or neglect.
Affluent Somerset County had the largest increase -- 34 percent -- in the number of teen-agers who gave birth.
Ciro Scalera, executive director of the Association for Children of New Jersey, said that while the percentages had increased in the suburbs, the cities still housed many more children growing up in poverty and surrounded by severe social problems.
In Bergen County, for example, the number of children on welfare jumped 35 percent. But the actual number of Bergen County children receiving welfare is still low at 4,682 when compared to urban areas like Essex County, which has 51,291 children on welfare.
In 1996, 66 percent of children receiving welfare lived in five counties: Camden, Essex, Hudson, Passaic and Union.
Statewide, the number of children on welfare increased 1.7 percent from 1990 to the first part of 1996, the report said. But state Department of Human Services figures show that the number of children currently on welfare is down about 12 percent to 171,000. That reflects the general trend of declining welfare rolls.
The most disturbing statewide trend is the rise in the number of teen-agers placed in detention centers and other residential programs because they have committed crimes. From 1990 to 1995, the number of juveniles committed to institutions increased 14.5 percent, to 1,100 from 961.
There was some good news in the report.
In Newark, the number of teen-age deaths fell 51 percent, while infant mortality decreased 22 percent.
Camden had similar declines, with 6.3 percent fewer teen-agers killed during the period and a 32 percent decrease in infant mortality. Mr. Scalera attributed these declines to population changes in the cities, combined with the influence of some social programs.
Statewide infant mortality rate fell about 16 percent from 1990 to 1994, from 1,086 to 910.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Consolidating Realty Brokerages and Services;
Industry Experts Ponder the Rising Merger Trend

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
THE consolidation trend now under way in New York's real estate brokerage and related services offices has some leading industry executives predicting that the business will wind up divided into two groups -- national, publicly traded companies and boutiques representing local clients in local transactions.
The latest wave got started last year when Insignia Financial Group acquired the Edward S. Gordon Company and set about using it as a vehicle to build a national commercial real estate operation. So far this year, the company has announced agreements to acquire the Rostenberg-Doern Company, which covers Westchester and Fairfield Counties, and Frain Camins & Swartchild in Chicago. 
 Two West Coast-based companies with operations in New York, CB Commercial and Koll Real Estate Services, have said they will combine, with CB Commercial acquiring Koll for $145 million in its stock.
The Galbreath Company's top New York official, Bruce E. Mosler, and a group of brokers associated with him have departed to join Cushman & Wakefield amid persistent reports that Galbreath is holding merger talks with the Chicago-based LaSalle Partners.
And there have been questions raised about the future of the area's largest real estate services company, Cushman & Wakefield, which is ultimately owned by a Japanese company, Mitsubishi Estate. Might Mitsubishi be interested in raising capital by selling a company some see as an odd fit in a company oriented toward property investments? The rumors, rejected by Cushman & Wakefield executives, are reflective of the changes taking place in the industry.
"I see more and more consolidation," said Raymond T. O'Keefe, president of Grubb & Ellis New York, the local office of the publicly traded company based in suburban Chicago. "Corporations want to deal with as few real estate companies as possible, so they are looking for the ones that can provide the broadest range of services."
As corporations shrink their headquarters staffs, Mr. O'keefe said, they are forced to rely on outside companies for consulting services. "They need to have someone to help them, evaluate their real estate needs," he said. "Should they own or lease? How to finance transactions? All this requires larger firms with a broad geographic spread."
There is a parallel between the growth in size of companies in other types of service industries and the consolidation of real estate companies, said Steven A. Swerdlow, executive vice president in charge of CB Commercial's New York metropolitan area operations.
"Back while I was still practicing law 15 years ago, I was with what was considered a medium-sized law firm," he said. "It had 50 lawyers. Now a medium-sized law firm has 200 lawyers. Over the last 15 years the advertising agencies have gotten huge. The stock brokerages have gotten bigger and fewer."
With real estate investment trusts supplanting family and corporate ownership of real estate, Mr. Swerdlow said, it is only natural for the real estate services companies to consolidate and look to capital markets for financing to speed growth.
Michael T. Cohen, the president of Williams Real Estate Company, said while it is possible for smaller independent real estate services companies to survive, there are strong forces driving consolidation.
He said Wall Street valued the earnings of a local real estate company at a lower multiple than a national or international operation, which made it difficult to tap financial markets.
He echoed Mr. O'Keefe in saying that national corporations often wanted to deal with one or two national real estate companies who could handle all their needs with a quality of service more even than dealing with multiple, locally managed companies.
SOME costs are fixed, he noted, so spreading them over a larger base of transactions or properties produces economies of scale. He added that consolidators had the opportunity to broaden the range of skills in their portfolios by acquiring firms with established specialties.
In spite of these factors, he said, consolidators have to be sure of what they are buying. "Some people are using this as an exit strategy," he said. "Most regional real estate brokerage companies are run on a superstar management philosophy that requires hands-on management. If those people leave, what have you bought -- desks?"
He said Williams "sees opportunities to ride this wave and we are exploring them," but he declined to offer further details.
Despite the economic pressures pushing toward consolidation, some top executives say the smaller companies will do nicely by emphasizing their detailed knowledge of local markets and customer wants. "I know what my customers want, I have intimacy with my customers," said Robert L. Billingsley, executive vice president of Colliers ABR, which has about 100 employees. "If I get a whole lot bigger, it gets harder to do customer intimacy."
He said smaller companies could make decisions quickly without waiting for permission from corporate boards in distant cities. And, he said, bigger companies are going to run into conflict-of-interest problems by seeking to represent companies that compete with each other.
"If I'm a landlord and one of these big agencies is representing a building across the street, I'm not going to want them to represent me as well," Mr. Billingsley said.
Julien J. Studley, the chairman of Julien J. Studley, Inc., said he was not inclined to increase the size of his company, which has about 250 professional employees in 10 markets across the country.
"The stated goal of companies like Gordon or CB is to make acquisitions," he said. "That is a basic part of their strategy. But I have questions about whether this is going to produce better real estate services."
He said growth by acquisition brought with it the problem of blending vastly different cultures in a business based on people and personal relationships. He noted Insignia's acquisition of the Frain Camins firm in Chicago and said "that firm has no resemblance to Gordon."
"These are not easy mergers," he said, "and it will be interesting to watch to see how it works out."
He said the great virtue of Insignia's acquisition of the Gordon company (for $74 million) was that it established a price for a service company.
"We get approached all the time," he said. "This way we got the valuation without having to do the transaction." He said his employee-owned company was about the same size as the Gordon company before the takeover and subsequent acquisitions.
Some executives argue that outright acquisitions are better than trying to operate nationally through loose alliances and networks.
"IF you have one company, you do business one way," said Mr. O'Keefe, who worked for Cushman & Wakefield and Gordon before joining Grubb & Ellis last year. "The reports will be the same, the analysis of the market will be the same. When you are dealing with employees, you simply have more leverage than if you are working for a network."
Arthur M. Mirante, the president and chief executive of Cushman & Wakefield, said there was no basis to rumors that the company's Japanese parent might be putting it on the block.
"Mitsubishi Estate is a real estate company -- probably the biggest in the world," Mr. Mirante said. "So their ownership of us makes sense. They are real estate guys; that's their only business and they will own us for a long time."
Mitsubishi Estate is the 100 percent owner of the Rockefeller Group, which owns four office towers on the west side of Sixth Avenue facing Rockefeller Center. In addition, the company owns a cleared building site on Seventh Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets known as "Rock West" and 80 percent of Cushman & Wakefield. The rest is owned by employees.
Mr. Mirante said the parent company was encouraging Cushman & Wakefield to participate in the market.
"We are in the market for acquisitions and have four or five deals under way," he said. In addition to acquiring Mr. Mosler and his group, he said the company had taken over a company called Metropolitan Structure, which had been the development arm of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;
Frustrated, but Standing Pat

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
PLENTY of investors with carefully constructed portfolios are frustrated by the fact that a single index fund would have provided better returns over the last couple of years.
Even in the tumultuous first quarter, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index continued to be the stock pace-setter. Only 274, about 1 of every 10, diversified domestic equity funds beat the benchmark in the period. Last year, 523 of those funds outpaced the S.& P. index. 
 Among the 64 funds that track the index, the average gain in the first quarter was 2.52 percent, versus an average loss of 1.98 percent for diversified domestic funds, according to Lipper Analytical Services, the fund trackers in Summit, N.J.
 With that kind of showing, it can be tempting to just throw all your money into a big index fund.
But take heed: the five professional money managers who have created hypothetical retirement portfolios for The New York Times are equally frustrated and still holding firm to their diversified approach.
"When the market goes straight up, diversification seems like a dumb strategy," conceded Harold Evensky, an investment adviser in Coral Gables, Fla., whose portfolio gained a scant 0.63 percent last quarter. "Stock investing is 'safe,' bonds are 'dumb,' high-yield bonds are a terrific investment, taxi drivers and other gurus are brilliant, and there is no down -- only up."
When such thinking dominates, a diversified portfolio may be hard to live with in the short run. But, Mr. Evensky added, "Like a house of bricks that's harder to build than a house of sticks, it lasts much better in the long run."
JOHN REKENTHALER, publisher of Morningstar Mutual Funds, in Chicago, says the stocks in the S.& P. 500 have already had such a huge run-up that the best opportunities can be found elsewhere.
"Sentiment for the index is as high as it's going to get," Mr. Rekenthaler said. "I expect the next bull market to resemble 1991 to 1993, when smaller stocks and, to a lesser extent, international companies benefited as investors rotated their moneys from safe United States blue chips into other investments."
In the meantime, he is pleased with his portfolio, which rose 0.40 percent for the quarter. "The international funds were above average for their ilk; Skyline Special and Third Avenue Value easily beat the Russell and even Fidelity Export, my weakest performer, fared well for a fund laden with technology."
Mr. Rekenthaler is following Arieh Coll, the recently departed manager of Fidelity Export. He is selling his 10 percent stake in Export and using the proceeds to buy shares in Fidelity Trend, Mr. Coll's new fund.
Because Mr. Rekenthaler believes that the S.& P. 500 companies are in for a hard time soon, he is also moving 5 percent of his assets, now in the Fidelity Fund, to Ivy International. That leaves him with just 15 percent of his portfolio in the Fidelity Fund, his sole United States blue-chip investment.
Sheldon Jacobs, who edits the No-Load Fund Investor, in Irvington, N.Y., retains the overall lead among the five managers, with a gain of 82 percent since the contest began more than three years ago, on July 7, 1993. The portfolios have risen an average of 61 percent, compared with an 87 percent total return for the Vanguard Index 500 fund, which mimics the S.& P. 500.
THREE of the five portfolios made money in the second quarter. And in a tribute to their broad diversification and their international components, all did better than the average for domestic diversified stock funds.
The portfolio performance, tracked each quarter by Lipper, excludes sales charges, transaction costs and tax considerations, because most retirement money is held in tax-deferred accounts. The five managers can choose any fund open to new investors and can shift money quarterly, although the portfolios were intended to grow for 20 years.
The leader for the quarter was Mr. Jacobs, with a gain of 3.40 percent. After toning down the risk in his portfolio in December, saying he expected a bear market during the next 12 months, he is sitting tight now.
In fourth place for the quarter, with a loss of 0.28 percent, was Jack A. Brill, a San Diego investment adviser who created a "socially responsible" fund portfolio. "I continue to believe that a long-term retirement fund for the next 15 to 20 years should be 90 percent in stocks and 10 percent in bonds," he said. "My choices in stock funds continue to be basically conservative, with diversification in global, aggressive and small-cap funds."
But Mr. Brill is making several changes. He is dropping Calvert Social Investment Managed Growth, because of its disappointing performance, and using most of the proceeds to buy shares in MMA Praxis Growth, a growth and income fund from the Mennonite Mutual Aid family, which looks for stocks that promote peace, justice, stewardship and health. He says the MMA manager uses relative value to select stocks, aiming for long-term growth and modest income.
Mr. Brill is adding the Parnassus Fund because of recent changes made by the fund's manager, including his decision to look more closely at how companies manage their growth and to give them less time to perform. Also new is the Vanguard Fixed-Income GNMA fund, creating a 10 percent position in bonds. Though the Vanguard fund is not formally dedicated to socially responsible issues, Mr. Brill noted that its Ginnie Mae bonds were backed by mortgages for middle-income and subsidized low-income housing.
In last place for the quarter, with a loss of 0.41 percent, was Eric M. Kobren, president of Insight Management and the editor of Fidelity Insight, an independent newsletter in Wellesley, Mass. Mr. Kobren's portfolio was hurt by a 10 percent stake in Fidelity Pacific Basin, which lost 6.80 percent in the period.
He is dropping that fund, which is more than 50 percent invested in Japan, out of concern that Japan's economic recovery will be further delayed by an increase in the country's consumption tax. He is splitting the proceeds equally between Fidelity Real Estate and Contrafund.
Over all, Mr. Kobren says that "while I'm far from being bearish on stocks, I strongly believe that being cautious (i.e., defensive) will, in the longer run, prove beneficial to growth-oriented investors."

Jinx? What Jinx?

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV 

 BODY:
DAVID PAGE sounded confident, but maybe a little nervous as well. He and his wife, Barbara Shinn, who own Home, at 20 Cornelia Street, were preparing to open their second restaurant, Drover's Tap Room, at 9 Jones Street. They had completely reconstructed the dining room, they had lovingly oiled the bar, and Mr. Page had even prepared beef jerky and pickled eggs as special snacks for the opening night party last Tuesday.
But there was one nagging thought, one potential fly in the soup. In the last four years, four restaurants had failed at 9 Jones Street. First was Sandolino, an old Village institution that opened there briefly after moving from its longtime location nearby. Then came Caffe Florence, an Italian restaurant. Despite good reviews, it went out of business. Then came two incarnations of a restaurant called 9 Jones. It, too, got good reviews. It, too, closed, twice. Could 9 Jones Street be a jinxed address, one of those legendarily cursed sites where restaurants simply cannot succeed? 
 "I'm a believer in spaces that are jinxed, and it scares the heck out of me," said Mr. Page, whose restaurants elaborate on the Middle American cooking he remembers from his childhood in Berlin, Wis. He paused a moment. "I don't think there's a chance that this place is jinxed, though."
Like alligators in the sewers or cats exploding in microwaves, the jinxed restaurant location is an urban myth. When a series of restaurants fail at a particular site for seemingly inexplicable reasons, the "jinx" is invariably trotted out by those who prefer the supernatural to more earthbound explanations like "undercapitalization" or "traffic flow." Mr. Page himself is a practical businessman as well as a chef. Still, he expresses concern about a colleague, John Schenk, who is opening a restaurant at another legendarily cursed address, One Fifth Avenue. "If Alfred Portale can't create a success there," he said, "that closes the book for me."
Mr. Portale, the acclaimed chef at Gotham Bar and Grill, and Jerome Kretchmer, the primary investor, were not able to make a go of a seafood restaurant there and closed it in June 1994 after a year and a half of struggling. A successor with different owners, Vince and Linda's at One Fifth, didn't fare any better.
"I don't believe in hexes or jinxes," said Mr. Schenk, who hopes his new restaurant, Clementine, will open in late April. "It has everything to do with timing, product and execution."
Mr. Portale hedges on whether One Fifth's failure was entirely rational. "It wasn't a good location for us," he said. "I'm not superstitious, but I used to feel there was a certain energy or aura about that space. There may be ghosts there." Mr. Portale does have his own rules for predicting success or failure. "If you have to go up a flight or down a flight, the restaurant's not going to work," he said. "Traffic flow: people are fanatic about which way the traffic flows on the street. They'll travel across Fifth to Park for lunch, but they won't head west."
Mr. Portale's rules would explain why the restaurant site at 525 Broome Street near the Avenue of the Americas is considered jinxed. Not only is it a flight down from the street, but traffic flows west on Broome. In rapid succession, three restaurants -- Vix Cafe, Tasco do Porto and La Taverne -- have failed there, but does Philippe Lajaunie, co-owner of the last two restaurants, feel there's a curse? Au contraire. He attributes the failures to a lack of organization and supervision. The address itself, promises Mr. Lajaunie, who is in the process of selling the site, is just fine.
Real-estate transactions, of course, could be harmed if a site was thought to be jinxed. So it's not surprising that a broker has a ready rationale for a failed restaurant. "What appears to be jinxed is a place that doesn't fit into a defined market," said Warren Newcorn, executive vice president of Winick Realty Group, which specializes in retail leasing. He cited the Times Square area, where the rule used to be that a restaurant had to be west of Broadway to succeed. "But Artie Cutler, when he did Virgil's, proved you could succeed east of Broadway," Mr. Newcorn said of Virgil's Real BBQ on 44th Street. "Perceptions change, and boundaries move."
It has taken a long time for perceptions to change about 142 West 10th Street, where eight restaurants had failed since 1981 before Scott Bryan and Gino Diaferia opened Indigo in the fall of 1995. "We said, 'We heard it was jinxed,' but we took a chance on it," said Mr. Bryan, who is also the chef at Luma in Chelsea. "We didn't put in a ton of money, so we thought, why not?"
So far, Indigo has succeeded, both critically and commercially. It's been a much different experience for Mr. Bryan than for Diane Forley, who was the chef in one of the failed incarnations, Oggi Domani.
"It's one of those unexplained New York phenomenons," Ms. Forley said. "Some people have theories about walking east or west and I think that that had something to do with it."
Ms. Forley, who said she believes locations really can be jinxed, is doing much better now as the chef and owner of Verbena on Irving Place. "Knock wood," she said.
Anne Rosenzweig, who owns Arcadia and the Lobster Club on the Upper East Side, not only believes in jinxed locations but also seeks them out. "Both my restaurants were jinxed," she said. "People think of me as the jinxed-space person." Ms. Rosenzweig is attracted by the challenge of succeeding where others have failed. "It's like real estate," she said. "If you look at an apartment in horrible condition, you imagine what it could be."
Drover's Tap Room has been open almost a week, and Mr. Page is optimistic. The restaurant's been busier than expected, and things have gone smoother than he'd hoped. He chalks it up to his secret weapon: opening on April Fool's Day. "If you believe in jinxes," he said, "you also have to believe in sneaking past them through the back door."

Chart: "TENANTS: Revolving Restaurants"
In 1981, Bill Desmond bought 142 West 10th Street, a residential building that housed a restaurant on the ground floor. Recalling that Casey's, a posh restaurant, had been successful there in the late 1960's, he had high hopes. Here are the nine restaurants that have been there since, the approximate years they were open, with Mr. Desmond's comments.
 
Demerry's 1981-83 French "The owner painted all the walls black."
 
Holy Smokes 1983 "The chef died before the restaurant opened."
 
Two Guitars 1984 "That never opened either. The owners sat there and drank coffee all the time."
 
Czarovitch 1985-87 Russian "It never really took off."
 
Joe's Bar and Grill 1988-1992 American "Successful, but then it changed."
 
Oggi Domani 1993 Italian "It just didn't work."
 
Kiss 1994 "I don't know what it was."
 
Maracas 1995 Transexual bar "I closed it down."
 
Indigo 1995-present, "It's great. It's about time that space was dealt the right cards. I knew it wasn't cursed. I just think it was cursed by virtue of the owners."

Proposed Greenmarket Site Ruffles Co-op Feathers

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
By all accounts, the Greenmarket on West 70th Street was a good idea that never really took off. Tucked in front of Public School 199 between Amsterdam and West End Avenues, it never caught the attention of the pedestrians who pack the busier avenues.
In four years, this lack of visibility has forced farmers to reduce their supplies from truckful to trunkful. Even then, many still had to lug home excess produce. This year, only one of the original six farmers has signed on to return for the coming season, which begins in June. This lack of enthusiasm has prompted the market's operator to threaten to shut down if it is not moved to a more visible spot. 
 "It's not economically feasible to keep the market open," said Tony Mannetta, the assistant director of Greenmarket, a nonprofit organization that runs the markets throughout the city. "We operate farmers' market, not a farmer market."
Mr. Mannetta and supporters of the market say an ideal spot would be half a block east, on Amsterdam Avenue, where the wide sidewalks and high visibility would draw more customers. But that effort is fiercely opposed from residents of One Sherman Square at 201 West 70th Street, a luxury co-op directly behind the proposed site.
They said such a move would worsen congestion on the already crowded avenue, draw outsiders into the neighborhood, deter merchants from leasing the commercial spaces in the building, bring competition to the neighborhood's struggling grocers and reduce property values in the building.
"I believe Greenmarkets are a wonderful thing, but I don't think they should be placed in the main thoroughfare," said Debbie Stevens, a co-op resident. "I don't want it to become a regular street fair."
Community Board 7, on whose approval the move depends, is evenly divided, with 16 members voting for the proposed site and 16 opposed, with 1 abstention.
To end the impasse, Debra Asher, an aide to Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge, proposed last Thursday that the Greenmarket be temporarily moved to an open triangular area on the east side of Broadway between 72d and 73d Streets.
Diane Bradtcher, chairwoman of Community Board 7, said the board would discuss the new proposal soon. JANE H. LII

A Slow Climb From the Ashes

BYLINE: By ANDREA K. WALKER 

 BODY:
Zheng Shou Ping smelled the smoke as he slept with his family in the basement of his Chinese restaurant. Joy K. Chwe got a call from the alarm company in the early hours of the morning. And Lance Bernardine first learned of last month's devastating fire in Soundview from a morning newscast.
The blaze all but destroyed the 10,000-square-foot building on Westchester Avenue where they and seven other merchants rented space. By daybreak all that remained of the small businesses they had painstakingly built was ashes. Last week the faint smell of smoke still lingered in the air. The building's blackened skeleton sat where there had been thriving businesses, a painful reminder of the ruinous night. 
 Many of the merchants, like Mr. Ping, who lost his eight-month-old business, the Wo Hop Chinese restaurant, had no fire insurance. They are struggling to rebuild their businesses. Mr. Ping wonders if he will ever open another restaurant, but the city's housing agency helped find an apartment for him and his family.
Dwight Williams, a spokesman for the Mayor's office, said two of the merchants had applied for the $50,000 in low-interest city loans and five for the $1,000 emergency grants. The city and the Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation offered to help the merchants find new locations. But Kevin Nunn, president of the development corporation, said only one business, Titehead Unisex Barber, had asked for help in relocating.
Mr. Bernardine, one of four barbers who ran Titehead, said he and his partners were looking for other work, but were eager to move back to their old location where they had a strong customer base. They were reluctant to borrow money for a temporary location. "We don't feel like having to pay a loan back," he said. Ms. Chwe, the owner of Juno, a shoe store specializing in designer sneakers and boots, is in a better position than the other merchants. She is already at work on renovations on a building across the street from her old location. Using money from fire insurance and emergency grants and loans from the city, Ms. Chwe signed a one-year lease at the new location but hopes to move back to the previous site. "It's going to take more than a year to rebuild," she said, "but I'm going to move back. I've been here for more than 17 years and I want to stay."
Michael Vecchi, the city's Chief Fire Marshal, said that the cause of the fire was still under investigation, but it appeared to have been accidental. ANDREA K. WALKER

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;
Want the Fast Lane? Try Russia

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY MIDDLETON 

 BODY:
TALK about a new world order. Russia is the undisputed leader, and Japan is in the cellar.
Such is the state of affairs in the worldwide market for stocks. The newest emerging markets, with all their volatility, are enjoying a burst of growth, while established markets are generally languishing -- at least for anyone buying in dollars. 
 "Investors are finding the highest returns from countries which are just on the cusp of moving from an economically repressed regime to an economically reforming or free regime," said Bryan Johnson, co-editor of the 1997 Index of Economic Freedom, published by the Heritage Foundation and The Wall Street Journal.
Probably no one knows that better than Arpad Pongracz, manager of the Vontobel Eastern European Equity fund. He has chalked up the best performance for the last four quarters among international stock funds, with a gain of 59.6 percent, by investing in the former Soviet bloc.
 "I consider these countries more capitalistic than many Western European countries today," said Mr. Pongracz, who was born in Hungary and lives in Switzerland. Companies in European nations like Italy and Germany rely more on bank loans than on stock issuance for financing, he said. By his reasoning, regions whose companies issue stock to raise capital are more capitalistic.
The stock market capitalization of the Czech Republic represents about 32 percent of the gross domestic product there, versus 28 percent in Germany, Mr. Pongracz said. (By comparison, capitalization exceeds 100 percent of the G.D.P. in the United States.) The percentages are far lower in Hungary, Poland and Russia than in the Czech Republic, he said, but they are moving in that direction.
In fact, Russia was one of the most profitable places to invest in the first quarter of 1997 as it was in 1996. The other profit centers were in what used to be called the third world: Hungary and the rest of Eastern Europe, the Mideast and parts of Africa and almost the whole of Latin America. Among emerging markets, only those in Asia have been dragging their heels so far this year.
The Morgan Stanley Capital International indexes for emerging markets in Latin America, Europe and the Middle East each rose more than 17 percent in the first quarter, led by Russia, with a 48 percent gain; Turkey, with 42 percent, and Brazil and Hungary, at 24 percent each. Emerging markets in the Far East, meanwhile, gained less than 2 percent.
Among funds that invest in a variety of emerging markets, the best performances of the last quarter were recorded by Glenmede Emerging Markets and Federated Emerging Markets, each of which gained nearly 14 percent. The Federated fund is also a leader for the 12 months, posting a total return of more than 31 percent.
As surely as emerging markets dominated the international arena in the first quarter, Japan was crushed. Owing to the failure of the Japanese Government to revive the nation's flagging economy and to the continuing decline of the yen against the dollar, many funds with Japan in their names -- including DFA Japanese Small Company and Fidelity Japan Small Companies -- racked up double-digit losses.
Europe rallied, meanwhile, but the dollar's strength slashed net returns to American investors by nearly two-thirds. The Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe Index jumped 11.6 percent in local currencies, but only 4.4 percent in dollar terms.
Now that the American stock market is swooning, interest in foreign markets is bound to increase. And the spotlight is shining on the hot emerging markets, despite the considerable risk.
"The outlook for emerging markets, not including Asia, is very good," said J. Mark Mobius, who is based in Hong Kong and manages several open- and closed-end funds for the Templeton Franklin Group.
AT the Vontobel Eastern European Equity fund, which has $160 million in assets, investors gained more than 16 percent in the quarter, thanks to Mr. Pongracz's heavy weighting in Russia and Hungary. The two countries still account for more than 55 percent of the fund's assets, but that portion is shrinking. The manager is adding to his stake in Poland, and is taking some profits in Hungary. On Russia, he remains a raging bull.
"Russia continues to offer the largest array of strongly undervalued securities -- companies of practically global significance as far as their strategic position is concerned in various mineral resources, such as oil, natural gas, nickel and copper," he said. "I wouldn't be surprised if this market doesn't double again over the next two years."
He is not the only money manager who finds capitalism thriving in unfamiliar places. Grace Pineda, who runs Merrill Lynch & Company's Latin America portfolio as well as the company's Middle East/Africa fund, says she is looking for companies that are restructuring in these regions. The latter fund has two-thirds of its assets in Egypt, Israel and South Africa. "These are frontier markets," Ms. Pineda said. "The idea is to go to countries that are putting through the kinds of reforms that have been successful in other emerging markets."
That theme is echoed by Robert Meyer, manager of Morgan Stanley Latin America, a $60 million fund that had a gain of more than 47 percent in the last 12 months.
The recent advances in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico are "not a bubble," he said. "We're seeing government step out of the economy, the end to what for most of this century has been a very heavy dose of government regulation, intervention and ownership.
"This is a long-term process where restructuring is unleashing efficiencies and earnings growth, and that's what drives stock prices up."
In Asia the story is quite different. Taiwan has been rallying for more than a year, in large part because interest rates are at their lowest level in a decade and are stimulating the economy. But Singapore and Korea, both major suppliers of components for personal computers, are suffering because of weakness in high technology.
Geoffrey Wong, chief investment officer of Koeneman Capital Management, which is based in Singapore, said that valuations are relatively high on Chinese and Hong Kong stocks, which rallied last year. The rest of the region looks even less attractive, he said.
Mark Bickford-Smith, co-manager of the $2.2 billion T. Rowe Price New Asia fund, said a shift in foreign growth has begun.
"Even though Asia is still growing significantly faster than Latin America, it is the changes at the margin which are significant," he said. "In both Eastern Europe and Latin America you are seeing an improvement in the relative momentum of economic growth."
Of course, Latin America and Eastern Europe have emerged from obscurity only recently, and they might easily slip back. And the high returns in the regions come with considerable risk, including the risk that political coalitions will collapse and economic growth will sputter.
A note of warning was sounded by Barton Biggs, the global investment strategist at Morgan Stanley. "The Japanese economy is far from perfect," he said, "but it's in a lot better shape than the Russian economy."

Arpad Pongracz, manager of the Vontobel Eastern European Equity fund, says he is bullish on Poland and Russia and is taking some profits in Hungary. His fund, the leader in the international stock category for the 12 months ended March 31, with a gain of 59.61 percent, had allocated stocks as follows at the end of the year.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
A 401(k) With One Big Gun Is One Big Risk

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA MUNGER KAHN 

 BODY:
STEER clear of shareholders in Mercury Finance, a car-loan company. They may be grouchy, and with good reason: In late January, Mercury disclosed that its earnings had been overstated by more than $90 million over the last four years. So in the quarter just ended, the stock wound up as the Big Board's biggest dud, down a whopping 78 percent.
The grouchiest of these shareholders may be none other than Mercury Finance's own employees. Of a total of about 1,900 workers, nearly 900 are enrolled in the company's 401(k) plan. And according to plan data for 1994, nearly two-thirds of the plan's assets were invested in Mercury Finance's own plummeting stock, which finished last year at $12.25 a share but closed on Friday at just $2.25. 
 (More recent data on the plan will not be available from the Labor Department until next month or later.)
In the wake of the January disclosure, the company, which is based in Lake Forest, Ill., and operates out of more than 275 offices in 31 states, has replaced top executives and scrambled for credit, and it is facing more than 50 shareholder lawsuits. These dark times are a far cry from the days when the inclusion of company stock in the 401(k) plan was met with worker enthusiasm.
"It was a wonderful thing," said Michael P. Harrington, former president of Mercury Finance and now chairman of the First Enterprise Financial Group in Evanston, Ill. "We were quite excited about the company's prospects."
Company loyalty was not the only reason for the smiles. Mercury has had great success in selling car loans to people with blemished credit ratings, and investors knew it. "The stock was doing quite well," said Walter Vonch, a senior manager who left the company in 1995 and now works in Phoenix. Indeed, the stock was up 53 percent that year alone.
But now the enthusiasm has turned to fear that the Mercury Finance situation may turn into an object lesson in overreliance on one stock. "I feel very badly for the employees," Mr. Harrington said. "I'm sure there are a number of employees who've been hurt with their retirement funds."
At the end of 1994, the Mercury Finance 401(k) plan had nearly $3.85 million in the company stock option. With the plan's total value then at about $5.88 million, the option accounted for 65.5 percent of assets. In 1993, Mercury stock accounted for even more: 69 percent of the plan.
Joseph Kopec, a company spokesman, said the 401(k) plan was valued at $10.5 million at the end of 1996. "I can't tell you the value now," he said, but if company stock accounted for 65.5 percent of the total then, as it did in 1994, the stock's drop through Friday would mean the plan's value had shrunk to just $4.9 million or so.
And if an employee of Mercury Finance had, say, a $10,000 401(k) portfolio that mimicked the plan's 1994 allocations, the stock's fall would have caused the portfolio to shrivel to just $4,653.
ONE reason for the great dependence on one stock may be the small number of investment options in the plan, which is administered by the company. Besides Mercury stock, workers were offered just one other equity option, a diversified growth fund. The only other active options were a money market fund and a guaranteed income contract.
In 1994, about $68,000 of plan money was in a fund, now closed to participants, consisting of stock in the Banc One Corporation, which is now the plan trustee. The plan's assets also included $80,000 in a participant-loan fund.
At the end of 1994, besides the 65.5 percent in Mercury stock, the plan assets were divided as follows: 18 percent in the guaranteed investment contract, 8.5 percent in the equity fund and 5.5 percent in the money market fund. Plan loans and the Banc One stock represented just 2.5 percent of plan assets.
Magnifying the reliance on the company's stock, most Mercury Finance employees do not have a traditional pension plan to fall back on. The company offers a pension, but because of length-of-service requirements, only eight employees qualify for it, Mr. Kopec said.
Of course, even if the 401(k) options are few, there are options. And plan participants themselves chose how to divide their contributions to the plan. "It was up to individuals how they wanted to make their investments," Mr. Kopec said.
Whatever the cause, the bottom line is that betting mostly on one stock is perilous. "I support employee ownership of stock, but having an exclusive retirement vehicle with more than 50 percent of the assets in one security is just too risky," said Douglas L. Kruse, an economist at Rutgers University who studies 401(k) plans.
The employees of Mercury Finance have other things to fret about -- like the future of their company. Now in default on $500 million in long-term debt and about $400 million in short- and intermediate-term debt, the company is operating on a $50 million short-term loan arranged by the Bank of America. The loan is due on June 10.
Opinions differ on the company's prospects. "I think the cards are stacked against them," said Thomas Kmiotek, a debt analyst at the Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Company, which recently downgraded the company's debt to indicate the defaults on payments. "History shows that these situations get so difficult that the only way to satisfy everyone is to pack it up and liquidate."
But Mr. Kopec said the company was "guardedly optimistic." He said that the Bank of America loan had provided Mercury Finance with "breathing room" and that the company was making progress raising cash as a result of a recent agreement to sell its insurance subsidiary for $72 million.
THE Labor Department, which is responsible for overseeing retirement plans, declined to comment on whether it was investigating the Mercury Finance situation.
"Obviously, it's of concern to us," said Alan D. Lebowitz, a deputy assistant secretary at the agency's Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration. But under Federal rules, he said, there is nothing wrong with heavy reliance on company stock in 401(k) or other defined-contribution plans. "Unless you find abuse, these kinds of plans are perfectly lawful," he said.
That's the problem, said Michael S. Gordon, an employee-benefits lawyer in Washington.
"There's nothing in current law that really provides adequate protection to employees in these situations," Mr. Gordon said. "The question is how many times this has to happen before something is done."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Blue-Collar Workers, and Hands-On Investors

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
ARRY YOUNG watches the stock market like a hawk. He logs onto the Internet almost every day, taps a few keys and pulls up his stock portfolio. That is, if he's not tuning into CNBC for the financial news.
Kevin Rynn is not much different. He got into the market in the late 1980's, and since then he has been perusing annual reports and leafing through the business sections of newspapers. He has owned a variety of stocks and mutual funds and is "very big on" learning more about those risky bets, sector funds.
You have probably heard such stories before. The two men in question are probably business executives, right?
Wrong. They are blue-collar workers. Mr. Young, 56, drives a forklift truck for the Mead Corporation, the forest products company in Dayton, Ohio. Mr. Rynn, 39, is a carpenter for Nastasi & Associates, a construction firm in Garden City, L.I.
Whether the notion that blue-collar workers are seldom active investors was ever true, it seems to be less true now.
According to Federal Reserve statistics, the nonretirement investments of skilled blue-collar workers have grown faster than those of most other workers, at least in percentage terms. In 1992, the median value of the stocks owned by these workers' families was $4,000; for mutual funds, it was $5,100. By 1995, these sums had risen to $4,800 and $10,000 -- increases of 20 percent and 96 percent, respectively.
But many of the most active blue-collar investors are hardly newcomers. "I got into the market in February 1990," said Mr. Young, who, with his wife, Flip, has retirement or nonretirement investments in 13 mutual funds and a handful of individual companies. "My brother was really big in the stock market, and then my wife was kind of encouraging me."
Mr. Young, who lives in Chillicothe, Ohio, about 60 miles south of Columbus, grew up in a family with eight children and a father who, remembering the Depression, always stressed the need to save. "My father said the first thousand you save will be the hardest," Mr. Young recalled.
The Youngs are well past that point now. They invest about 16 percent of their pay -- Mrs. Young is a data base manager at Lockheed Martin -- in their respective 401(k) plans. They also funnel $300 a month each into various mutual funds. Although they would not reveal the size of their portfolio, they said that their account at the Vanguard Windsor fund, their largest, was worth about $60,000, and that their overall holdings have had average annual returns of 10 percent since 1991.
Besides Windsor, their mutual funds focus primarily on equities, from the T. Rowe Price European fund to Janus Mercury, a domestic mid-cap growth fund. Their individual stocks include Mead, Lockheed Martin and Borland International.
Being active investors, however, does not guarantee success. This year, the Youngs invested in bank stocks through the Invesco Strategic Financial Services fund, but after early gains, the shares "nose-dived," Mr. Young said. "That's what happens with a sector fund," he said. "You can make lots of money fast, and you can lose lots."
But Mr. Young is already sizing up his next profit opportunity. "I think tech stocks are going to be the thing to jump in with because they've been beaten down," he said.
And he is optimistic about the market, both because he thinks the economy is sound and because he remembers what happened last year.
He missed out on a "ton of money" in 1996, he said, after Elaine Garzarelli, the market guru renowned for forecasting the 1987 crash, predicted last July that the market was about to sink again.
The market had already fallen some when Ms. Garzarelli, who runs the investment firm Garzarelli Capital, made her announcement. So on July 25 -- a date the Youngs will not soon forget -- the couple cashed in most of their holdings.
Right then, of course, the market rocketed higher and continued to do so for months. As a result, "I didn't do so good in 1996," gaining just 5 percent, Mr. Young said.
But in early January, the Youngs re-entered the market, choosing many of the same investments they had abandoned earlier. While Mr. Young says he is "greatly concerned" about the market's recent faltering, he is taking a buy-and-hold approach now.
"You don't have any choice but to ride it out," he said.
That is not the strategy chosen by Mr. Rynn, who years ago gave up his outdoor hobbies for the world of investing.
Like Mr. Young, though, Mr. Rynn is no novice. "I opened up a brokerage account with Charles Schwab in '89 or '90," Mr. Rynn said. "I went from fishing magazines to finance magazines."
When he began, he said, he did not know anything about Wall Street. He thought Morgan Stanley was a pitcher for the Boston Red Sox. (That was Bob Stanley.)
But now Mr. Rynn, who has both retirement and nonretirement investments, is more experienced. He would not reveal the size of his portfolio, but his nonretirement assets range from shares in PBHG Emerging Growth, a small-cap fund, and in Janus Worldwide, a global fund, to stock in health care companies like Abbott Laboratories and American Home Products.
As this equity-heavy portfolio suggests, Mr. Rynn does not flee from risk. "With stock, it's more risky, but it's more rewarding," he said.
In February, though, Mr. Rynn, who is married and has two children, sensed that clouds were gathering when the market became volatile and technology stocks fell. So, a month ago, he cashed in all his domestic holdings.
"Right now a lot of my money is in a money market account, positioned to be moved. But waiting," Mr. Rynn said.
He is pleased that the last two weeks have proved him right, but he is still optimistic about the market. "I don't know if it is going to go further south," he said.
The recent market fall has an ironic cast for Jack Keleher, 54, a packaging-machine mechanic at Cambridge Brands in Cambridge, Mass., a division of Tootsie Roll Industries. Mr. Keleher said he gave up horse race-track gambling about a decade ago for something a little less risky.
"I wasn't a degenerate gambler," he said. "I just liked the challenge of trying to figure things out. My idea of enjoyment was getting up Saturday morning and crunching the numbers in The Daily Racing Form."
Mr. Keleher and his wife, Peg, have about $150,000 in 401(k) accounts and other retirement assets. As for nonretirement money, since 1989 they have been putting $30 to $50 a month into the market through an investment club that they formed with some relatives. Meeting once a month, the club is active but lacks rigid rules.
"If my sister doesn't do an assignment, I can't tell her to take a hike," he said.
The club, whose holdings total about $36,000, favors large, established companies like Conagra and Texaco.
"We like stocks that have a history," Mr. Keleher explained. "I'm not that smart to be on the cutting edge, but I look at a company and if the dividends and the sales are going up and it's been around 10 years, I've got a good shot at making money." As for the recent market downturn, he is not bailing out. "We're not market timers," he said.
This conservativeness stems partly from his concern about fulfilling family obligations. "We shouldn't get too speculative," said Mr. Keleher, who has three grown children and a 16-year-old.
His co-workers are impressed by Mr. Keleher, who reads Investor's Business Daily and turns on CNBC soon after waking at 7 A.M. Or, at least, they used to be.
"They're sick and tired of it," Mrs. Keleher said. "They say, 'Don't mention investing around Jack because he can go for three or four hours.' "

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;
Mutual Fund Lesson: How It Feels to Lose

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
FOR millions of mutual fund shareholders, the first quarter of 1997 was like no other. They lost money.
Not since the fourth quarter of 1994 had mutual funds that invest in stocks and those that buy bonds lost money in the same quarter. In the ensuing two years, the number of Americans who own shares in mutual funds has grown by a third, to 63 million. That means millions of neophyte fund investors have never experienced a bear market, nor had they ever, until this year, suffered a quarter in which the value of both their stock and bond funds declined. 
 In the first three months of 1997, the average domestic stock fund lost 1.7 percent of its value, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund tracking company in Chicago, while the average bond fund dropped 0.3 percent.
And since the end of the first quarter, things have grown worse. The Dow Jones industrial average fell in three of the five sessions last week, and long-term interest rates climbed to their highest levels in six months. In the coming months, mutual fund investors will play a big role in determining the health and direction of the financial markets.
Signs of nervousness are starting to appear. AMG Data Services, a company in Arcata, Calif., that tracks cash flows, reported on Friday that equity mutual funds suffered a net outflow of $328 million in the week ended on Wednesday. Funds that invest primarily in growth stocks -- that is, shares of companies with rapidly growing earnings -- lost nearly $1 billion, the third consecutive week of outflows for that category.
On Wall Street, however, plenty of people remain convinced that mutual fund holders will stand fast even through a stock market correction of 10 percent to 20 percent and that cash flows to mutual funds will continue to support stock and bond prices.
"The global economic situation couldn't be brighter for long-term holders of financial assets," said John Cleland, chief investment strategist at the Security Benefit Group, a Topeka, Kan., investment company that oversees $2 billion in fund assets. Because so many mutual fund shareholders are investing through retirement plans, they are focused on long-term goals, and therefore "cash flows are not going to dry up, and they are not going to reverse," Mr. Cleland said.
CERTAINLY, there were some bright spots in the most recent quarter. International stock and bond funds, particularly those that invest in emerging markets, held up well. The average international stock fund gained 2 percent, and funds investing in Eastern Europe and Latin America were the strongest in the equity sector. On the bond side, funds investing in high-yield, or junk, bonds also reported gains for the quarter.
But for many stock fund investors, the pain in the first quarter was even worse than the averages suggest. Small-cap growth funds, the group that logged the best performance for most of the last two years, declined 12.5 percent on average. According to Morningstar, a dozen diversified stock funds lost more than 20 percent each.
As fund companies begin to send out their quarterly performance reports to investors, shareholders in many of the hottest funds of the last two years will find that their investments have lost money -- and not just over the most recent quarter.
Take the Stein Roe Capital Opportunities fund, which soared 51 percent in 1995. That red-hot performance attracted more than $1 billion in new money last year, and the fund continued to perform strongly, with a return of 20 percent. In the most recent quarter, however, the fund lost 18 percent of its value, leaving just about anyone who invested since the end of 1995 in the red.
Similarly, the Twentieth Century Vista fund, part of the fund family now known as American Century, wowed investors in 1995 and 1996 as it gained an average of 25 percent a year and its assets nearly tripled, to $2.2 billion. But in the first quarter of 1997, the fund lost 18.9 percent of its value, wiping out nearly all of its profits back to June 1995. Anyone who has invested since June 1995 has, at best, broken even -- and more likely lost money.
Investors who bought shares of the T. Rowe Price Science and Technology fund after September 1995, when the fund was one-third its current size of $3.1 billion, have probably lost money. A first-quarter loss of almost 14 percent wiped out nearly all the gains of the fund for the previous 15 months.
Robert J. Markman of Edina, Minn., who manages three mutual funds that invest in a portfolio of other funds, has a theory about how many investors will react when they realize that more than a year's worth of gains have been erased in one quarter.
"They will panic," Mr. Markman said. "The average investor who bought into these funds is going to look at his wife and say: 'Helen, we can make 5 percent in a money market fund. We don't need this kind of risk.' "
One factor that will greatly affect investors' responses is whether their expectations were realistic to begin with, Mr. Markman said. "People don't have to lose 20 percent to 30 percent before they'll pull their money out," he said. "All they need is to have their expectations not met."
RECENTLY, investors have set their expectations extraordinarily high. In a nationwide survey of 750 mutual fund investors conducted for Montgomery Asset Management, a San Francisco mutual fund company, respondents said they expected an average return of 16 percent this year on their mutual fund investments. Over the next 10 years, they forecast an average annual return of 22 percent.
"That is absolute folly," said R. Stephen Doyle, chairman of Montgomery Asset Management, which oversees $4.2 billion in fund assets. "Those kinds of expectations could lead to some unhappy and distressing consequences" if stock prices continue to fall.
Since Montgomery conducted the survey, in late February and early March, the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen about 470 points, or about 7 percent. In the survey, 63 percent of those questioned said they would do nothing if the Dow dropped 350 points, or about 5 percent. Nearly three-quarters of the respondents said they expected the Dow to finish this year above 7,000.
Many fund investors, Mr. Doyle noted, will need substantial returns from now until the end of the year "just to get even," much less match a 16 percent expectation. Over the longer term, the respondents' expectations are more than double the average annual return produced by stocks over the last 60 years. If the average portfolio contains a healthy dose of bonds, which historically have produced lower returns than stocks, investors' expectations are even less likely to be met.
The last time mutual fund investors poured huge amounts of money into a sector of the mutual fund industry, only to turn and flee when their expectations were not met, was in the early 1990's.
In 1993, investors committed a record number of new dollars to bond funds: $113 billion, or 19 percent of the assets in those funds at the end of the previous year. The heavy inflows came at the end of a three-year period of rising bond prices and falling interest rates.
But in March 1994, when bond prices began to fall sharply after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, bond fund investors began to flee. And they continued to do so for 14 of the next 15 months.
Some analysts say a similar disappointment in the equity markets will cause investors to move money away from stock funds, where most of their new cash has been going recently. Last year, investors contributed a record number of dollars to equity mutual funds: $221 billion, or 17 percent of the previous year's assets. The record amount came in the sixth year of a period in which the major stock market averages never fell 10 percent below their record highs.
THROUGH Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average was nearly 8 percent below its high-water mark, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off its peak by more than 7 percent.
Undoubtedly, more mutual fund shareholders than ever are investing for retirement, rather than for a shorter term. That explains, in large part, why Americans have greatly increased the amount of their financial assets in stocks.
According to data compiled by the Investment Company Institute, equity holdings accounted for 31 percent of the financial assets of American households at the end of 1996. That was up from 17.8 percent at the end of 1990, the start of the bull market's latest sprint.
To be sure, that was not the biggest commitment ever by households to equities. From 1963 through 1969, equity holdings exceeded their current level, peaking at 33.8 percent of household financial assets in 1968.
But even now, some financial advisers are recommending that individuals scale back their equity holdings. "We're clearly moving into a defensive mode," said Louis P. Stanasolovich, president of Legend Financial Advisors of Pittsburgh.
"We don't believe that the stock market is going to fall 50 percent," Mr. Stanasolovich said. "But we do believe a 10 percent to 20 percent correction is in the cards over the next 12 months. We're making sure our clients have some money in international securities, in real estate funds, and some cash on the sidelines for buying opportunities."
For the remainder of the year, Mr. Stanasolovich said, he has greatly scaled back his expectations. "If we make some money, great," he said. "But we are aiming not to lose a lot."
Individuals who invest in mutual funds are not the only ones who might be scaling back their stock investments in the coming months to reduce their exposure to equities. According to figures released by the Federal Reserve last month, the portion of assets in state and local government employee retirement funds that is invested in stocks rose to 55 percent at the end of 1996 from 38 percent five years earlier. Similarly, the equity portion of private pension funds rose to 44 percent from 38 percent.
If sales by institutional investors cause continued weakness in stock prices, will mutual fund holders swim against the tide, continuing to put money into equities? Recent signs are less than encouraging.
The latest statistics from AMG Data Services and Mutual Fund Trim Tabs, a fund tracking service in Santa Rosa, Calif., show that money has already begun flowing out of aggressive-growth funds and technology funds in recent weeks.
If the experience of the fund categories that are already leaking money is any indication, the low recent levels of cash reserves at fund companies will probably aggravate the situation.
The aggressive-growth funds, for example, held only 4.4 percent of their assets in cash at the end of February. That is the lowest level since at least the beginning of 1984 and may well have contributed to their declines in recent weeks.
LAST June, just before small-cap stocks went into a tailspin, the aggressive-growth funds had 7.7 percent of their assets, or $18.7 billion, in cash. That cushion allowed the funds to go into the market after the worst of the selloff and pick up their favorite stocks at relatively cheap prices.
At the end of February, however, these funds had cash balances of only $12.4 billion. With money flowing out in each of the last three weeks, the funds have had much less buying power.
Fund companies have maintained that they are not concerned about the relatively low levels of cash on hand. But a recent study by Towers Perrin, the pension and retirement plan consulting firm, raises questions about how well fund companies are prepared to handle any unexpected outflow of cash from investors.
Of 27 big mutual fund companies surveyed by Towers Perrin, only six had made arrangements to borrow money from an outside source or from other funds within the same family to finance redemptions. Brian E. Hersey, director of investment manager research at the firm, said that demonstrated a "level of comfort that is unwarranted" in light of changes in the fund industry and the speed with which financial markets move these days.
Although a growing number of mutual fund shareholders have made their investments through 401(k) plans or other tax-deferred retirement plans, "I don't think you can assume that those investors are not going to panic," Mr. Hersey said. "The '800' numbers are going to work for them as well," he said, referring to the toll-free telephone lines that allow investors to switch their assets among money market, stock and bond funds.
It is easy to forecast gloom and doom when short-term trends appear menacing, said Mr. Cleland of Security Benefit. But his bullishness was unshaken even by last week's decline. He noted that the stock market adjusts quickly today and said that a correction of 10 percent to 20 percent and a subsequent recovery could occur in three to six months.
"I think we are going to have good first-quarter earnings on balance, which will provide a floor for market valuations," Mr. Cleland said. "And before the summer is over, the market will recognize that significant inflation is not out there."
Indeed, by late last week, some bargain hunters had started to scoop up technology and other small-cap stocks that have been so battered. On Friday, large-cap stocks rebounded, too. Mutual fund investors have been conditioned in recent years to buy when the market dips, in expectation of a rebound. Some investors apparently thought they saw the bottom last week.

HEADLINE: It's a Cold, Cruel World, And Guys Need to Talk

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT 

 BODY:
AT first glance, the knot of men, dressed in a fashion arc from faded jeans to sports coats and neckties, standing around a table bountiful with icy beer and fast-food fajitas, appeared to be little more than aging fraternity boys in an off-campus romp. At any moment, it seemed, their chorus of belly laughs and bawdy one-liners could give way to a belching contest.
But no. There would be none of that in this comfortably furnished Upper West Side brownstone. The five friends, all in their 30's, had come to spend the next two hours on more sober business: to wrestle, no less, with the post-feminist tangle of what it means to be an American man in the closing years of the 20th century. 
 The men, most of whom became friends while students at Wesleyan University, have held these loosely structured gatherings every other Monday for almost five years. They call themselves Mariner's Gate, taken from a corner of Central Park where they once gathered to formalize the group -- sort of a consecration, as Beck Lee, a cherubic, 36-year-old theatrical press agent, put it.
On this night, when they settled down to talk -- serious, but not somber -- no subject was taboo or unworthy of examination from their unabashedly male perspectives, be it financial woes or dating wars.
"We like to challenge each other to grow and sort of shed some of the layers of acquired repression that holds us back in our lives," said Mr. Lee, who talked openly at the get-together about his anger and disappointment with a much younger woman who stood him up on a date. (He got a sympathetic hearing, albeit with body language that hissed, "I told you so.") The group, Mr. Lee noted, has helped him maintain his fighting spirit in the sometimes treacherous trenches of work, love and family.
The men of Mariner's Gate are hardly alone in regularly turning to one another for guidance and solace. They are part of a leading edge of small, urban-based men's support groups quietly reconstructing themselves from a blueprint of masculinity and duty that they are busy redrawing. "Men are really trying to find their bearings," said the Rev. Tom Cushman, an associate rector at St. James-Episcopal Church on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Three groups of eight men each meet weekly at 7:30 A.M. at the church to slip in some meaningful dialogue before work. "I can't tell you how much need there is for men's groups," Mr. Cushman said. "There is so much isolation in this country, so few places where you feel that you belong and can be yourself."
Support groups like these, many of whose members are professional and middle-aged, are cropping up across the country like early-morning whiskers, meeting in homes, restaurants or churches.
Members of New Warrior Network, a national men's group, which says it has 10,000 members, 220 of them in New York, splinter off into small weekly gatherings to discuss how they can become better husbands, better fathers or just simply better men. The Internet's World Wide Web is brimming with lists of men's groups with names like Men Assisting, Leading and Educating (MALE), Men Talk, Inside Men's Lives and Real Men.
(For those who may not be ready to share their emotions with other men, the Internet also carries advertisements for therapists specializing in just that. "Are you tired of doing it alone?" asks Gary Plep, a clinical social worker and co-founder of the Northern California Men's Center in Campbell.)
Through the ages, men have bellied up to the bar with buddies, swapping war stories about sports and women. But these new talkfests, with scheduled times, set members and clear agendas, are something far less muscular and less salty.
There is a "revolutionary difference in the kind of exchange that is going on now," said William S. Pollack, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the director of the Center for Men at McLean Hosptial in Belmount, Mass.
"It is a more open, more emotional sharing of a deeper sense of self between men that many of us, until the 80's or so, were brought up not to do," he continued. "Men are going against all the gender stereotypes, a kind of gender blanket that we have been smothered under, one that tells us to be stoic, not to express pain, not to be vulnerable."
In the wake of cultural changes writ large by the women's movement, of shifting definitions of family and two-income households, some men say they are turning to each other in search of a practical paradigm on which to model their behaviors and attitudes.
"This is a time of transition," Mr. Lee said. "This is a time of realignment, and a lot of men are throwing up their hands in frustration and are withdrawing from the battle."
Generally, women have long understood the value of support groups. "They are aware they have an uphill battle," said Robert Bly, 70 and the guru of the modern men's movement. "They have been devalued for centuries."
Most men, on the other hand, have viewed these sometimes touchy-feely sessions of male togetherness with suspicion and derision, particularly their antecedent, the sweat-lodge, drum-beating rituals that Mr. Bly extolled in his 1991 best seller "Iron John: A Book About Men." (Yes, they are still venturing into the woods under Mr. Bly's auspices.) Part of the resistance, Mr. Bly said, is that "men feel they are at the top of the heap anyway, so they don't need to support one another. The interesting thing today is the groups are leaderless, getting together and meeting every week or two weeks and talking."
For the last two years, Gerry Migliore, a public relations manager in New York, has been organizing "Boys Night Out." Despite its name, the group of five or six members deals with the serious business of talking about their problems.
The idea evolved out of a meeting Mr. Migliore called together in 1994, frustrated that while he could express his concerns with his female friends, he couldn't share them with his male friends. He appealed to a few to join him to talk about their perceptions of manhood. At the gathering in an Upper West Side apartment, five men cooked a meal and spent the summer evening near an open bank of windows recalling defining moments in their lives.
Today, "Boys Night Out" is often held in bustling Manhattan bars where the conversations, replete with machismo trappings of fine cigars and 10-year-old brandy, could easily be mistaken for old-fashioned man talk about sports and office machinations. "We talk passionately about religion and politics, our feelings about mortality," Mr. Migliore, 53, said.
Mortality came up when one man was troubled by a chronic pain in his leg. "All of our clocks are winding down," he said. "And as I get older, I find that the spiritual things are more important to me."
Another member, a decade his junior, piped in that he refused to think about death. "We as men have a lot more play in those years between birth and old age," he said. "It's about how we live, how we manage our stress, how we tap into the power of our relationships."
And no one raised an eyebrow when one group member told another that he should try to be less of a teacher to his wife and more of an accepting husband.
"We're honest like that," Mr. Migliore said. "I don't think that would be that easy if we had an auditorium filled with men."
Mr. Migliore was referring to groups like Promise Keepers, the national Christian-based men's group that in recent years has drawn more than two million men to stadium rallies.
"The stadium conferences are so visible, so they get all the media attention," said Mark DeMoss, a national spokesman for the group, which combines male bonding with religious inspiration. "But the real work of Promise Keepers takes place outside the stadium walls in small groups of men. Men are changing because men are talking."
Craig Hernick, the director for the New Warrior's center in Louisville, Ky., said he had never trusted men. He would pal around, go out drinking and watch football games on television with his buddies.
"Guys all my life were the foe," said Mr. Hernick, who became a Warrior five years ago. "They were people to compete against on Little League, for the girlfriend, the job. I looked to women for emotional and personal support."
Now, every Friday, Mr. Hernick, 43 and married, spends two to three hours with his support group. Sometimes, they simply meet at an amusement park and ride the roller coaster, again and again.
Mr. Hernick recalled how his small circle helped a member deal with the death of his father from a lingering illness. "We are a group to support one another, to either cry on or celebrate with," he said.
Mariner's Gate was founded by a newly married man who was about to become a father and who was worried he would lose touch with men and their influences as his life grew more domestic. "From the beginning," said one member, Kevin Osborn, 37, "it was touted as a men's group with a higher function."
At the Mariner's Upper West Side session, one member talked about how he had just received an ambiguously worded letter from a former girlfriend. He spoke in a low, flat tone, his gaze wandering. "I'm frustrated with the fact that I have not been meeting the right kind of lady," he said. "I want to just stay on track, waiting and being available for somebody I can have a real relationship with."
"You're not calling her?" he was scolded.
"No, I'm not calling her."
Another member, who had heard disappointing news at work, spoke at his turn: "The amazing thing was that I'm hearing this news and I didn't sink into a bottomless pit of depression."
The group nodded approvingly.
"We find it very comfortable to sit in our lair and sort of scratch at each other's wounds," Mr. Lee said later.
And how do the left-behind women react? Susan Kiley, Mr. Osborn's wife of seven years, occasionally complains when she has to put their three children to bed by herself. "But I'm certainly not jealous about it," she said. "Their meetings are not something I need to be a part of.
"I don't think he discusses that much of his home life," she said, more question than statement.
"My wife calls us the International Boys Club for Men," one Mariner said. But, he added with a grin, "she's glad I belong to it."
 
The Minutes
 
MEMBERS of Mariner's Gate, a men's support group, answer to fanciful nicknames at meetings and take turns doing tasks like writing the minutes.
 
Here is an excerpt from a report on a recent meeting:
The brotherly Tex Bro-D spoke of working like a dog in Brooklyn, of schmoozing like a hog in the city of angels, and of winning an award in songwriting.
Virgil spoke of his odyssey (shouldn't that be Homer?): navigating the rocks of unemployment, resisting a siren's call. Will her temptations prove irresistible? Virgil needs a guide (perhaps Dante) through the inferno of agency reps. The city of angels also calls to him. Or should he rest in the shade of the Buttonwood Tree?
Hef spoke of struggles with partying, with sleep, with health. Abandoned by two of three women, he dissed one for dissing him. Hef also hears the call of a siren: wisely though, when she reached out, he pulled his hand back, fearful of getting burned.
No longer blocked and locked, Deano confessed a surge of creative energy (none of which was on display on that night). His inspiration led to the initiation of a new quartet. But will it be brass or strings?
The five turned inward, exploring the notion of identity. It's not of our own making, one said. It springs forth from our vision, our aspirations, and others' vision. That's how we earned and learned our names.

HEADLINE: Bill Clinton, Moralist;
The President as Vice President

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
NOT for many a day has a President tried as hard as Bill Clinton to save Americans from their bad habits, like smoking and drinking, no matter how much zeal other Americans have brought to crusades against this vice or that.
Calvinism, it is true, lay at the center of life in the early years of the Republic. "It is not quite accidental," observed the British historian D. W. Brogan, "that the first great American novel deals with the public, legal punishment of adultery, and The Scarlet Letter has been more read than its lesson has been digested." 
 But after the Civil War, organized religion became a less propulsive force in American politics. The exception was the Prohibitionist movement during and just after World War I; its success stemmed in part from religious fervor but also from the anti-German (and thus anti-beer) feelings of the day.
At no point in this century have Presidents appointed themselves chiefs of the vice police. Most have found it politically expedient, if not personally uplifting, to attend church on Sunday and hold the occasional prayer breakfast. But that is not the same thing as seeking to make the nation more virtuous by dint of legislation, which most politicians have avoided since the unhappy experience of Prohibition.
 
Prohibition and Hypocrisy
 After the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919, outlawing alcohol, hypocrisy reigned in the White House and on Capitol Hill. Harding drank as much as he gambled. Hoover took refuge in platitudes, calling Prohibition "a great social and economic experiment, noble in nature and far-reaching in purpose." And FDR, on whose watch the amendment was finally repealed, was a diligent consumer of the sundown martini (two, if Mrs. R wasn't watching).
Now comes Mr. Clinton, a President with a surprising and very different approach. Consider how much he has taken on just in the last year or so:
Immediately after his re-election, he denounced as "simply irresponsible" the liquor industry's decision to resume broadcast advertising after a voluntary ban of half a century. By doing so, the President said, the industry would expose children to temptation "before they know how to handle alcohol." When that produced no results, he asked the Federal Communications Commission last week to look into the matter.
Mr. Clinton's new anti-alcohol crusade parallels his fight against tobacco. Last August, surrounded in the White House Rose Garden by children wearing T-shirts reading "Tobacco-Free Kids," he announced that the Government now considers nicotine an addictive drug, subject to regulation. Last month, he announced rules requiring ID checks of buyers under the age of 27.
In addition, the President has sought to give the Government a role in regulating pornography -- on television, through the V-chip, and on the Internet, through the omnibus Telecommunications Reform Act, signed in February 1996 -- despite the protests of a dwindling band of liberals who accuse him of trampling Constitutional guarantees of free speech.
And after California and Arizona voters last November approved local ballot initiatives declaring marijuana legal if used for medical purposes, the Administration threatened doctors with sanctions if they prescribed the drug for patients. That, too, brought protests, with prominent physicians arguing that the Government was intruding into the sacred doctor-patient relationship.
For all his popularity at the polls, Mr. Clinton is not viewed by the electorate as a moral beacon. In opinion surveys during last year's Presidential campaign, his Republican rival, Bob Dole, consistently won higher marks for personal rectitude. Mr. Clinton has been accused of womanizing and of shady business practices. But his personal history, as well as today's political climate, offers clues to his new stance.
Mr. Clinton is the son of an alcoholic, and he has a brother who has used drugs, so he knows the havoc that addiction can wreak on people and their families. In addition, he is a doting father, cognizant of the vulnerability of children, and he is married to a woman who has focused on children's causes.
It is the focus on children that makes political crusading against sin acceptable, at least for the moment, because the well-being of the young in a world increasingly full of dangers is as big a preoccupation of Democrats as of Republicans, as much a concern in small towns as in big cities, as high on the agendas of the secular as on those of the religious elements in society.
 
A Low-Cost War
 From the viewpoint of politicians with activist leanings but a tight budget, like Mr. Clinton and many of his closest advisers, cracking down on smoking and alcohol abuse, attacking the pornographers and merchants of violence and seeking with full fanfare to head off any move to legalize marijuana have obvious appeal. Issuing governmental regulations and pounding on the bully pulpit don't cost much, at least at the beginning.
Nor is the President's party likely to lose much campaign money. As the South has become more Republican, tobacco money has tended to flow disproportionately to Republicans -- by almost a five-to-one ratio in 1995-96.
So far, furthermore, Mr. Clinton has refrained from launching a campaign against gambling, the vice of choice of his late mother, who loved the ponies. The powerful gambling lobby gives heavily to politicians. In taking on the distilled-spirits companies, he has made no moves against the beer and wine industries, which advertise copiously on television and mount big lobbying efforts in Washington. Noting that beer is the first choice of kids who drink, Karolyn Nunalee of Mothers Against Drunk Driving observed caustically, "Basically, alcohol is alcohol."
The question is how far public support will enable this Presidential assault on vice to go. The manners and morals of a people can never be molded by legislation or governmental decree; if what government does harmonizes with public sentiment, if it is seen to address genuine evils, the law will be upheld. If not, it will be ignored or, worse, laughed at, as happened not only with Prohibition but also with attempts to keep books like Ulysses and plays like those of Eugene O'Neill from a supposedly tender public.

STOCK MARKET
It's Falling? Well, Naturally
So did you think stocks would keep rising forever? Investors hoped so; it's pathetically easy to make money that way. But the interesting thing about the market's slide in the last week or so is that no one seemed truly surprised. They knew the party had to end, and now it was ending -- or at least taking a break. Surprise would have been silly. Oddly, though, when the job numbers came out on Friday -- the unemployment rate down again, a gain of 175,000 jobs -- that strength should have caused investors even more worry that the Federal Reserve would tighten the screws by raising interest rates again. But no. The Dow rebounded somewhat.
 
WIRELESS DREAMS
Airwaves: A Bonanza Deflated
The idea had everything: not only was it high-tech, but it would put billions into the threadbare Federal purse. Simply auction off the airwaves needed for all those wireless-communications gadgets overrunning our lives. But did the Government, dizzied by that free money, get carried away? Perhaps. The first auction went fine -- the licenses went to big guns like AT&T and Sprint, cash on the line. But at the second auction, the F.C.C. welcomed risk-loving entrepreneurs with open arms, asking just 10 percent down and payments spread over a decade. And yes, on paper, it took in $10.1 billion, and the budget balancers were glad. But much of that money turns out to be pie in the digital sky, for the buyers are having trouble paying, with one -- Pocket Communications -- even filing for bankruptcy last week. The F.C.C. threw up its hands and stopped collecting payments while it sorts all this out.
 
THE CORPORATE GAME
A Sweet Boss? Can't Be
So you want to be a corporate bigwig and get all those nice stock options? Well, there are a few rules. You must always think of the bottom line, and if that means getting fancy new equipment and ditching a few hundred workers, so be it. You dump older workers in favor of lower-paid younger ones. And you pay your workers as little as the market will bear. By these standards, Marvin Eisenstadt is a dismal failure. At his Brooklyn company, Cumberland Packing, which makes Sweet 'n Low, he gleefully ignores every rule, using old equipment, saving hundreds of neighborhood jobs and rarely dismissing anyone. "We don't always have to make business decisions," he said. "I have to sleep at night." The company isn't a failure, though; there's such demand for those little packets of sweetener that Cumberland is doing just fine. And in the long run, one business school professor said, its way of doing things "might be profoundly wise."
 
LAYOFFS
The Personal Touch
Here, on the other hand, is what is often the American way: CPC Specialty Foods in the Bronx, which turns out Melba toast, has about 200 employees, many of whom have been there 10, 20, even 30 years. Or at least it did until Wednesday, when workers arrived to see a list of about 45 names posted on a wall -- those who were out of a job. "No warning, nothing," said one man who saw his name on the list. "I'm still in shock." The bakery is for sale, said CPC International, but the job cuts were unconnected -- they were seasonal, it said. That worker had been there nine years.
 
TOBACCO WARS
Fighting Smoking With Taxes
There's a simple way to cut teen-age smoking, tobacco foes say: just make it more expensive. So for the moment, at least, anti-smoking crusaders are zeroing in on raising state and Federal taxes enough so the price of an average pack would go from $1.80 to $4.23. And that, they hope, would make it prohibitively costly -- economists estimate that every 10 percent price increase means a 12 percent decline in the number of teen-agers who take up smoking. State taxes now vary from Virginia's 2.5 cents a pack to Washington State's 82.5 cents, but the goal is to raise the average to $2. In the past, given the tobacco industry's heavy lobbying, many state legislators would have turned a deaf ear, but sentiment is shifting markedly with all the publicity surrounding Liggett's acknowledged recruiting of young smokers. Even most smokers, polls show, now support higher taxes.
 
APPLE COMPUTER
A Mighty Vote of Confidence
Hold off on those Apple Computer obituaries for the moment. Yes, the company has big troubles, slipping two steps back, it seems, every time it inches ahead. But Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia has a different take on its situation. It's "bad," he said, "but not that bad," and it's "a heck of a company," with "a loyal base of customers." This was no idle chitchat, for Prince Walid had put his money where his praise was, just paying some $115 million for 5 percent of Apple. A poor investment? "They said the same thing about Citibank," said the Prince, who invested $800 million in Citicorp in 1991 and even after selling many of his shares has a $5 billion stake.
 
WATERFRONT REALITIES
The Hudson! Of Course!
Sometimes New York is downright uncivilized. The Hudson, one of nature's marvels, is at its elbow -- the city wouldn't even be here without this river -- but decade after decade it treats it with contempt. While other cities do glorious things with their waterfronts, the strip south of 59th Street (south, that is, of Donald Trump's latest playground) is a mess, a hodgepodge of parking lots and rotting piers. After the epic Westway battle -- which lasted, if memory serves, just over a century -- nature-loving types got the city to commit $100 million to a waterfront park. The plan couldn't go forward without the same amount from the state, though, and last week Gov. George E. Pataki decided to commit the money.
 
ON-LINE BLUES
A Dangerous '800' Number
"Look, Ma, no busy signal!" If you hear those words, and the topic is America Online, you'd better reclaim your place at the family computer -- quick. Yes, the kids might have gotten lucky and dialed into America Online's local access number on the first try (yeah, right!), or they might have heard about an "800" number that was never busy and used that instead. What they probably didn't hear about was the extra access charge for using the "800" number. (And if they did, well, parents are made of money, aren't they?) The bills are coming in, though, and people are discovering that the nice manageable $19.95 a month is turning into hundreds of dollars. Refunds? Possibly, but don't count on it.
 
DEADLINES
Tax Break, Peruvian-Style
Last Wednesday was the tax-filing deadline in Peru, but about 50 Peruvians had a problem: they were still being held hostage in the Japanese Ambassador's residence. Now you'd think that Peruvian tax collectors would just worry about those people later -- let them get past some problems that were, well, a bit more serious than tax forms and not set any formal deadline. Alas, no. The tax office said last week that the hostages, if and when they went free, would have exactly 30 days to do their civic duty.

HEADLINE: Fat Cat Spat;
Look Who's Carping Most About Capitalism

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT wasn't long ago that the most astringent critiques of capitalism came from the left. Armed Zapatista guerrillas in the Mexican jungles and the fast-disappearing Socialists of Japan complained that leaving the world to the ruthless efficiency of the market not only made fat cats fatter and the impoverished poorer, but it also undercut human dignity and skewed national values.
They lost the argument. Save for odd corners of the world like Cuba and North Korea, the ideology of the market economy reigns supreme. Political leaders vying for investments from overseas cut their budget deficits and privatize industry to satisfy the most feared figure on the international scene: the bond-rater from Standard & Poor's, whose thumbs-down in the global coliseum signals the world's biggest investors to take their billions elsewhere. 
 Now the inevitable backlash to market-worship is well under way. But to really hear the excesses of capitalism denounced, listen to some of the world's confirmed capitalists. Perhaps fearful that the side effects of economic globalization are more severe than anyone thought, or that they could spin out of control, prominent members of the monied classes and their conservative allies are questioning whether markets have become too unfettered. The only hitch is that they can't agree on the nature of problem, to say nothing of what to do about it.
Evidence of this rethinking is everywhere. The latest meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland -- which views itself as the world-class assemblage of the free-market elite -- was devoted to ways of ameliorating the worst consequences of economic competitiveness. George Soros, the man who broke the British pound and assembled a $2.5 billion fortune, seized the cover of The Atlantic Monthly recently with a rambling account titled "The Capitalist Threat."
The "uninhibited pursuit" of laissez-faire ideology, a perplexed-sounding Mr. Soros reported, results in a loss of equilibrium. Education and other features of civilized society that don't promise a quick return on investment get short shrift, and nations become "preoccupied with their competitiveness and unwilling to make any sacrifices for the common good." Mr. Soros does not advocate the bar-the-door approach to free trade that other billionaires -- Ross Perot or Sir James Goldsmith, for example -- have urged. But he takes the view that governments have to reclaim their power from the markets.
The new critics have their conservative cheerleaders, though some of those bring a different agenda. There is William Bennett, the conservative's minder of values, who worries less about disequilibrium than about the erosion of national decorum.
Hollywood's production line of sex and violence has been Mr. Bennett's easiest target, but now the debate has moved on to regulating the Internet -- and made odd bedfellows. In defending the Communications Decency Act before the Supreme Court last month, the Clinton Administration found itself allied with the Christian Coalition and Senator Jesse Helms in support of the regulatory state. And it was fighting not only the American Civil Liberties Union but the United States Chamber of Commerce, which warned in a friend-of-the-court brief that the United States would put itself at a competitive disadvantage if it began regulating the ultimate expression of global free enterprise.
 
Echoes From the Past
 None of these arguments is new; there are echoes of Tory conservative thought and the Progessive Era tame-the-oligarchs movement in all of them. What's surprising is that many of the new concerns come from the oligarchs themselves, who see that globalization is causing instability that could unmake the market revolution. And some come from conservatives whose rallying call in the 80's -- shrink the government and save the markets -- has turned into gospel. Even Bill Clinton says the era of big government is over.
But victory left the victors divided. Libertarians persist in defending the untrammeled markets. Patrick J. Buchanan and Ross Perot struck a different chord with arguments that economic integration, starting with the North American Free Trade Agreement, impoverishes working Americans and impinges on American sovereignty by letting "faceless foreign judges" review American laws challenged by our trading partners. Meanwhile, those who worry about income inequality, job insecurity and pornography on the Net talk about getting the Government to intervene.
The same divisions, and odd alliances, can be found wherever politicians, labor unions and business executives believe they have lost their ability to control market forces. Not surprisingly, political leaders find it hard to give up the power that comes from running, and interfering with, a national economy.
In Europe, it is no longer just labor leaders who argue that global competition threatens the Continent's social safety net. Now the chief executives of some of Europe's biggest industrial enterprises are voicing nervousness about the European Monetary Union, the world's most ambitious attempt to erase national boundaries. In Germany, some industrialists are protesting the strict budget-cutting requirements that are part of the deal for countries that want to enter the monetary union. They talk about inflation and unemployment, but their real fear is that Europe's common currency, the Euro, will prove far more unstable than the German mark -- meaning that Germany will be dragged down by lesser economies.
Then there are the South Koreans, who waxed enthusiastic about the wonders of global competitiveness in the 70's and 80's, as American companies moved production there. Now the same forces that brought suburban manses and sports cars to the industrial tangle of Seoul are moving to China and India, scared off by wages that shot up during the democracy movement. When South Korean companies rammed a bill through the Parliament that would allow them to move operations out of the country just as the Americans were doing, the protests grew so ugly that President Kim Young Sam had to go on television to apologize. The law is being amended.
"What we're seeing in the backlash overseas is a reaction to the American style of quick downsizing to become instantly more competitive," said Clyde Prestowitz, who heads the Economic Strategy Institute here. "For decades executives in Europe and Japan have been inculcated with the thought that they have a responsibility to maintain employment and social stability, and now they find this in direct contradiction to the global imperative."
So how much of this backlash is warranted, and how much is driven by the torrent of globaloney about economic integration? The answer is a little of both. Paul Krugman, the M.I.T. economist, says the importance of global markets is overstated because "pontificating about globalization is an easy way to get attention" at conferences like Davos. And politicians, of course, have good reason to throw up their hands and blame mysterious global forces for their national economic woes. France springs to mind.
But it is also clear that globalization's effects have been understated by many economists because they are maddeningly hard to measure. Laura D'Andrea Tyson, President Clinton's chief economic adviser until a few months ago, agrees with estimates that 20 to 25 percent of the growth in wage inequality in America comes from the global market, in which even a complex job can be done half a world away -- say, having software written by an Indian engineer. Such nervousness could explain why Vice President Al Gore, backpedaling on the wonders of globalization, has fallen silent about the need to extend free trade agreements.
 
No One to Make the Rules
 Ultimately, taming the excesses of a global free market is going to be next to impossible because no one can agree on who should do the taming. Who would mandate a minimum wage and create a Social Security system for the world? Who would tell India that it can't build car factories because there are already too many sport utility vehicles polluting the world? Who would rule that Washington should be allowed to regulate what children can see on the Internet, but that China should not be allowed to regulate what dissidents can say on it? These are the "disequilibriums" dividing fans of capitalism around the world. They aren't going to get any easier.

HEADLINE: When Money Talks, Orwell Is Listening

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
AS stock prices tumbled last week, serious discussion erupted as to whether things were really getting better. Or at least that's what you might think if you assumed that Wall Street types use words to mean what they usually mean. The question being asked was whether a stock market "correction" had begun. And certainly, no one would oppose having things corrected.
Why call falling prices a correction? To some extent, it is part of a trend, which has been going on for decades, to make bad economic and financial news sound as good as one possibly can. Politicians are happy to get in on that trend. So are brokerage house analysts, who are often quoted in the financial pages. It is, after all, their job to sell securities. And that job is not made any easier if things sound too bad. 
 On a daily basis, the favored terms of Wall Street make any stock market movement sound good. Sometimes there is a "rally," which means prices are rising. Other days see "profit taking," which means prices are falling because so many people were selling stocks, but it sounds so good. Sometimes the phrase profit taking is used even when a stock has fallen so far that it is inconceivable that any living person has any profits to take.
Companies these days rarely go "bankrupt." Instead, they are "restructured," which sounds ever so much better even if it often means the same thing.
It works in the economy, as well. Once upon a time, the economy suffered occasional "panics," a term that was not a bad description of how investors reacted. But that term was replaced by the much gentler sounding "depression," which had been used to mean economic downturn for a century but only came into wide usage after the 1929 stock market crash. After all, we've all been depressed occasionally, and we've eventually gotten over it.
The 1930's depression destroyed the Republican Party for generations. So politicians decreed there could never be another one. Since then, there have only been "recessions."
Financial words that begin life as mere euphemisms mysteriously acquire mathematical rigor. A recession now has an official definition: two consecutive quarters in which the nation's economic output declines. Except nobody admits that anything declines; the preferred term is "negative growth." Even in a recession it sounds better to have some kind of growth.
Similarly, a correction is viewed as a decline of at least 10 percent in a stock market index. (The Dow Jones industrial average has not had one of those since 1990, a record-long period, but it is now down 7.9 percent from its peak, reached March 11, so one could come any day.)
If a correction lasts long enough, it eventually becomes a bear market, although you can be sure Wall Street will resist admitting such a thing until it is quite obvious. (The use of the bear as a symbol of falling prices dates from the early 18th century, and evidently predates the use of a bull as a symbol of rising prices. The Oxford English Dictionary speculates it may have come from a proverb about the risk of selling a bearskin before the bear is caught.)
After the mid-1970's recession, the worst one since World War II, even that word briefly became forbidden in official Washington. Alfred E. Kahn, the Cornell economist and adviser to President Jimmy Carter, dealt with the prohibition by using the word "banana" when he meant recession. Everyone had a good laugh. So far, recessions are still allowed in discussion.
But they terrify politicians. President Clinton owes his job, in no little part, to his success in blaming George Bush for the last recession. No doubt Al Gore cringes whenever an economist suggests that a recession might appear in the next few years. Since he can't control the economy, perhaps Mr. Gore should simply seek a new term. Might we suggest "growth pause"?
A decade or two ago, a stock that collapsed and then recovered a bit was not said to have "snapped back," today's label. The move was instead called a "dead cat bounce," which is the idea that anything will bounce a little if dropped from high up enough.
But that term is rarely used these days. It might encourage more investors to engage in profit taking.

HEADLINE: The World;
Searching for an Enemy and Finding China

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A SOVIET analyst, Georgi Arbatov, once warned that Mikhail Gorbachev was going to do something unforgiveable to the United States: take away its enemy.
But Mr. Arbatov underestimated American ingenuity. In the last few months, a number of members of Congress, leading and following the opinion magazines and the think-tank symposia, have been working to invent a new enemy, China. Sparked by unconfirmed suspicions that the Chinese sought to meddle in the American political campaign, enough confusion and domestic politics now swirl around the topic of Beijing to make even a Cold Warrior's head spin. 
 The argument is that the United States could be cooperating in its displacement from Asia by helping China grow in wealth and military potential. This is a variant on the Leninist notion that the capitalists will sell the revolutionaries the rope to hang them. It also builds on the recurrent American fear of an Asian power rising up to challenge American dominance in the Pacific, a role played first by fascist Japan, then by Communist China, then by an economically booming Japan, and now, again, perhaps, by China.
But does that reflect the real relationship between China and the United States? A number of powerful thinkers in Washington say it does not. They say the fears presume a hostile relationship largely because they overestimate Beijing's capacities while hardly looking at all at China's weaknesses and poverty.
This is not to say that China is not a nasty place. Political dissent has been quashed there and democratic activists are jailed on flimsy grounds; the leaders are a narrow group of autocrats who use power ham-handedly and hand out multi-million business contracts to Boeing or Airbus for political gain; state-owned businesses only obey copyright agreements when threatened; the military is backward but ambitious and sells missiles to countries like Iran that Washington doesn't much like.
 
Behaving Badly
 And it is not to say that China's growing influence, both economic and military, will not create problems for America and Asia. An aggressively nationalist China nursing past humiliations is going to be a major power in the next century no matter what Washington does.
But even those who are pessimistic about China understand that it is not a great power now, and that some of its nastiness stems from the anxieties of a narrowly based central leadership with decaying political legitimacy.
And there is a big difference between acknowledging that the Chinese Government behaves badly and believing that it represents a clear and present danger. Put another way, there is a difference between having faith that the United States will be strong enough to rein in China's ambitions and influence its behavior for some time to come, and fearing that China is already so implacable that America can only confront and contain it.
Despite Chinese denials -- and the obvious fact that other countries, from Israel to France to Taiwan itself, do their best to influence American politics with money and espionage -- the scandal has helped convince many Americans that China is an enemy.
But Winston Lord, who recently left office as Assistant Secretary of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, warns against such an approach. "It's inevitable and healthy to have a debate on China and its future," he says. "But there is a tendency to exaggerate China's threat and demonize it, almost out of nostalgia for the Soviet Union. We shouldn't assume China's hostility in the next century, which could be self-fulfilling and wrong, any more than we should assume China will be benign. We have to be firm, tough, seek cooperation and keep our powder dry, while shoring up alliances."
Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former Carter Administration National Security Adviser and no softie on Communism, says something similar: "Our fashion is to have the enemy of the year. China is big, it's large on the map, it's yellow, so there is an under-the-surface racist element, and it fits very nicely an obsessive state of mind. I imagine it will last a couple of years, because China is big enough to sustain this obsession."
At the same time, senior American officials say, China's rush toward development has created severe tensions for a post-Deng leadership that could just as easily spin China into rival provincial fiefs as create an aggressive superpower.
Robert B. Zoellick, who was an Under Secretary of State for James Baker, says capitalism has improved living conditions for hundreds of millions of people, while undermining the legitimacy of their leaders.
 
Freedom and Tension
 "The Chinese enjoy more freedom, choice and opportunity to learn about the world than they did when the United States re-established ties" 25 years ago, he said. He then lists the "momentous tensions" China's nervous leaders are trying to manage: between Beijing and the provinces; the mainland and Hong Kong and Taiwan; private and state-owned enterprises; urban and rural populations; and decayed political legitimacy and an increasingly pluralistic public. America needs a strategy, he argues, "that matches a China that will be in a condition of flux for decades, not just years." But the current controversy, senior American officials freely admit, is putting a freeze on any important initiative in relations, making a vote for permanent favorable trade status for Beijing impossible this year. It is also threatening to postpone China's entry into the World Trade Organization, which the West wants.
One result of the fight is that the Clinton Administration, after fumbling through its own contradictions on how to handle China, human rights and trade, is now having to defend dealing politely with China at all. Its case was not helped by Vice President Al Gore's painful awkwardness in his public sessions with Chinese leaders, his failure to speak forcefully about human rights and his refusal to visit Hong Kong, as House Speaker Newt Gingrich cheerfully did.
But just as cheerfully, Mr. Gingrich acknowledged to The Wall Street Journal that China has changed. If some Republicans are searching for an enemy, he added, "I don't think China is that enemy."

HEADLINE: After the Shouting;
A Minimal-Impact Minimum Wage

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
UP close, the thunder of last year's debate over the minimum wage seemed as portentous as the shots fired on Fort Sumter.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy called an increase in the $4.25 minimum hourly wage "the overarching issue of our time and the election." The Republican House Majority Leader, Richard K. Armey, a former professor of economics, said, "Study after study demonstrates" that hikes in the minimum wage shut out the neediest job seekers. He vowed to fight an increase "with every fiber of my being." And Republican Senator Hank Brown of Colorado warned that the resulting jobless teen-agers would trigger "a crime problem and a juvenile problem of epic proportions." 
 The increase kicked in Oct. 1. Now, six months later, the Government's employment report suggests that the fulminations were mostly hot air. Last month's 5.2 percent unemployment rate was the lowest in five months. The new wage is a boon to some working poor. But the wage increase has had little effect elsewhere.
 
A Hill of Beans
 Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute, which has union support, said, "Despite the vehemence of the debate, a minimum wage increase is throwing a pretty small pebble in a very large pool." Mark Wilson of the conservative Heritage Foundation agreed, "The economics of the minimum wage doesn't matter a hill of beans to anybody."
Looking for re-election last year, Congress and the White House ordered the first increase in the wage in six years. That upped the standard by 50 cents an hour to $4.75 last October with another 40-cent rise to $5.15 this July.
For a full-time worker who earned the old $4.25, that means a raise of $1,800 a year and an incoming exceeding $10,000 for the first time. People earning up to $5.15 an hour account for around 10 million of the nation's 129 million workers.
Most people's pay, however, is rising by a barely perceptible clip, suggesting that the increase in the minimum wage has little ripple effect. Last month they averaged $12.15 an hour, 24 cents more than in September and 47 cents more than a year ago.
As for looming unemployment, finding a job has rarely been easier. Since September, a robustly growing economy has pulled nearly two million more people into jobs, including 124,000 more of those dreaded jobless teen-agers.
None of this surprises most economists, who say that the law of supply and demand still works, that employers will hire fewer workers when the minimum wage rises a lot as it has sometimes in the past. But most say this latest relatively small increase in a very low minimum wage has a minimal impact on jobs or the economy. At most, a higher minimum might discourage employers from hiring an additional 200,000 workers while they raise the pay of many more.
So why the big debate? One reason was business as usual: Congress responds to pressure groups like labor unions, which favor higher wages, and groups like fast-food chains, which hire most minimum-wage workers and want to hold down wages. This time a political skirmish became a brawl over ideological fundamentalism.
Having won control of both houses for the first time in four decades, Republicans wanted to take a symbolic whack at Government intervention in the economy. They tackled the orthodoxy that says all wages plunge without a minimum wage.
In setting a minimum wage, Mr. Wilson of the Heritage Foundation explained, government intrudes upon the freedom of employers and workers to negotiate the terms of a job. "Slowly but surely," he said, "they're taking away your liberty to mutually make employment decisions. I dare say that's socialism. It's government paternalism at its worst."
 
Battle of the Economists
 To lend credibility to their ideology, both sides drew on distinguished economists. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich seized upon the work of two Princeton professors, Alan Krueger and David Card.
Both economists had looked at employment in fast-food shops in New Jersey and Pennsylvania before and after New Jersey raised its minimum wage above Pennsylvania's. Employment in Pennsylvania didn't change, they found, and it even grew slightly in the New Jersey shops.
Mr. Reich used their study to show that an increase would not lose jobs. Mr. Kennedy, sensing a popular issue, began pushing a wage rise to the top of the Democrats' election-year agenda.
Meanwhile Richard Berman, executive secretary of the Employment Policies Institute, a research group financed in part by the National Restaurant Association, sent payroll data from some of the same restaurants to two other distinguished economists, William Wascher of the Federal Reserve and David B. Neumark of Michigan State University. They came to the opposite conclusion, discerning a slight decline in jobs at the New Jersey restaurants.
For all four economists the operable word was "slight." But in political debate such distinctions became mountains and the economists themselves became targets of partisan ridicule.
"We tried to be cautious" in reporting the analysis of Mr. Berman's data, Mr. Neumark said. "Our conclusion was: this had to be looked at more." Lobbyists, though, blew their findings out of proportion, he said. "It was obnoxious."
Mr. Card said, "I've sort of had it. I've sort of decided I'm not working on the minimum wage any more."

HEADLINE: Welfare Reform's Other Victims

 BODY:
Among this country's 30 million low-wage workers without high school degrees, there is widespread fear that the new law requiring welfare recipients to work will cost them their jobs. Many economists say that relatively few workers will be displaced. But there will be suffering because the influx of low-paid workers will drive down the wages of those who already have jobs.
About four million welfare recipients will go to work either in private-sector jobs or -- if states assume responsibility -- in workfare, which pays the recipient welfare benefits in exchange for cleaning parks or other public-service work. If the economy stays strong, labor markets can absorb three or four million more workers without shoving aside existing workers. Over the past 20 years, unemployment rates have dropped even as millions of baby boomers flooded the market. More work for some does not mean less work for others. Welfare recipients will not just occupy a job slot. They will also earn income to spend on goods that other workers must be hired to produce. 
 The new law is not, however, without risks. Employers could afford to soak up the baby boomers because wages fell. Hiring welfare recipients at lower wages will also be profitable. Four million new workers might seem a small addition to a labor force of 130 million. But most of them are concentrated in only a few regions, and because they will compete for the jobs that require little education or work experience, the influx of welfare recipients will create downward pressures on wages in those areas. Prof. Harry Holzer of Michigan State estimates that wages for unskilled workers across the nation could fall by an average of 10 percent.
If Congress could guarantee that the economy would remain forever strong, the new welfare law might make sense. Nearly everyone could work, even if wages fell. But the economy will at some point slow down. Many unskilled workers will lose their jobs, joining welfare recipients unable to hold a steady job in a lengthening unemployment line. Under the old law, they could collect food stamps for as long as they needed help. Under the new law, childless adults can lose their food stamps in a matter of months. Cash benefits for parents could be cut off after two years.
The states could step in to fill the void created by Congress. But judging from past experience, most states will not want to raise the necessary taxes because they fear losing their competitive edge in the hunt for new industry. When Congress ripped away the safety net, it had no idea how much fear and desperation it would cause.

HEADLINE: An Endgame for the Mideast

 BODY:
President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright like to talk about America as the indispensable nation, the only country with the power and prestige to help bring peace to troubled regions like the Middle East. They now have a chance to deliver on that grand image. The unfinished peace between Israel and the Palestinians is near collapse and Washington's role as avuncular mediator will no longer suffice. Mr. Clinton and Ms. Albright must make some hard decisions and take some political risks to end the conflict.
They can begin tomorrow when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel comes to the White House. Both Mr. Netanyahu and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, have mismanaged the peace effort in the weeks since the two sides reached a milestone agreement on the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the West Bank city of Hebron. Israel has imperiously proceeded with a housing construction project in East Jerusalem and Palestinian terror attacks have resumed in Israel. 
 With trust disintegrating and violent confrontations resuming, the entire step-by-step approach to peace no longer seems promising. Still, if there is no other route open, Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat, with a powerful push from Washington, may have to return to the phased peace plan outlined in the original Oslo agreements three years ago.
But another, more daring option may be available if the White House is willing to bear the risks involved. It is to move directly to intensive negotiations on a final settlement. That would mean negotiating permanent boundaries between the areas of Israeli and Palestinian control and defining the respective rights of the two peoples in Jerusalem.
It would require deciding whether Jewishsettlements in the West Bank and Gaza should be uprooted, annexed to Israel, or transferred to Palestinian rule with security guarantees. Final settlement talks must also determine whether the Palestinians win a full-fledged state of their own, or must accept some limits on their sovereignty.
A drive for a final agreement would probably require continuous high-level talks with active American participation, not unlike the 1978 Camp David marathon led by President Carter. Though the idea may seem improbable in the tense climate that now prevails, it should not be dismissed. Some conditions are favorable. Mr. Netanyahu is pushing for the idea, and the White House seems willing to consider it. The two main Israeli political parties have begun to sketch out elements of a politically sustainable Israeli bargaining position. Mr. Netanyahu even seems prepared to discuss the formation of a Likud-Labor coalition government, which would free him to make some difficult concessions.
Palestinian leaders, while wary of skipping past the remaining land transfers due under Oslo, have recently been thinking creatively about final-status issues. On Jerusalem, for example, Mr. Arafat now talks about a Vatican City-type arrangement that would not require a redivision of the city. Others have ventured further, suggesting a new Palestinian capital that would lie inside metropolitan Jerusalem but outside present city limits.
Compromises on Jerusalem and the other issues will be painful for both sides, and impossible without sustained pressure and encouragement from Washington. They will have to honor Israel's need for military security and legitimate Palestinian aspirations to national dignity.
Before any kind of talks can begin again, Mr. Arafat must unequivocally restate his opposition to terrorism and back up his words with consistent actions. Mr. Netanyahu should respond with constructive gestures in the economic sphere -- for example, allowing the opening of the Palestinian airport and seaport facilities in Gaza. Nothing, however, will happen without the direct and active involvement of Mr. Clinton and Ms. Albright. America can only be the indispensable nation if its leaders are prepared to make it so.

HEADLINE: From Asia, the Real Clinton Scandal Is His Prices

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: HONG KONG

 BODY:
From Asia, the accusations of influence-peddling at the White House look a bit different. The immediate reaction is often not outrage but surprise -- at the low American prices.
Corruption and gift-giving to curry favor are widespread in most Asian countries. And a few highly publicized scandals, including cases that involved former presidents of South Korea, have highlighted what is widely accepted here: the practice is entwined with building relationships and doing business, and the amounts are usually far greater than the sums that have sparked uproar in Washington. 
 Corruption may be no more widespread in parts of Asia than in other rapidly developing regions, like Latin America, but it has come into the spotlight because of links to President Clinton's campaign fund-raising. And it is clear that the development boom that has transformed East Asian economies has sent the price of influence soaring.
A result is that some executives here are struck mostly by how inexpensive it reportedly is to gain access to the President. A $100,000 contribution will not get a visitor a night in the Asian versions of the Lincoln Bedroom, or probably even a presidential green tea, or even a glass of water. Indeed, such an amount might be regarded as so puny a donation as to be insulting.
Take Yang Chung Mo, a South Korean business executive who in the 1980's was asked to contribute to the fund-raising efforts of Chun Doo Hwan, then the country's President. According to accounts of the episode in The Joong-ang Ilbo, a major Korean daily newspaper, Mr. Yang contributed $386,000, which was regarded as a paltry sum.
President Chun is said to have been furious at the offering and at Mr. Yang's disregard for accepted norms (on other occasions, Mr. Yang paid by check instead of cash). And after all, Mr. Chun had dropped hints to Mr. Yang that another executive had donated $3.8 million.
So Mr. Chun, who is now in prison for corruption, was said to have punished Mr. Yang by effectively destroying his conglomerate, the Kukje Group, which was then one of South Korea's largest. At the time, Mr. Chun ruled as a dictator, so the case was never prosecuted. Kukje went bankrupt in 1985, and its pieces were scattered among other conglomerates whose executives had dug more deeply into their pockets.
"If they want to influence policy, I don't think they would think in terms of $100,000," a prominent Asian-American said of tycoons in Asia. "They would think in much larger amounts of money. A hundred thousand is too small an amount to think it could influence Clinton policy."
Politics is as costly a process in much of Asia as it is in America, and so politicians -- with the same distaste as in America -- feel obliged to turn to companies and wealthy individuals. Likewise, family members of influential figures in Asia, from Thailand to Taiwan and Indonesia to South Korea, sometimes see their roles as gatekeepers, and they take tips at the door.
In China, the son of a Politburo member confided a few years ago that he was accepting a $400,000 share of a company in exchange for lending his family's support for a commercial project. The idea was that officials would favor the company if they realized that the family had a stake in it.
"You just don't do business without sending a few bucks the way of your friends," said a foreign banker in Hong Kong.
Contributions from Asians and Asian-Americans have been at the center of the controversy about White House campaign financing, but many Asian-Americans and Asians complain that the focus is misplaced. They say that the uproar is a result of bias.
One businessman in Asia who met Mr. Clinton said that at his breakfast meeting at the White House there were other foreigners, from the Middle East and elsewhere, but by far the greatest scrutiny had been directed at those with Asian names.
"I find a lot of 'yellow peril' invective in the way this is reported," said Eugene K. Galbraith, who handles global research for HG Asia, a brokerage firm, and who spent 16 years in Indonesia before moving to Hong Kong last year. Mr. Galbraith said the same search for influence could be seen in other parts of the world without a strong legal tradition.
In such places, where various laws are interpreted loosely or simply do not exist, relationships have become a crucial means for doing business. "It doesn't have so much to do with Asia as with political systems in which the rule of law is not sufficient," he said. "You've got to know the people to get things done."
Yet the executives acknowledge that influence-peddling is widespread in Asia, and that the custom of spreading around a million dollars here and a million there is hard to shed when dealing with the United States. Just as most Americans probably do not regard it as theft if they use a paper clip from the office, many Asian executives find it difficult to get excited about sums in the thousands of dollars.
In Indonesia, for example, one public stock offering recently involved a demand for some $50 million worth of shares, under a special financial arrangement, to a family member of President Suharto, according to an executive familiar with the deal. The executive and others say that the practice is not uncommon.
In South Korea, former President Roh Tae Woo has been imprisoned and convicted for, among other offenses, raising more than $350 million in illegal contributions. Of that sum, two companies contributed $31 million each, local newspapers say.
In China, a former Deputy Mayor of Beijing, Wang Baosen, committed suicide two years ago when he came under scrutiny for having amassed $37 million in payoffs. In Japan, a former political boss, Shin Kanemaru, was arrested after a police raid on his home turned up cash and gold bars worth some $25 million.
In Thailand, corruption has been one of the main reasons for dissatisfaction with several Thai leaders, from Chatichai Choonhavan, in the early 1990's, to Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa, voted out last fall.
Sometimes money that changes hands or is deposited into a bank account clearly violates the local laws, and in most countries bribery is against the law. But on many occasions the exchange is highly subtle or the laws are simply neglected.
In Asia, a "voluntary contribution" or an expensive gift may be offered in return for a specific change of policy. More often the donations are a way of currying favor and assuring access in the long run.
Using money to cultivate relationships with powerful or prominent figures is considered a legitimate business practice. Sometimes the aim is not so much influence-peddling as prestige-peddling.
Likewise, in the United States, the aim of donations to the Democratic Party in many cases may have been to win President Clinton's ear or that of his aides rather than a specific quid pro quo, executives say. Over and over again, executives talked about money not as bribes but as nutrients to cultivate relationships. No word comes up more than "relationships."
"Most of the Chinese people view more the relationship and the integrity than the money," said Joseph Chiang, a director in the China division of the Lippo Group in Hong Kong. "If you and I are friends, I wouldn't think twice to use money to change your mind. Relationships and integrity are of utmost importance to most of the overseas Chinese businessmen."
That view was echoed in interviews with executives throughout Asia.
"If you look at the pattern of overseas Chinese who invest in China, they always contribute, building schools or hospitals," said Roderick W. Macneil, who runs his own firm doing business in China. "They surely wouldn't do it if they didn't have long-term interests in the town or locality. But it's not the case of 'I'll build a hospital in exchange for taking 50 percent of your port.' There's no direct quid pro quo."

HEADLINE: Within Little Havana, A Change in Accents;
Other Hispanic Groups Growing in Miami

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, April 5

 BODY:
In Little Havana's Maximo Gomez Park, named after the 19th-century Cuban patriot, the boisterous crowd of regulars, all in their 60's, 70's and 80's, interrupt their domino game only to go get a cortadito, Cuban coffee. They call one another "brother" or "partner" in Spanish, trade stories about past adventures and talk politics but rarely argue. They are all staunchly anti-Castro.
The scene at Domino Park, as it is more commonly known, is quintessential Hispanic Miami, one of the images that has defined this city, where Cuban immigrants have dominated in numbers and clout since the 1980's. 
 But within the same blocks, another Little Havana can be found -- the one with St. John Bosco Church, where the Cuban pastor tends to a parish that is 68 percent Nicaraguan; with La Esquina de Tejas restaurant, where most of the waitresses are from Honduras, Uruguay and Peru, and with the local Sedano's Supermarket, where customers reach past the Cuban black beans to the yellow cornmeal for Colombian arepas, sweet corncakes.
The Little Havana of today underscores a change that demographers say took hold in the 1980's and continues in the 1990's -- in Miami, Hispanic does not mean just Cuban anymore.
Cuban-Americans remain the largest Hispanic group, about 60 percent of the one million Hispanic residents in Dade County, Miami's metropolitan area. They also derive political and economic power from being, in the words of a Princeton University sociologist, Alejandro Portes, "the oldest, the most naturalized, the richest and the most solidarized" Hispanic group here.
But over the last two decades, new immigration and higher birth rates among other Hispanic groups have dramatically altered the composition of the Hispanic mix and given Miami a broader Latin American identity, demographers say.
They have also made the area's economy heavily dependent on international commerce, given politicians another group to cater to -- the non-Cuban Hispanic voter -- and maintained Spanish as a well-entrenched language, although with different accents.
So different that Alex Chamizo, 36, a Cuban-American whose family has owned La Esquina de Tejas for 30 years, says he feels "the way the Anglos felt when the Cubans came."
The immigration after Fidel Castro's revolutionary victory in 1959 turned Dade County, whose Hispanic population was only 5 percent in 1960, into a Hispanic stronghold. By 1990, 49 percent of the two million residents were of Hispanic descent. In 1995, the University of Florida estimated that the county's Hispanic residents had grown to 1.1 million, or 56 percent of the population.
But in the latest part of this demographic transition, another shift occurred. While Cubans accounted for 91 percent of all Hispanic residents in the county in 1970, the percentage dropped to 59 percent by 1990, despite a doubling of the Cuban population, to more than 550,000. The fastest-growing group during this period was what the Census Bureau lumps together under "other Hispanics," mostly Central and South Americans.
The Census Bureau released figures last month showing that Dade County would be losing population if not for immigration, which added nearly 200,000 residents from 1990 to 1996. Statistics from the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Dade County School District show that a significant number came from Colombia, Nicaragua, Peru, Honduras and the Dominican Republic, as well as Cuba and Haiti.
Hispanic sections in other large urban centers around the country like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago have also grown more diverse as the Hispanic population undergoes explosive growth that is expected to make it the nation's largest minority by 2005. But the impact has been greatest in Miami, where the Hispanic culture has become dominant.
In this most unassimilated of metropolitan areas, where the Hispanic majority is mostly foreign born, the diversity has transformed Miami into a Latin American center where billboards in Portuguese announce Brazilian drinks, international businesses like shipping, banking and travel are major employers and the main Spanish-language daily, El Nuevo Herald, reprints articles from 11 Latin American newspapers.
El Nuevo Herald's decision to begin publishing articles last month from newspapers like Venezuela's El Universal and Panama's La Prensa was aimed at giving readers "a more genuine flavor to the Colombian or the Venezuelan story," said the publisher, Alberto Ibarguen.
The idea reflected market realities -- about half of the newspaper's readership in Dade and Broward Counties is of Hispanic descent other than Cuban-American, he said -- but also Mr. Ibarguen's own interests. He was born in Puerto Rico, of a Puerto Rican mother and a Cuban father, has lived in Colombia and Venezuela and is married to an Argentinian.
"I'm representative of what this city is becoming," said Mr. Ibarguen, 53.
Nowhere are the changes more evident than in immigrant enclaves like Little Havana, the first stop for many newcomers, where the famed Cuban block party, Calle Ocho, (Eighth Street) had as its theme this year Festival of the Americas and where about half the storefronts have sprouted signs advertising travel to Central America or food staples like Salvadoran pupusas, grilled corn pancakes with stuffing.
At St. John Bosco Church, which opened in 1963 to tend to the religious and social needs of Cuban exiles, the founding pastor, Msgr. Emilio Vallina, says his Central American parishioners of today are poorer, lacking the Government aid or refugee services given to the Cubans when they first arrived.
While many new arrivals strain social services in the short term, their ties to Latin America have attracted more business and tourism, said Mayor Alex Penelas of Dade County. Every new flight that an airline adds to its routes, he said, creates 40 jobs.
Mayor Penelas, 35, American-born but of Cuban descent, was elected last year in an example of the consolidation of Cuban-Americans' political power in an area where they still lead in voter registration. But while most Hispanic elected officials here are Cuban, Mr. Penelas, a Democrat, said those elected countywide, like him, could not have won without building coalitions among five main blocs of voters: black, Jewish, Anglo, Cuban and non-Cuban Hispanic.
Political experts say that Hispanic groups like the Puerto Ricans and the Dominicans tend to vote more Democratic than Cuban-Americans here, but that others, like Colombians, seem to be just as Republican. All groups, however, often come together to elect Hispanic candidates regardless of party affiliation, the experts said.
Certain issues like welfare reform have also caused Hispanic groups to unite in the past. With more younger Cubans voting Democratic, according to voter samples, "in a way the Hispanic population in Dade County is up for grabs," said Dario Moreno, a political science professor at Florida International University.
The Hispanic gains in numbers and power have been accompanied by an exodus of non-Hispanic whites, who made up about 30 percent of the county's population in 1990, and increasing frustration among black residents, who comprised about 20 percent and are now the most vocal in trying to insure political and economic participation.
But grumblings of dissatisfaction are also heard among Hispanic groups, from those who perceive the Cuban-Americans as giving preferential treatment to one another in jobs and government programs, or who have grown tired of the constant drumbeat against Castro's Cuba. "The challenge, of course, is to make everybody feel that they're part of this community," Mayor Penelas said. "There's no doubt about it. That's a challenge."
In this population mix, cultural clashes underlying a nation's prejudices inevitably come to the fore occasionally.
In Little Havana, the banning of a Puerto Rican singer from performing at the Calle Ocho festival last month because of his embrace of a famous songwriter from Cuba prompted the ire of Puerto Rican civic leaders.
Last year, when the president of the Latin Chamber of Commerce blamed newcomers, including recently arrived Cubans, for the trash piling up on Little Havana's sidewalks, he drew angry retorts from Nicaraguan organizations.
Intermarriages and voting patterns, however, show more cohesiveness than meets the eye. Julio Ospina, 57, a Colombian pawn shop manager, has married five times -- three times to fellow Colombians, once to a Cuban and once to a Peruvian, his current wife.
"Latins are very extroverted," he said. "It's easy to meet people here. To label somebody based on what country they're from is ignorant."
Leoncio Lazo, 70, a Domino Park regular for 17 years, agreed. "The Cuban generally gets along with everybody," Mr. Lazo said. "The only one he never gets along with is the Communist."
A number of the most active Hispanic organizations, including the Colombian American Service Association and the Puerto Rican Chamber of Commerce of South Florida, are nevertheless forming a coalition to give non-Cuban Hispanic residents a louder voice for their various interests.
"It's not us versus them," said Juan Carlos Zapata, 30, president of the Colombian association and a member of the Dade County Community Council, "but the time has come to say we want the same opportunities to do what you did."
In an area where change is the only constant, it may not be clear until the 2000 census whether Cuban demographic erosion continued through the 1990's, experts say. Because of the 1994 accords between the United States and Cuba that allow for a steady migration of at least 20,000 Cubans each year to this country, there is talk among sociologists of a "re-Cubanization" of Miami.
But as younger generations grow more Americanized, the question is what cultural imprint Miami can expect. The tone will be pan-Latin, sociologists say.
"Little by little, when the population becomes more American and less immigrant, they'll develop more of a sense of being Hispanic or Latino and will develop more unity," said Silvia Pedraza, a sociology professor at the University of Michigan and an expert on ethnicity. "Having the cities become more diverse is the first ingredient in the development of a Hispanic identity in the United States."

HEADLINE: HEALTH CARE'S GIANT: The Doctor as Investor -- A special report.;
For Biggest Hospital Operator, A Debate Over Ties That Bind

BYLINE: This article is by Martin Gottlieb and Kurt Eichenwald, with computer analysis by Josh Bar banel. 

 BODY:
The offer made Dr. Richard Rubinson uneasy. Shortly after the Columbia Hospital Corporation took control of the Miami hospital in 1993 where he had long practiced, the company gave him and other doctors the chance to buy up to 20 percent of the institution by investing up to $150,000 each. As investors, the company explained, the physicians would share in the hospital's financial risks and rewards.
Such investment offers are common in American industry. Yet to Dr. Rubinson, the former president of the Dade County Medical Society, medicine is not just any industry. He feared that his interests as an investor might conflict with his duty as a doctor to act in the best interests of patients. Columbia's investment deals, he felt, gave doctors "the implicit understanding that the more patients there were, the more the return on your little piece would be." 
 It was, the 60-year-old thoracic surgeon said, "a message I just didn't want to respond to." He declined Columbia's offer.
In the last few years, several thousand doctors have been offered such investments by Columbia, now known as the Columbia/ HCA Healthcare Corporation, the nation's largest health care company, with about 350 hospitals and hundreds of other medical facilities. Some, like Dr. Rubinson, have begged off. Many others have not.
Hospitals, of course, have long recruited doctors with generous enticements -- like signing bonuses, consulting contracts and outright purchases of their practices. For Columbia, able to bring vast wealth to the courting game, these deals have been instrumental in the drive to dominate medical marketplaces.
But, because their financial returns are tied directly to those of their hospitals, the doctor-investors are stepping into different and, to many health care experts, troubling territory. Not only do they raise the kind of ethical issues that so worried Dr. Rubinson; some of the investments are raising legal questions as well.
In recent months, Columbia's financial relationships with its doctors have come under heightened legal scrutiny. The Federal agency that runs Medicare is examining whether Columbia doctor-investors are violating a Federal conflict-of-interest law when they send patients to services like home care that are operated through hospitals where they have stakes. Many of the investors in El Paso were served with search warrants as part of a Federal inquiry involving the company. And a doctor who invested in a Columbia partnership in Texas has sued the company, saying that some of its deals with physicians violate the law.
To examine the investments' effects, The New York Times analyzed referral patterns of 62 doctors in the Miami area. Since Columbia does not make partnership records public, the study was based on limited information. But it showed that after investing, the doctors as a group referred more patients than before to Columbia hospitals and fewer to competing hospitals. Columbia called the study flawed and said investments did not influence admissions.
Though a handful of far smaller companies also offer doctors investments, Columbia has used them from its inception and is their most forceful proponent. After putting a hold on such plans for several years, while absorbing hundreds of new acquisitions, Columbia has started to offer them again.
Bringing doctors on as investors, the company's executives say, is nothing more than an effort at smoothing the often-fractious relationship between hospitals and physicians. They say the investments give doctors an identification with the company's mission. This, they say, leads to savings -- because the investors are thus more prone to listen to reasonable plans for economies -- and to improvements in care that come through the cooperation with the hospital that is needed in the era of managed care.
"We believe that physician integration is best achieved if we -- Columbia and doctors -- have a common vision of our future and share in governance, risk, reward and ownership," said Dr. Frank M. Houser, president of Columbia Physician Services.
But many medical professionals look at this new doctor-hospital relationship and come away asking questions like these:
With hospital administrators pressing to cut costs, will doctors with investments acquiesce more easily to cuts in nursing care and other services? With hospitals increasingly forced to accept fixed payments for care, no matter how much they actually spend to provide it, will doctors shrink more readily from ordering medically beneficial but costly tests and treatments?
And will the investments influence where doctors send patients? Especially, will they tend to refer patients who cannot pay, and others with costly cases, to hospitals where they do not have a stake and refer the more profitable ones to their investment hospitals? And will they tend to send patients to outside medical services in which the company has a stake, even if such treatment is not medically necessary or could be provided more effectively elsewhere?
Some of these issues are akin to ones faced by the far larger, and steadily growing, number of physicians who receive fixed payments for managed care patients and so have an incentive to limit treatment.
In interviews, many doctor investors said the investments had no effect on the way they treated patients.
"The thing that drives physicians on where they send people is where they can get their best care," said Dr. Magdalena Averhoff, an investor in Columbia Cedars Medical Center in Miami who is on the company's national board.
But in a brief written in support of the Texas doctor's lawsuit against Columbia, three of the country's most prominent physicians argue that by their nature, the investments confound a doctor's loyalties.
The investments, along with other incentives, "take physicians into uncharted waters, where conflicts of interest abound and the separation between business and professional aims is obscured," wrote the doctors, C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General; Arnold S. Relman, former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, and James S. Todd, former executive vice president of the American Medical Association.
"No longer are physicians the trustees solely for their patients' interests," they wrote. "They become in addition agents for a corporate enterprise which regards patients as customers."

The Enticements
Long String of Lures For Local Doctors
Landing Dr. Jerry Enis, a Miami orthopedic surgeon, was a coup for Columbia. When he left Mount Sinai Hospital in Miami Beach in 1992, he took more than 250 patients a year to two Columbia hospitals.
Dr. Enis said he saw Columbia's executives as "pioneers" committed to improving medicine. In joining Columbia, Dr. Enis also became an investor, with $45,000 in Cedars Medical Center and $15,000 more in Miami Heart Institute. But what tipped the balance, he said, was a package of perquisites including the $2.5 million purchase of a struggling office building he owned.
"It was enough of a stimulus for me to make the change," he said. "I would be a provider for the Columbia hospital system and bring my patients there."
With deals like these, Columbia follows a well-worn, legally sanctioned path. Long before investment deals were offered, hospitals wooed doctors with lucrative benefits.
Benefits vary widely. For example, in El Paso, records show, one Columbia hospital paid large consulting fees to a number of doctors -- about $500,000 in 1994 to 10 doctors alone. In Tampa, Fla., Dr. R. R. Vijay, a heart surgeon, receives $90,000 a year for his work as a medical director; he uses two-thirds of it for a helicopter to take him to work.
Yet such deals can unnerve some doctors. Consider Dr. Jerry Niernberger, a family practitioner in Wichita, Kan., who was saddled with $40,000 in student loans. When talks on a joint venture fell apart between Columbia and the group practice where he worked, the company began picking off the group's physicians with handsome offers.
Dr. Niernberger's contract with the practice imposed strict financial sanctions if he joined a competitor. But he said Columbia offered to pay the penalty if he joined a company hospital. Beyond that, he said, the company's package included a large guaranteed increase in income, a signing bonus and the retirement of student loans.
"That money was sitting there," Dr. Niernberger recalled. "My life would be so much easier." But in the end he balked. Working for Columbia did not appeal to him, and as for the offer's extravagance, he said, "I felt pretty uncomfortable about that."

The Investments
A Crucial Element From the Beginning
From Columbia's earliest days, winning doctors' loyalty with investments was as important as wooing them with attractive financial offers. With the investments, Columbia brought to hospitals the kind of arrangements sweeping through American medicine, with doctors owning pieces of businesses like labs and CAT-scan centers.
The company offered the investments at 15 of its first 23 acquisitions. Then, as now, Richard L. Scott, Columbia's chairman, explained their rationale as simple.
"If someone has an ownership interest in something, they take pride in that, and so they will try to have whatever impact they can," he said last year. "It's really less that physicians invest, and it's more that we offer them the opportunity to be our partner."
But loan records from Citicorp, one of Columbia's bankers, show that at their inception the investments were seen as a way to insure that doctors would send patients to Columbia rather than to rivals. Because of that, Citicorp viewed the investments as a central rationale for approving a $54 million loan to the company for its first hospital acquisitions, in El Paso.
In a 1988 memo, for example, Michael E. Wendling, a Citicorp officer, noted enthusiastically that Columbia planned to "increase market share through the use of physician partnerships to capture existing patient flows from competing hospitals."
In June 1988, Mr. Scott wrote Mr. Wendling that the partnership plan would help the company increase its admissions. "Based on the census controlled by the new physicians subscribing to limited partnership units," as well as that of earlier investors, he wrote, "we believe we have more than sufficient physician support to meet our projections."
For months, the El Paso partnership plan directly linked investments by doctors and new admissions. One document explaining the partnership investments cited the example of a hypothetical doctor who could expect $41,538 annually on a $30,000 investment. That extraordinary return was mainly based on the assumption that the doctor would bring in $600,000 worth of patient business.
When the Texas Medical Association called that link unethical, Columbia dropped it.
In an April 1989 letter to Representative Pete Stark, a California Democrat critical of the partnerships, Mr. Scott defended the investments as intended solely "to improve the quality of health care services." He added, "There is no evidence that El Paso Healthcare System influenced the physicians to change their referral patterns."
That is not what the company's bankers thought. Even after the direct link between admissions and investment returns was dropped, the bankers saw the partnership as a key to filling beds. "Substantial cash flow is paid to physicians" through the partnerships, Mr. Wendling wrote in July 1989. "This is good in that it has helped boost volume."
Mr. Stark's outrage over that era of medical deal-making led him to write two laws sharply curtailing doctors' ability to invest in medical facilities where they refer patients.
But Columbia was able to continue offering investments because of an exemption in the Stark laws that lets doctors have stakes in hospitals, as opposed to enterprises like home health agencies and laboratories. The intent, in part, was to promote the growth of rural medical services. The company interpreted the exemption as allowing investments in hospital networks, effectively giving referring doctors ownership of services in which they could otherwise not invest. It is this aspect of the investments that Medicare authorities are investigating.
In Corpus Christi in 1992, the passage of the second Stark law appeared to imperil doctors' investment in a Columbia CAT-scan center. Partnership records show that Columbia folded the CAT-scan service into a local hospital, and traded the doctors' old shares for a new stake in the hospital.
"Indirect ownership didn't change anything," said Dr. James Thompson, an investor in the CAT-scan center.
And so, in Mr. Stark's view, Columbia has taken his law and "turned it upside down."

The Impact
A Debate Over Effect On Patient Care
When Columbia offered shares in Cedars in 1993, Dr. Howard Katzman and his partners invested $15,000. Turning a profit, the surgeon said, was not the point. "My group invested for one reason only: we felt it was important for us to show our dedication to the institution," he said. "It allows you to have some influence over the planning."
The investments usually work like this: Columbia sets up a partnership that owns a hospital or group of medical facilities; doctors with admitting privileges -- and a handful of administrators -- can buy up to 10 partnership units for $10,000 to $15,000 each, giving them aggregate ownership of up to 20 percent; as Columbia executives see fit, the doctors receive distributions from the hospitals' cash flow.
Some doctors claim returns of far more than their original investment in a few years; others say they would have done better buying Columbia stock. Doctors at Cedars say that last year a $15,000 investment led to a $4,000 payout -- a higher return than those seen by most investors in the stock market.
If doctors leave the hospital or are incapacitated and cannot practice, they must sell their shares back. If they divorce, they must sell. Columbia does not want any outsiders to have ownership.
The chairwoman of the American Medical Association, Dr. Nancy W. Dickey, said another aspect of the plans, limiting the offerings almost exclusively to doctors, appeared to violate the group's ethical guidelines.
Many experts say these limitations indicate Columbia's intentions: to influence behavior. Columbia executives say, though, that the investments are too small to affect doctors' medical decisions. They added that, with the huge growth of managed care, doctors have less ability to decide where their patients go.
His group's investment, Dr. Katzman said, "has not influenced where we put patients one speck." Dr. Averhoff, the Florida physician, said the investment had not altered her admissions either. She said any differences in her referral pattern stemmed from such factors as patients' preference and managed care agreements.
Because Columbia, citing privacy concerns, refuses to provide names of its doctor-investors, it is difficult to analyze whether investments change admitting patterns. But using limited records on file in Florida, The Times examined admission patterns of 62 investors at Cedars and Miami Heart, which both offered investments in 1993.
In order to best examine the effects of the investments, The Times sought to identify doctors who had not bought into previous Columbia partnerships. Admissions patterns of the 62 doctors indicated that they had no previous connection with two other hospitals with investment plans that were merged with Cedars and Miami Heart.
The study found that between 1992 and 1995, their annual referrals to the Columbia hospitals where they invested rose 13.4 percent, while their referrals elsewhere dropped 22.4 percent. Within the pattern, doctors' practices varied widely. Excluding the referrals from Dr. Enis, the high-admitting orthopedic surgeon, the pattern still held, with admissions to the investment hospitals increasing 6 percent over the period and decreasing by 11 percent to other hospitals.
David L. Manning, a Columbia vice president, produced a company study of University Medical Center in Tamarac, Fla., that he said showed that investments had not influenced admissions. He called the Times survey "highly questionable" and said it was based on "what appears to be a biased sample of physicians." The study was flawed, he said, because it did not account for such factors as physician specialty, the impact of managed care contracts and patient preferences.
But John Cuddeback, an associate professor of health policy at the University of Florida who developed a hospital "report card" for the state, said The Times had used criteria "well above" those employed in the medical industry for decision-making. The results, he said, established "some degree of evidence that there's a difference of behavior" that calls for further study.
To some, the reason for such changes is self-evident. "It's as if you go into a car diagnostic clinic and the guy also has a car-repair facility," said John T. Cusack, a lawyer for nonprofit hospitals. "Lots of times he's going to tell you the car has to be fixed."
But to others in the field, the investments can have subtler consequences. With doctors on Columbia's side, they say, it is easier for Mr. Scott to undertake the cost-cutting initiatives sweeping the industry. "He had to seduce the doctors to be on his side of the trench warfare so when he lays off some nurses they're not going to shoot at him, they're going to be with him," said Uwe Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton University. "Doctor investments were a key to that."

The Questions
Financial Favors Lead To a Doctor's Doubts
As investigators sift through documents seized from Columbia in El Paso, a stack of papers sits in a Houston courthouse, spelling out accusations of impropriety in Columbia's deals with physicians. The papers stem from a lawsuit brought by Dr. Thompson of Corpus Christi. In it, he contends that the company violates Medicare laws prohibiting kickbacks to doctors for their referrals.
The financial incentives spelled out in Dr. Thompson's lawsuits included cut-rate office space and far more. Columbia sent him on fishing and hunting trips. Columbia also sold him a $15,000 stake in its Corpus Christi network, he says, and gave him a $500-a-month no-show consulting job to pay for it.
"I was told that the consultant fee would go on until the investment cash was paid back," said Dr. Thompson, who produced copies of pay stubs. "There was nothing I did that merited a consulting fee."
The break point for him came after what he described as a Columbia favor to other doctors -- at his expense. Columbia let an obstetrics group bar all but obstetricians from delivering babies at the hospital. That shut out Dr. Thompson, whose practice heavily focused on obstetrics.
He consulted a lawyer and sued. In August, the case was dismissed on a technical ruling that did not address the substance of his allegations; he is appealing.
A number of influential parties have written briefs in his support, including Dr. Koop, Representative Stark and the Justice Department.
While none of those parties could attest to the truth behind Dr. Thompson's contentions, they forcefully spoke of the legal and public policy importance of the issues he raised. Columbia declined to comment because of the pending litigation.
But Dr. Thompson was left with simple questions. "It all makes you question every admitting decision you make," he said. "Am I doing this for the right reason, or am I doing this for the wrong reason? It is just kind of a burden to think about."
 
How the Study Was Done
 To analyze the behavior of physician investors in Florida, The New York Times obtained disclosure statements filed by Columbia/HCA hospitals with the State of Florida listing investors who referred patients to outpatient services.
It then matched these names against state and Federal physician license and identification numbers, and then against a file of more than 1.1 million patient discharge records in Dade County from 1992 to 1995.
The study focused on the behavior of new investors in a Columbia/HCA investment plan at two hospitals, Cedars Medical Center and the Miami Heart Institute. Because the company declined to provide any information about investors, the study used hospital records to select doctors who were attending physicians at these hospitals, but had no connection with two other hospitals where investment plans were already in place. About a third of all investors identified from disclosure forms were included.
The study may also have missed some doctors who invested in hospitals but were not listed on the Florida disclosure forms, and is subject to errors in the way hospitals listed investors and admitting physicians. JOSH BARBANEL

HEADLINE: Once the Hope of Secular Turks, Ex-Leader Is Now Widely Reviled

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Turkey, April 5

 BODY:
When Tansu Ciller became Prime Minister of Turkey in 1993, millions of Turks joined Western leaders in rejoicing. She seemed the ideal figure to lead her country toward the next century: an English-speaking economist, a woman in a Muslim country, and a dedicated secularist in a region where fundamentalism was making steady gains.
Much has changed in four years. Today Mrs. Ciller is Foreign Minister and a leading member of a coalition Government headed by a Muslim-based party. Many Turkish political leaders accuse her of forging the alliance to shield herself from a series of inquiries into her personal finances. 
 "They haven't formed a government partnership but a partnership in crime," asserted Mesut Yilmaz, the main opposition leader. Mr. Yilmaz was Prime Minister in a short-lived coalition with Mrs. Ciller that fell apart last spring after he indicated that the would support an investigation of the charges against her.
Parliamentary investigators, leading political figures and Turkish newspapers have been examining how Mrs. Ciller and her husband, Ozer Ciller, became multi-millionaires. They have raised questions about her statement that she inherited more than $1 million in cash and gold from her mother, a woman whose former neighbors have described as a penniless pensioner.
Mrs. Ciller's critics have also examined the purchase in 1992 of $1.5 million worth of properties in New Hampshire by an American company headed by her husband. They say Mr. and Mrs. Ciller enriched themselves through illicit use of Government funds in her years as Prime Minister from 1993 to 1996. Some opposition figures have even suggested that Mrs. Ciller once held American citizenship, which if true could complicate her political position here. They have sued in Federal court in New York to obtain her passport records.
While the United States has declined to confirm or deny the existence of such documents, it is fighting the legal action. The State Department has said that disclosing any foreign official's passport records could cause "great disadvantage, and perhaps personal and familial danger, abroad."
Mrs. Ciller has denied any wrongdoing. Tim Platt, her New Hampshire lawyer, said she has never held an American passport or been an American citizen. Mr. Platt also said her investments in the United States comply fully with American law.
Some aspects of Mrs. Ciller's rise to the status of a multi-millionaire, however, remain unclear. She has said, for example, that some of her wealth stems from wise investment of the $1.1 million inheritance from her mother, who died in 1995.
But neighbors of Muazzez Ciller said this week that she had lived near poverty in a shabby Istanbul apartment, and doubted that she could have left such a substantial sum.
"This poor woman was sick and barely had enough to eat," said one resident of the building where the elder Mrs. Ciller lived. "We used to do her shopping, wash her dishes and help her cook because she couldn't afford a maid. She got in trouble with the landlord because she was always late with the rent. If she had any money, I'm sure she would have used it to make her life a little easier."
Mr. Platt said that the elder Mrs. Ciller had made "personal and life style choices" not to spend her savings. "The fact that she held cash at home or in a safe deposit box is not inconsistent with the practice of people in her society at the time."
Questions about Mrs. Ciller's finances were of little interest outside Turkey until June, when she astonished many world leaders by agreeing to join in a coalition government with the Islamic-oriented Welfare Party. Until then she had bitterly attacked Welfare, calling it a fundamentalist threat and vowing never to cooperate with it.
Under the coalition agreement, the Welfare Party leader, Necmettin Erbakan, became Prime Minister and Mrs. Ciller became Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.
After the alliance was sealed, Mr. Erbakan's supporters in Parliament helped Mrs. Ciller defeat a series of proposals -- some of which they themselves had filed while in opposition -- that would have referred questions about her wealth to the Supreme Court.
The move in Parliament has led critics to charge that a deal has been struck under which Mrs. Ciller keeps the Welfare party in power and, in exchange, it protects her against judicial investigation.
Charges of corruption and abuse of power began to swirl around Mrs. Ciller as she ended her term as Prime Minister. In recent months the charges have become a major topic of public discussion. This year Mrs. Ciller has faced a series of parliamentary votes on charges that she illicitly diverted funds from several Government-owned companies, including an electric utility, an auto manufacturer and a hotel chain. The closest vote, however, came not on motions based directly on those charges but on one that asked the Supreme Court to investigate the source of her wealth.
Mrs. Ciller agreed to an interview in February to discuss the charges against her, but canceled it moments after Parliament voted 270-263 not to send charges against her to the Supreme Court. The vote was along party lines. Afterward her office provided a statement that said:
"The parliamentary commission conducted an extensive inquiry into Mrs. Ciller's finances, releasing publicly numerous confidential tax returns and financial documents which she provided voluntarily. The commission issued a report of over 300 pages and cleared her of any improprieties. The Parliament has confirmed that finding and the matter is now closed.
"Parliamentary inquiries into two other allegations, which were clearly of a political nature, have also resulted in a finding that she acted properly. She has been fully cleared of all charges. No other inquiries involving Mrs. Ciller are now pending."
Under Turkish law, Parliament cannot reopen any investigation within one year after it has been closed. But some Turks believe the charges against Mrs. Ciller will not fade away.
"These dossiers will be opened sooner or later and taken to an independent judiciary," predicted Mehmet Kececiler, deputy chairman of the opposition Motherland party.
Many former allies of Mrs. Ciller say they are furious at her for having formed a coalition with the Islamic party against which she had campaigned so strenuously. Among them is Husamettin Cindoruk, one of the patriarchs of Turkish politics, who is a former chairman of her True Path party and served as president of Parliament from 1991-95.
"Tansu Ciller is what allowed the Welfare party to come to power," Mr. Cindoruk said. "She agreed to form a coalition with Welfare because they promised they would shield her from investigations. This has brought great trouble to Turkey."
Mrs. Ciller has explained her decision to form the coalition Government by saying she serves as a check on Prime Minister Erbakan, assuring that he does not stray too far from Turkey's secular traditions. There is evidence that she has succeeded on several occasions. Mr. Erbakan, for example, has bowed to her wishes and dropped his proposal to allow female civil servants to wear veils or head scarves.
Aides to the Prime Minister have defended his decision to form a coalition with Mrs. Ciller. As the top vote-getter in the December 1995 election, he was at the center of bargaining to form a Government.
"He had the plurality, he was the No. 1 candidate," one senior official said today. "He was ready to form a coalition with anyone. He tried from the beginning with each party. He tried it first with Mesut Yilmaz, but it didn't work out. Then he took up the effort with Ciller."
Turkish news reports based on reviews of the Cillers' property holdings here, which include homes, apartment buildings and large plots of land, put their net worth in the tens of millions of dollars. Mrs. Ciller says that she and her husband built their fortune largely from the inheritance from her mother and another of several hundred thousand dollars from her father.
Among the Ciller family's investments was the purchase in the early 1990's of a Holiday Inn in Salem, N.H., and the Granite State Business Center in Hooksett, N. H. The property was bought by GCD, a New Hampshire company. Mr. Ciller and his family have a controlling interest in the company, according to Mr. Platt, the New Hampshire lawyer.
The $1 million purchase was paid for with five treasurer's checks, according to copies of the checks provided by the Turkish opposition. Mr. Platt declined to say how that money was raised, and whether it was borrowed.
Mrs. Ciller attended colleges and taught for a time in the United States, but she has steadfastly denied reports that she held a United States passport for a time. Her lawyer, Mr. Platt, said she could not have done so because she lived in the United States for less than the required five years.
A New York lawyer who represents a member of the Turkish parliamentary commission that investigated Mrs. Ciller, Jerrold L. Morgulas, has filed suit in Federal court seeking release of Mrs. Ciller's passport and immigration records. A Federal judge hearing the case expressed deep skepticism about that suit in a recent hearing.
In addition to the accusations of financial impropriety, Mrs. Ciller has been touched by one of the most serious scandals in recent Turkish history, which began unfolding in November when a senior police official was killed in a car crash along with a convicted heroin smuggler who was being sought by Interpol.
Also in the car was an influential member of Parliament from Mrs. Ciller's party. Questions about what they were doing together quickly resulted in the resignation of the Interior Minister, a close ally of Mrs. Ciller, and led to a series of disclosures about Government sponsorship of death squads during the last 20 years.
Several of the most spectacular "mystery killings" occurred while Mrs. Ciller was Prime Minister, and some politicians say they suspect that officials of her Government may have ordered or approved them. Many of the victims were suspected of maintaining ties to the separatist guerrilla army that calls itself the Kurdistan Workers Party, or P.K.K.
Evidence that has come to light since November suggests that senior Government officials approved such killings. There has been no proof that Mrs. Ciller was involved, but several political figures have publicly accused her.
"In November 1993 Mrs. Ciller said at a press conference that she had a list of businessmen, artists and other people who were helping the P.K.K.," said Esat Canan, who was a member of Parliament at the time. "She said she was going to eliminate this problem. After that, people started to get killed one after another. I think there is a connection. If she knew the names of people who were guilty of illegal acts, why didn't she have them brought to trial?"
This year, officials of several European governments have charged that Turkish drug traffickers seem to have enjoyed official protection. "There have been incidents where information definitely got back to drug dealers," said Tom Sackville, a British Home Office minister.
A German judge who was hearing a case against three accused Turkish heroin smugglers told reporters in January that he believed the smugglers had "personal contacts" with Mrs. Ciller. Pressed for details, he said he would give none until he issues his verdict.
The Turkish Foreign Ministry filed a diplomatic protest after the judge made his charge, describing it as "an unproven, unfounded, totally unacceptable allegation."

HEADLINE: In Fujimori's Peru, Economy Grows As a Democracy Is Left to Wither

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, April 5

 BODY:
On this day five years ago, President Alberto K. Fujimori stunned this country when he disbanded Congress and the courts to seize sweeping powers that he said were needed to end corruption and terrorism that were rampant in Peru.
While the rest of Latin America was abandoning military dictatorships, Mr. Fujimori deployed tanks and troops outside the Congress and the Palace of Justice, suspended the Constitution, and imposed harsh measures to combat terrorism and revive the faltering economy. 
 Today, despite the hostage crisis at the Japanese Ambassador's residence here, Peru is undeniably a safer, more economically viable country. Many Peruvians say they believe that those successes are the direct results of Mr. Fujimori's "autogolpe," or "self-coup."
But while Mr. Fujimori was overwhelmingly voted to a second term in 1995, many of his authoritarian policies remain in place.
The police have broad powers to arrest anyone they suspect of terrorism. People accused of terrorism are tried in military courts where there is no due process.
Many political experts say Peru is less democratic today than it was before Mr. Fujimori assumed emergency powers on April 5, 1992.
"Democracy before the coup was very weak in Peru, but five years later I am convinced it's even weaker," said Carlos Basombrio, director of the Legal Defense Institute, a leading human rights group.
"The legacy of Mr. Fujimori's coup," he said, "is that the Peruvian Army now has more autonomy than any military in Latin America, the judiciary is less independent and has more Draconian laws on the books, and there is no real political party system to speak of."
Many leading politicians and scholars here and abroad say that Mr. Fujimori could have accomplished his goals without abolishing constitutional rule and that by doing so he made Peru a country where power is heavily concentrated in the executive branch.
They cite the lack of civilian control over Peru's military, which Mr. Fujimori has repeatedly absolved of widespread human rights abuses committed during its crackdown on leftist rebels, and Peru's judicial system, which under Mr. Fujimori's control has convicted hundreds of Peruvians of terrorist acts and sentenced them to long jail terms.
"The way Mr. Fujimori sees the world is: 'We will do it my way or we won't do it at all,' " said David Scott Palmer, who teaches Latin American politics at Boston University.
"Compromise and negotiation are not part of Mr. Fujimori's calculation, and whether it comes to democracy or negotiating an end to the hostage takeover, his reactions are part of the same continuum that began with the imposing of martial law in 1992," Mr. Palmer said.
Indeed, some foreign diplomats and relatives of hostages who are being held by Marxist guerrillas here have expressed concern that Mr. Fujimori's autocratic style has been a major stumbling block in resolving the crisis, now nearly four months old.
Last week, mediators between the Peruvian Government and guerrillas reached the outline of a tentative agreement to end the standoff, by which the rebels would give up their captives and leave Peru in exchange for a chance at early parole for some of their jailed comrades.
But as the details of the pact were being worked out, Mr. Fujimori backed away from it. Diplomats familar with the talks said he had become concerned that he would appear to have given in to a major rebel demand -- freedom for their jailed colleagues.
"While we have respect for our President, we are worried that he has not learned how to compromise, especially when human lives are at stake," said the wife of a high-ranking Peruvian Government official who is being held hostage, speaking on condition of anonymity. "We are afraid that if Mr. Fujimori will not compromise, he could resort to a military solution."
Mr. Fujimori, whose office did not return telephone calls requesting an interview, has said that his actions in 1992 were the only way to save the country. He said Congress and the courts had refused to endorse reforms needed to fight terrorism.
Martha Chavez, a Congresswoman who is in Mr. Fujimori's party, said declaring martial law was the President's only feasible option five years ago because Congress was gridlocked and would have taken too long to approve the needed measures. "What Mr. Fujimori did five years ago was valiant, brave, and absolutely necessary to save Peru," she said. "Have we forgotten so quickly what life was like during that time? Bombs were exploding all around us. We were afraid to venture outside."
Mrs. Chavez said Mr. Fujimori's "coup" gave Peruvians hope that the Government could defeat terrorism, particularly in the provinces where civilian patrols were established with the military to resist guerrilla groups that were wrecking havoc on rural villages.
Opinion polls have shown that most Peruvians approved of Mr. Fujimori's dissolving of Congress and the courts, which were seen as corrupt and detached from the people. The President's popularity skyrocketed after the capture in September 1992 of Abimael Guzman Reynoso, leader of the Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla group, and the subsequent capture of 30 other leaders.
But many political analysts say that while Mr. Fujimori deserves much credit for curbing terrorism and revitalizing Peru's economy, those achievements have been incorrectly tied to his "self-coup."
"Mr. Fujimori has done an excellent job of convincing the Peruvian people that the coup was necessary to defeat terrorism and accomplish other reforms," said Cynthia McClintock, a professor of political science and expert in Latin America at George Washington University. "The truth is that long before the coup took place, the Congress and Mr. Fujimori were close to an agreement on the judicial and economic reforms and that the intelligence unit that would eventually capture the guerrilla leaders was already in place."
Mr. Fujimori's critics say he is beholden to the generals who backed him in 1992 and has failed to bring the military under full civilian control.
A former Cabinet member who is still close to Mr. Fujimori said the President wanted to replace Gen. Nicolas Hermoza, who has served as commander of the army since 1991, but that Mr. Fujimori cannot act because General Hermoza is revered within the armed forces and does not want to leave.
In return for the military's support, Mr. Fujimori persuaded Congress to pass a broad amnesty law last year absolving the military of human rights abuses committed during its fight against guerrillas.
"Fujimori and the military were partners in the coup d'etat -- they made a pact to govern together and keep each other happy," said Lourdes Flores Nano, a Congresswoman from the opposition Popular Christian Party.
"We say it's time to end this joint venture between the President and the military and allow free democratic rule," Miss Flores said. "So far, Mr. Fujimori has been unable to do this."

HEADLINE: THE RENT DEBATE: THE OVERVIEW;
Studies Suggest Tenants In Upscale Neighborhoods Would Be Hit the Hardest

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

 BODY:
Half a century after it was introduced and six weeks before it could pass into extinction, rent regulation in New York remains a thoroughly contested policy. Landlords and tenants disagree in fiercely emotional and often surprisingly personal terms not only about the system's philosophical merits, but also about how it actually works and what would happen if it expired.
Underlying their bitter differences, however, are some basic realities. 
 Landlords have suggested that the effects of deregulation on rents would be modest. Yet for many tenants, even a 10 percent rent increase could be significant. And a recent study of deregulation sponsored by a landlord association put the average increase for a rent-stabilized apartment at more than 13 percent.
Tenant groups have, for obvious political reasons, tried to portray the battle over the rent laws as one that affects residents of all neighborhoods of New York City, where most of the state's rent-regulated apartments are located. But the effects of lifting the rules that regulate 1.1 million apartments would clearly be felt disproportionately in different parts of the city.
In some of the city's poorest neighborhoods, rents might hardly be affected at all, while in the most fashionable areas, huge increases would be a virtual certainty. The same landlord-sponsored study predicts that rents would rise by almost 30 percent in Greenwich Village and by more than 50 percent on the Upper West Side.
Both sides acknowledge that rent regulation encourages tenants to stay put, even as they disagree sharply about whether this is a good thing. Landlords argue that many rent-regulated tenants hold onto apartments longer than they need to, which in turn causes shortages and forces other tenants to pay higher prices. Tenants argue that the lack of turnover promotes stability and preserves the complex texture of many New York neighborhoods.
Without rent regulation, "you would lose any kind of economic integration," Michael McKee, the rent law campaign manager for the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, said.
There have been battles over rent regulation in New York in the past, but few have been as fierce or as anxiety-ridden as the current one.
For the first time in recent memory, one of the state's legislative leaders, the Senate Majority Leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican of Rensselaer County, has declared his opposition to renewing the regulations. And Gov. George E. Pataki, whose position on the issue has often seemed purposefully ambiguous, has said that he is willing to allow the rent laws to lapse when they expire, or "sunset," on June 15.
Almost without exception, economists side with those who oppose rent regulation; artificially holding down the price of housing, they contend, inevitably limits the supply for everyone. Even liberal-leaning economists who favor some sort of housing subsidies see rent regulation as wrongheaded because it does not benefit those who need it most.
"Economists who don't think of themselves as conservative would still say this is a very inefficient way to redistribute income," Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, said.
At the same time, even many opponents of regulation acknowledge that lifting the rent laws alone will not solve New York's chronic housing shortage. Already, new buildings that have not received special tax breaks are not subject to rent regulation. Yet even in relatively good economic times, residential construction in New York has lagged behind that in other cities.
Perhaps just as significantly, economic principles and astute politics do not always go hand in hand, as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani demonstrated last week when he vowed to march with tenants in Albany. While there are many New Yorkers outside the system who might benefit from ending rent regulation, those inside the system care more about the issue and are better organized.
"The people who are harmed don't even know they're being harmed," Peter Salins, an urban economist who is provost of the State University of New York and an outspoken critic of rent regulation, said. "So they can't act as an interest group."

A Confusing Patchwork
A Mix of Laws Regulating Rents
 Although New York's rent laws are frequently lumped together under the term "rent control," the laws are actually a patchwork of state and city regulations of which rent control is only one piece. All told, the regulations cover roughly half of the city's rental apartments and 2.5 million tenants.
The city's rent laws cover two types of apartments. The first group, rent-controlled housing, covers apartments built before 1947 where the tenants have been in continuous occupancy since 1971; the definition of the word "continuous" is a flexible one. Many people in rent-controlled apartments pass them on -- both legally and illegally -- to relatives, people who tenants say are relatives, and even friends. According to the latest city housing survey, there are slightly more than 70,000 rent-controlled apartments left. Of all the regulated housing, these apartments tend to have the lowest rents.
The city's second category, rent-stabilized housing, covers apartments built between 1947 and 1968 as well as some more recent apartments for which landlords have sought special tax benefits. There are roughly 290,000 of these, and their rent increases are set each year by the Rent Guidelines Board. Last year, the board allowed increases of 5 percent for one-year leases and 7 percent for two-year leases.
It is the state, rather than the city, that regulates the largest group of apartments. These are apartments that were built before 1947 but no longer fall under rent control because the tenants have not been in continuous occupancy. There are roughly 760,000 such apartments in New York City, and another 60,000 in Nassau, Westchester and Rockland Counties. These are also known as rent-stabilized apartments, and in New York City their rent increases are also determined by the Rent Guidelines Board.
Together, the city and state have taken a few thousand apartments out of regulation under so-called "luxury decontrol," which went into effect in 1993. These are apartments with rents above $2,000 a month and tenants with annual incomes of more than $250,000.
Luxury decontrol has proved difficult to administer, and it is estimated that many apartments eligible for decontrol are still, in fact, under rent regulation.
Just last week, Mayor Giuliani, with a great flourish, signed a bill extending the city's rent regulations for three more years. At this point it is unclear how the city's regulations would be affected if state rent regulations were allowed to expire.

After Deregulation
In Manhattan, Rents Could Rise Sharply
Mary Sibak, 60, has lived with her husband in a one-bedroom apartment in Hell's Kitchen for 36 years. Her rent is $171 a month. She does not work, and her husband, who is employed in a warehouse, brings home less than $400 a week, she said.
Standing outside her building, on 44th Street between 9th and 10th Avenues, Mrs. Sibak said she had heard about the debate in Albany and was deeply distressed. "The day they raise the rent is going to be just terrible," she said. "People are going to be on the streets."
Rent regulation is often debated on an anecdotal level. But for every anecdote about a Hollywood star who keeps a rent-controlled pied-a-terre, there is a string of stories about people like Mrs. Sibak, who have held onto their apartments simply because they cannot afford to leave.
"Where are you going to move?" Mrs. Sibak asked.
That ending rent regulation would have a significant impact on a neighborhood like Hell's Kitchen, and indeed throughout midtown and lower Manhattan, is beyond question. The reasons are to a certain extent obvious: the more desirable the location, the more pressure on rents.
The city's own research shows that rent regulation has held down rents in Manhattan more than anywhere else.
According to the city's most recent housing survey, the median unregulated rent in Manhattan in 1993 was $1,030 a month. By comparison, the median was $400 a month for a rent-controlled apartment and $620 a month for a rent-stabilized apartment. In the Bronx, the median unregulated rent was $600 a month, while the median rent-controlled rent was $349, and the median rent-stabilized rent was $450.
Manhattan also has a disproportionately large number of rent-regulated apartments; roughly a third of all stabilized units are in Manhattan.
But how the effects of ending rent regulation, or phasing it out through so-called vacancy decontrol, would play out through the rest of the city is more difficult to gauge.
This difficulty is perhaps best illustrated by the very different results predicted by two recent studies. Both were sponsored by the Rent Stabilization Association, the city's largest landlord association.
The first study predicts that, under deregulation, the typical stabilized rent in midtown and lower Manhattan would increase by 6 percent, or $43 a month.
Throughout the city, in all five boroughs, the typical stabilized rent would rise by only 2 percent, or $7 a month, this report argues.
The second study assumes that deregulation would compel landlords to spend significantly to upgrade apartments, and it reaches a dramatically different conclusion about the impact on rents.
That study predicts that in the first several years following deregulation, the average rent of a former rent-stabilized apartment in Manhattan would rise by $175 a month, or 22 percent.
Meanwhile, it forecasts that the average stabilized rent citywide would increase by 13 percent, or $90 a month.
Tenant groups argue that both studies probably understate the impact of deregulation. And they further contend that what matters is not only the size of the increases but also the income of the tenants affected.
"Yes, there's a bigger spread in Manhattan," Mr. McKee, of the Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, said.
"But that doesn't mean there's no difference outside of Manhattan. And for the people who are living in those neighborhoods, it's a very significant difference."

Lessons of 1974
A Brief Experiment With Rent Decontrol
 New York is one of the few remaining cities in the country that still has rent regulation; most municipalities got rid of their systems after World War II. Boston, another long holdout, lifted its controls in 1994.
But at least in theory, even in New York rent regulation has always been considered temporary, as the continual "sunsetting" of the rent laws attests.
In 1971, New York briefly experimented with ending rent regulation; under a measure passed by the State Legislature that year, all apartments under rent regulation were to be deregulated as soon as the existing tenants moved out. The experiment, however, was short-lived; in 1974, the Legislature passed the Emergency Tenant Protection Act, which placed formerly rent-controlled apartments under state rent stabilization.
As with most every other aspect of rent regulation, the effects of this experiment are hotly contested.
The experiment took place during a time of increasing inflation and rising fuel prices, and many argue that it was too short to draw any reliable conclusions from it. Nonetheless, the experiment has had -- and continues to have -- a significant impact on the debate.
A 1974 report by a commission headed by then-Assemblyman Andrew Stein argued that the experiment was a failure, Decontrol, the report maintained, had caused rents to shoot up, but had "neither stimulated new building construction" nor "spurred renovation." Tenant groups continue to cite this report as evidence that deregulation would lead to price-gouging but little improvement in the city's housing.
Landlords, however, maintain that the Stein Commission misrepresented its own findings. They continue to point to a rise in new construction in 1972 as a sure sign that housing in New York would improve as a result of decontrol.
The Stein Commission, according to the Rent Stabilization Association, "reached conclusions based on a political agenda, and not on the facts."

Charts/Maps: "Rent Regulation: A Citywide Portrait"
New York's 50-year-old system of rent regulation will expire in June unless the State Legislature extends it. As city, state and census data make clear, the stakes are huge: more than a million apartments are regulated. But the impact of regulation varies widely, from borough to borough and income level to income level. Charts show percentage of housing that is regulated.

A Referee Draws Her Line on the Court

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON 

 BODY:
THE maiden challenge came in the very first summer pro league game, when one overgrown adolescent took exception to a foul. The complaint began with "Man," ended with "call," and in between contained a couple of four-letter embellishments, which the referee intuitively knew could not be ignored.
"Technical foul," the ref said, index finger targeting the culprit, who was only about to make things worse. 
 "What's a woman doing here anyway?" he whined.
Dee Kantner's explanation was dismissively short and sweet.
"I am, you're not," she said. "You're gone."
As power doesn't necessarily beget respect, 36-year-old Dee Kantner understands that her prospective employment as one of two female officiating pioneers in the National Basketball Association next season is likely to be a tricky business. She and 32-year-old Violet Palmer of Los Angeles, both of whom called last Sunday's Old Dominion-Tennessee women's national championship game, are scheduled to join a group of professional martyrs trained to take much abuse, but not too much.
It is difficult enough for men working men's games to make split-second decisions on when the line of fair comment has been crossed. Next season, Kantner and Palmer will establish the guidelines for women. Actually, they will make them up as they go along.
"Hopefully," Kantner said from her home in Charlotte, N.C., "I'm intelligent enough to determine whether it is respectful or disrespectful."
In developmental leagues and two N.B.A. preseason games last fall, Kantner considered it just part of the banter and byplay when players addressed her as Legs, or complained about a "women's call," or when one player impishly pleaded with her that "we need a little lovin' down at the other end."
She does not expect players and coaches to be gender blind. "Off the floor, they can open the door for me, I don't care," she said. "On the floor, I just want to be recognized as someone doing the job."
That this would even be an issue for Kantner or Palmer, that we have nearly reached the millennium without a woman's officiating a major men's sport, speaks to a mind-set of fatuous denial. If players don't believe that women can effectively officiate their games, how do they explain that so many of them, as products of single-parent homes, have had lives totally dependent on Mom?
Come to think of it, there may be one person on the face of the planet who, in the heat of battle, might be spared Anthony Mason's evil eye. His mother, Mary.
That said, competence and acceptance are two different things. These last couple of years have on various basketball levels brought outrageous and thuggish abuses of officials. Are kids imitating what they have seen Dennis Rodman and Nick Van Exel -- to name two N.B.A. ref-strikers -- do on television, or does the N.B.A. merely reflect a young America that is awash in violent imagery, in many cases beginning at home?
Probably both. For sure, the N.B.A.'s rowdy young have been influenced by a rap culture that is often degrading to women, which may help explain why Kenny Anderson, during the Chicago-Portland preseason game, reportedly responded to a foul call by telling Kantner to keep her eyes on the game and off his pants.
Kantner said she recognized that Anderson "was clearly testing her." The following morning, she picked up a Chicago newspaper to discover that Michael Jordan (female consumers, take note) was just as clearly judging her.
"Too slow," Commissioner Jordan opined. "She got in the way."
"The one time I got in the way, I had no place to go," Kantner said. She added that if her quickness were an issue, then bring on her male counterparts. She'd be happy to race.
One person's good call is another's grounds for protest. Officiating, Kantner knows, is a far more interpretive craft than her day job as an engineering sales rep. But there is one component to her "game" that she will not even debate, and that is conditioning.
It is a source of pride for a 5-foot-8-inch, 145-pound multisport athlete who attended the University of Pittsburgh on a field hockey scholarship. And it is one reason Dale Brown, who recently retired as Louisiana State coach, invited her at the 1991 National Sports Festival to officiate an exhibition that fall between L.S.U. and Australia. Ground was broken and, before long, she was in an N.B.A. officials camp, she and 75 men.
At the women's Final Four, Tennessee's Pat Summitt said she did not see coaching men as a "step up." Summitt, a five-time national champion, earns more than Tennessee's men's coach. Juggling her sales job with about 80 major college women's games a season, Kantner has spent a good part of the last 10 years working on five or six hours' sleep. This is about better opportunity, for her and -- with many N.B.A. officials facing tax evasion charges and possible unemployment -- perhaps for others like her.
"People say, 'Do you know what you're in for?' " she said. "I say, 'Let's hope I'm not completely shell-shocked.' "
That is just her little joke. She expresses supreme confidence and talks of her "responsibility" to the N.B.A.'s call as if it is a calling. The players may answer her calls, too, as long as they do so with respect.

HEADLINE: Town Pins Hopes on Superfund Site

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS 

DATELINE: ANACONDA, Mont., April 4

 BODY:
When the last vestiges of copper mining and smelting here closed in 1980, left behind were a towering smokeless smokestack, hundreds of unemployed smelter workers and a landscape strewn with a century's worth of hazardous waste.
Now revitalization efforts are under way. This company town without a company is not looking toward copper to breathe life back into its languishing economy, however, or any other kind of mining, for that matter. 
 It is looking at golf.
As the fairways and tees green up next month, an $11 million, 200-acre golf course designed by Jack Nicklaus will open in this down-at-the-heels industrial town of about 10,000 people.
It is an unlikely place for such state-of-the-art golfing. The 18-hole course is sandwiched between a low-income housing project and the Cedar Lanes Bowling Alley, beneath the mountains on the edge of town that have been denuded by decades of noxious smelter fumes.
Anaconda sits about a mile in elevation and its winters are long. There is still a little snow on the course. Major markets are a long way off; the nearest metropolitan area with a population of one million is Salt Lake City, about 500 miles away. The whole state of Montana has fewer than 900,000 people.
Even more unusual is that the undulating course is part of the reclamation of an Environmental Protection Administration Superfund site and sits on top of the ruins of the old smelter. In fact, the Old Works Golf Course has an industrial smelting theme that carries right down to the black slag, or smelting waste, used in the bunkers and the cranes and old heavy equipment scattered around the grounds.
"It's the first Superfund golf course," said Derf Soller, superintendent of the course for Golden Bear Club Services, which is owned by Mr. Nicklaus and which manages the course. "It's absolutely safe. It's a low-level Superfund site. It's not radioactive. The metals in the soil are inert and the whole site has been capped."
Reclamation of the site cost $30 million and was paid for by the Atlantic Richfield Company, which bought the Anaconda Copper Mining Company in the 1980's. Elaborate steps have been taken, with consultation by the E.P.A., to make sure arsenic and heavy metals in the soil do not affect people and do not get washed off the course to contaminate nearby Warm Springs Creek. Sheets of plastic lie under the fairways, bunkers and greens, and all water drains into a contained artificial lake. Most of the ground was covered with crushed limestone, which in turn was capped with 16 to 18 inches of clay and which was then covered with six to eight inches of sand.
"It's safe," said Charlie Coleman, project manager for the site for the E.P.A. Making a golf course on a Superfund site, he said, is part of a trend toward using reclaimed land, rather than just fencing it off.
"You can't just pick up this volume of waste and move it somewhere," Mr. Coleman said. "It's too expensive. Our goal is to make these properties useful."
Despite the improvements, great care was taken to keep the flavor of the days of the smelter intact.
The greens and fairways, for example, lie on land that stretches in front of the ruins of two 19th-century smelters. The ore mined from the "Richest Hill On Earth" by the Anaconda company in Butte, 26 miles away, was hauled here for processing. The brick clubhouse has been built in a style of local historic architecture, and replica period street lights are being placed in the parking lot. Each hole bears the name of something to do with the smelter, such as Crusher, Silver Mill, Flue No. 5, Slum House and Anode.
Parts of the course sit on top of "heap roast" piles, mounds of charred, coal-black rock that were set afire decades ago to reduce ore into copper.
The sand traps, or bunkers, meanwhile, are actually called slag bunkers. The fill came from a mammoth pile of coal-colored residue left over from the days of the giant smelter. "The ball sits up on it real nice," Mr. Soller said. "Jack thought it was great."
The brick stack from the smelter towers over the town and the course. The smelter itself has been torn down.
The new economic course Anaconda is charting is a symbol of change in the West these days.
As mining and other traditional heavy industries diminish, towns are hoping to cash in on the booming tourist business.
Anaconda needs a ray of light in its bleak economy. The population of Deer Lodge County, of which Anaconda is the largest city, has dropped from a peak of almost 19,000 people in 1960 to 10,000 today. Numerous historic brick buildings from the 1800's sit boarded up and abandoned.
It remains to be seen whether the course, which is one of three in the area, will help the local economy much, and so far it has not sparked much new development. There are only about 50 motel rooms in town.
Mr. Soller is optimistic. More than two million tourists travel between Glacier and Yellowstone National Parks on nearby Interstate 90 in the summer, he said.
And with the greens fee for 18 holes around $28, the course should be a draw. Most Nicklaus-designed courses cost $70 to $100, Mr. Soller said.
Bill Edwards, the owner of the Cedar Lanes Bowling Alley, said it certainly could not hurt his business. "The summer months are slow for bowling," Mr. Edwards said, above the din of the crash of pins. "We've been out here in the middle of nowhere for a long time. This should bring a lot more people."

HEADLINE: THE RENT DEBATE: BATTLE;
War of Nerves in Albany

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 5

 BODY:
Thousands of frightened and angry tenants are expected to swell the marbled corridors of the State Capitol in the coming week, demanding a stay of execution for the laws that limit rent increases on one million apartments in New York City and its suburbs.
Few issues in recent decades have generated such fear and loathing toward state government, since few issues so directly touch so many people, most of whom live in New York City. A change or a lapse in the regulations -- which are scheduled to expire after June 15 -- could cause rents to rise for thousands, perhaps millions, of tenants, undoubtedly straining the ability of many to stay in their homes. 
 With Albany's leaders vehemently at odds over whether to extend, revise or abolish the laws, there have been no negotiations, no offers of compromise -- just threats from Republicans to let the laws expire and demands from Democrats to keep them unchanged.
Most economists say that the rules hold down the housing supply, but opponents of deregulation contend that they keep neighborhoods stable. A middle ground seems unreachable. And tenants' anxieties are growing.
But in that anxiety lies the key to understanding the political strategies driving the rent war. Combatants on all sides are out to harness people's fears, trying to put the mounting panic to their best political use. Which raises the all-important question: who will use it most effectively, and who will be burned trying?
Leading the charge for opponents of the laws has been the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, an ardent advocate of deregulation who has called for ending rent protections over the next two years, except for the elderly, disabled and poor. With characteristic hyperbole, he has described rent regulations as more destructive to New York City than an atom bomb explosion and has predicted that lifting rent restrictions will spur developers to build new apartments and rehabilitate old ones by the thousands.
Mr. Bruno and other Senate Republicans received more than $200,000 in campaign contributions from groups representing landlords last year, though he says those donations did not influence his stance against rent restrictions.
Mr. Bruno, a Republican of Rensselaer County, has threatened to let the existing rent laws expire after June 15 if his demands for their abolition two years from now are not met -- something he can singlehandedly do by blocking any bill in the Senate that would extend the rules.
If Mr. Bruno succeeds, the rent protections that now benefit more than two million New Yorkers would expire after June 15. That does not mean rents would immediately go up, but once leases expire, landlords could begin the process of raising rents to market levels.
Though Mr. Bruno has said repeatedly that he did not want to frighten anyone, it is patently clear that fear is at the core of his strategy. He is, after all, counting on Democrats -- who are the laws' staunchest defenders -- to come limping to the bargaining table out of pure dread that the rules will lapse.
There, he hopes, they will accept this bargain: that weakened protections are better than no protections.
Mr. Bruno underlines this strategy almost every time he speaks on the issue by reiterating his intention to let the laws die after June 15. The Democratic-controlled Assembly has already passed legislation to extend rent controls, but of course it takes both houses to pass a law (as well as the Governor's signature).
On Monday, Democrats in the Republican-controlled Senate say they will move to bring a bill extending the rent laws to the Senate floor; Mr. Bruno has said he will block it, which would reinforce his threat to let the laws expire in June, unless Democrats bow to his will.
Asked in a recent interview what would happen if the Democrats failed to take his threat seriously, he replied, "If they are stupid enough to do that, they will make the biggest mistake that they have made this year."
He added that the Democrats "have tested me a number of times," and lost.
Not that Assembly Democrats are without considerable power. They can -- and clearly will, if necessary -- hold up the budget and every piece of legislation pending in Albany this session if Mr. Bruno refuses to consider a compromise on rent protections.
The Democrats also believe that tenants' fears will work to their political advantage. Not by moving Mr. Bruno, whose power base is upstate and who has little to lose by alienating New York City tenants, but by pressuring Gov. George E. Pataki to rein in the majority leader, his fellow Republican.
Mr. Pataki, the Democrats reason, wants to expand his very small base of support in New York City in preparation for his 1998 re-election campaign. Gutting or abolishing the rent laws will cause a huge backlash against the Governor, and his political handlers will simply not accept that, the Democrats contend. And the Democrats have made it clear that they will do their best to focus blame on the Governor.
Mr. Pataki won office in 1994 with scant support from New York City voters, and might again. But that is always a risk, especially since the large turnout upstate in the last election was unusual and Mr. Pataki, who won the vast majority of upstate votes, probably cannot count on either the large turnout or such overwhelming support again. And he is said to harbor higher political aspirations; unpopularity in New York City would presumably not help his future.
"If the laws expire, it will be the Governor's inaction that brings that out," said the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver of Manhattan, the Legislature's most powerful Democrat, in a recent interview.
Of the three leaders, Mr. Pataki is, in many ways, in the most awkward spot. He is under growing pressure from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has been speaking out more forcefully on the matter, to preserve the laws. Even Mr. Pataki's political patron, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato -- who is also up for re-election next year -- has criticized Mr. Bruno for stoking the public's fears.
But that fear could work to the Governor's benefit, as well. Mr. Pataki has tried to cast himself as a mediator, the lone moderate capable of finding a middle ground -- even though his long-term support for ending rent controls on vacant apartments puts him much closer to Mr. Bruno's end of the spectrum than Mr. Silver's.
Under Mr. Pataki's script, public panic will make it easier for him to push for a compromise -- and, in the end, appear the savior for millions of tenants. "He's saying, 'When it's time for the cavalry, I'll come riding in,' " said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute in Hamden, Conn. "He'll be John Wayne."
But the political risks are also much greater for Mr. Pataki. Voters almost always blame governors more than legislators for Albany's failures -- so he is more likely to be the target of tenants' wrath if the rent laws lapse or are severely weakened.
The Governor's aides say he is fully aware of the Democrats' strategy to hold him accountable for changes to the laws. But they say Mr. Pataki will not be pressured into simply extending the rules because he believes they should be gradually phased out -- though he has refused to say exactly how.
As if to send a message to the Democrats that he will not blink first as the June 15 deadline approaches, Mr. Pataki said recently, "I hope it doesn't take something like the expiration of laws to force serious negotiations. But if it does, it does."
With all sides locked into a game of chicken, there have been no negotiations, nor even talk about holding negotiations. Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver have not budged from their positions and Mr. Pataki has been keeping mum on his, trying leave himself wiggle room for a final compromise.
But what that compromise might be is anyone's guess. Several possibilities float on the horizon. One option is to expand the policy known as luxury decontrol, where controls are ended for more expensive apartments rented by wealthier people.
Another is moving toward the type of system now used in Los Angeles, where restrictions on rent increases apply to occupied apartments, but rents are allowed to jump to market rate whenever units are vacated.
These are things no one is willing to discuss because no one wants to be perceived as caving in to the other side. The battle lines are drawn, the combatants frozen in place, waiting for someone else to move first. And tenants sit on the sidelines, biting their nails.
"This is all designed to make tenants and their supporters panic and give in and swallow some poison-pill amendment," said Michael McKee, director of the rent-regulation campaign for the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition. "And we are prepared to fight right through the summer if we have to."

HEADLINE: Donald E. Maude, 55, Economist Known as Inflation Policy Expert

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
Donald E. Maude, chief economist of the United States unit of Scotia Capital Markets in Toronto and a former senior economist for Merrill Lynch, died on March 27 at New York Downtown Hospital. He was 55.
The cause of his death was a heart attack, his wife, Kathleen Gustos Maude of Shrewsbury, N.J., said. 
 Mr. Maude first gained attention as a financial economist in the late 1970's, when rising oil prices and tightening credit sent the nation's economy into one of the most turbulent periods of the postwar era. From 1978 to 1984, as he rose to the post of chief financial economist at what is now Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, Mr. Maude was frequently sought out by the news media for commentary on the effects of the Federal Reserve's anti-inflation campaign on financial markets.
As the economy became less unsettled in the mid-80's, the employment prospects for financial economists became more so, and Mr. Maude held positions at several Wall Street firms before finally joining Scotia Capital Markets in 1992. At Scotia, owned by the Bank of Nova Scotia, he was chief United States economist and a member of the board of Scotia Capital Markets (U.S.A.) Inc., its American subsidiary.
He continued to be sought out by the financial media for his views on economic developments, and appeared frequently as a guest commentator on "Wall Street Week With Louis Rukeyser" and on CNBC, the financial news cable channel.
Mr. Maude, a resident of Shrewsbury, was a former member of the board of trustees of Monmouth College, where he received his undergraduate degree in business administration in 1963. He received his master's in economics from the University of Missouri in 1965.
Mr. Maude was a member of the Money Marketeers of New York University, the Downtown Business Economics Club and the National Association of Economists.
Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Kevin L. Maude, and a daughter, Alison K. Maude, both of Shrewsbury; a brother, Lawrence P. Maude of Fort Washington, Pa., and a sister, Judith M. Steiner, of Miami.

HEADLINE: Allen Ginsberg, Master Poet Of Beat Generation, Dies at 70

BYLINE: By WILBORN HAMPTON

 BODY:
Allen Ginsberg, the poet laureate of the Beat Generation whose "Howl!" became a manifesto for the sexual revolution and a cause celebre for free speech in the 1950's, eventually earning its author a place in America's literary pantheon, died early yesterday. He was 70 and lived in the East Village, in Manhattan.
He died of liver cancer at his apartment, Bill Morgan, a friend and the poet's archivist, said. 
 Mr. Morgan said that Mr. Ginsberg wrote right to the end. "He's working on a lot of poems, talking to old friends," Mr. Morgan said on Friday. "He's in very good spirits. He wants to write poetry and finish his life's work."
William S. Burroughs, one of Mr. Ginsberg's lifelong friends and a fellow Beat, said that Mr. Ginsberg's death was "a great loss to me and to everybody."
"We were friends for more than 50 years," Mr. Burroughs said. "Allen was a great person with worldwide influence. He was a pioneer of openness and a lifelong model of candor. He stood for freedom of expression and for coming out of all the closets long before others did. He has influence because he said what he believed. I will miss him."
As much through the strength of his own irrepressible personality as through his poetry, Mr. Ginsberg provided a bridge between the Underground and the Transcendental. He was as comfortable in the ashrams of Indian gurus in the 1960's as he had been in the Beat coffeehouses of the preceding decade.
A ubiquitous presence at the love-ins and be-ins that marked the drug-oriented counterculture of the Flower Children years, Mr. Ginsberg was also in the vanguard of the political protest movements they helped spawn. He marched against the war in Vietnam, the C.I.A. and the Shah of Iran, among other causes.
If his early verse shocked Eisenhower's America with its celebration of homosexuality and drugs, his involvement in protests kept him in the public eye and fed ammunition to his critics. But through it all, Mr. Ginsberg maintained a sort of teddy bear quality that deflected much of the indignation he inspired.
He was known around the world as a master of the outrageous. He read his poetry and played finger cymbals at the Albert Hall in London; he was expelled from Cuba after saying he found Che Guevara "cute"; he sang duets with Bob Dylan, and he chanted "Hare Krishna" on William F. Buckley Jr.'s television program. As the critic John Leonard observed in a 1988 appreciation: "He is of course a social bandit. But he is a nonviolent social bandit."
Or as the narrator in Saul Bellow's "Him With His Foot in His Mouth" said of Mr. Ginsberg: "Under all this self-revealing candor is purity of heart. And the only authentic living representative of American Transcendentalism is that fat-breasted, bald, bearded homosexual in smeared goggles, innocent in his uncleanness."
J. D. McClatchy, a poet and the editor of The Yale Review, said yesterday: "Ginsberg was the best-known American poet of his generation, as much a social force as a literary phenomenon.
"Like Whitman, he was a bard in the old manner -- outsized, darkly prophetic, part exuberance, part prayer, part rant. His work is finally a history of our era's psyche, with all its contradictory urges."
Allen Ginsberg was born on June 3, 1926, in Newark and grew up in Paterson, N.J., the second son of Louis Ginsberg, a schoolteacher and sometime poet, and the former Naomi Levy, a Russian emigree and fervent Marxist. His brother, Eugene, named for Eugene V. Debs, also wrote poetry, under the name Eugene Brooks. Eugene, a lawyer, survives.
Recalling his parents in a 1985 interview, Mr. Ginsberg said:
"They were old-fashioned delicatessen philosophers. My father would go around the house either reciting Emily Dickinson and Longfellow under his breath or attacking T. S. Eliot for ruining poetry with his 'obscurantism.' My mother made up bedtime stories that all went something like: 'The good king rode forth from his castle, saw the suffering workers and healed them.' I grew suspicious of both sides."

An Authorization For a Lobotomy
Allen Ginsberg's mother later suffered from paranoia and was in and out of mental hospitals; Mr. Ginsberg signed an authorization for a lobotomy. Two days after she died in 1956 in Pilgrim State Hospital on Long Island, he received a letter from her that said: "The key is in the window, the key is in the sunlight in the window -- I have the key -- get married Allen don't take drugs. . . . Love, your mother."
Three years after her death, Mr. Ginsberg wrote "Kaddish for Naomi Ginsberg (1894-1956)," an elegy that many consider his finest poem.
Strange now to think of you, gone without corsets & eyes, while I walk on the sunny pavement of Greenwich Village,
downtown Manhattan, clear winter noon, and I've been up all night, talking, talking, reading the Kaddish aloud, listening to Ray Charles blues shout blind on the phonograph
the rhythm, the rhythm -- and your memory in my head three years after -- . . .
"Kaddish" burnished a reputation that had been forged with the publication of "Howl!" three years earlier. The two works established Mr. Ginsberg as a major voice in what came to be known as the Beat Generation of writers.
Mr. Ginsberg's journey to his place as one of America's most celebrated poets began during his college days. He first attended Montclair State College. But in 1943, he received a small scholarship from the Young Men's Hebrew Association of Paterson and enrolled at Columbia University. He considered becoming a lawyer like his brother, but was soon attracted to the literary courses offered by Mark Van Doren and Lionel Trilling, and switched his major from pre-law to literature.
At Columbia he fell in with a crowd that included Jack Kerouac, a former student four years his senior, Lucien Carr and William Burroughs, and later, Neal Cassady, a railway worker who had literary aspirations. Together they formed the nucleus of what would become the Beats.
Kerouac and Carr became the poet's mentors, and Kerouac and Cassady became his lovers. It was also at Columbia that Mr. Ginsberg began to experiment with mind-altering drugs like LSD, which would gain widespread use in the decade to follow and which Mr. Ginsberg would celebrate in his verse along with his homosexuality and his immersion in Eastern transcendental religions.
But if the Beats were creating literary history around Columbia and the West End Cafe, there was a dangerous undercurrent to their activities. Mr. Carr spent a brief time in jail for manslaughter, and Mr. Ginsberg, because he had associated with Mr. Carr, was suspended from Columbia for a year.
In 1949, after Mr. Ginsberg had received his bachelor's degree, Herbert Huncke, a writer and hustler, moved into his apartment and stored stolen goods there. Mr. Huncke was eventually jailed, and Mr. Ginsberg, pleading psychological disability, was sent to a psychiatric institution for eight months. At the institution, he met another patient, Carl Solomon, whom Mr. Ginsberg credited with deepening his understanding of poetry and its power as a weapon of political dissent.

Becoming a Protege Of the Poet Williams
Returning home to Paterson, Mr. Ginsberg became a protege of William Carlos Williams, the physician and poet, who lived nearby. Williams's use of colloquial American language in his poetry was a major influence on the young Mr. Ginsberg.
After leaving Columbia, Mr. Ginsberg first went to work for a Madison Avenue advertising agency. After five years, he once recalled, he found himself taking part in a consumer-research project trying to determine whether Americans preferred the word "sparkling" or "glamorous" to describe ideal teeth. "We already knew people associate diamonds with 'sparkling' and furs with 'glamorous,' " he said. "We spent $150,000 to learn most people didn't want furry teeth."
The poet said he decided to give up the corporate world "when my shrink asked me what would make me happy." He hung his gray flannel suit in the closet and went to San Francisco with six months of unemployment insurance in his pocket. San Francisco was then the center of considerable literary energy. He took a room around the corner from City Lights, Lawrence Ferlinghetti's bookstore and underground publishing house, and began to write.
During this period, Mr. Ginsberg also became part of the San Francisco literary circle that included Kenneth Rexroth -- an author, critic and painter -- Gary Snyder, Michael McClure, Philip Whalen, Robert Duncan and Philip Lamantia. He also met Peter Orlovsky, who would be his companion for the next 30 years.
His first major work from San Francisco was "Howl!" The long-running poem expressed the anxieties and ideals of a generation alienated from mainstream society. "Howl!," which was to become Mr. Ginsberg's most famous poem, was dedicated to Solomon, and begins:
I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,
dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,
angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night. . . .
Mr. Ginsberg read the poem to a gathering arranged by Mr. Rexroth, and those present never forgot the poem, its author or the occasion.
Mr. Rexroth's wife privately distributed a mimeographed 50-copy edition of "Howl!" and in 1956, Mr. Ferlinghetti published "Howl! and Other Poems" in what he called his "pocket poets series."
With its open and often vivid celebration of homosexuality and eroticism, "Howl!" was impounded by United States Customs agents and Mr. Ginsberg was tried on obscenity charges.
After a long trial, Judge Clayton Horn ruled that the poem was not without "redeeming social importance."
The result was to make "Howl!" immensely popular and establish it as a landmark against censorship. The outrage and furor did not stop with the sexual revolution. As late as 1988, the radio station WBAI refused to allow "Howl!" to be read on the air during a weeklong series about censorship in America.
There were almost as many definitions of Beatniks and the Beat movement as there were writers who claimed to be part of it. As John Clellan Holmes described it, "To be beat is to be at the bottom of your personality looking up." But if the movement grew out of disillusionment, it was disillusionment with a conscience.
Mr. Ginsberg tried to explain the aims of the Beats in a letter to his father in 1957: "Whitman long ago complained that unless the material power of America were leavened by some kind of spiritual infusion, we would wind up among the 'fabled damned.' We're approaching that state as far as I can see. Only way out is individuals taking responsibility and saying what they actually feel. That's what we as a group have been trying to do."
On another occasion, he described the literary rules more succinctly: "You don't have to be right. All you have to do is be candid." Mr. Ginsberg was nothing if not candid.
As he wrote in "America," another 1956 poem, which took aim at Eisenhower's post-McCarthy era:
America I've given you all and now I'm nothing
America two dollars and twentyseven cents January 17, 1956
. . .
America this is quite serious
America this is the impression I get from looking in the television set
America is this correct?
. . .
Mr. Ginsberg said the poets who formed the prime influence on his own work were William Blake, Walt Whitman, Ezra Pound and Williams. He declared he had found a new method of poetry. "All you have to do," he said, "is think of anything that comes into your head, then arrange in lines of two, three or four words each, don't bother about sentences, in sections of two, three or four lines each."
His disdain for poetry's traditional rules only gave ammunition to his critics. James Dickey once complained that the "problem" with Allen Ginsberg was that he made it seem as if anybody could write poetry.

Traveling Widely For Two Decades
Mr. Ginsberg used the celebrity he gained with "Howl!" to travel widely during the next two decades. He went to China and India to study with gurus and Zen masters and to Venice to see Pound. On his way home, he was crowned King of the May by dissident university students in Prague, only to be expelled by the Communist Government. He read his poetry wherever he was allowed, from concert stages to off-campus coffeehouses.
He was in the forefront of whatever movement was in fashion: the sexual revolution and drug culture of the 1960's, the anti-Vietnam war and anti-C.I.A. demonstrations of the 1970's, the anti-Shah and anti-Reagan protests of the 1980's. In 1967 he was arrested in an antiwar protest in New York City, and he was arrested again, for the same reason, at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968. He testified in the trial of the so-called Chicago Seven.
Through it all, he kept writing. After "Kaddish" in 1959, major works included "TV Baby" in 1960, "Wichita Vortex Sutra" (1966), "Wales Visitation" (1967), "Don't Grow Old" (1976) and "White Shroud" (1983).
In his celebrated career, Mr. Ginsberg received many awards, including the National Book Award (1973), the Robert Frost Medal for distinguished poetic achievement (1986), and an American Book Award for contributions to literary excellence (1990).
In 1968, Cassady died of a drug overdose. Kerouac died of alcoholism the next year. By the mid-1970's, Mr. Ginsberg had helped start the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics of the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colo., a Buddhist university where he taught summer courses in poetry and in Buddhist meditation. He also was becoming one of the last living voices of the Beat generation and the keeper of the flame.
In 1985, Harper & Row published Mr. Ginsberg's "Collected Poems," an anthology of his work in one volume that firmly established the poet in the mainstream of American literature. The poet again made tours, showing up on television shows, but this time he was in suit and tie offering a sort of explanation of his work.
"People ask me if I've gone respectable now," he said to one interviewer. "I tell them I've always been respectable."
During another interview, he confessed: "My intention was to make a picture of the mind, mistakes and all. Of course I learned I'm an idiot, a complete idiot who wasn't as prophetic as I thought I was. The crazy, angry Philippic sometimes got in the way of clear perception.
"I thought the North Vietnamese would be a lot better than they turned out to be. I shouldn't have been marching against the Shah of Iran because the mullahs have turned out to be a lot worse."
But despite his suit and tie, the censors continued to look over Mr. Ginsberg's shoulder. During the interviews, David Remnick, then of The Washington Post, accompanied him to CBS's "Nightwatch." A producer, unfamiliar with the poet's work, asked if he would read something on the show.
"How about reading that poem about your mother?" she suggested.
" 'Kaddish,' yes. Time magazine calls it my masterpiece," Ginsberg replied. "But I don't know. . . ."
The poet pointed to a word in the poem he doubted would make prime time. As Mr. Remnick reported, the producer's eyes glazed over and there was a long silence.
"Your mother's . . .?" the producer said in horror.
"Couldn't we just bleep that part out?" the poet offered, always helpful.
"No," the producer said.
"It's O.K.," the poet replied. "I've got other poems."
 
Social Conscience Plus Sex and Drugs
What sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and ate up their brains and imagination?
Moloch! Solitude! Filth! Ugliness! Ashcans and unobtainable dollars! Children screaming under the stairways! Boys sobbing in armies! Old men weeping in the parks!
Moloch! Moloch! Nightmare of Moloch! Moloch the loveless! Mental Moloch! Moloch the heavy judger of men!
-- From "Howl!" (1955-56)
America I still haven't told you what you did to Uncle Max after he came over from Russia
I'm addressing you.
Are you going to let your emotional life be run by Time magazine?
. . .
It occurs to me that I am America
I am talking to myself again.

 -- From "America" (1956)
And how Death is that remedy all singers dream of, sing, remember, prophesy as in the Hebrew Anthem, or the Buddhist Book of Answers -- and my own imagination of a withered leaf -- at dawn --
Dreaming back thru life, Your time -- and mine accelerating toward Apocalypse,
the final moment -- the flower burning in the Day -- and what comes after,
looking back on the mind itself that saw an American city
a flash away, and the great dream of Me or China, or you and a phantom Russia, or a crumpled bed that never existed --
like a poem in the dark --
. . .
O mother
what have I left out
O mother
what have I forgotten
O mother
farewell
-- From "Kaddish" (1959-60)
. . .
Kansas! Kansas! Shuddering at last!
PERSON appearing in Kansas!
angry telephone calls to the University
Police dumbfounded leaning on
their radiocar hoods
While Poets chant to Allah in the roadhouse Showboat!
Blue-eyed children dance and hold Thy Hand O aged Walt
who came from Lawrence to Topeka to envision
Iron interlaced upon the city plain --
Telegraph wires strung from city to city O Melville!
. . .
Thy sins are forgiven, Wichita!

 -- From "Wichita Vortex Sutra" (1966)

HEADLINE: Mojave Park Supporters Fight Plans for Dump

BYLINE: By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF

DATELINE: JOSHUA TREE NATIONAL PARK, Calif., April 3

 BODY:
Rugged canyons, sagebrush and sunburned plains stretch in a majestic void across the Mojave Desert. But if you hike among some of this arid preserve's most desolate slopes and thorny wilderness, the spectacular view comes to an abrupt, ugly end.
The abandoned pit of the Eagle Mountain iron mine, two miles outside the park, to the southeast, is the focus of an intense dispute between developers who want to fill the enormous hole with trash, and environmentalists who fear that a dump would harm the fragile desert habitat. Fueling the debate are questions about economics, location and aesthetics that mirror the conflict over encroaching development near many of the nation's most revered natural and historic treasures. 
 Donna Charpied, a critic of the Eagle Mountain plan, gazed at the scarred hillsides of the mine the other day from her jojoba farm near the rustic town of Desert Center and spoke of the potential damage to wildlife in the park. She lamented that her organically grown crops -- bushes whose seeds are used for oil in items like cosmetics -- could become contaminated and that the tranquil way of life in the scrub-covered Chuckwalla Valley would be altered for as long as the dump is open, an estimated 75 years.
"When it's 128 degrees here -- and that's not uncommon -- it's going to stink," Ms. Charpied said. "You can go to Los Angeles if you want to see more smog and Pampers hanging on trees."
The Riverside County Planning Commission is holding hearings on Eagle Mountain and will decide whether to recommend that the project be approved within a few months. County supervisors will then take up the decade-old issue and make a final ruling.
If the $150 million plan is carried out, Eagle Mountain will receive up to 20,000 tons of trash a day from Southern California, mostly by rail. Under the plan, garbage will be buried in nearby canyons or emptied into the 1,100-foot-deep, 1 1/2-mile-wide East Pit gouged by Kaiser Steel between 1947 and 1982, long before Joshua Tree's southeastern boundary was expanded to surround the property on three sides.
Even supporters say the landfill would affect the area's environment. The debate is over how much, and whether the project would infringe on the experience that visitors expect from this unique landscape known for its twisted Joshua trees, vast blue skies and blissful quiet.
Ernest Quintana, superintendent of the park, has been a critic of the plan from the start. He predicted that ravens, attracted by the trash, would flock to Joshua Tree and prey on threatened desert tortoises, and that glaring lights, plumes of dust and tractor noise could scare off the timid bighorn sheep that leap between boulders in the nearby Eagle Mountains.
In the end, however, the National Park Service has no jurisdiction over the area. Some of the land is privately owned and some is controlled by the Federal Bureau of Land Management.
"I'm just asking developers and supervisors to use their common sense," Mr. Quintana said. "Visitors to that part of the park go there expressly to put on their backpacks to be one with nature."
Rick Daniels, president of the landfill's developer, the Mine Reclamation Corporation, counters that his company would do everything possible to mitigate potential damage, including paying $1 per ton of garbage to preserve natural habitats. He promised that the company would bury trash every day, pave roads to eliminate dust and collect windblown garbage inside the park.
Mine Reclamation also signed an agreement with the National Park Service, agreeing to several environmental safeguards beyond what is normally mandated by law, like financing independent research to monitor the dump's effect on Joshua Tree. Mr. Daniels added that Eagle Mountain would generate 1,500 jobs and help alleviate a landfill shortage that is anticipated when several dumps close in coming years near Los Angeles, about 200 miles to the west.
"People would like to think that the trash they put out at night is picked up by the tooth fairy," he said. "I challenge anyone to find a better use for that property."
Crisscrossed by power lines, dune buggy tracks, prospectors' shacks and fighter jets on low-level practice runs, the Mojave Desert is far from the unblemished American West of movie lore. The sprawl could increase if several proposed development projects ever go through.
Ward Valley, near the Colorado River, is listed as a future underground nuclear waste storage site. The Army is planning to add 331,000 acres to its National Training Center at Fort Irwin to stage tank maneuvers. And two companies have proposed separate landfills to compete with Eagle Mountain, one on a dry lake bed 150 miles east of San Diego, the other near Amboy, 250 miles east of Los Angeles.
Relations between preservationists and developers in the Mojave have been especially testy since 1994, when Congress set aside nearly 1.4 million acres of land under the Desert Protection Act. Rather than protecting Eagle Mountain, the legislation designated it an appropriate site for a landfill.
Its location near a remote, roadless corner of Joshua Tree insures that few visitors would ever see the dump once it opens.
When told of the plan, Michael Williams, a hiker from Los Angeles, rolled his eyes and sighed. Then after pausing for a moment before lacing his boots and heading down a dirt trail, he added: "You have to put garbage dumps somewhere. But no matter where it goes, someone is bound to be upset."

HEADLINE: AUTO RACING;
Speedway Off to a Bumpy Start as Winston Cup Arrives in Texas

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO 

DATELINE: FORT WORTH, April 5

 BODY:
The folks at Texas Motor Speedway, which has its inaugural races this weekend, like to point out that eight Texas Stadiums could fit into the track's infield. Maybe so, but what really matters is whether some of that Jerry Jones-Dallas Cowboys marketing magic finds its way into the place.
O. Bruton Smith, the owner of Speedway Motorsports, which built and operates the $120 million track, is surely trying. In bringing Nascar racing to the Dallas-Fort Worth marketplace, Smith is holstering some big numbers: more than 150,000 seats, opening-weekend attendance that should exceed 250,000, a television deal with CBS that he says pays $4 million annually, and those new stadium money-makers, personal seat licenses. 
 With all that cash being tossed up like dust in a Texas tornado (did we mention the 76 track-side condominiums under construction that will sell for $275,000 to $575,000 apiece?), the raison d'etre for it all -- a 1.5-mile circle of asphalt about 20 miles north of downtown Fort Worth -- could almost get lost in the whirl.
Unless, of course, you are one of the people expected to drive around the place at about 190 miles an hour. The Winston Cup drivers who will race in the Interstate Batteries 500 Sunday -- and their minor league brethren in today's Busch Grand National Coca-Cola 300, which was won by the Winston Cup veteran Mark Martin -- haven't yet issued their decree on Smith's stately pleasure dome.
"When the race is over, there's going to be some people who love it and some who hate it," said Darrell Waltrip, who starts 14th today in the 500-miler.
One who might fall into the latter category is Ricky Craven, who fractured his right shoulder blade and sustained a concussion in a crash on the fourth turn on Thursday. That corner was the one predicted to be the James Dean bend by most drivers after early test runs. And during today's Busch race, Randy Porter hit the Turn 4 wall on Lap 66; he was taken to a hospital for precautionary X-rays.
Waltrip scoffed at the earliest dire predictions, made by colleagues after rain stopped the first day of group tests last month. "Some of those comments came from guys riding around in rental cars with the windshield wipers on," he said.
Nonetheless, Waltrip agrees that the turn -- which funnels onto a double-dogleg front "straightaway" -- could be trouble. "It's a little tight off of Turn 4," he said, "and the tri-oval on the front stretch doesn't lend itself to passing and side-by-side racing. Still, I haven't raced there yet, so I don't know for sure."
And when he does today, it will be cautiously. "Normally, you're a little apprehensive at first coming to a new track because you don't know the limits," Waltrip said. "Either you have to be the victim, or sit back and watch and say, 'I guess that's not possible.' "
One thing that turned out to be impossible as the opening weekend approached was holding school. The speedway traffic -- cars on the narrow rural highways can go only one way in the morning and the other way in the evening -- took care of that. The local school district decided to cancel classes for two days.
The idled student body did not even have to figure out how to sneak in; 5,000 free tickets, each accompanied by a soda and a hot dog, were there for the taking.
The Northwest Independent School District would gladly swap the free passes and franks for some tax revenue from the track, but it is not getting any. The property that the track occupies is owned by the Fort Worth Sports Authority, a quasi-public corporation set up by the city, and is leased back to Speedway Motorsports for $50,000 a year in an arrangement that exempts the track from property taxes.
The school district, estimating it is losing $1.5 million a year in revenue because of this arrangement, sued to collect the taxes, lost and has filed an appeal.
Fort Worth, in its quest to develop the desolate land around Ross Perot Jr.'s Alliance Airport, a booming corporate airfield on the city's northern fringes, has granted about $200 million in tax abatements to firms that have relocated there, near the speedway. Although the track is tax-exempt, Speedway Motorsports estimates it will have an annual economic impact of $160 million in the area.
The school district isn't having any of that. The students had to go to the track to get the free tickets after the district refused to distribute them. "What the race track does with their tickets has nothing to do with the school, and we'd like to keep it that way," said Larry Hutto, vice president of the Northwest school board. The district did keep the $500 check that the speedway sent as a donation after the school band played at a track function.
While the district is out tax revenue, about 125 families who lived in a mobile-home community that is now an RV parking lot for the track are out more. They were uprooted by the sports authority, which used its power of eminent domain to claim the land. And that has led to the other big dispute surrounding the track. Several homeowners are going to court, challenging the authority's offering price for their land -- and the subsequent higher offer awarded them by an arbitration panel -- as grossly unfair.
One homeowner was offered $18,000 by the authority, a figure later raised to $78,000 by the three arbitrators. That's still far below what the property would be worth on a square-foot basis as part of an industrial tract, said Robert Cohen, an attorney representing six homeowners.
Tom Higgins, the assistant secretary-treasurer of the sports authority, said: "You have to understand the method of condemnation. What you're condemning is a trailer lot. You're not condemning a hotel or a factory.
"We acknowledge it's a very difficult situation because you're talking about people's homes. But there's a law, and we followed the law."
As to Cohen's argument that the property could be worth a lot more as an industrial site, Higgins replied, "What it could be is a parking lot, and that's what it is."
Not really. This area of the state was inundated with over 2.4 inches of rain from about 6 P.M. Thursday to 6 P.M. Friday, and most of the parking areas at the 950-acre speedway (they had not been paved yet) were too muddy to be used. That meant the traffic-management plan that the speedway and police had worked on for months had to be scrapped at the last minute. The speedway has hired about 300 buses to shuttle fans from off-site parking areas, as well as 15 tow trucks to rescue fans' vehicles stuck in the ooze.
Traffic was a nightmare, nonetheless, as police reported five-mile backups on the interstate that feeds into the speedway. Fans were advised to leave as early as possible on Sunday. Good idea, but consider this: as if fate hasn't mocked the speedway enough this weekend, Sunday happens to be the only 23-hour day all year, what with the shift to daylight time.
The rain has disrupted the racing schedule as well. Qualifying for the Interstate Batteries 500 was called off today (even though skies had cleared) when water started seeping onto the track surface from the point where the crash wall meets the pavement.
And when the Winston Cup cars tried to get in some much-needed practice this morning before the Busch Grand National race, the pavement started disintegrating in one of the turns, forcing a halt.

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY

 BODY:
IT doesn't take long for most visitors to the Boardwalk and Park Place to notice something familiar about the street map. Atlantic City's boulevards, named mostly after the states and bodies of water, bear more than a passing resemblance to the Monopoly game board.
The resemblance is intentional. America's most famous board game was indeed based on Atlantic City. Boardwalk and Park Place are still among the most valuable properties around, if only you could buy them. 
 While gambling has existed here in some form or another since the city was founded in 1854, Atlantic City's traditional path to the pot of gold has been the buying, selling and developing of real estate. So much feverish dealing inspired Charles Darrow, an unemployed plumbing contractor, to base Monopoly, his real estate trading board game, on Atlantic City street names, landmarks, utilities and other features. Darrow's game, designed in 1929, described a city for sale, where everything, from building hotels on public property to getting out of jail, was possible to someone with cash. Now, with as much as $10 billion in total casino investment expected by 2005, one would think that in 70 years, the game has changed.
Not quite.
In today's Atlantic City, winning is a lot like winning at Monopoly. More important than having money or property is the ability to outlast the competition, especially since most of the money gamblers lose in Atlantic City does not stay in town. Although the rules and the players have changed over the years, the game has stayed the same. While the gambling industry is making more money than ever, Atlantic City has become New Jersey's smallest town with big-city problems: unemployment, racial divisiveness, a decaying retail center and a general residential flight to the suburbs.
"The contrasts in the game are still, by and large, visible in Atlantic City," says Howard Kyle, director of the Atlantic County Planning Department and an amateur historian who is a native of the city. "Go to Park Place" -- priced at $350 on the gameboard -- "and you'll see a busy, thriving resort. Go to Baltic Avenue" -- $60 on the board -- "and you'll see some of the same problems you'd find in any major Northeastern city."
Many of the landmarks on the Parker Brothers game board still exist in Atlantic City. (Mayor James F. Whelan has a deluxe Monopoly set in his City Hall office.) And every few years someone comes up with a scheme to use Monopoly symbols as part of an urban renewal project. Portions of Baltic and Mediterranean Avenues are now called Fairmount and Melrose, respectively. Illinois Avenue is now Martin Luther King Boulevard.
There is still land to buy on Baltic and Mediterranean, but the big money is no longer in building a few houses, or even a hotel, and collecting rent. It seems the only people with cash in their pockets at the end of the day are the owners of tall, floodlighted casino hotels with parking garages.
"The big way the board has changed, obviously, are the casinos," says Jack Plackter, a lawyer specializing in development. "But most of the casinos still don't know how to play Monopoly. They haven't protected their borders by buying up property that would keep competitors away and give them the room to expand."

The Players: Impresarios And Empire-Builders
Only one casino mogul "really knew the game," Mr. Plackter said, "and that was Jim Crosby." James M. Crosby, the founder of the city's first casino, Resorts International, bought land all over the city, especially around Resorts. "In the early 1980's, he had so much land he had almost total control of what was happening in the South Inlet," a blighted area covering city's the northeastern corner, Mr. Plackter said. "MGM and Sun International, the companies coming into the city now, are fighting over a lot of the same land so they can get that kind of control, but there simply isn't enough room for both of them to get what they want."
Mr. Crosby died in 1986, and his heirs sold Resorts and most of his land holdings to Donald Trump. Mr. Trump now holds majority ownership of four Atlantic City casinos as well as the Steel Pier, more than any other company or individual in Atlantic City. In promoting those properties, he has become as famous as the mustachioed, top-hatted "Rich Uncle Pennybag" of the Monopoly game, if less avuncular.
As a player, Mr. Trump combines unequal parts of Barnumesque self-promotion and fingernails-on-chalkboard intimidation, insisting on not playing until the rules are rewritten in his favor. A big backer of Republican politicians, he has halted all improvements planned for his casinos and is currently suing numerous state agencies to stop the construction of a commuter tunnel that he believes will benefit the once and future Monopoly whiz, Steven A. Wynn.
Mr. Wynn is credited with reviving interest in the city with his decision in 1995 to build a casino in Atlantic City. Mr. Wynn is acquiring 155 acres of city-owned land in the marina district without charge from the city but must pay $15 million in cleanup and site improvement costs, of which he may recoup $8 million in state toxic waste cleanup credits. He has made all of this contingent on the building of a $330 million crosstown car tunnel, financed partly by the state, that would chop up sections of two residential neighborhoods.
Mr. Wynn plans as many as three casinos for the marina site, including Le Jardin, a branch of his successful Mirage chain. He also owns Boardwalk frontage at Albany Avenue and part of the marina waterfront next to the Trump Castle (soon to be renamed Trump Marina) casino.
"If you want to win, you're two and a half years too late," says John Huber, a commercial Realtor in the city. "The news that Steve Wynn was going to come in and build a casino here set off another buying wave in the Inlet and along the Boardwalk that may even have begun to taper off."
Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Wynn doesn't like to play until the rules are rewritten in his favor. Unlike Mr. Trump, whose empire depends heavily on revenues generated from his Atlantic City casinos, Mr. Wynn can still decide not to play, thanks to his Las Vegas casinos, and lose only a few million dollars in legal and public relations fees.

The Corporation As Gamesman
But the biggest player in the city's current Monopoly game is Hilton Hotels, which already owns property on the Boardwalk and Park Place. A former loser (Hilton's Rainbow casino became the Trump Castle when Barron Hilton was denied an casino license in 1995), Hilton is now the largest gambling company in the world, thanks to the financial legerdermain of its chairman, Steven Bollenbach (who dug Donald Trump out of bankruptcy barely six years ago), and Arthur M. Goldberg, a Jersey boy who merged his Bally's casinos in Atlantic City and Nevada with Hilton last year to create the largest gambling company in the world, with 18 facilities worldwide, two in Atlantic City. Hilton also owns acres of parking lots around its Atlantic City Hilton casino at Boston Avenue and the Boardwalk, and large, buildable parcels on both sides of Pacific Avenue near Park Place. The company is finishing an expansion of its Bally's Park Place casino and may also acquire the financially troubled Claridge casino hotel.
As a player, Mr. Goldberg, a Monopoly fan and backer of Democratic political candidates, tends to keep quiet until he's ready to pounce, and he can be effective at derailing city improvement projects that don't directly benefit his properties. As president of Hilton's gambling operations, he may become the newest winner if he succeeds in a $10.5 billion hostile takeover bid for ITT Corporation, owner of Caesars.
Even before ITT bought Caesars in 1993, Caesars Atlantic City casino was more profitable than the more famous Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.The company is building an expansion abutting Bally's Park Place; it also owns the Ocean One Mall, a retail and amusement pier at Arkansas Avenue, and a Boardwalk-front parking at Martin Luther King Boulevard and Park Place, where it plans to build an enormous Planet Hollywood casino.
Last year ITT, under its chairman, Rand Araskrog, showed that it could play Monopoly with the best. A 500-room Doubletree hotel going up opposite the city's new Convention Center, partly financed by Caesars, magically became a Sheraton, scheduled to open in November, when Caesars bought out Doubletree's portion. That the Sheraton chain is also owned by ITT was not lost on anyone. Unless it capitulates to Hilton, ITT now has a lock on hotel business from the city's new convention hall. Although huge conventions of Elks, Moose and other lodges were held in Atlantic City when Darrow designed the Monopoly game, his board doesn't show how important it has become to be close to a large convention facility.
Of all the casinos, Harrah's Atlantic City is in the best shape to survive the turbulent next decade, followed by Tropicana and Showboat. Content to sit in its own corner of the marina district, Harrah's, which got a black eye when its Jazz casino in New Orleans failed in 1995, has enough land and cash to have more than 2,000 hotel rooms by the year 2002, making it the largest hotel in the state. (Tropicana, with 1600 rooms, is currently the largest.)
Newcomers include MGM Grand. Headed by Al Luciani, a former Atlantic City Golden Nugget executive, the company expects to open a casino and theme-park complex in the South Inlet section in two years. The South African company Sun International, under Sol Kerzner, is buying several acres south of the former Merv Griffin's Resorts, which it hopes to turn into an ocean-themed Atlantis casino in 1999.
Before Mr. Trump is crowned the current Boardwalk king, it should be noted that his casinos, as well as those of Resorts International (then owned by Mr. Griffin), filed for bankruptcy at the close of the 1980's. The Sands, owned by Texas-based Pratt Hotels, and the Claridge have been in financial difficulty for two years. Another casino, the former Playboy, changed its ownership and name before running out of money. (It was later purchased and reopened in 1996 as the Trump World's Fair Casino.)

Monopoly Updated: A Reality-Based Fantasy
This is what might happen if you were to play a 1997 version of Monopoly, set in a city poised for its next big wave of casino-fueled rebirth.
 
PASS GO, COLLECT $200 Passing Go in the modern Atlantic City requires you to apply to the Casino Reinvestment and Development Authority, a state agency that gives away billions in tax money -- a little more than a penny from every dollar lost -- from the casinos' gross gambling revenues. Grants from the authority are supposed to go to projects and activities that will improve the city or benefit the elderly and the handicapped. But with so many court challenges over the years, the lawyers may turn out to be the only clear beneficiaries of the casino boom.
 
THE PROPERTIES One of the peculiarities of Atlantic City's Monopoly landmarks is that they have retained their value over time, give or take a few zeros. Land along Mediterranean and Baltic Avenues, blocks from the Boardwalk, would sell for $10 to $12 a square foot, said Mr. Huber, the Realtor who admits to having played more than his share of Monopoly over the years.
BOARDWALK AND PARK PLACE These and other properties offering Boardwalk frontage along the miracle mile between the Showboat and Tropicana casinos are still the most expensive, $40,000 a square foot. Go 10 blocks up the Boardwalk, into the South Inlet, where of MGM Grand want to build a casino complex, and the price drops to $100 a square foot. Mayor Whelan says he hasn't ruled out using the city's power of eminent domain to help MGM get more what it wants at a lower price.
 
HOUSES Because of environmental upgrades and "soft costs" for permits and other legal matters, a three-bedroom house in the Inlet section can cost $150,000 to $210,000. If you build a housing development, you can qualify for money from the Casino Reinvestment and Development Authority, reducing your cost but requiring you to sell some of your houses to low-income families.
 
HOTELS The city's only new non-casino hotel in two years, the 500-room Sheraton is connected to the new convention center. Due to open in November of this year, it cost $87 million. But casino hotels change the game. Now, a typical Atlantic City casino hotel with 1,000 rooms and 100,000 square feet of casino space will cost at least $450 million. So far, the record is $1.3 billion that Mr. Trump paid to build the Trump Taj Mahal during the days of junk bond debt with double-digit interest. Gamblers lose $1.5 million to $2 million at the Taj Mahal every day. Before you count your chips, remember that it takes state and local agencies at least two years to process and approve the paperwork for a casino hotel. "Soft costs" have been variously estimated as 10 to 25 percent of the total investment.
 
CHANCE The worst luck you could have is for your high-rolling gamblers to win big. Among the other bad tidings to casino developers have been riparian claims (somebody digs up an ancient map of the town that shows a tiny creek used to run under your casino; pay the state $250,000, as the old Playboy did); an auto accident that closes your parking garage (lose $400,000 a day, as the Claridge did last summer, when your customers go elsewhere); a popular entertainer's defection to another casino (when Frank Sinatra was still performing, his presence could raise a casino's gross by several million dollars every night he was in town); a contractor's ties to organized crime (next time ask about Cousin Vinnie; pay $50,000 fine); a sexual or racial discrimination suit (as much as $500,000, settled out of court by several casinos); a hostile takeover (costs for poison-pill defenses: $50 million), and a unionization drive ($500,000 in consultation costs and management overtime to defeat it). Among the new cards to add to the pile would be those that grant permission to tear out your lounges and add slot machines; bless you with air rights so you can extend your casino over a public street; venture into Chapter 11 bankruptcy so that you don't have to pay your bondholders and creditors all you owe them, or have the city of Atlantic City use its power of eminent domain to condemn a property that you need for your casino expansion. On a different space, change the get-out-of-jail-free card to "deregulation."
 
COMMUNITY CHEST The former Community Chest is now the Atlantic County Chapter of the United Way, the city's single most popular charity among casino employees.
 
LUXURY TAXTen percent of a hotel room's bill goes to a fund for civic improvements. Casinos also pay nearly 70 percent of the local taxes collected in Atlantic City. An additional 8 percent of the casino gross goes to a general fund that, before it was pillaged by the state Legislature, was supposed to benefit the elderly and the handicapped. And don't forget the redevelopment authority's cut. Beyond which there is a tangle of permits, processing fees and legal complexities.
 
FREE PARKING No longer free. The casinos charge a state-mandated $2 that is supposed to pay for projects to improve the city, specifically a corridor project to link the new Convention Center to the Boardwalk. Elsewhere, parking meters and three-hour parking limits for non-residents cause the city to issue about 90,000 parking tickets a year.
 
THE RAILROADS The Short Line was a bus line, not a railroad. Of the Monopoly railroads, only the Pennsylvania Reading did come to Absecon Island, as did the Camden & Atlantic. Darrow split the Pennsylvania Reading into two separate railroads to fill up the board. Today, New Jersey Transit commuter trains use rights-of-way cut by the Camden & Atlantic, the city's first railroad, which steamed into town in 1854. Once Atlantic City's most important source of visitors, the line is now a money-loser for New Jersey Transit. The game might be updated by making one of the railroad spaces a charter bus company bringing in day-trippers who mostly play the slot machines.
 
UTILITIES The Electric Company, based in Pleasantville, jolts enough juice into the animated signs in front of the Trump Plaza and Caesars parking garages each use enough electricity to power a small South Jersey town. The Water Works is the Atlantic County Municipal Utilities Authority, which regularly wins awards for the purity of its water.
 
JAIL The one square everybody hates now takes you out of town. The Atlantic City Police Department has small holding facilities, but most people arrested in the city are moved to the Atlantic County Correctional Facility in Mays Landing, a 30-minute drive away. The Get-Out-of-Jail-Free card, a relic of the days when political bosses ran the town, is obsolete. If you need help, the phone number of city's best-known criminal lawyer, Edwin Jacobs, is in the book.

Why the Tobacco Industry Found Taxes Hazardous to Its Health

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
RECENT weeks have been tough for the tobacco industry, ever since one of its major manufacturers, the Liggett Group, broke ranks and admitted that marketing campaigns had been aimed at teen-agers, and that it had known for decades that cigarettes are dangerous.
Hoping to capitalize on public revulsion at these disclosures, anti-smoking advocates are pushing legislation in 19 states to raise cigarette taxes by as much as a dollar per pack. Polls, by the advocates on both sides and by independent survey organizations, consistently show overwhelming public support for increased excise taxes to reduce consumption. 
 For years the tobacco industry fought regulations like those aimed at banning or restricting smoking in buildings or cigarette giveaways, but the industry apparently viewed these skirmishes as a useful way to keep the debate away from something it feared much more -- higher excise taxes, which would discourage smoking, especially by teen-agers.
Internal documents from the Tobacco Institute, the cigarette manufacturers' trade association, and the Philip Morris Companies, plus testimony by a Tobacco Institute vice president, indicate that the industry has long feared excise taxes.
Now anti-smoking advocates, with financial support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in Princeton, N.J., and the American Cancer Society, among other organizations, are pushing the Federal and state governments for higher excise taxes on tobacco.
Various anti-smoking advocacy organizations provided the documents quoted below. The first was released in litigation, and others, all on company stationery, were sent to the groups anonymously. Several have been cited in other news reports. The company involved, Philip Morris, has not disputed their authenticity. DAVID CAY JOHNSTON
A September 1981 internal memo at Philip Morris warned about a Federal report concluding that raising taxes would significantly reduce smoking among youths. The memo about the National Bureau of Economic Research report was written by Myron Johnston, a company economist, to his boss, Harry G. Daniel, who at the time was manager of research on smoking by teen-agers.
Because of the quality of the work, the prestige (and objectivity) of the N.B.E.R., and the fact that the excise tax on cigarettes has not changed in nearly 30 years, I think we need to take seriously their statement that . . . if future reductions in youth smoking are desired, an increase in the Federal excise tax is a potent policy to accomplish this goal. . . .
[The authors] calculate that . . . a 10 percent increase in the price of cigarettes would lead to a decline of 12 percent in the number of teen-agers who would otherwise begin to smoke. . . .
Among teen-agers the prevalence of cigarette smoking is highly correlated with income (from either allowances or working) while there is no similar correlation between smoking prevalence and income among adults. . . . It is clear that price has a pronounced effect on the smoking prevalence of teen-agers. . . .
We can never look with equanimity on increases in the excise tax, but because of demographic trends and the improved economic outlook an increase at this time would probably be less harmful than it would have been at any other time in the past decade.
The industry nevertheless redoubled its efforts to head off tax increases. In December 1989, during the Bush Administration, an internal Philip Morris memo recounted the company's lobbying efforts, naming tobacco-state politicians through whom it intended to exert pressure. The memo plays down a report on a possible tax-hike recommendation from the Administration.
Discussions were held with officials of the White House and Treasury Department, who assured us that: a) there are no plans to raise cigarette excise taxes as part of the FY 91 Budget exercise, b) the tax study alluded to in The Wall Street Journal was a mid-level, what-if exercise containing a number of politically controversial tax changes available should the coming tax debate produce calls for revenue increases, c) no such recommendations for tax policy changes have reached either [Treasury] Secretary [Nicholas] Brady or [Budget] Director [Richard] Darman for their review.
Contacts were made with Congressional allies to enlist their support in contacting the Bush Administration to oppose cigarette taxes. Those contacts included Senators Helms, McConnell, and Warner and Representatives Bliley, Coble, McMillan, Bateman, Rogers, Ballenger, and Bunning [all Republicans, from North Carolina, Virginia or Kentucky]. All agreed to contact the Administration via phone or letter to protest. Ballenger immediately called the Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy, Ken Gideon. . . .
We have asked Senator [Howard] Baker [Republican of Tennessee] and his associates to enlist Governors Campbell of South Carolina and Martin of North Carolina to contact the President via letter and remind him of his no-excise-tax-on-cigarettes campaign pledge. We are awaiting their responses. In addition, the Senator continues to have phone discussions with the Administration on this issue. The President has assured Senator Baker previously that he remains opposed to new cigarette taxes. . . .
It appears that our alert to Members of Congress [has] yielded dividends. At a minimum, the Treasury Department has been put on notice that tobacco excise tax increases will meet strong resistance from President Bush's Southern allies.
In March 1990, an internal Philip Morris memo from James W. Dyer, the chief lobbyist in Washington, to David Greenberg, a Philip Morris vice president, claimed success in muting criticism of tobacco by Dr. Antonia Novello, President Bush's nominee for Surgeon General, as she prepared for confirmation hearings:
We have intervened with the White House, OMB [Office of Management and Budget] and HHS [Department of Health and Human Services] to urge that Dr. Novello take no position on any pending anti-tobacco legislation. We stressed to her handlers and to interested parties that we were interested in making sure she focused on non-tobacco health problems. We were successful in that both of our objectives were met.
The next day, at the hearings, however, Dr. Novello vowed to fight the tobacco industry and later she called tobacco companies "death dealers." By mid-1990 higher excise taxes seemed in store. A May 1990 memo expressed alarm over a meeting on the Federal budget planned for Houston that July:
It is prudent to assume that there will be a budget summit, and that excise tax increases are viewed as acceptable tax increases. . . . Therefore, our grassroots, grasstops, employee communications, TBN [the reference is unexplained], etc., should go into high gear now. We should activate every tool at our disposal immediately. I have a feeling this is not a test, this is the real thing.
A Philip Morris memo a few days later gives advice on political contributions aimed at heading off a tax increase:
I have been contacted by Fred Malek [a Bush political adviser] and his staff, all of whom are currently planning the 1990 Houston Economic Summit on July 9 through 11. They are soliciting corporate sponsors. . . . If we contribute cash, I would suggest a minimum donation of $25,000. . . .
And the next month a memo to Kathleen M. Linehan, the No. 2 executive in Philip Morris's Washington office, urged support for four Republicans in the 1990 Congressional elections. All but Bill Schuette won.
Craig Jones [Craig T. James of Florida] -- . . . he is very conservative, pro-business, anti-tax, endangered species type who is pro-tobacco. . . .
Bill Schuette [Michigan] -- I'd give up all the rest to give this guy money. He's in the forefront of the anti-tax movement, our food crowd loves him and he has an excellent chance.
Paul Gillmor [Ohio] -- Former Speaker of the Ohio House, he is a chain smoker who will vote with tobacco. . . .
Chris Cox -- Has moved to the forefront of the anti-tax movement in the House because he has introduced the balanced budget amendment that the business community is rallying round. The trouble is, he's a California Republican, therefore, suspect on tobacco. . . .
In pre-trial testimony last February in a lawsuit brought by Mississippi to recover tax money spent on tobacco-related illnesses, Ronald C. Morris, vice president of the Tobacco Institute, gave the industry's position on taxes:
The Institute is opposed to cigarette taxes. . . . is not opposed to improving health care. [But tobacco companies] are opposed to funding it. It's bad public policy to use an excise tax dedicated to fund a growing need. You have a declining revenue potential with a growing need source. It is just not good public policy. . . . We would support a broad-based tax to pay for indigent health care.

HEADLINE: Players Don't Show Colleges The Money

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN; William C. Rhoden is a sports columnist for The New York Times

 BODY:
For Steve Smith, the dream came true in the spring of 1991 when he became that needle in a haystack, the one in a million who managed to reach the National Basketball Association. Mr. Smith was drafted by the Miami Heat on the first round and was the fifth player selected overall. The draft culminated a brilliant career at Michigan State University and a long hard climb from the inner city of Detroit.
 During his rookie season in the NBA, Mr. Smith's dream was shattered when his mother died of cancer. His older sister, Janice, had been fatally shot when he was 8 years old. But this was different. Clara Bell Smith was his best friend, nurturer, confidante, sage -- his coach. 
 For six seasons after his mother's death, Mr. Smith, a 6-foot-7-inch guard for the Atlanta Hawks, looked for a substantial way to commemorate her memory. He wears a tattoo of a bell on his right arm that he touches before shooting a foul shot. He has given away $70,000 a year for tickets so that youth groups can attend Hawks home games. He donates $50 for each three point shot he makes to the Atlanta-based Make-A- Wish Foundation, which grants wishes to terminally ill children. But nothing seemed substantial enough to honor his mother's memory. He wanted something more enduring.
 "I just kept running different things through my head," Mr. Smith, 28, recalled recently.
 Last November Mr. Smith was contacted by Kirk Gibson, the former Detroit Tiger baseball player and MSU alumnus about contributing to a $6 million campaign to build a student athlete center on campus. A light went on in Mr. Smith's head: This was it.
 At the time, he was negotiating a lucrative contract with the Hawks, to whom he'd been traded in 1994. The contract was for a whopping $50.4 million over seven years; by the time Kirk Gibson came along, Mr. Smith was ready to put his money where his heart was. After several meetings between his attorneys and Michigan State University officials, Mr. Smith contributed $2.5 million toward the construction of the building. -- the largest known contribution from an active professional athlete to his alma mater.
 Substantial gifts to colleges and universities are certainly nothing new. What makes the Smith gift highly unusual, however, is its source: a college athlete alumnus.
 Of all the groups of alumni, professional athletes are among the least likely to be associated with making hefty gifts to their respective schools outside of the athletics department.
 At a time when even minimum salaries of professional football, basketball and baseball players are well into six figures, university officials have begun to recognize the universe of professional athletes as a relatively unexplored frontier. And as Mr. Smith's gift creates a few ripples in this universe, many development officers wonder why they have not tapped into this resource before now.
 The more pertinent question is why haven't more professional athletes given more generously to universities.
 The question is more complex than it appears and addresses a troublesome aspect of the relationship between big-time athletic programs and universities.
 Many universities use their scholarship sports programs to curry favor with alumni and with boosters. The schools use football and basketball programs to enhance the image and imagery of the university by using sports as a vehicle for national advertising.
 In the midst of all this stands the recruited athletes. They have become a peculiar combination of entertainer, gladiator and student who put themselves through school by utilizing the labor intensive skills they have honed for years. The mutual, but ill-defined backscratching between the university and recruits has created a hybrid called the student-athlete. It has also created an ambivalence toward the university by athletes who look at the profits -- direct and indirect -- that the university derives from sports programs.
 "Sometimes athletes have the feeling that they have given to their university by playing ball," said Charles Webb, the vice president of development at Michigan State University.
 Wayne Baskerville, director of development and alumni relations for the University of Michigan's athletic department, brought up another more contemporary consideration.
 "A big problem with athletes giving is that so many of them are leaving school after their first or second year, and they are not having an opportunity to develop any connection with the school," he said.
 Some student athletes, particularly in football and basketball, say that those athletes who do remain on campus for four years are sometimes stigmatized by being on a so-called "free ride." Many speak of alienation from the general student body and say they tend to bond primarily with with one another.
 These feelings are often more pronounced in African American athletes who attend predominantly white colleges. In many cases, the athletes would not have chosen the school nor the school the athlete but for athletics. One development director who asked not to be identified said, "A lot of black athletes don't feel a connection to the school. In many cases they feel they've done a lot more for the university than the university has done for them. They say 'The institution has kept me isolated, kept me in practices during the season, workouts and training after the season, the athletic dining hall, then study hall' -- all of it is centered around the athletic complex. As a result they don't go to a lot of social events. They feel more loyalty to the team than they do to the university."
 For many athletes, being asked to give money to the university is one more maneuver to exploit a resource. With the large number of African American athletes participating in revenue producing sports of football and basketball, much more attention has to be paid to the athletes' on-campus experience.
 Mr. Webb said that Smith's substantial gift could signal a breakthrough.
 "I have no question this gift will raise the consciousness of our other athletes," he said. "We've already had three or four others say 'I want to do something. I may not be able to do it at the level of Steve Smith, but I can do something.' That's all we can ask." He added: "Sometimes I don't think we as development officers have been as aggressive, or have worked with our athletes as closely as we could have."
 Paul Blodgett, vice president for development at the University of Southern California, agrees.
 "I don't think we've given it the attention it warrants," he said. "Do I think we've done a particularly good job of that here? No," he said referring to cultivating athletes as donors. USC has a rich tradition of producing professional athletes. Currently the school has 46 former Trojans playing in the NFL, six in Major League Baseball and one in the NBA.
 "We've certainly talked about it," Mr. Blodgett said. "And we've talked about individual names. When you have individuals with significant wealth, you have to deal with that person's relationship to the university and did he or she have a good experience."
 Mr. Smith said that he enjoyed his experience at Michigan State. Although he stayed for four years, he needs a few more hours to graduate. But he said he plans to return after retirement.
 Yet fond memories and good times were not what attracted Mr. Smith to the building project. The hook was a provision that allowed donors who contribute more than half of the construction costs of a building to have that building named in their honor. Mr. Smith had a grander idea: He told the university that he wanted the building named in honor of his mother.
 Ground breaking for the Clara Bell Smith Student Athletes Academic Center took place on March 1. According to Mr. Webb, Mr. Smith's gift marks the first time that a donor has asked that a building be named for someone else.
 "This was great because it allowed me to give back in a lot of ways," Mr. Smith said. "I named the building after my mom, I gave back to Michigan State, which helped me get to where I'm at, and it allowed me to give back to my high school." Mr. Smith also has endowed an annual scholarship to Michigan State for the best student at Pershing High School in Detroit. "That was the most exciting thing for me," he said.
 Mr. Smith grew up in the Detroit inner city, He is the second of three children and the only boy. His father, Donald, drove a bus and his mother stayed home and raised their three children.
 Mr. Smith said the reason he began a scholarship fund at Pershing was to give non-athletes with good grades but limited funds an opportunity to attend Michigan State.
 "A lot of kids I know in my area had the grades to go to Michigan State but did not have the financial means to get there," he said. "So instead of going to Michigan State and struggling, they'd go to a community college where they could maintain themselves financially and concentrate on academics. This scholarship will allow them to go to the university and concentrate on the books."
 Mr. Smith's gift to his university may be the largest but it is not the first. Last year Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls gave $1 million to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to create a new research institute on families in the School of Social Work. A year earlier, Jamal Mashburn of the Miami Heat, established a scholarship fund for economically disadvantaged students with a $500,000 gift to the University of Kentucky.
 But, some development officers wonder, how can they encourage more giving?
 "In the case of the institution, usually those who are involved in the fundraising enterprise don't have the relationship with the athletes," said Robert Hill, the vice president for communications at Syracuse University. "The people who had the relationship, like the coach, don't concern themselves with fundraising. So usually institutions conduct their fundraising programs without any significant involvement from these coaches who are really the ones most likely to get a positive response." As an example, Mr. Hill points out that the athletic department's fundraising campaign has a goal of $10 million. Of that, $7 million already has been raised. Of the major gifts, only two came from varsity athletes who made their money playing professional ball: Lawrence Moten and Sherman Douglas, both of whom are African Americans. They contributed to the Jim Boeheim Scholarship fund. Of the 100 donors to the general athletic fund, 15 were former athletes in varsity sports, though most participated in non-revenue sports. None of the donors made their money playing pro sports.
 But, Mr. Hill said, a number of African American athletes have begun to rejoin the fold. Jim Brown, the Hall of Fame running-back-turned-actor is one example. Mr. Brown refused to participate in any Syracuse affairs until 1983, Mr. Hill said -- nearly 25 years after he graduated.
 During one drive to bring black alumni back to Syracuse, Mr. Hill said, he canvassed every African American athlete who ever played for Syracuse and invited them to campus. "Just to get them involved and say 'Hey, you own this Orange, too'," he said, referring to the school colors. "They enjoyed being able to come back and gripe about how rough life was when they were here, to the point where they were seeing that it wasn't like that anymore. There had been substantial changes." Syracuse currently has eight players in the National Basketball Association (two are white, six African American), and 15 athletes in the National Football league (eight African Americans, seven whites).
 Darryl Daniels, a North Carolina-based agent said one of his clients, Charles Way, a running back with the New York Giants who attended the University of Virginia, preferred to contribute money to an African American organization rather than to the university. Mr. Way, an engineering major, contributes to the National Association of Black Engineers.
 "I like him doing that -- that's empowering an African-American organization," Mr. Daniels said. "What I'd like to see happen more is giving money to the black engineering group and the United Negro College Fund. A lot of money that is given back to the university, give it to a positive African American entity."
 But Mr. Hill at Syracuse counters that if alumni give the money to the university, the university will direct it to an engineering student. "What I say is you can give to the institution and earmark it for black students studying engineering. You can help the kid and help your alma mater."
 For some development officers, the answer is simply that athletes are no different from other alumni.
 "If you look at the pattern of individual giving generally, people under 50 may make contributions but they're not really thinking of making large contributions because they're still thinking about acquiring wealth, accumulating wealth, not so much about giving it away," said Mr. Blodgett of USC.
 Mr. Smith said that while he is not at the income level of someone like Michael Jordan, his gift to Michigan State won't hurt his wallet.
 "It's not going to make a dent because growing up, I never thought I'd have it," he said. "It hasn't hurt me because I know how to live without it."
 Finally, Mr. Smith said, he feels a sense of completion -- that his real dream has been fulfilled. Because of his donation and the new student athlete center, he senses that his mother's spirit will live on for generations.
 "She was a giving person," he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 20, 1997, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article in the special Education Life section on April 6 about donations by professional athletes misstated the gift-giving preference of Charles Way, who plays for the New York Giants. He says he has no preference for African-American organizations over the University of Virginia, which he attended.
The article also misstated the given name of Mr. Way's agent. He is Deryle Daniels, not Darryl.

HEADLINE: Superstore Inflation

BYLINE: By Richard Panek; Richard Panek is writing a social history of the telescope, to be published next year.

 BODY:
The superstore -- that cropland-encroaching or square-city-block-swallowing shrine to seemingly limitless supply -- is shaping up to be the defining shopping experience of the 1990's. It has established the scale that shoppers now demand and a strategy that retailers giddily emulate, and it has done both to an extent that would have been unimaginable only 10 years ago. Whatever bigger was, now it's more.
Superstores have gone from zero to $550 billion in annual sales, or fully one-third of the nation's retail revenue, in 10 years flat. In fiscal year 1996, Home Depot, the leading home-improvement superstore chain, showed a record $938 million profit on $19.5 billion in sales, a 28 percent improvement over the previous year's record profits; Staples, a $106 million profit on $4 billion in sales, or a 44 percent improvement. Borders, the No. 2 bookseller in the nation, has been opening new superstores at the rate of one every nine days; Barnes & Noble, the leading bookseller, one every four or five days; Staples, two a week. For Home Depot, nearly three a week. 
 That's three new-from-the-foundation-up pieces of real estate, each stocking 40,000 to 50,000 different kinds of building materials, home-improvement supplies and lawn and garden products, each with a garden center that by itself covers at least 20,000 square feet, each week.
Where only yesterday there was empty acreage, suddenly there are superstores selling books, sporting goods, home furnishings, athletic wear, baby products, bed and bath supplies, toys, consumer electronics, pet supplies, even off-the-rack bridal gowns. In some fields, the term no longer suffices; in the
grocery trade the distinctions include conventional-format stores, warehouse stores, superstores, superwarehouse stores, combination food-and-drug stores and hypermarkets. As Richard S. Tedlow, a Harvard Business School professor and the author of "New and Improved: The Story of Mass Marketing in America," says, "I'm not sure what people mean when they use the term superstore."
Over the years in popular parlance it has applied to anything from an ultra-inclusive Wal-Mart outside Madison, Wisc., to the ultra-exclusive Emporio Armani on Madison Avenue. It definitely comes in a big box -- "big box" is a Wall Street synonym, in fact, for four walls that house a wealth of consumer goods. But in recent months, thanks in part to the Federal Trade Commission's highly publicized resistance to the proposed merger between the Staples and Office Depot superstore chains, its meaning has begun to settle on a specific breed of big-box retailer, one that lives by a singular code.
Category killers, they are called. They sell one kind of merchandise, and they sell it at deep discount. By buying from suppliers at high volumes, they don't just give the local competition a run for its money -- they eliminate it by design. As an enterprise with a responsibility to stockholders and a board of directors, the superstore exists on the scale it does for one reason only: not to sell the proverbial better mousetrap but to be the last mousetrap seller standing.
That's the theory, anyway. In practice, superstores often don't succeed in killing all the competition. They eliminate the small and the weak, all right, but in another way superstores create competition. After all, there's nothing like a highly visible, phenomenally successful business venture to invite rivalry. Ten years ago, Home Depot -- "the quintessential category killer," as Forbes magazine put it -- had the home-improvement superstore field to itself; by 1996, there were a dozen such chains. At the end of the day (or decade), all that's left standing are other superstores.
What happened in the office-supply category is typical to the point of being instructive -- and for some observers, instructive to the point of being cautionary. On May 1, 1986, in Brighton, Mass., Staples opened the first office-supply superstore in the country. Six months later, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Office Depot followed suit. Within three years, 15 office-supply superstore chains were competing, and already the battlefield had claimed its first casualty, Office Station. Today, that competition has narrowed to three superstore chains, and if the Staples-Office Depot merger that was first proposed last September goes through, there will be just two -- just like 10 years earlier, in the fall of 1986.
But what a difference a decade makes. The office-supply deal would create a chain of more than 1,000 superstores in 47 states and 10 foreign countries -- big enough to attract the attention of an F.T.C. already suspicious of superstores. Last May the agency charged that Toys "R" Us was using its 20 percent share of the toy market to pressure suppliers not to sell products to competitors; now the F.T.C. has flagged a merger between the No. 1 and No. 2 office suppliers for having all the makings of a monopoly.
Market share is an elusive concept, depending on who's doing the defining. Staples maintains that at $10 billion in annual sales, even the new company would account for only 5 percent of the $185 billion office-supply industry. Less generous (and less advantageous) estimates might adjust that market share to 8 percent of a $125 billion industry. The F.T.C. action, however, raises the question of which industry we are talking about here -- the entire office-supply marketplace, including the corner pharmacy's half-aisle full of pushpins, protractors and, yes, staples, or the $23 billion superstore market, of which the newly merged giant would command a 44 percent share?
Clearly, the F.T.C. favors the latter interpretation. The press release announcing the regulatory commission's complaint states that office-supply superstores "offer consumers the convenience of one-stop shopping for a wide variety of office supplies, computers and computer-related products, and office furniture at deep discount prices." They are "unlike any other retail stores in the United States."
In other words, the category killers have succeeded so well that they have created a new category: themselves.
More, it turns out, was the easy part. More categories overall, more variety within each category, more inventory within each variety; 10,000 square feet of books; 50,000 square feet of CD's; 120,000 square feet of home furnishings. To enter a superstore is to know what the scale of Olympus or Eldorado must have looked like in the imaginations of mortals.
And then what? Achieving critical mass was a relatively simple matter: raise money (Wall Street has been an early, ardent, unwavering advocate of the category-killer concept), buy real estate, build boxes, fill them with inventory; customers will show up if only to witness the spectacle, and they'll look around, and they'll buy. They'll even come back.
But will they keep coming back? Will a superstore be able to distinguish itself from its competitors sufficiently so that it will become not just a novelty but a necessity? That's the tricky part, and that's where the superstores have had to get creative.
It's no longer enough to have the widest selection of CD's at the lowest prices. That's why Wow!, a 60,000-square-foot West Coast combination of the Good Guys consumer-electronics store and Tower Records, features an $80,000 home stereo system on which classical connoisseurs can sample the latest releases at length and at leisure. That's why the 75,000-square-foot Virgin Megastore in Times Square offers 250 listening and viewing posts, in addition to live performances, a bookstore, a travel agency, a cafe and a movie theater. That's why no self-respecting video or audio retailer is complete without a giant video screen -- or better yet, 25 video screens generating one gigantic image, which doesn't even have to match the soundtrack. Like the stores themselves, these screens are doing one thing while saying -- or not saying -- another.
"People are looking for a store that makes a statement," says Professor Tedlow of Harvard Business School. Note that he says "makes a statement," not "has something to say." That's because what a superstore has to say for itself is pretty much what most any retail operation has to say: buy, buy, buy. Its fundamental appeal might be the promise to save you time and money, but in fact, it depends for its survival on its ability to keep you on the premises and buying more than you came in for -- in retail jargon, the "look around a while" factor and its "add-on item" impact. As one executive summarized his superstore's strategy: "Stay longer, sample more and visit more often."
Sometimes the distraction is sustenance. If a shopper is going to spend the two or three hours most super-
stores bank on, the retailer had better provide food and drink, or that customer is bound to wander off. Sometimes this distraction is seduction. An overwhelmed customer is a passive customer, and a passive customer is suggestable -- turn here, go there, hold that, buy this. Either way, the distraction is what transforms the superstore into a destination.
Both Barnes & Noble and Borders have announced that their strategy through the end of the century is to focus on opening stand-alone superstores while cutting back on the older, smaller mall stores. And why not? These days, a bookstore is a bookstore, food court, music shop and newsstand rolled into one. Not only does it give the customer plenty of incentive to spend more time and more money on the premises, but it does so by keeping for itself the discretionary income that used to get spread around nearby stores in malls. During the superstore run-up in the early 1990's, according to one industry survey, mall traffic was down 14 percent, and a recent report estimated that 15 percent of conventional malls would go out of business by the end of the decade.
What happened to office-supply superstores will happen among other categories. After undergoing a meaningful process of consolidation," as an analyst puts it, the No. 1 and 2 players will remain, and maybe a third." But the specialty shop has not outlived its usefulness. For all their overwhelming inventory, superstores provoke a question of almost Zen-like clarity: What about consumers whose choice is not to have a choice? What if all a shopper wants is, as one retail analyst puts it, "to go on an errand instead of a shopping excursion?" In the cyclical nature of retail, the superstore is creating a demand for the very store it puts out of business -- the small single-category specialty shop.
"Consumers like having an alternative," says Maureen McGrath, a vice president in the research department at Smith Barney. "They want to have the convenience of buying a screwdriver without having to cross a 300-foot parking lot and a 125,000-square-foot superstore. Superstores are great; that's a great way to spend an afternoon. But that's a lot of square feet to be covering if all you need is a box of nails." Still, even mall developers now are routinely including one or more category killers to serve the anchoring function that department stores once did, while keeping a handful of specialty shops to meet the traditional needs of customers.
The category killer has indeed become a distinct breed of retailer, as the F.T.C. suggests. It's a place to shop, yes, but a place to linger, too, to take a family on a Saturday afternoon, to meet a friend for breakfast, to steal a few minutes for yourself on the way home from work, to daydream, perhaps, over a magazine and a cup of coffee that's infinitely more aromatic than anything at the local coffee shop. In this respect, the superstore is no different from the suburban shopping center before it, or the downtown department store before that. In the midst of all the hyperbole -- "super-," "mega-," "hyper-," "giga," "-max," -- it has been easy to overlook a simple fact. Sure, a superstore is a stationery shop or hardware store writ huge. But far more to the point, it's also a mall writ small.
Most Americans of a certain sentimental bent still harbor a soft spot for the mom-and-pop shop. Show them the shell of a department store in some middle American downtown, and they'll feel a pang for the distance between what a community must have imagined its future would be and what it has become. Even the once-unstoppable mall, as it exhibits signs of mortality, can evoke a fleeting nostalgia for a postwar period of economic expansion and optimism. But when the time comes to bid farewell to the heyday of the superstore -- and come it will, one day deep in the next century -- what will we be mourning?
Bigness, no doubt, but bigness of a type peculiar to the late 20th century, an era when it was still easy to believe that more was more, not less.

Bendel's is now owned by the Limited, which bought the historical value of the store. This bag's probably been through a million marketing meetings." T.K.

HEADLINE: Cable Ruling Endangers Access to C-Span

 BODY:

To the Editor:
On March 31 the Supreme Court upheld the 1992 Federal law requiring cable television systems to carry local broadcast stations (front page, April 1). 
 While wishing to support local media, both Congress and the Court fail to recognize that in some instances cable systems have been required to carry locally originated home shopping channels at the expense of C-Span, arguably the most effective televised channel that consistently serves the goals of an informed citizenry. C-Span estimates it has access to 3.5 million fewer viewers since the "must-carry" law went into effect.
That the Court held in favor of broadcasters on economic grounds and the need to support the broadcasting industry as much as on First Amendment grounds is disturbing. This is why Justice Stephen G. Breyer, voting with the majority, felt compelled to add a separate opinion disagreeing with the Court's questionable economic analysis.
In the dissenting opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said that the Court "trivializes the First Amendment issue at stake in this case" by deferring to "a highly dubious economic theory."
Only a ham-handed Congress, and a Court prepared to overstep its authority and use economic hypotheses to meddle with economic policy, could pass and uphold a law that is supposed to serve the larger public good by encouraging, nearly forcing in some instances, cable systems to drop C-Span.

HEADLINE: Film Studios Play a Game Of Summer Maneuvers

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, April 6

 BODY:
Will the Walt Disney Company blink and move its summer action film "Con Air" off its current opening date, June 6, because 20th Century Fox has defiantly moved its "Speed 2: Cruise Control" to the same weekend?
Will "Titanic," probably the most expensive film ever made (rumored at as much as $180 million and climbing) be completed in time to meet its current scheduled opening date, July 2? 
 Will Steven Spielberg's "Lost World: Jurassic Park," which opens on May 23, obliterate other movies opening in the weeks that follow?
Summer fever has seized Hollywood. "Studios Get Summer Sweats," said a recent headline in Variety. William Mechanic, chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, put it another way. "Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, practically every weekend is booked," he said the other day.
Perhaps a dozen and possibly 14 or 15 films are opening this summer, each of which will cost, with marketing, well over $100 million. Never before have so many blockbuster movies been released in a single year, no less a single season. The result is a panicky game of chicken Hollywood style, in which studios position themselves for the best opening dates in the summer, the season of peak moviegoing in the nation.
"It's not a business for the weak at heart," said Robert G. Friedman, vice chairman of the Paramount Motion Picture Group. "You have to constantly watch the market and be flexible enough to change."
Given the sometimes perilous economics of the movie business, positioning for a single weekend is extraordinarily important. "We all know we can pretty much determine what your picture will do overall based on your opening weekend," said John Goldwyn, another top Paramount executive. "It's terribly important to own a weekend so you can get as much of the audience you're targeting."
Mr. Mechanic, at Fox, went one step further. "Unfortunately it's reached a point where your fate is written after the first matinee in New York," he said. "It's almost reached a point, one shot and you're out."
The result of this concern, some call it alarm, about opening weekends is a ferocious summertime competition among studio executives to position, to compete, to joust and feint over opening dates.
Early on, two films, Universal's "Lost World: Jurassic Park" (opening on May 23) and Warner Brothers' "Batman and Robin" (June 20) staked out their opening weekends. Every other studio ran for cover: no executive or film maker wanted to release a blockbuster film on those dates or even the following weekend.
Mr. Spielberg's "Jurassic Park" and the Batman franchise have proved to be enormously lucrative and now have built-in audiences. The early Hollywood buzz is that the new "Jurassic Park" is the film to beat this summer, while the new "Batman" (with George Clooney) will probably open to a huge weekend box office, but will quickly run into trouble from the competition.
But Barry Reardon, president of distribution at Warner Brothers, said with a laugh: "I'm not one bit uneasy. Look, everyone has cleared out in front of me. In back of me, I've got 'Hercules,' which is for kids, and 'Out to Sea,' which is Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon and, essentially 'Grumpy Old Men' on a ship. I'm not worried."
Mr. Reardon's lack of concern is probably justified. Disney's animated "Hercules," which opens on June 27, is aimed at parents with young children, while Fox's comedy "Out to Sea," which opens on May 30, is targeted on the older audience that has made the "Grumpy Old Men" movies successful. Neither audience is the prime "Batman" crowd, which is mainly teen-agers and 20-somethings.
Certainly the most discussed shift so far -- and more shifts will undoubtedly take place in the next few weeks -- involves the decision by Fox to abruptly change the opening date of "Speed 2: Cruise Control." (Instead of terrorists taking over a bus, as in "Speed," the new film has bad guys taking over a cruise ship.) Initially the film was set to open on July 2, but two big films are to open that weekend, which is probably the busiest four-day period of the moviegoing year.
The two Goliaths are Sony's "Men in Black," a sci-fi adventure starring Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, and "Titanic," the James Cameron epic about the ill-fated liner. "Titanic" is so expensive that it is being financed by two studios, Fox and Paramount.
Mr. Mechanic, at Fox, decided to move off that date and placed the new "Speed" against Disney's "Con Air," which opens on June 6. That action drama, starring Nicolas Cage, involves mayhem on a plane carrying convicts. Both films are colliding head on in pursuit of the same audience: young men.
There may be some personal issues involved. It is known around town that senior executives at Fox and at Disney are not too fond of each other and are in open competition. But Mr. Mechanic denied this.
"We moved the movie because it was a great date," he said. "It wasn't about 'Con Air.' Besides, we have an action movie with Sandra Bullock: we have a big female audience here, too."
Although rival studio executives said that Disney would probably decide to move the opening of "Con Air," Richard W. Cook, chairman of the Disney Motion Picture Group, said that this was not so. "We basically settled to open two weeks after 'Jurassic' and two weeks before 'Batman,' " he said. "We settled on that day and we're not going to move."
Adding to the unease this summer is "Titanic," whose cast includes Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as lovers aboard the doomed ship. (A musical about the Titanic is scheduled to open on Broadway on April 23.) There are rumors aplenty that the movie will not be completed by Mr. Cameron in time for release on the choice July 4th weekend.
The options? It could move to July 11 against another blockbuster, Warner Brothers' "Contact," the Robert Zemeckis film starring Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey, based on the Carl Sagan novel, or to the following weekend when several smaller films are to open, or to July 25 when two more mega-expensive movies are to open: Sony's "Air Force One," starring Harrison Ford as a President threatened by terrorists, and Warner Brothers' "Conspiracy Theory," an action film in which Mel Gibson plays a conspiracy-obsessed New York taxi driver who meets up with Julia Roberts as a Justice Department lawyer.
In the meantime the jockeying continues. Fox recently moved one of its costlier movies, "Alien Resurrection," with Sigourney Weaver and Winona Ryder, to the autumn to avoid the summer onslaught.
"Are we getting nervous now?" asked Tom Sherak, chairman of the 20th Century Fox Domestic Film Group. "I'm sleeping less and less."

HEADLINE: Latins See Dickering on Sale of Jets to Chile as End of U.S. Ban

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, April 6

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's decision last week to allow the Lockheed Martin Corporation to submit a technical bid for sales of F-16 fighter planes to Chile is being widely viewed as the end of a United States ban on high-technology arms sales to Latin America.
While Administration officials say that President Clinton has not yet approved any sale of fighter planes to Chile, they acknowledged that permitting Lockheed to discuss technical and pricing information on the F-16 with the Chilean Government gives a strong indication that the United States is on the verge of relaxing the ban. 
 "It is very rare for the Government to release this data and then not allow the sale to go through," said an Administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The final decision is still under review, but we wanted to allow American companies to submit bids to Chile before its March 31 deadline."
In Santiago, Gen. Fernando Rojas Vender, head of the Chilean Air Force, expressed joy that the United States had allowed American weapons makers to take part in the bidding, saying Lockheed's technical bid on the F-16 was "a very important step forward."
Chile, which is seeking to buy at least 20 advanced fighter planes, has said that it is interested in Lockheed's F-16 but that it is also considering buying planes from other countries that have no restrictions, including Swedish JAS-39 Gripen and French Mirage 2000-5 fighters.
Even Argentina, which has opposed lifting the United States weapons ban for fear of a regional arms race, has shifted its position, apparently conceding that United States arms sales to Latin America are inevitable.
A spokesman for Argentina's Foreign Ministry said on Friday that while his Government is still strongly opposed to a regional arms buildup, it is not concerned whether the United States removes or maintains the ban, especially since Argentina has no conflicts with its neighbors.
Military analysts said Argentina initially opposed relaxing the United States ban because it could not afford to buy the advanced weapons because of sharp budget cutbacks.
Argentina's military spending has declined 75 percent in the last 10 years after the country's return to democracy from military dictatorship. Meanwhile, Chile, which has the strongest economy in Latin America, has increased its military budget, which by law receives a substantial percentage of the country's copper revenues.
The analysts have said that the sale of F-16's would change the balance of air power in South America to favor Chile, which would have technology far superior to Argentina's, unless the Argentines also came up with the money to buy F-16's.
"This is about military prestige," said Wendy Hunter, a professor of political science at Vanderbilt University. "Argentina doesn't think that if the Chileans get new F-16's that they will come charging over the Andean ice field and attack them. Argentina is embarrassed because by comparison it has very little money to spend on new weapons and believes that without superior firepower, it doesn't have prestige."
While Argentina, a close United States ally, is publicly saying that it is no longer concerned about the possible lifting of the American arms ban, Government officials from both countries confirmed that Argentina is still lobbying the Clinton Administration not to allow the sale to Chile, or at the very least to permit the sale of less-advanced F-16's.
Indeed, some Chilean military officials have said that they are worried that in its final decision, the United States will not sell Chile the latest generation of F-16's, a move the Chilean military officials said could force them to take their business elsewhere.
Administration officials said the decision to allow Lockheed to bid for Chile's fighter planes was due mainly to pressure by United States weapons contractors who maintain that the arms ban is preventing them from competing in a potentially lucrative market that is open to foreign competitors.
The American weapons contractors cite Peru's recent purchase of a dozen Russian MIG-29's at a cost estimated at $350 million -- business the weapons contractors say is needed to preserve jobs in the United States.
But critics of relaxing the United States arms ban say that democracy is still very fragile in Latin America and that many countries do not have full civilian control over their armed forces and thus are ill equipped to regulate the new military technology.
They point to Peru's MIG purchase as another sign that the military can override other domestic and even regional concerns. While other South American countries have larger air forces than Peru's, United States analysts who assess the balance of power in Latin America said that Peru's Russian MIG's were the most advanced. The Russian MIG-29 fighter performs air interception and air-to-ground missions, military analysts say, that are not very useful in the kind of jungle wars that Peru has fought.
"While I don't see an immediate arms race developing in the region, I do see these advanced weapons purchases contributing to destabilizing relations between countries," said Sarah Walkling, a senior analyst for the Arms Control Association, a Washington-based research agency.

Tourists Shrug Off a Hepatitis Alert

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: MARSHALL, Mich., April 5

 BODY:
Of all the things that can go wrong for a tourist town, national publicity about an outbreak of infectious disease has to rank near the top of the list, right up there with losing a few bathers to shark attacks.
But this peaceful, 167-year-old town in south-central Michigan seems to be shrugging off its unwanted moment of fame as the epicenter of an outbreak of hepatitis A. Bed-and-breakfasts like the National House Inn, which occupies an elegant brick building erected in 1835 in the center of town, were full. And there was plenty of activity this weekend at the many antique stores and other shops along Michigan Avenue, the main street, which still looks much as it did a century ago. 
 Tourists either said that they were not worried about the widely reported outbreak or had not realized that this town had been hit the hardest. Everybody seemed to have heard that it had only been linked to frozen, contaminated Mexican strawberries served in school cafeterias.
"We haven't had any contact with the children," said Helen Kreuze, of Battle Creek. She was spending her honeymoon at the National House Inn with her husband, Nelson, a retired computer programmer. "They really did a good job of giving immunizations, so there shouldn't be a problem."
The Rev. Rodney Buzzard, of Auburn, Ind., who sat near the Kreuzes in the inn's breakfast parlor on Saturday morning, said he had known of some hepatitis cases in Michigan but his eyebrows rose and his jaw dropped when he was told that 97 of the 185 cases nationwide had occurred in this town of 7,000 people.
After a brief pause, Mr. Buzzard decided that might mean some bargains besides the antiques. "I'll bet the best place in the world to order strawberries is Marshall," provided they are fresh, he said.
Dr. Craig N. Shapiro, a hepatitis expert at the Federal Government's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said that visitors to Marshall would not be risking infection unless they stayed in the home of someone with the virus. "A general tourist who is traveling there doesn't have to worry," he said.
Hepatitis A is transmitted through close personal contact, food, water and human waste. Nobody can know whether any tourists have caught the virus here, because it has an incubation period of two to seven weeks. But the odds are extremely low, Dr. Shapiro said, because the virus has affected only students and teachers who ate the contaminated strawberries, rather than local restaurant workers, for example.
Hepatitis A typically produces flulike symptoms and jaundice. The disease is usually mild and can last a few weeks. Nine students and school employees were briefly hospitalized here.
Marshall has weathered setbacks before. Founded in 1830 and named for John Marshall, the former Chief Justice of the United States, the town almost became Michigan's capital. The main advocate, State Senator James Wright Gordon, optimistically built a Governor's mansion here in 1839, a two-story house in the Greek Revival style.
The mansion, now occupied by a chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, is in a neighborhood known here as Capitol Hill. But Lansing became the capital after the State Senate defeated Marshall's bid by a single vote in 1847.
Halfway between Detroit and Chicago, Marshall boomed when the railroad arrived in 1844 and then suddenly suffered an economic collapse when the main railroad switching station was moved in 1872 to Jackson, 30 miles to the east. The town has changed little since then, mainly because of a wealthy industrialist whose family made a fortune selling what they called "rupture appliances" -- belt-like devices commonly worn by hernia sufferers before modern surgical techniques were developed.
The industrialist, Harold C. Brooks, became Mayor in 1925 and for 60 years poured his money into preserving the mid-19th-century brick buildings, which have attracted tourists ever since. There are even a few stone buildings, like the three-story Darling and Daughter Variety Store on Michigan Avenue, which has a mansard roof and a facade lavishly decorated with Corinthian columns and a large stone balcony overhanging the sidewalk. In 1991, the Interior Department designated an area that included 867 buildings here, including downtown, as a National Historic Landmark District.
Restaurants like the Coffee Pot, a diner in the middle of town where the popular roast beef and mashed potatoes special is just $4.65, are still housed in the old brick buildings. At midday on Friday, local mechanical engineers from a test course for trucks on the outskirts of town were trading jokes at the restaurant about the hepatitis outbreak.
But one of the engineers, Douglas Nielsen, spoke for the group and many town residents when he stood up to leave after lunch. "Of all the cities in the United States," he said, "why did it have to happen here?"

HEADLINE: Broadening the Appeal of Classical Music Radio

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
A year ago, Rick Cohn was considering how to recast a low-rated classic rock radio station in Tulsa, Okla. There, commuter trips last no longer than two singles, a jingle and a newscast. His station was competing with 32 others, including 6 rock stations, in a market with just $30 million a year to spend on radio advertising.
When he heard a pitch from SW Network, a Sony Corporation unit with a classical music format modeled after Top 40 rock radio, Mr. Cohn, the station's general manager, was skeptical. Classical music "was not even in my realm of consciousness," he said. 
 He got an eye-opener when audience research showed "there was a hole bigger than Dallas" among Tulsa radio listeners. The Oil Patch city, which takes pride in its symphony, ballet and opera, had been without a classical music station since 1994.
When Mr. Cohn told his bosses at Shamrock Communications Inc. he wanted to unplug rock for Rachmaninoff, "they thought I'd gone tipsy."
But a year after switching to the nation's only syndicated, 24-hour classical feed, Mr. Cohn's station, KCFM, has seen its advertising sales rebound and its audience grow by 50 percent, to a 2.9 percent share of the market.
Some listeners reacted patronizingly to SW's playlist of short recordings, but hundreds more were delighted. Some wrote letters, pledging to support the station's advertisers. One of the station's clients, a local BMW dealer, is pulling ads from competing stations and buying more on KCFM. And the Tulsa symphony credits the station with reversing a decline in ticket sales among younger patrons.
"We've got the wind at our back," Mr. Cohn said.
Tulsa is one of SW's most successful footholds. The fledgling network with 11 affiliates from Monterey, Calif., to Kennebunk, Me., is trying to bring classical radio to large numbers of people by redefining the standard repertory with familiar movie soundtracks, symphony excerpts and breezy disk jockeys who forgo announcing orchestral credits.
It is a strategy heavily influenced by baby boomer demographics and the new economics of radio-industry consolidation. So far, acceptance is slow, but the format has created controversy among the nation's traditional classical radio broadcasters, who mostly create their own programming.
Called SW Classical, the format drops some staples of classical radio, including opera and live concerts, as well as soundtracks exceeding 52 minutes during the day. SW loosely modeled the format from the programming developed in the early 1990's at Classic FM, a successful London station now owned by GWR Group P.L.C. of Britain.
Anthony J. Rudel, SW's programming vice president, called the format a contrarian play for group owners, who can now control up to five FM stations in the largest markets. His argument is that broadcasters that own several stations in a market can broaden their audiences without cannibalizing the listeners of their mainstream rock stations.
"The format is from album rock," said Mr. Rudel, a former program director at WQXR-FM in New York, which is owned by The New York Times Company. "This isn't groundbreaking. Our problem is to sell over the hurdle that classical is for old people."
In truth, SW is battling on two fronts. To win converts in places like Tulsa, industry analysts say SW must disprove the industry stereotype that classical radio wins an older audience unattractive to advertisers. It is an audience of interest to SW's parent, which owns several recording labels, include Sony Classical. Mr. Rudel must also win over critics, who accuse him of "giving the listeners pablum" for classical programming.
Saul Levine, owner of KKGO-FM, a Los Angeles classical music station, said: "To me, that's an embarrassment. We don't take a movement and say, 'Here is some Brahms.' " They're in effect saying, 'We don't want to tax your mind.' "
In a matchup that will be closely watched in the industry, Mr. Levine intends to go on the air this month with a new station broadcasting original programming to San Diego from a Tijuana, Mexico, frequency, XBACH-AM. SW's newest affiliate, KFSD-FM in Escondido, Calif., went on the air in February.
"We're going to beat them with traditional classic music," Mr. Levine said.
Mr. Rudel scoffs. "The old-style stations approach classical music like a museum. Don't touch. Don't enjoy.
"We're in the entertainment business; we make it interesting," continued Mr. Rudel, the son of the opera conductor and director Julius Rudel and the author of three books on classical music.
SW is alone among commercial syndicators in supplying 24 hours of classical programming, although National Public Radio and Public Radio International also syndicate classical programs to noncommercial member stations. SW, like ABC Radio and Westwood One, also supplies short segments of entertainment news to 800 stations in a barter-for-time arrangement.
Syndicators make a living selling national ads on their shows. Since SW's classical affiliates cumulatively are still too small for a national advertiser, stations pay for programming and sell their own ads, Daniel J. Forth, SW's president, explained.
About 460 stations play some classical music. Only 40 are commercial. As only commercial stations draw Arbitron rankings, quantifying the market for classical radio is a guess at best.
The format seems to be benefiting from use of classical recordings in film and television and a shift in baby boomers' musical tastes, said Robert Unmacht, editor of the M Street Journal, an industry newsletter. In the 240 markets surveyed by the Arbitron radio ratings service, classical radio is on seven-tenths of 1 percent of the stations, but wins 1.4 percent of the listeners, he said. By contrast, 15 percent of the Arbitron-ranked stations play country music, but they draw just 11 percent of listeners.
Conventional radio research focuses on how to split a genre like rock into classic and alternative. But in one unusual study, the nation's top three formats -- country, news talk and oldies, respectively -- failed in popularity contests. Classical came in second to Motown when audiences were asked their preferences for individual music selections, said Jon A. Coleman, a radio consultant in Research Triangle Park, N.C., who conducted the research.
"People intellectually say they want more variety," Mr. Coleman said. "Behaviorally, that's not how they respond. The reality is they want what is familiar.
"Tony's notion," he said, referring to Mr. Rudel, "is that classical music is part of our lives. We just don't know it. He wants to tap into that."

HEADLINE: THE RENT DEBATE: THE GENERAL;
Bruno, in Private War Room, Sees Himself as Pragmatist

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 6

 BODY:
For the first time since the early 1970's, the state laws that regulate apartment rents are in serious jeopardy. In a legislative year that resembles a minefield, rent is making the loudest bang, tying up talks on the budget, taxes and welfare, looming as a serious campaign issue and exposing deep divisions among Republicans.
It has come to this because of one man, Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader of the State Senate, whose district near here has more farms than apartments. Previous Republican leaders here deferred on the rent issue to the political weight of millions of tenants, but Mr. Bruno, the affable, silver-haired former owner of a telecommunications business, has declared war. He has vowed to phase out regulation over two years, and said that if he did not get his way the current rent laws would not be renewed when they expire after June 15. 
 Rent regulation "is the best example of government at its worst that I can point to in this state," he said in an interview on Friday. He argued that it has discouraged new construction, worsening the housing shortage -- and thus, paradoxically, driving up rents -- and effectively forcing residents of unregulated apartments to subsidize those in regulated apartments. He said that deregulating the market would stimulate construction, adding $5 billion to the New York City economy over a few years.
Mr. Bruno's insistence has several Republican senators, from New York City and its suburbs, fearful that killing rent regulation would cause a backlash against them.
The first major test arrives Monday, when the Senate votes whether to take up a Democratic bill to extend rent laws for another four years. Mr. Bruno has vowed to keep the bill bottled in committee, and even the handful of Republican senators who favor rent regulation are hesitant to oppose him.
"As far as we're concerned, Monday is a litmus test," said Michael McKee, the rent law campaign manager for the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition. "They can either support Joe Bruno or support the tenants."
Others, notably Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, have played down Monday's vote, stressing that it is only the beginning of a lengthy fight.
Mr. Bruno -- who cheerfully concedes that his district has no rent-regulated units -- insists that his opposition is a matter of principle.
Government "is over-regulatory, to the detriment of the majority of people," said Mr. Bruno, who was first elected to the State Senate in 1976. "I got into politics to try and do something about that."
Mr. Bruno, 67, from Rensselaer County, said his opposition to rent rules is a natural extension of a view of government that calls for lower taxes, less regulation and letting the free market hold sway. As evidence of his conviction, he noted that he began calling for an end to the rent laws a decade ago.
With one notable exception -- Sheldon Silver, the Assembly Speaker -- few of the most involved people on either side of the dispute, from legislators to landlords and tenant organizers, doubt that Mr. Bruno's position is a genuine matter of belief.
"I think he sincerely believes the ultra-right-wing view of things, and is quite sincere when he says things would be better without rent regulation," Mr. McKee said. "I think he's out of his mind, but I believe he believes it."
Of course, it could be in everyone's interest to say so. The Republicans and landlords want to portray Mr. Bruno, a powerful ally, as a man of principle. And the Democrats and tenant groups would like nothing more than to make him out to be a Gingrichian ideologue.
At stake is rent stabilization, which begun in 1968 and which caps rents and rent increases for 1.1 million apartments, and rent control, the World War II-era system that imposes more stringent controls on 80,000 apartments. Most of the affected units are in New York City, where almost half the rental apartments come under one system or the other.
Mr. Bruno argues that the wealthiest renters benefit most from rent regulation, a contention aggressively contested by the tenant groups and Democratic lawmakers. It is the tenants living in Manhattan, "between 92d Street and 52d," he said, who "are the ones that are taking advantage of the system. I don't blame them. I don't fault them. The system allows it, and they're the beneficiaries."
Mr. Bruno said he understood people's fears about eliminating the system, but he insisted that, overall, deregulation would lower rents.
"They don't focus on the merits: Is rent stabilization good or bad? It's all emotional," he said. "The concept of government regulating people's lives is wrong when it's not necessary."
One of the few players in the drama who publicly questions Mr. Bruno's sincerity is Mr. Silver, who sees in the Senator's intransigence a covert strategy by the Senate leader and Gov. George E. Pataki. By this view, Mr. Bruno is the Governor's stalking horse, taking an extreme position that will allow Mr. Pataki to ride to the rescue with a compromise that eliminates some rent regulations but allows him to take credit for having saved the rest.
"Maybe the Senator is out there being a front man for a position the Governor advocates," Mr. Silver said.
Both the Senator and the Governor insist that this is not the case. But Mr. Pataki has added to such speculation by saying that he would broker the dispute rather than take sides, while indicating that he, too, wanted to end regulation, but more gradually.
Mr. Bruno's critics also note that last year, landlords' groups like the Rent Stabilization Association and the Neighborhood Preservation Association contributed more than $700,000 to state campaigns, overwhelmingly to Republicans, and that this figure does not include contributions made by individual building owners. Of the money donated by the landlords' groups, $174,000 went to the New York State Senate Republican Campaign Committee, controlled by Mr. Bruno.
"Any opponent of anything usually ends up saying, 'You're a tool of the contributors that oppose my point of view,' " Mr. Bruno said..
Three years ago, before he became majority leader, Mr. Bruno waged a successful campaign removing apartments from rent regulation if the rent was over $2,000 a month and the tenants earned more than $250,000 a year in two consecutive years. Some legislators speculated that Mr. Bruno would eventually settle for lowering that income limit, but he insisted he would not. Except for talking about a longer phase-out of rent laws, and making exceptions for the poor, elderly and disabled, he has not softened his position since announcing last December that he would force an end to the controls.
He warned that Mr. Silver and others questioned his resolve at their peril. "If they think they're going to take me to June 15," Mr. Bruno said, "rent control is going to cease overnight."
Lawmakers said they could not recall a leader of either house of the Legislature, from either party, who held so firmly on an issue that put his followers in political jeopardy.
But Mr. Bruno argued that the threat to Republican Senators had been overstated. "I don't believe that any one, single issue will ever affect an election, not one issue," he said.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "THE PLAYERS: How They Stand"
The positions of the three main players vary in the debate over New York State's rent laws, which expire after June 15. Here is a brief description of each:
THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER, JOSEPH L. BRUNO, REPUBLICAN OF RENSSELAER COUNTY Mr. Bruno has staked out the strongest position against the rent laws. Under his plan, any unit that became vacant after June 15 would be decontrolled, a policy known as vacancy decontrol.
He would expand the existing policy known as luxury decontrol, allowing rents of more expensive apartments occupied by wealthier tenants to reach market rates. And by mid-1999, he would decontrol all units, except those occupied by elderly, disabled and poor tenants.
ASSEMBLY SPEAKER SHELDON SILVER, DEMOCRAT OF MANHATTAN Mr. Silver has called for simply extending the current rent laws, and would even strengthen certain protections for tenants. But he has not ruled out expanding luxury decontrol to more units as a compromise.
GOV. GEORGE E. PATAKI, REPUBLICAN Mr. Pataki has tried to keep his position on the rent laws vague, saying he wants to broker a deal between Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno.
But he has called for gradually ending some, and possibly most, rent regulations -- though he would maintain protections for elderly, disabled and poor tenants. And he recently acknowledged that he supports vacancy decontrol.

HEADLINE: CLINTON TO PRESS ISRAELIS TO ASSIST THE PALESTINIANS

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, Minn., April 6

 BODY:
As Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel met with King Hussein of Jordan here to discuss eroding confidence in the Middle East peace effort, President Clinton prepared today to push Mr. Netanyahu to make good on his promises to improve the lives of Palestinians.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Netanyahu will meet in Washington on Monday in a hastily arranged effort to stem the rising distrust between Palestinians and Israelis and to bring stability to the region. One proposal is to construct new Arab housing in East Jerusalem. Nearly three weeks of demonstrations and violence have followed the Israeli decision -- despite American opposition -- to build new Jewish housing in mostly Arab East Jerusalem, at a place the Palestinians call Jabal Abu Ghneim and the Israelis, Har Homa. 
 Mr. Netanyahu has proposed breaking the cycle of violence by moving directly to intensive negotiations with Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, on the final political status of Jerusalem and the Palestinian Authority, and he discussed that proposal with King Hussein, recuperating here after a prostate operation at the Mayo Clinic on Saturday.
In a short briefing with reporters after the meeting at the clinic, Mr. Netanyahu said that the King was recovering and that he wished him well. "He is a good friend of peace and of Israel," he said.
Mr. Clinton, partly on the King's advice, is leaning away from dramatic gestures like final-status talks, fearing that proposals not well prepared will fail, causing further damage, senior American officials say. "Right now we're looking at more short-term confidence-builders," an official said. "We've got to get Netanyahu and Arafat talking again."
The Americans also want to know if Mr. Netanyahu, who leads the conservative Likud Party, is serious about trying to form a government of national unity with the Labor Party, as he has sometimes suggested. Mr. Netanyahu has lost popularity in Israel, and a unity government would be better able to negotiate and ratify a final settlement with the Palestinians that could give them a limited form of statehood and a capital in part of Jerusalem.
"I wouldn't rule out something dramatic, like a Camp David summit, down the road," a senior American official said. "Obviously our position would be different if there's a unity government. But what is vital now is to restore confidence on both sides -- so that the Israelis feel safe from terrorism and the Palestinians feel there are visible benefits from the peace process."
To help restore confidence quickly, Mr. Clinton will push Mr. Netanyahu to announce and begin construction of Arab housing alongside the new Jewish housing in East Jerusalem, American officials said. Mr. Netanyahu has said he will not stop the Jewish construction.
So the Americans, despite their view that changes to Jerusalem should be a part of the final-status talks, do not expect him to reverse himself, as he also refused to do in September when the Israelis opened an archeological tunnel near a major Islamic holy site in the Old City, setting off deadly clashes that killed some 80 Palestinians and 15 Israelis.
But the Americans want at least a private promise to avoid construction on disputed land during peace talks. On Saturday, Mr. Arafat demanded that Mr. Netanyahu stop "the Judaization of Jerusalem" by construction of settlements. He has sent Hanan Ashrawi, a well-known Palestinian official, to consult with Washington.
Mr. Clinton will also push Mr. Netanyahu to make good quickly on other confidence-building measures listed in the Hebron accords. Those include opening the airport in Gaza so Palestinians can travel abroad without going to Israel or Jordan; safe passage between Gaza and the West Bank; access to port installations for faster transit of goods; an easing of restrictions to allow greater economic activity in the Palestinian Authority, and more permits for Palestinians to travel to jobs in Israel.
Mr. Clinton is also pressing Mr. Arafat to forswear violence and terrorism and to resume security cooperation with Israel, to build up Israeli confidence shaken by the renewal of suicide bombings.
Israeli officials say Mr. Netanyahu wants Mr. Arafat to make an absolute commitment to stop violence if peace talks are to resume. Mr. Netanyahu has charged that Mr. Arafat gave "a green light" to the militant Palestinians of Hamas to use suicide bombers against the Israelis in response to the Har Homa decision.
While not supporting Mr. Netanyahu's charge, the Americans have also demanded that Mr. Arafat give "a red light" to terrorism and violence. But the Palestinians complain that their newly empowered police force is being asked to keep the peace so Israel can build more settlements in Jerusalem without negotiating Jerusalem's status. They say Mr. Netanyahu, through provocations like Har Homa, is trying to destroy the Oslo accords and then blame the Palestinians.
After meeting Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Clinton and his special envoy, Dennis B. Ross, will consult the Arabs. They want Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat talking again, and if that can occur in the context of confidence-building measures, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright may make her first trip to the Middle East to preside over the occasion.
"She will carry a lot of capital with her first trip to the region, and we don't want to waste it," a senior official said.
Mr. Arafat is skeptical about Mr. Netanyahu's offer of accelerated final-status talks in the next six months, with a Camp David-style summit meeting if necessary, and then, if all fails, a continuation of the gradual Israeli troop withdrawals laid out in Oslo. Mr. Arafat is concerned that Mr. Netanyahu is simply trying to avoid the peace agreement's formula of gradual troop pullouts and increasing autonomy for the Palestinian Authority. Under Oslo, the final-status talks are supposed to be concluded by May 1999.
King Hussein's Prime Minister, Abdel Salam Majali, said Jordan "has no problem beginning final-status talks provided the steps spelled out in the Oslo accords for autonomy proceed" on schedule.
Mr. Majali was with Mr. Netanyahu at the clinic, and said the Israeli's visit "is a generous gesture toward King Hussein and Jordan."
Meeting King Hussein last week, Mr. Clinton said he was "prepared to do anything I can" to get the peace effort "back on track and move it forward." With Mr. Netanyahu about to arrive, he said, "the less I say about it, the more likely I am to have some success," citing a time frame of "the next two to three weeks."
Mr. Clinton "is very energized on this," a senior aide said. "He wants to make a difference. But while there is a clear sense of urgency here, we also need to do this right."
That was also King Hussein's advice. He said the Americans should be more aggressive as "the arbiter" in shaping a just peace, and not merely be "the messenger" among the parties.
Ms. Albright would be welcome in the region, the King said, adding, "But I think it would be better if she visits at a time where there could be a visible result and some progress."

HEADLINE: The Market vs. Larry Flynt;
Hustler Losing Out to Cable, Video and Web

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
The movie appeared in theaters as "The People vs. Larry Flynt." But as Larry Flynt himself has observed, it might have been called "$60 Million Worth of Free Advertising."
These days, Mr. Flynt's empire can use any free help it gets. He has been placing increasing emphasis on what is euphemistically called the "men's sophisticates" magazine category, even as the cost of renting a raunchy video can be cheaper than the $5.99 cover price of Hustler and as sexually explicit cable television channels and Web sites vie for his target audience. As a result, Mr. Flynt's operation seems to be falling behind in the swiftly evolving X-rated market. 
 Hollywood limelight aside, Larry Flynt Publishing Inc., solely owned by its namesake, is so secretive that financial information on the company is as wispy as the clothing on a centerfold model. But there are signs of trouble.
Within the last 18 months, the company has sold or closed a handful of magazines created for a more mainstream market, like Super Cycle and Maternity Fashions. The new focus: a group of 20 titles that -- with a few relatively staid exceptions like PC Laptop and the music-oriented Rap Pages -- is skewed toward sexually explicit publications like Leg World and Busty. Retrenching to this hard-core core is a risky strategy at a time when large chunks of the readership are finding the same photography and mindset through other media -- often for less.
Circulation is down, an especially damaging situation for a company that relies heavily on single-copy sales, rather than subscription or ad sales, for its estimated $100 million annual revenue. The flagship, Hustler, sold two million copies a month in 1976. But these days Hustler's press run is less than a million copies, and on average more than half are returned unsold, according to the 1996 statement of ownership on file at the Long Beach, Calif., postal service branch, where the company is required to submit audited figures to receive second-class postage privileges.
The skin-magazine business generally is "not as hugely profitable as it was," said Reed Phillips, a principal in DeSilva & Phillips, a New York investment bank that advises media companies. "The corner video store has made a big difference for these magazines." Playboy and Penthouse have also seen their circulations plummet in recent years.
"The readers are aging with the owners," says Martin S. Walker, chairman of Walker Communications, a longtime adviser to media companies. "They're not keeping up with the fantasies of youth."
By all accounts, Mr. Flynt, who declined to be interviewed for this article, runs an autocracy that allows him to make business decisions virtually unchallenged. There is no clear explanation why he has not followed a path similar to magazines like Playboy and Penthouse, which, under similar pressure, have inched their way toward a certain self-defined degree of respectability and have branched out. A full 58 percent of Playboy Enterprises Inc.'s estimated $7.6 million profit for the fiscal year that will end in June, for example, will come from its cable and video businesses, and just 18 percent from Playboy magazine.
Instead, Mr. Flynt has chosen to stay focused on print and on making Hustler "the most outrageous magazine out there" -- in the words of Hustler's executive editor, Allan MacDonell, to whom Mr. Flynt referred all questions.
Nor is there a clear explanation for the sale late last year of one of Mr. Flynt's chief assets, the Flynt Distribution Company, which handled the newsstand placement not only for Flynt publications but also for others, including newsstand copies of The New York Review of Books.
Mr. MacDonell said Mr. Flynt started the distribution business in 1976, when the magazine -- then only two years old -- had a circulation of 3.8 million and the founder "saw the checks that were going to the distributors."
Last year's decision to sell the operation was made to focus once again on the magazines themselves, Mr. MacDonell said.
Neither Flynt nor the buyer -- the Curtis Circulation Company of Hackensack, N.J. -- would disclose the price paid for the distribution company. But Mr. Phillips, whose investment firm was not involved in the transaction, sees the sale itself as a likely sign of financial trouble.
"It probably wasn't working, economically," he said. "It would be advantageous to have your own distribution company. Certainly, if it was doing all right, and they were satisfied with it, they would have kept it."
To be sure, Flynt Distribution could make for strange rackfellows. Michael Johnson, manager of direct sales and subscriptions for The New York Review of Books, said that under a contract acquired through purchase of another distributor, Flynt had handled about 5,000 copies of his publication's 140,000-copy press run. Unfortunately for The Review, the readers frequenting newsstands that carried Hustler and its spinoffs were not necessarily a literary crowd.
"We were such an odd title for them," Mr. Johnson said. "If we had relied on them for real distribution with profits attached to it, we would have failed miserably." His publication saw much better results through direct sales, he said.
Anthony DiBisceglie, director of client services for Curtis Circulation, said interest stemming from the movie had lifted sales of Hustler, though he refused to give specific numbers.
But Mr. Phillips said any uptick like that might be only a brief surge. "If they pick it up and it's not for them," he said, "it will be a one-time thing."
Approval from the masses has never been a priority for Mr. Flynt, who owned a chain of striptease bars in the South before starting Hustler in 1974. Circulation quickly soared, but so did public hostility. While on trial on obscenity charges in Lawrenceville, Ga., in 1978, a sniper shot him in the back outside the courthouse. The man who claimed credit for the crime, John Paul Franklin, was apprehended six years later.
Despite -- or perhaps because of -- the notoriety, Flynt Publishing has performed well enough over the years to gain respect from some quarters.
"Anyone who makes millions, it can't be all accidental," Mr. Walker said. "So I'm sure Flynt has a lot of business smarts. What was it Mark Twain said -- you can never go wrong by underestimating the American people?"
Whether that underestimation remains profitable, though, is unclear. Mr. MacDonell would not comment on what the earnings are on Flynt Publishing's $100 million in revenue, other than to say "we've got a pretty good ratio there."
John Harrington, who publishes a newsletter that tracks newsstand sales, said he thought profits were probably very good. "They're not paying a great deal in editorial or other marketing costs," Mr. Harrington said. "There are a bunch of specials that they sell, recycling that same editorial material."
There are no outside estimates of Hustler's circulation or advertising pages. But "we do pretty well with ads," Mr. MacDonell said. "We had 71 pages of paid ads in the July '97 issue of Hustler," which recently went to press. None of the ads were for cars, liquor or cigarettes, the holy trinity of other men's magazines. "It's all phone sex and mail-order," he said. "There might be one ad for balding."
But with licentiousness comes a certain editorial license. "We don't worry about offending anybody," Mr. MacDonell said. "We're not going to offend these mail-order companies."
Mr. MacDonell said Hustler includes serious articles, although the May issue features articles on the life of a porn-film star and the latest sexual fetish involving toes.
"You have to give them more than what they get from a video," Mr. MacDonell explained. "With the magazine, they will read. I get letters back, so I know they read. Hustler appeals to the brain as well as the sexual instincts."
The ads Hustler does sell are cheap, comparatively speaking. The prices peak at $25,000 for a four-color, full-page, while the 50 top-grossing magazines charge an average of $82,861 for the same kind of ad, according to statistics kept by the Publishers Information Bureau, part of the Magazine Publishers Association. Magazines with circulation comparable to Hustler's average $43,805.
"They are definitely below what you might call an industry average," said Judith S. Jorgensen, a spokeswoman for the association.
Although still not involved in video and cable television, the company is becoming more active on the Internet's World Wide Web, Mr. MacDonell said, where it already has on-line versions of Hustler and three of its other magazines.
The on-line Hustler (www.hustler.com) closely resembles the magazine in terms of tone and content, namely the editorial preoccupation with female anatomy. The site charges a membership fee of $12.95 a month, plus additional fees based on time spent on line.
"It's very inviting because there aren't any paper costs and not much production cost," Mr. MacDonell said. "A lot of it is reinterpreting what you've already designed. We have a four-person staff for the Internet alone." That may not sound excessive, but Hustler magazine has long been produced by a staff of seven.
But it is not as if Hustler has cornered the on-line sex market. "In a space like this, it has an awful lot more competitors than it does on the newsstand," said Scott Smith, director of digital commerce for Jupiter Communications, a Manhattan technology research firm. "There have got to be thousands."
New technology notwithstanding, it is hard to gauge the future of Larry Flynt Publishing. Unlike Hugh Hefner, for example, who propelled his daughter, Christie, through the ranks to chairman and chief executive at Playboy, Mr. Flynt, who is 54 years old and uses a wheelchair as a result of the 1978 shooting, does not appear to have cultivated a publishing heir among his five children from three marriages, although two, Larry Jr. and Theresa, are currently working there. Nor has he designated a successor from outside the family.
Would Hustler, then, fade away when its founder is no longer interested in running it?
"It's very hard to think of anyone within the established media who would buy it, because it's got that attached stigma," Mr. Phillips said. "If a magazine like that were for sale, more than likely someone outside the industry would buy it. It would be an ego buy. It really has to be someone who wants to live that life style, like buying a baseball team."

HEADLINE: THE MILLENNIUM BUG -- A special report.;
Computers Are the Future But Remain Unready for It

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER with LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

DATELINE: CHIPPEWA FALLS, Wis.

 BODY:
They hear the heavy footfall of the approaching millennium at the Mason Shoe Company. And they wish it would just go away.
Like virtually every American enterprise large and small, public and private, Mason Shoe depends on its computer systems to manage the daily flow of information and paper. A bank of Hewlett-Packard 9000 computers orders materials, schedules manufacturing, pays bills, processes receipts and fills mail orders. 
 Nearly every document the company creates carries a date. That's a problem. A big problem.
As with hundreds of thousands of computerized operations around the world, unless something is done, and soon, on a dark cold night at the end of December 1999, the clock at Mason Shoe will strike 12 and the calendar will spin backward to Jan. 1, 1900 -- and Mason Shoe's computer, utterly confused, could make the company's business grind to a halt.
This 750-employee shoemaker in northwest Wisconsin is suffering its own small share of a looming global quagmire known as the year 2000 problem or the millennium virus, as it is also called (even though the millennium technically does not begin until 2001). And as of April 5 of this year, computer programmers at Mason Shoe and around the world had 1,000 days to effect a cure. One estimate of the collective cost runs as high as $600 billion.
Briefly stated, this is the problem: The software on many computers employs a two-digit shorthand for the date, so that the year 1982, for example, is written as 82. Unless the date fields are changed to reflect the arrival of the new century, computers will interpret "00" as 1900, with potentially frightening results.
Indeed, doomsday scenarios have become a staple of the computer industry trade press. Many articles read like works of science fiction, with images of satellites falling from the sky, a global financial crash, nuclear meltdowns, hospital life-support systems shutting down, the collapse of the air-traffic system and a wayward ballistic missile.
But despite such prophecies, almost all of the dozens of computer experts interviewed by The New York Times expect the life-threatening problems to be dealt with beforehand. And while they concede that unanticipated troubles could arise, most say the millennium will probably end not with a calamitous computer crash but with many expensive and disruptive headaches.
Without proper attention now, manufacturers could grind to a halt as their inventory systems break down. Customer orders could go unfilled. The Internal Revenue Service computers could begin spewing out millions of false tax notices. Bank records of loans and mortgages could become fouled up. Stock transactions could fail to clear.
Trying to prevent this will be costly. Sally Katzen, the White House official responsible for coordinating Federal year 2000 computer conversion efforts, estimates the cost of bringing Federal computers up to date at $2.3 billion over the next two and a half years. She acknowledges that that is probably a fraction of the true cost.
The Gartner Group, a Connecticut technology consulting company, estimates the global cost of year 2000 conversion at $300 billion to $600 billion, based on the overwhelming size of the job and the late start by most governments and businesses. Gartner's calculation of the Federal Government's portion of the bill: $30 billion.
John Lubs, president of Mason Shoe, is reluctantly budgeting $500,000 to reprogram his computers, all money straight off the company's bottom line.
"It's not even as satisfying as fixing a roof," Mr. Lubs said resentfully. "We get absolutely nothing out of it. We get to stay in business, that's all."
 
Troubled Legacy
A Quick Fix Fails to Appear
 How did we reach this Information Age impasse?
Many of the world's computers -- and many of the automated systems driven by them, from bank vaults to traffic signals to nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles -- record dates in a six-digit format: YYMMDD. Such date fields are embedded deep in the basic code that runs computer operating systems and applications software.
This shorthand way of recording dates is a bequest from computer programmers of years past. Although long recognized as a potential problem, it was largely ignored until recently as a result of denial, delay and misplaced faith in a quick technological fix.
Most recent computer hardware and software has been designed to recognize the difference between 1900, when Rockefellers and Carnegies bestrode the economy, and 2000, the era of Wal-Mart and Microsoft.
And yet much of the world's computer data -- fully half, by some reckonings -- still resides in programs that can identify the decade, but not the century.
No one has yet devised a silver bullet to attack the problem, a nifty program that would search out and convert every date field in a computer's operating system or software. Every computer system and every program that is date sensitive must be opened up and changed to become year 2000 compliant.
There's nothing glamorous or mysterious about the task. It is boring, grinding and ultimately unsatisfying work, like resetting the VCR and microwave clocks when daylight saving time begins. You get nothing new; only the opportunity to eat the same frozen dinners and watch the same shows.
And despite claims from dozens of computer vendors, there is no single software tool that can be used to find and fix faulty date fields, except in the simplest computer applications. One of the biggest concerns of data processing managers is that even if one computer system is fixed to accommodate the century change, it can easily be contaminated by noncompliant data imported from other computers.
Most computer users, like Mason Shoe, have developed their systems over years, customizing programs from a variety of sources to handle unique jobs, from processing millions of dollars in credit card receipts to scheduling production of men's dress shoes in sizes 8AA to 13EEEE.
The result is millions of one-of-a-kind computer applications around the world and an incredibly labor-intensive job of fixing them.
Mason Shoe's year 2000 problem -- like much of the world's -- began in the 1960's when it purchased its first computer system, an I.B.M. mainframe programmed in the then-current Cobol language.
Over the years, Mason grafted a variety of applications from a variety of vendors onto the central computer processor. Many of the companies that supplied the software are no longer in business and the technicians who installed and ran the programs have long since moved on.
Three years ago, company officials decided to upgrade their computer systems, buying a Hewlett-Packard networked system to run all the company's data processing programs. The Hewlett-Packard system was year 2000 compliant when installed, but rather than purchase all new software, Mason executives decided to "import" the custom-designed programs from the old I.B.M. machine -- virtually all of them written in Cobol, a language spoken by very few modern computers.
The decision seemed sensible at the time, making the conversion job cheaper and faster than it otherwise would have been. But the immigrant Cobol code brought with it a deadly stowaway -- the year 2000 virus.
When Cobol was in wide use, computers had a tiny fraction of the memory and disk space they do today. In an effort to conserve that precious space, programmers limited date fields to six digits, two each for year, month and day, assuming that the hardware and software would be replaced long before the end of the century.
But Cobol and other "legacy" systems proved more durable than their creators imagined.
Carl Lijewski, Mason Shoe's director of data processing, learned of the company's problem in 1995 when he attended a year 2000 conference for corporate computer specialists. He raised the issue before senior executives and asked for $50,000 to begin attacking the problem.
"We kind of pooh-poohed it when Carl first brought it up," Mr. Lubs said. "We kept asking him what this $50,000 was about. But he finally convinced us we'd better pay attention."
It turned out that the money was just a down payment on a bill that ultimately would be 10 times as much.
A good portion of that sum will go to Allegiant Legacy Solutions, a Blue Ash, Ohio, consulting firm that much as classics scholars keep nearly extinct ancient languages like Aramaic and Latin alive, specializes in Cobol and other now-obscure computer languages.
Mason Shoe hired Allegiant when executives discovered that they could not handle the job of scanning and scrubbing the company's three million lines of computer code by themselves.
An Allegiant programmer, Howard Hawkins, commutes by air once or twice a month between Blue Ash and Chippewa Falls, charging $1,200 a day plus expenses. Mr. Lubs considers the cost barely short of extortion, but feels he has little choice but to pay it.
"This stuff runs the business," Mr. Lubs said of his computer systems.
 
Unexpected Durability
Computer Code Lives Too Long
George Luntz, the president of Allegiant, knows that he and his fellow "Cobol cowboys" are not the most popular vendors in America right now. But he insisted that no one suspected in the 1960's and 1970's when they wrote programs with six-digit date fields that they would still be in use in the late 1990's.
"This has brought out all the conspiracy nuts, just like the Kennedy assassination," said Mr. Luntz, a 41-year-old South African-born former I.B.M. systems engineer who has been a computer programmer since he was 19. "I assure you, there was no conspiracy. We felt the useful life of these systems was 5 to 10 years."
But now, Mr. Luntz finds himself competing with Fortune 500 companies and the Federal Government for the services of Cobol programmers. His company has 25 employees, and he is advertising on the Internet for more, particularly programmers who speak the ancient mainframe languages of Cobol, Fortran and Assembler.
Mr. Luntz said that qualified Cobol programmers now demand annual salaries of $100,000 to $200,000 -- and the price is going up. Which is why he predicts that his firm's $1,200 daily rate for Cobol consultants is likely to double over the next 18 months.
"People have been saying for years that Cobol is dead, but most of the money will be spent fixing Cobol systems," Mr. Luntz said. Most universities and trade schools no longer teach Cobol and other old languages, but many young people pick it up at job sites where it is still used. And many retired programmers are going back to work, lured by the premiums being paid for their services.
"I get approached all the time by E-mail by people who say they're coming out of retirement to code," said Mr. Luntz. "They are out there and they are in demand, believe me."
One group of formerly retired Cobol programmers printed up T-shirts reading, "The Dinosaurs Are Back." The back of the shirt reads, "And We Are Angry."
 
A Very Big Task
Winners Will Get An Early Start
Peter de Jager, a Canadian computer expert who, in 1993, was one of the first to sound the year 2000 alarm, recently conducted a survey of business progress in addressing the problem. He found that no more than a third of private companies know exactly what they have to do to fix their systems and when they are going to do it.
"The rest are just beginning," he said.
The winners will be those companies that started early. They will not be competing for programmers whose prices are escalating rapidly and will have sufficient time to test their efforts.
"We think it could become a competitive advantage," said Steven L. Sheinheit, a senior vice president in charge of corporate computer systems at the Chase Manhattan Bank. He said that early completion of the year 2000 conversion job could give the bank the opportunity to acquire companies, or at least parts of companies, weakened by mishandled conversion projects.
Chase began working on the problem in 1995 and is confident that it will be ready for the changeover by the end of next year, allowing it to devote all of 1999 to testing, officials there said. The company expects to spend between $200 million and $250 million on the project -- about 5 percent of its total spending on information technology over that period.
Chase has bought software that identifies about 80 percent of the date references in computer code; the rest must be searched manually, bank officials said.
"The difficulty is not changing the code but testing it. If you change one line, you have to test the whole system," Mr. Sheinheit said.
Experts estimate the cost of testing -- both internally and with an organization's suppliers and business partners -- to be 50 percent to 60 percent of the total conversion price. That is why many of today's cost figures are probably low, they say.
The testing process involves a form of time travel in cyberspace. One must advance the computer's calendar to a date in the 21st century, then run the system both forward into the new century and backward to the 20th century to assure that calculations run smoothly.
That sort of trial is the only way to be certain that, for example, a bank's computers can correctly calculate mortgage or credit card payments that cross the century line. A consumer can run such a test by setting a VCR clock to Dec. 31, 1999, and programming it to record a program the next day.
There are three possible outcomes with such testing, according to Richard M. Kearney, the KPMG Peat Marwick partner in charge of the consulting firm's global year 2000 practice.
The first is success, in which the computer recognizes the new date and functions properly.
Otherwise, one of two things can happen, Mr. Kearney said. "The computer may not execute commands at all -- and that's the best thing that can happen," he said. "The alternative is they will run the calculations and come up with all wrong answers, in which case you have a very serious problem" -- ranging from millions of rejected credit card transactions to a huge data processing breakdown.
But one organization's problem is another's business opportunity. Lawyers are gearing up to sue companies that fail to complete their conversion projects and whose noncompliant data infect the systems of organizations with which they do business. Potential legal liabilities also arise for consultants and vendors whose fixes don't work.
And one enterprising insurance consortium is offering a millennium insurance policy to protect against year 2000-related foul-ups. The Minet Group and the American International Group are offering a policy with coverage limits as high as $100 million to cover business losses resulting from failed conversion efforts. But buyer beware: Purchasers of the policy must deposit as much as $80 million with the insurance companies to get $100 million in coverage.
 
High Stakes
I.R.S. Must Get It Right
On any given day, Mason Shoe has two people working on year 2000 conversion. The Internal Revenue Service has 700.
"We have an enormous problem, which may be unprecedented in its complexity," Arthur A. Gross, who is responsible for the I.R.S.'s information systems, said. "We can't get it wrong, because there won't be enough time to do it over."
The tax collection agency has more than 50 different computer systems running 19,000 separate applications from more than 62 million lines of program code. And that is just for the core business of processing 200 million tax returns and collecting $1.4 trillion in Government revenue.
Mr. Gross guesses that it will cost $155 million to bring those systems up to date by the turn of the century, but he acknowledges that his estimate may be low.
The agency runs an additional 30,000 programs on minicomputers and desktop machines for less critical functions like storing records and answering taxpayer questions. Mr. Gross said he had no idea of the scope or cost of converting them. "We don't know what we don't know," he said, adding that many of the systems will simply be discarded because they would be too expensive to fix.
Meanwhile, the challenge at the Pentagon -- and the stakes -- are exponentially greater. The military has 9,300 computer systems running 112,000 programs, according to Emmett Paige Jr., the Defense Department's top computer executive.
Mr. Paige told a Congressional committee last month that the Pentagon was about halfway through the process of assessing the scope of the problem, but that it had already identified 560 computer systems that it would eliminate rather than try to make them year 2000 compatible.
He said that the current estimate of conversion costs was $1.1 billion, but that he expected the cost to rise as the millennium draws near. Officials said that the estimate did not include all the costs of fixing computers at the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon's "black" or supersecret weapons programs.
Bruce McConnell, a senior official of the Office of Management and Budget working on the year 2000 problem, expressed confidence that the Government's most important systems will be converted, tested and working properly on Dec. 31, 1999.
"I don't think we'll get everything done, but I hope we'll get everything done that has to be done," Mr. McConnell said.
But Bruce Hall, research director for the Gartner Group, said that Mr. McConnell, like most other technology managers, was probably underestimating the magnitude of the task he faces.
"It's like one of those Whack-a-Mole games at the carnival," Mr. Hall said. "Problems keep popping up faster and faster."
 
Laying Blame
No Warning From Vendors
Up in Chippewa Falls, Mr. Lubs is looking for someone to blame for his year 2000 hassles -- the companies that sold him his hardware, the technicians who installed the applications programs, the itinerant programmers who customized them for his shoe business.
"No one warned us about this date problem when they sold us these systems," Mr. Lubs said bitterly, shaking his head. "They created this problem and they won't admit it."
Mr. Luntz, the millennium-bug exorcist, contends that Mr. Lubs is laying blame in the wrong places. The year 2000 problem is not the product of a devilish computer industry plot, Mr. Luntz said, but rather of the unexpected longevity of computer programs and of the procrastination of industry and government officials.
Some other priority always came first, he said.
"The approach was in the great American tradition of 'We'll fix it when we have to, we'll delay it until the final payment is due,' " Mr. Luntz said. "Well, we've reached the final payment. This is the 30th year of a 30-year mortgage. They have to fix it -- and fix it at once."

TOMORROW: How investors hope to profit, and some pitfalls that may loom, as companies zero in on the year 2000 problem.

Charts: "Detecting Dates Amid the Data"
 
Computing's so-called year 2000 problems is a legacy of the 1960's and 70's, when programmers using software languages like Cobol conserved precious memory by using two-digit dates for the year -- 67, for instance, instead of 1967. The "19" was assumed. Unfortunately for thousands of companies like Mason Shoe, many of those old Cobol programs are still in use. And so, unless every date reference is revised in millions of lines of Cobol code across the land, on Jan. 1 2000, the computers will assume it is the year 1900. Changing the dates isn't the hard part; the challenge is determining which lines of computer code actually contain date-relevant data. The excerpt below, from a Cobol program that helps Mason Shoe track customers and sales calls, illustrates the challenge of finding and fixing the Year 2000 problem.
 
1. SEARCH: Poring over a printout containing thousands of lines of code, a programmer checks for commands likely to affect dates. MOVE DATIME is a likely suspect. The year-specific digits embedded in DATIME's underlying code can then be modified.
 
2. IDENTIFICTION: The next step is to trace all subsequent commands affected by MOVE DATIME, to insure that the underlying data code gets updated in these commands, as well. Commands with direct links to MOVE DATIME are fairly easy though laborious to trace . . .
 
3. PURSUIT: . . . but the real challenge is to ferret out all subsequent points in this program where a date-affected command like TA-LAST-CALL may interact with other commands. These subsequent date references may also need modification. This virus-like expansion can require the programmer to seek and destroy hundreds of date problems within this single program.

"What Could Happen"
Ideally, the millenium bug will have minimal effect on the average person. But if the debuggers are not diligent between now and Jan. 1 2000, the problem could intrude into everyday life in ways like these.
 
Your telephone service is terminated because of errors in date calculations.
 
Your driver's license expires becuse the motor vehicle department cannot recognize dates after Dec. 31, 1999.
 
Your broker miscalculates your capital gains, bond payments and other transactions because of faulty dates.
 
Your department store rejects your credit card because your payment is 100 years overdue.
 
Your bank's automated teller swallows your card, thinking it has expired.
 
Your Social Security payments are cut off because the agency computers miscalculate your age.
 
Your tax payments are erroneously billed as overdue by the I.R.S.
 
Your mortgage payment arrives late because the bank's computers fail to note the century change.
 
Your home VCR fails to record a show because it mistakes the year.
 
Your car's dashboard "Service Engine Now" light falsely indicates that the car is due for a tune-up.
 
Your pharmacy refuses to refill your prescription because the computer says it has expired.
 
While elsewhere . . .
 
Bank vaults refuse to open.
 
Building security systems fail, refusing to read coded cards or keys.
 
Production schedules at all kinds of manufacturing facilities are corrupted by improper-coding.
 
Automatic elevator programs crash, freezing high-rise elevators.
 
Airline flight schedules are thrown into disarray because of flaws in the air traffic control system computers. (Illustration by Al Branberg/The New York Times) (pg. D11)

HEADLINE: City Hall Deal Ties Subsidies To Job Growth

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
In a sign that New York City may be strengthening its ability to retain corporate employers without doling out costly incentives, a European financial company that had threatened to move to Connecticut will remain in Manhattan and will get tax breaks only if it expands its local work force.
The agreement, with ING Barings, a British-Dutch financial services company, is the city's first deal that links subsidies solely to job growth, city officials say. Under the deal, the company has agreed to move more than 800 workers to an office tower on East 52d Street and expand its payroll in return for $5 million in tax breaks and other incentives. 
 In recent decades, the city has typically awarded multimillion-dollar incentive packages to keep employers from deserting the city for other areas where taxes and other costs might be lower. But the ING deal includes no up-front incentives, something city officials attribute to a stronger local economic climate and the relative lack of available office space in the suburbs.
Still, the city continues to negotiate incentive packages with other businesses, particularly larger Wall Street companies whose loss would pose a blow to the city's status as a global financial center.
Under the ING deal, no benefits will be awarded for the current payroll at the company, as was the case in every other so-called job retention deal over the last 25 years. ING Barings is expected to add 870 new jobs over the 15-year term of the deal, according to Bernadette O'Leary, a spokeswoman for the city's Economic Development Corporation. If the company goes ahead with that hiring, it could receive up to $3.4 million in sales tax exemptions and $1.65 million in energy discounts, she said.
But exactly how many people are now employed at ING Barings, a division of the Dutch ING Group, is of some question. Ms. O'Leary said that ING Barings will "retain 841 jobs" in New York, while Lane Mitchell, a spokeswoman for ING Barings, said the company employs 957 people, up from 788 in January 1995. Ms. Mitchell declined comment on the city deal until it is formally approved -- as expected -- by the Economic Development agency's board tomorrow.
"With the changes in the New York City economy under Mayor Giuliani's leadership, we have begun to focus much more on job growth with the benefit packages than on job retention," Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said. "We are also trying to reduce the cost per job of the benefits in recognition of the change in the economic climate."
ING Barings, which occupies a total of 200,000 square feet of space at 135 East 57th Street and 667 Madison Avenue, will be moving to about 290,000 square feet at 55 East 52d Street, near Park Avenue.
The city's agreement with ING Barings marks the 26th "retention deal" struck by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's administration since January 1994, and in those deals, the city says it has retained 57,400 jobs. Companies like Republic National Bank, Capital Cities/ABC, Travelers Inc., Conde Nast and PaineWebber have received a combined $500 million in tax breaks and other incentives after threatening to leave Manhattan.
More recently, the city has tried to strike a tougher stance in negotiating with companies over tax breaks in recognition of both the city's improving economy and the shrinking amount of office space available in the suburbs. Certainly the $5 million package granted to ING Barings pales in comparison to the $183.9 million subsidy provided to the New York Mercantile Exchange.
But that has not stopped companies from lining up at the city's door to demand benefit packages. ING Barings threatened to move 500 back-office jobs to Stamford, according to Ms. O'Leary of the Economic Development Corporation. Standard & Poor's, a bond-rating agency and financial information service, has threatened to move as many as 2,000 jobs to Jersey City, unless the Giuliani administration grants sales tax exemptions and other incentives in lower Manhattan.
Some urban planners, including the Regional Plan Association and the Citizens Budget Commission, have criticized the granting of such tax breaks, because, they say, the incentives provide advantages against competitors in the same industry. And, they say, the subsidies shift the tax burden from the large corporations with the clout to get the benefit packages to small- and mid-sized companies that make up the backbone of the city's economy.
"With the financial services boom, it's not clear why the city should be subsidizing any financial services firms," said Ray Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit research organization. "But a giveaway conditioned on job growth is certainly better than one conditioned on job maintenance."
Like many financial companies, ING Barings has seen a spectacular increase in revenues over the last few years. Last Thursday, ING Barings reported that its net profit had soared 25.4 percent in 1996 to $1.97 billion, over 1995.
ING Barings will be moving to space vacated by Credit Suisse First Boston after the investment bank received a $50.5 million subsidy package to support its move to 11 Madison Avenue, between East 24th Street and East 25th Street. First Boston has brought new life to a neighborhood that had been hurt by layoffs and transfers by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and by New York Life.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Women's Hockey: No Fights, Just Skating

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: KITCHENER, Ontario, April 5

 BODY:
Her family had season tickets to the Chicago Blackhawks. Her brother, Tony, would eventually play in the National Hockey League. The boys in the neighborhood accepted her, and Cammi Granato assumed that the N.H.L. would accept her, too. Then, one day in junior high, her mother took her aside and explained the hockey facts of life.
"I wanted to play for the Blackhawks," Granato said. "My mother told me I was a girl and that was a boy thing. I cried. I loved hockey just as much as the boys did." 
 A dozen years later, women's ice hockey has gained international acceptance and authentication on its own terms. For the first time, the sport will be an Olympic medal event, joining two other first-time sports -- snowboarding and curling -- at the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan. Granato, 26, is a star forward on a hockey team that, with Canada, will be an Olympic favorite and try to sustain the gold-medal momentum generated by American women in basketball, soccer and softball at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.
That momentum was evident this past week at the women's world hockey championships as the United States advanced to the title game in what is serving as the qualifying tournament for the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan.
[On Sunday night, Canada defeated the United States in overtime, 4-3, for its fourth straight title.]
Both the United States and Canada qualified for Nagano, along with three of the other eight teams here -- China, Finland and Sweden. Japan, as the host country, received an automatic berth to complete the Olympic field.
Checking -- the use of bodies to impede the other team -- is not allowed in the women's game, which places a premium on the skills of skating, passing, stick-handling and playmaking. It is the equivalent of below-the-rim basketball, a fluid, finesse game that avoids the fighting and clutching and grabbing of men's hockey.
The women's skill level is such that Tara Mounsey, a defenseman from Brown University, was voted the best high school player in New Hampshire, man or woman, in 1996. In a 10-0 rout of Sweden on Thursday that secured the Olympic berth, Karyn Bye of River Falls, Wis., contributed a hat trick, three goals, and Granato scored twice as the United States outshot the Swedes by a stunning margin of 73-4.
"With the Olympics, people will know women play hockey and they will be shocked to see that we can play at that Granato said. "We're not trying to play a men's game. What we're trying to do is be recognized for our own game and respected for it, too. We don't have to be 6-4, 220 pounds."
The American women have traveled similar paths on their pioneering expeditions toward Olympic acceptance. They grew up in the East or in the Midwestern hockey belt of Michigan and Minnesota. They learned the game playing with their brothers and other boys. Some, like Vicki Movsessian, a defenseman from Lexington, Mass., first took to the ice on figure skates.
"My personality was too gritty for those outfits they had me wearing," Movsessian said.
One day, her father was sharpening her figure skates and he filed right over the toe picks. She told him: "Don't worry about it. I'm not going back."
Many of the American women played on boys teams from youth hockey through high school. Some had an easier time than others in gaining acceptance from opposing teams and parents. Stephanie O'Sullivan, a forward from Dorcester, Mass., had to tuck her hair inside her helmet and take the name of Steven on one youth team; Kelly O'Leary, a defenseman from Auburn, Mass., once played a tournament as Kevin O'Leary.
The youngest American player, Angela Ruggiero, 17, is a junior at Choate prep school in Wallingford, Conn. Most of her teammates played at Ivy League colleges or at other Eastern schools, such as Providence and Northeastern, which have varsity teams. Erin Whitten, the starting goalie from Glens Falls, N.Y., has played in several men's professional minor leagues.
"Playing against men, you're at the bottom rung of the ladder and you scrape to get playing time and respect," Whitten said. "There's a lot of satisfaction when you gain that respect. But people look at me and some say I shouldn't be there because I'm a girl. Or, 'She's doing the best she can, but she's still third string.' With the women, I'm one of the elite players. It makes a big difference when we all have that respect. Winning an Olympic medal with the women's team would be way more satisfying than simply being part of a men's team."
Unlike women's basketball, the Olympic afterglow will not help light the way for a professional women's hockey league. The Olympics will be the summit for these careers. So, many of the Americans, eligible for training grants between $10,000 and $20,000 from the United States Olympic Committee, have delayed school, careers and their lives as they try to make the final roster for Nagano.
Lisa Brown-Miller, of Union Lake, Mich., resigned from her job last June as head coach of Princeton's women's team to follow her Olympic dream. Instead of going on a honeymoon two summers ago, she went to a hockey training camp.
Brown-Miller said her husband told her, "I don't want you sitting on the couch and watching the Olympics and saying to yourself, 'If I had stuck with it, I'd be there.' "
Women's hockey first appeared in Canada in 1892; Canadian television recently identified the oldest active player in the country as Mabel Boyd. She is in her 70's. The Canadians defeated the Americans to win the previous three world championships, with the first title coming in 1990. Twice in the early 1990's, goalie Manon Rheaume participated in exhibition games with the Tampa Bay Lightning of the N.H.L. Canada's current team is so skilled that Rheaume, now 25, was cut from the women's squad a week ago.
The Americans are catching up. In this decade, the number of women playing hockey in the United States has jumped from 5,533 to 20,555, according to USA Hockey, the national governing body. Three years ago, Minnesota declared women's hockey a varsity sport on the high school level; this season, 67 teams registered to play.
On the college level, women's hockey is an emerging sport on the 25th anniversary of Title IX, which forbids discrimination on the basis of gender. The sport perfectly fit the International Olympic Committee's pressured need to add more women and women's team sports to the Winter Games.
Finland, a three-time bronze medalist at the world championships, is considered the other medal favorite at Nagano. But China, which lost, 6-0, to the United States in the semifinals, has made an intriguing emergence since 1992. Coach Zhang Zhi Nan said that only 70 women in the entire country play on an elite level, all of them from the northern industrial city of Harbin. Still, the Chinese have developed an assertive style, based on hard work and from watching videotapes of N.H.L. games.
The men in the former Soviet Union once dominated Olympic hockey, but the Russian women's team is struggling with inexperience and financial problems now that the country's sports machine is no longer greased by state support. Russia's top player, Yekaterina Pashkevich, has followed the lead of many Russian figure skaters by coming to live and train in the United States. She coaches the women's club team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
When she began playing as a girl, Pashkevich said, people told her parents, "Your daughter is weird." The national team is only three years old, and Russian players struggle, she said, "because the economy is bad and people can't buy equipment and pay for ice time."
On a tour of the United States several years ago, the Russian women had to rely on the charity of American prep schools to improve their shoddy equipment. But the failure to make the Olympics may now turn away sponsors and kill the women's program outright, Pashkevich said.
"If a team is not going anywhere, no one wants to spend money," she said.
It is quite another story for the Americans. Cammi Granato is now one step closer to fulfilling a goal that began when her brother Tony played in the 1988 Winter Games. A onetime New York Ranger, he now plays for the San Jose Sharks.
"I was 16; I wanted so bad to be an Olympic athlete," Cammi Granato said. "Should I try basketball? Volleyball? It's great now to have a chance to get there playing hockey. It's a dream come true."

China Cracks Down on Pirates
China's copyright police have begun pursuing and arresting pirates of compact disks, after years of ignoring demands for action from the United States and elsewhere. Since a concerted effort began in December, the authorities in one province say, more than 100 offenders have been arrested and 28 underground factories shut down. Dozens more factories are believed to exist, but many have suspended production. A1 

Embassy Plan in Berlin Stalls
Architects of a new American Embassy on a prime site in Berlin said plans for it had been put on hold because of a lack of money. The new embassy was being financed from the sale of other American-owned properties in Germany, but the money has only trickled in. The building was expected to be finished by 1999, when the German Government moves back to Berlin from Bonn. But now diplomats are reluctant to say when it might be ready. A4
 
90 Killed in Attacks in Algeria
Attackers armed with knives, axes and guns massacred about 90 people in Algeria in less than two days, witnesses said. The attacks, which survivors attributed to various Islamic factions, all took place within about 60 miles of the capital, Algiers, the same area where security forces have been waging a fierce offensive against the militants. It was some of the worst violence since the insurgency began five years ago. (AP)
 
New Goals on Environment
Environmental ministers from 53 countries plan to open talks at the United Nations this week on setting new targets in fields ranging from conserving fresh water supplies to limiting chemical pollution as the fifth anniversary of the Rio Earth Summit meeting approaches. Their aim is to reach enough agreement over the next three weeks to allow world leaders to endorse their decisions at a special session of the General Assembly in June. A3
 
Hapsburgs Return to Sarajevo
Descendants of the Hapsburg Archduke Franz Ferdinand, whose assassination in Sarajevo set off World War I, visited the Bosnian capital for the first time since the assassination. At the site of the killing, Otto von Hapsburg and his son Karl unveiled a simple post that read, "Let peace rule the earth." The spot was once marked with a plaque honoring the assassin, a Serbian nationalist who opposed Hapsburg rule. A4

Generator Problem Forces Shuttle to Turn Back
The seven astronauts on the space shuttle Columbia were forced to cut their trip short by 12 days and prepare to land tomorrow because a power generator on board was deteriorating and could explode. Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said there was no immediate danger, so the craft did not need to return today. The crew shut down all non-critical equipment to conserve power. A10
 
Rowhouse Fire Kills Five
Two adults and three children died in a fire that consumed a West Philadelphia rowhouse. The ruined building then collapsed, injuring eight firefighters who were inside. The fire was controlled within an hour, but a woman and three of her five children on the second floor and a man in another apartment were killed. Fire officials said the fire resulted from a faulty electrical outlet where a space heater was plugged in. A13
 
Storm Cripples Upper Plains
A blizzard stranded travelers on the northern Plains and made life miserable for volunteers sandbagging towns threatened by floods in Minnesota. Two people were killed in Wisconsin. Snowdrifts as high as 20 feet closed hundreds of miles of highways in Wyoming, the Dakotas, Nebraska and the eastern edge of Montana. Dikes failed along the Red River in Breckenridge, Minn., which was swollen by melting snow from previous storms. B8

Kidnapped Boy Is Sought
Widespread publicity generated hope and telephone tips in the case of a 10-year-old boy who was kidnapped at knifepoint outside his house in the rural community of Beaumont, Calif. The boy, Anthony Michael Martinez, was taken Friday by a thin white man, 25 to 30 years old, with blue eyes and a mustache, who asked him to help look for a lost cat, officials said. Family members have been ruled out as suspects, the authorities said. (AP)

Without Big Tax Breaks, Company Still Chooses City
A European financial company that had threatened to move to Connecticut decided to remain in Manhattan instead, even without a large package of up-front tax benefits from the city. The company, ING Barings, will get tax breaks only if it expands its local work force. City officials said the deal was the first of its type and was made possible by the stronger local economic climate and a shortage of office space in the suburbs. B1
 
Police Kill Machete Wielder
A police officer shot and killed a 16-year-old high school student who the police say was wielding a machete in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan. The police defended the shooting, saying officers felt their lives were in danger. But some residents who said they witnessed the encounter said the shooting appeared unjustified, and small crowds gathered on streets in the neighborhood, where shootings by police officers have provoked violence before.

HEADLINE: Volcano Captured Corn, Chilies and House Mice

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

 BODY:
IT was early evening in the rainy season when the villagers felt the ground shake and then probably trembled themselves at the sight of blasts of steam in the distance. They dropped what they were doing and fled, abandoning their thatch-roofed huts, fruit trees in full ripeness and unwashed dinner dishes.
That was 14 centuries ago, around the year 590. The people saved their lives but lost their village, which was buried virtually intact under more than 16 feet of fine ash from an erupting volcano half a mile away. Only now are archeologists digging through the ash, at the site they call Ceren in present-day El Salvador, and finding remains of the village so well preserved that it has been stamped with the inevitable sobriquet of Central American Pompeii. 
 Paleoethnobotanists, in particular, are having a field day. At Ceren, these specialists in the uses of plants by early people have uncovered stores of ceramic vessels filled with beans, squash, cacao and other plant foods -- dried but still recognizable after all these centuries. They also gathered charred seeds, burned in the volcanic heat, which could be identified under the microscope.
As they examined the site in finer detail, botanists have even identified plants that had disappeared, though not without a trace. Some left delicate impressions of leaves, seeds or stems in the ash. Some that had completely decomposed left cavities in the packed ash. The cavities served as molds, which, when filled with dental plaster, produced clear replicas of plants. In this way, plaster casts re-created the corn cribs filled with unshucked ears as they looked the evening the volcano struck.
Archeologists and botanists said Ceren is revealing for the first time much about the everyday lives of ordinary people in sixth-century Mesoamerica: their dwellings and crops, what they ate and how, their economy and how it contributed to the classic period of Maya civilization. Most explorations have concentrated on the grand ceremonial centers of the Maya rulers and priests.
"What we learn from Ceren," reported a team of scientists led by Dr. David L. Lentz of the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, "is that people living on the fringes may have made a contribution to the development of Mayan culture by producing surpluses and providing resources necessary to sustain the larger centers."
The director of Ceren excavations, Dr. Payson Sheets, an archeologist at the University of Colorado at Boulder, said the stores of food, the abundance of finely painted ceramics and the evidence of trade goods showed this to be a prosperous community of farmers. In one of the more humble households, archeologists counted more than 70 ceramic vessels.
"It's surprising, but also sad," Dr. Sheets said in an interview last week. "The standard of living 1,400 years ago was higher than it is now among the peasants of El Salvador."
Such archeological discoveries at a farming community, important under any circumstance, are especially rare in tropical climates where moisture spells rapid decay for all organic materials, thatch, twine and the dinner beans, unless they happened to be sealed in the dry, airless depths of ash. The bean collection from Ceren is one of the largest found at any Mesoamerican archeological site.
The existence of the buried village first came to light in 1976, but it was more than a decade before intensive excavations got under way. So far, 11 buildings have been uncovered: dwellings, an obsidian workshop, a food storehouse, a sauna for ritual sweat baths, a religious center and a community hall. The structures had adobe walls and roofs of thatch made from a type of grass that is now extinct, apparently killed off by alien grasses from the Old World. Found in the surviving thatch were the bones of mice that had infested the roofs.
Ground-penetrating radar surveys have detected the sites of many more dwellings, leading to estimates that 200 to 300 people lived in the village. Researchers are not sure if these were Mayans or members of local ethnic groups, either Lenca or Xinca. The nearest major center of Maya culture, then in its heyday, was Copan, about 60 miles away in Honduras.
Whoever they were, these people had made this site in a fertile valley their home for several centuries. Archeologists can almost pinpoint the time it all came to an end.
It was the rainy season of July or August, because evidence of fully ripe fruits of that time of year was found in abundance. It must have been early evening, probably between dinner and sleep. The men had certainly returned from work in the corn fields, because their tools were stacked near the dwellings. Food was still in pots on the hearths. Some serving bowls were empty but unwashed, still bearing the marks of people eating a semisolid substance, possibly corn meal gruel, with their fingers. And it was before they had retired for the night, or else their sleeping mats would have been rolled out.
In an interview and a report in a recent issue of the journal Latin American Antiquity, Dr. Lentz said that an analysis of the plant remains showed that Ceren had developed a diverse agriculture of orchards, household gardens and large corn fields. At least at this time of year, they had a variety of foods to eat: corn, several kinds of beans, squash, chili peppers, avocados, nuts, cherries and other fruits. They drank cacao, the favorite beverage of the Maya. They got their animal proteins from deer, ducks, dogs and freshwater mollusks.
Dr. Lentz and his colleagues concluded that the Ceren farmers "had at least as varied a diet as the Maya nobility" living at Copan. Most of these foods would be familiar to Central Americans today. But Dr. Lentz said, "We had no record of chilies anywhere in the Mayan realm -- here we find thousands of them, just everywhere, hanging from the rafters."
Cotton appeared to be a major crop, he said, with the fibers used not only for the villagers' own clothing but for trade. They may have used cotton cloth as exchange material for obsidian, exotic ceramics and other imported goods found at the site.
The botanists also found evidence that the people were grinding cotton seeds to extract the oil, possibly for cooking. Although it has never been demonstrated that the Maya knew about cottonseed oil, Dr. Lentz said, they probably did use it for cooking because they had few other sources of oil. Their only domesticated animals were dogs, turkeys and ducks.
Dr. Lentz, who also directs ethnobotanical research at the City University of New York, was joined in his work on Ceren by Dr. Marilyn P. Beaudry-Corbett, a ceramicist at the University of California at Los Angeles; Dr. Maria Luisa Reyna de Aguilar, a botanist in San Salvador, and Dr. Lawrence Kaplan, a biologist at the University of Massachusetts at Boston.
"Ceren provides part of the answer to the question of how the Maya were able to develop and maintain such large ceremonial centers," Dr. Lentz said. "These farmers were producing the agricultural surpluses that probably contributed to the civilization's wealth and culture."

Getting Drugs, Getting High: Same Old Same Old

 BODY:

THE STORY OF JUNK
By Linda Yablonsky
325 pages. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $23.
So how does a girl get from Point A to Point B: from a wholesome childhood in an all-American suburb to a grungy life as a heroin addict and dealer in Greenwich Village? How does a nice girl end up smuggling heroin from Thailand in condoms pushed up her rectum? Well, this is the tale Linda Yablonsky sets out to tell in her chilling if sometimes tedious first novel, "The Story of Junk." 
 Certainly this novel couldn't be more timely. After all, stories about middle-class heroin use have become a regular feature on television news magazines, heroin chic has become the fashion world's newest craze and "Rent," a musical about life among the users, transvestites and would-be artists of the Lower East Side, has become a hit, as has "Trainspotting," a high-spirited movie about Scottish heroin addicts directed in the style of Richard Lester's Beatles films.
As for "The Story of Junk," its gritty portrait of heroin addiction stands in sharp contrast to the Technicolor effusions of "Trainspotting" and "Rent." There are alarming stories about friends passing out from overdoses, buying methadone that other addicts have spit into bottles and dying of AIDS. There are gruesome descriptions of addicts covered with sores and bruises, trolling the mean streets of Alphabet City looking for a fix, and equally gruesome descriptions of what it feels like to go cold turkey. Even Ms. Yablonsky's more upbeat stories have a way of depressing the reader: endless days and nights spent in cold apartments and hot restaurants, listening to people with "great haircuts and shiny suits" talk about their habits and say things like "I think death must be bliss."
"While other drugs work to alleviate pain, excite the mind or otherwise trick the senses," her narrator says, "heroin plays with the soul -- or whatever it is makes a person uniquely appealing and distinguishable. Like an enveloping shadow dissolving day into night, it sneaks across your vision and tries to put it out, whatever that joy is by which you live, it creeps inside and pushes you down, making you smaller and smaller, a tiny flame burning down."
Framed by the unnamed narrator's arrest and interrogation by a narcotics officer, "Junk" jumps back and forth in time to tell the story of how she reached this point. We learn that she is an aspiring writer and sometime restaurant cook who was attracted to the bohemian world of New York, so different from the middle-class world of her youth. We learn that her dabbling in heroin led to a habit and that that habit, in turn, led to dealing. We also learn that her regular customers are "chippers and partyheads, overachievers, friends," in other words, the artists, musicians and poets she hangs out with in SoHo and the Village.
"A junk-bond boom on Wall Street is flooding the underground economy with a steady flow of disposable cash," the narrator of "Junk" says of the 1980's. " 'Discretionary income,' they call it, and some of it trickles down here. The world seems made of junk: junk money, junk food, junk stores, junk powder. I got into junk at just the right time."
Writing in edgy, serviceable prose, Ms. Yablonsky gives the reader some evocative snapshots of the worlds her characters frequent: a Village restaurant "hung with paintings and other works of art by the better-known clientele" and equipped with a huge walk-in fridge that also serves as a drug parlor; Avenue B, where there are "bodies slinking in and out of guarded doorways, diving through holes punched in concrete walls, wiggling into gaps in the sidewalk deep as wells, shooting up in empty lots, nodding on the hulks of abandoned cars." She provides some voyeuristic glimpses of their lives: being checked for track marks by suspicious dealers; taking Valium, codeine and Darvon to overcome the pain of withdrawal, and yards and yards of stoned conversation.
None of this talk is terribly interesting, as the narrator, who has become privy to her clients' secrets, observes: "I'm hearing the same things too many times; I don't want to hear them anymore. I don't want to know who steals what to get money for their drugs. I don't want to know who they lie to or why. I don't want to know who's dying or who's getting famous."
This, in the end, is the problem with this novel. Though Ms. Yablonsky proves she can be a vivid storyteller when she has an real story to relate (like her narrator's smuggling trip to Thailand), and demonstrates an anthropological flair for recording the mores of the downtown drug scene, her narrative often devolves into a weary recitation of drug buys, drug busts, drug parties: the deadening routines that frame an addict's life. As for the characters (the narrator's lover, Kit; the narrator's former lover Rico; the narrator's drug source Angelo; even the narrator herself), they, too, tend to blur into one another, all of them obsessed with junk: where to get it, how to ingest it and occasionally how to kick it.
As Ms. Yablonsky, herself, writes: "Everyone's got a story to tell, and most of those stories will change in some way, every time they're told. Not this one, not the story of junk. This one's always the same."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Climbs Above 125 Yen And Also Soars Against Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose above 125 Japanese yen for the first time in more than four years yesterday and surged against the German mark, powered by the lure of higher interest rates in the United States and optimism over Europe's single-currency plan.
The dollar was also helped by an easing of trade friction between the United States and Japan, following Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin's trip to Tokyo, and by rallying American stock prices. 
 The dollar hit an intraday high of 125.80 yen, the strongest since mid-January 1993, before settling in New York at 125.56 yen, up from 124.31 yen on Friday.
Against the mark, the dollar rose to 1.7109 marks in New York, up 1.5 percent from 1.6854 Friday and the highest level in a month.
Currency traders said the growing attraction of higher United States interest rates was an important catalyst for the dollar's advance, which began with a surge of dollar-buying in Japan. Higher interest rates make yields more attractive on dollar-denominated securities.
Traders also bought the dollar in reaction to Mr. Rubin's remarks on Friday and again yesterday, in which he asserted that currency rates should not be used as tools in trade disputes.
His statement calmed concerns that the United States might want a stronger yen and a weaker dollar, which could help narrow Japan's widening trade surplus with the United States by making Japanese goods more expensive here. As a result of his remarks, traders largely ignored a report that showed that Japan's trade surplus rose in February for the second consecutive month.
The dollar got another lift from a meeting of European finance ministers over the weekend in the Netherlands. At the meeting, the German Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, appeared to soften his stance about strict entry criteria for Europe's single-currency plan, which is to start in January 1999.
Mr. Waigel's apparent shift dampened speculation about a possible delay in the introduction of the Euro, which will displace the mark as Europe's predominant currency. The mark had recently drawn strength as a haven should the single currency plan encounter trouble.

Dumb and Whiney

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
We are fortunate today to have with us Dr. B. B. Braithwaite, the eminent authority on self-help, diet, getting rich quick and finding spiritual peace in 30 days. Dr. Braithwaite has kindly agreed to answer a few questions from our readers.
First, Doctor, can you explain to Baffled Baseball Fan why our Government refuses to let our teams play baseball in Communist Cuba while leaning over backward to encourage our businessmen to toady for big bucks in Communist China? 
 "Gladly. All Communism is bad, but Cuba's Communism is worse than anybody else's Communism. We have spent 40 years trying to abolish it, and it still refuses to disperse. Why reward such insolence by letting Cubans enjoy our national pastime?
"China, on the other hand, not only picks up the bill for our excessively costly elections, but also provides our retailers with cheap tennis shoes for which they can charge us ridiculously high prices. Without ridiculously expensive cheap tennis shoes, Americans might never again be able to get out of the car and walk around the block."
While on the subject of China, Dr. Braithwaite, perhaps you can answer this one from Irked Russian: Why enlarge NATO to surround Russia more tightly, now that Russia has gone capitalist? Isn't it more sensible for NATO to surround China now that China is the world's most heavily armed Communist power? Want to tackle that, Doctor?
"What an innocent you are, Mr. Irked Russian. The United States is full of voters of Eastern European extraction who despise and fear Russia in any form. To harvest their votes, politicians must move NATO ever closer to the gates of Moscow.
"As for China, think for a moment what this proud, highly aggressive, heavily armed, repressive and nasty regime might do if we extended NATO to its very borders. You, Mr. Irked Russian, could end up without any incredibly expensive cheap tennis shoes."
Doctor, will you tell Mr. Sorehead why he should not be cross with Alan Greenspan? He says every time he gets a job Alan Greenspan says too many people have jobs and raises interest rates to throw him, Mr. Sorehead, out of work again.
What advice, Doctor, can you give this churlish prole to make him feel more kindly to Alan Greenspan?
"Just this, Mr. Sorehead: Keep whining about Alan Greenspan and you'll be known as a common scold. Do you think Alan Greenspan has a personal grudge against you? Don't be a dunce.
"Alan Greenspan is an economist. Do you think economists harbor grudges against people? Nonsense. Economists are not interested in people. When they look at the world, they do not see people, they see statistics.
"To Alan Greenspan, as to all economists, you, Mr. Sorehead, are not Mr. Sorehead at all. You are a number. A very interesting number, to be sure, but just a number. So for heaven's sake, man, quit blubbering, buck up and start acting like a number."
While we are on economics, Doctor, perhaps you can you answer this question from Going Nowhere. He wants to know why his pay never goes up more than an inch a year while the pay of C.E.O.'s constantly increases by leaps and millions.
"Isn't the answer obvious? Who decides who is going to be paid what? The answer, my dear Going Nowhere, is: C.E.O.'s decide. Consider the harsh work they are required to do:
"Slashing payrolls. Exporting jobs to cheap-labor areas like Mexico, India, Texas. Chairing conferences on greater efficiency and higher productivity. Merging. Acquiring. Going into bankruptcy.
"Is this your idea of easy work, Mr. Going Nowhere? Would you sacrifice your inch-a-year pay increase to shoulder these trying and painful tasks, even though they offered you millions every year?
"Would you risk failure with its humiliating headlines about your getting only $70 or $80 million in severance pay for doing a rotten job? If so, Mr. Going Nowhere, quit complaining and get to Harvard Business School right away for an M.B.A."
Thank you, Doctor. I'm sure your wisdom will lead us all to spiritual peace before the month is out, if not a 10-pound weight loss.

HEADLINE: Rise in Consumer Debt Rate Slowed to 6.7% in February

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
Americans continued borrowing at a moderate pace in February after building debt in January at the fastest rate in six months.
Consumer debt rose at a 6.7 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate in February, to $1.21 trillion, after increasing at a 10.3 percent rate in January, the largest since July, the Federal Reserve said today. 
 The report was slightly stronger than analysts had expected because the rate for January was revised up from an earlier 8.4 percent estimate.
It fit with other evidence suggesting that economic growth in the first quarter continued at around the robust 3.8 percent rate of the fourth quarter.
Consumer spending, supported by strong job growth, is powering the economy right now. It represents about two-thirds of overall activity. Borrowing by consumers has grown every month since May 1993.
"I don't think this number suggests that consumers are splurging, but it fits in with the economy starting out quite strongly," David C. Munro, an economist with High Frequency Economics, said.
Much of the increase in borrowing came in credit card debt, which grew at a 12.7 percent annual rate in February after surging at a 21.6 rate in January, the biggest gain in 16 months.
Automobile borrowing slowed, however. It increased at a three-tenths of 1 percent rate after rising at a 3.1 percent rate in January.
Other consumer debt rose at a 5.5 percent rate in February after an advance at a 2.9 percent rate in January. This category includes loans for mobile homes, education, boats and vacations.
Economists believe that Americans' borrowing binge will begin to slow this year.
They expect the Federal Reserve, which increased short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point late last month, to continue to increase the cost of borrowing in an effort to slow economic growth and prevent inflationary imbalances from developing.
And there are signs that consumers are reaching their limit. Personal bankruptcies topped a million for the first time ever last year.
And the percentage of credit card holders behind on their payments at the end of 1996 rose to the highest level on record.
"There will be some progressive weakening of consumer credit demand," Mr. Munro said. "We'll see smaller increases rather than reductions."

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW;
A World of Corruption and Personal Enrichment

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
If you got the impression over the years that the Mexican Government was a stew of corruption, nothing in "Murder, Money and Mexico" is likely to change your mind. Tonight's edition of "Frontline" tells of influence-peddling, money laundering, drug dealing, murder and associated activities by the Salinas political family, which appears to have set a record, even for Mexico, of self-enrichment.
Although the program doesn't come up with much in the way of hard new evidence, it offers an abundance of allegations, speculations, suspicions, suppositions and plausible surmises about the doings of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who has fled his country, and Raul Salinas de Gortari, his brother, who is being held on the charge of murdering a sometime political ally. 
 The hour should have particular interest for audiences to the north. The narrator reminds us that Carlos Salinas, described as "the brainy one" of the family, earned a doctorate in political economy at Harvard University and still has admirers for the free-market policies he brought into the presidency in 1988. A professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who served as an adviser to President Salinas says, "If he ran a corporation, you'd buy the stock."
Washington invested in him because he favored Nafta, the North American Free Trade Agreement. There's the former Mexican President strolling with President Clinton and being applauded by Congress.
Among Mexicans whose investment in Mr. Salinas paid off were a select group who got hold of valuable properties sold by the state during privatization. They did exceedingly well despite their country's economic collapse. North American businessmen may have enhanced their fortunes.
As for Raul Salinas, there is evidence that he laundered hundreds of millions of dollars, possibly with the help of Citibank and probably with the help of his loved ones. Interviewed about charges that some of the fortune she helped to spirit out of Mexico was protection money from drug dealers, his wife says, with no credit to Claude Rains, "I was shocked, shocked!"
Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the United States Government's head drug fighter, was also shocked, shocked when Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, Mexico's chief of drug enforcement (praised by General McCaffrey for his reputation for integrity), was arrested for being on the drug-cartel payroll.
The fund-raising methods of President Salinas in 1993 may stand as an inspiration to American politicians. An investigator reports that the outgoing President invited Mexico's 30 biggest businessmen to a dinner at which they were asked to contribute $25 million apiece to his anointed successor's campaign. And he didn't even have to offer them a room for the night.

HEADLINE: Commerce Chief Will Lead Trade Trip With New Rules

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
Commerce Secretary William M. Daley will lead a trade mission to Latin America next month, his first and the first under new rules intended to eliminate politics from the process of selecting businesses that take part, the Commerce Department announced today.
The Secretary's entourage will stop in Brazil, Argentina and Chile to exploit what Mr. Daley described as "unprecedented opportunities for United States business" arising from economic reforms and trade liberalization in the three countries. 
 Two delegations of 12 to 15 members will be formed, officials said, based on their companies' prospects for business development and the Government's effort to obtain diversity of company size, products and location, as well as to include members of minorities.
But while the new rules opening up the selection process do not bar individuals from making donations to political candidates, they pointedly state that "an applicant's partisan political activities (including political contributions) are irrelevant."
The trip is the first since the department announced the criteria for its trade missions -- a step that was taken in the wake of allegations, which have not been proved, that former Secretary Ronald H. Brown rewarded financially supportive friends with places on foreign trips. Mr. Brown, who was killed along with 34 others on a trade mission to Croatia last April, often responded to those charges by noting that many of these executives were contributors to both parties.
Selection of the companies rests with a Commerce Department panel composed largely of career employees whose recommendations will be reviewed by a five-member board that includes a senior Department lawyer. Mr. Daley will have no say in the matter. Applications are due on April 25.
The South American mission, May 11 to May 19, is in three distinct parts.
The first three days will be in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo followed by participation in the third annual meeting of the Americas Business Forum, a private-sector group that fosters hemispheric economic integration, at Belo Horizonte, Brazil.
Then Secretary Daley travels to Buenos Aires and returns to the United States by way of Santiago, Chile.
The separate delegations of 12 to 15 members are to accompany the Secretary for the Brazil and the Argentina-Chile segments, with some executives from each likely attending the meeting in Belo Horizonte, for which the department does not select participants.
In an interview, Mr. Daley said the choice of Latin America for his first trade mission came easily. "There's lots of growth going on," he said. "Our competitors are spending a lot of time there."
He added that he hoped to organize as many as four more missions this year, with Asia and Europe the most likely destinations and India and Canada also under active consideration.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Bond Prices Show Rise

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices recovered yesterday from Friday's sharp fall, bolstered by a strong dollar and by thin trading.
The gains ended a slide prompted by the March employment report on Friday, which showed brisk economic growth and higher labor costs, indicating that the Federal Reserve would again have to raise interest rates to stem inflation. But yesterday's modest rally did not reflect any change in sentiment among investors, who still expect another rate increase by summer. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 21/32 yesterday, to 94 19/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 7.06 percent, from 7.12 percent on Friday.
A rise in the value of the dollar caused a short-covering rally in the bond market that lifted prices early in the afternoon before they retreated, analysts said.
"The dollar's strength helped bonds, especially its gains against the yen," said Greg Jones, an economist with Briefing.com, a market analysis firm in Menlo Park, Calif.
A stronger dollar makes dollar-denominated securities more attractive to foreign investors, who have been increasingly drawn to the United States Treasury market, according to recent data.
Foreign investors acquired a record $370 billion in United States fixed-income securities in 1996, up 68 percent from 1995, the PSA, the Bond Market Trade Association, said yesterday, citing preliminary Treasury figures.
But the afternoon gains in Treasury prices were held in check as investors remained cautious ahead of some key economic data, especially reports on producer prices and retail sales on Friday.
"For this week, retail sales in particular are the concern," Mr. Jones said. "The market is obviously waiting to see if another tightening has to be priced in."
Larry J. Wipf, a vice president and economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, said, "Once the Fed starts raising rates, multiple-rate hikes are par for the course."
"Although a couple of additional tightenings appear likely, a repeat of 1994, when the Federal funds target was increased seven times for a cumulative rise of 300 basis points, is not expected," he said. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Elsewhere in the market, the Government will sell $8 billion of its inflation-indexed notes today, through a reopening of its initial issue in January.
Interest rates at yesterday's regular weekly bill auction were down as good investor demand raised the price of buying short-term Treasury debt as those wanting to buy outstripped supply.
The rate for a three-month bill dropped to 5.14 percent, from 5.18 percent last week, while the rate six-month paper slipped to 5.30 percent, from 5.31 percent. Following are the results of yesterday's bill auction:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Bills	 	Average Price	98.701	97.321	Discounted Rate	5.14%	5.30%	Coupon Yield	5.28%	5.52%	High Price	98.706	97.331	Discounted Rate	5.12%	5.28%	Coupon Yield	5.26%	5.50%	Low Price	98.701	97.321	Discounted Rate	5.14%	5.30%	Coupon Yield	5.28%	5.52%	Accepted at low price	38%	40%	Total applied for	$37,111,006	$35,779,392	Accepted	$6,502,846	$6,542,247	Noncompetitive	$1,478,064	$1,214,655	
 
Both issues are dated April 10, 1997. The three-month bills mature on July 10, 1997, and the six-month bills mature on Oct. 9, 1997.

HEADLINE: Staples and Office Depot to Fight F.T.C. Merger Challenge

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
Staples Inc. and Office Depot Inc., asserting that Federal antitrust officials do not understand the office supply business, vowed today to "vigorously contest" the Federal Trade Commission's decision to challenge their proposed $4 billion merger.
Thomas G. Stemberg, the Staples chief executive, said in a statement that the F.T.C.'s conclusion that the merger would result in higher prices and decreased competition was based on a small sample of product prices and a flawed theory of the office products market. 
 "We believe an unbiased court of law will understand the merits of our case," Mr. Stemberg said in a statement.
The commission voted 4 to 1 on Friday to go to Federal court this week to block the proposed combination, which would have created a office supply giant with more than 1,000 stores and $10 billion in annual sales.
F.T.C. officials said that they planned to file a motion seeking an order temporarily restraining the merger in Federal court in Washington later this week.
Both sides' positions appeared to be hardening following the vote on Friday. William J. Baer, chief of the F.T.C.'s antitrust bureau, said that there did not appear to be any way to structure the merger to address the commission's concern that the deal was anti-competitive.
And Mr. Stemberg, who called the panel's decision "bizarre" and "absurd," indicated that the companies would pursue the merger regardless of cost. He said that the companies would seek an expedited hearing in Federal court to resolve the matter before the merger agreement expires on May 31.
The agency complaint is based in large part on pricing studies and econometric models that officials say demonstrate that Staples, Office Depot and the only other company in the superstore business, Officemax Inc., compete only against each other, and not against other suppliers of office goods.
F.T.C. officials have argued that eliminating one of the three competitors will violate Federal antitrust laws and will inevitably lead to higher prices.
But Mr. Stemberg contended that the combined company would control less than 6 percent of a highly competitive and fragmented $185 billion office supply industry. He said that the merger, if it was allowed to proceed, would not end price competition for office products because they would continue to be sold by such giant retailers as Wal-Mart, warehouse clubs and several large nationwide catalogue dealers.
"Staples and Office Depot are committed to our mission of bringing even lower prices to our customers" after the merger is completed, Mr. Stemberg said.

HEADLINE: City Comptroller Signs Off On Deal to Protect Water

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Declaring that New York City's $2.2 billion plan to protect its upstate water supply from pollution could still "prove to be a disastrous and expensive failure," City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi yesterday opened the way for the city to pay the first $86 million to dozens of communities around the reservoirs.
Since last fall, Mr. Hevesi, a Democrat, had criticized the deal for its lack of firm controls both on pollution sources and on how money from city water users would be spent. 
 By withholding his approval -- which was necessary because the Comptroller must sign off on any financial settlement of a lawsuit against the city -- Mr. Hevesi could have delayed the water-protection deal, which was largely worked out by Republicans, including Gov. George E. Pataki, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, and representatives of largely conservative upstate villages, towns and counties.
Mr. Hevesi said he decided to approve the accord once city, state, local and Federal officials agreed to changes that he and some private environmental groups had sought.
"We've made this a better deal," he said yesterday. "But it is just a beginning, not an end. If this agreement is not implemented in good faith and with an eye toward meticulous detail, it could all fall apart."
The Comptroller planned to release a 33-page report today on the strengths and weaknesses of the watershed plan, highlighting the recent changes. A copy was obtained by The New York Times.
Mr. Hevesi's move endorsed political detente between the city and its upstate neighbors, even as he expressed skepticism about the merits of major elements of the accord intended to insure the long-term purity of the city's water.
Under the plan, over the next 15 years New York City will buy thousands of acres of land to shield its 19 upstate reservoirs from pollution, improve sewage treatment in the watersheds, and subsidize "environmentally sound" economic development. The first payment of $86 million on April 21 will be for improving sewage treatment systems.
In return, Federal environmental officials have granted a long-term waiver from rules that would otherwise require the city to build a giant $5.1 billion filtration plant for its reservoirs west of the Hudson River. The city is already under a Federal order to build a smaller plant for $600 million to filter water from its more polluted Croton reservoirs.
The improvements were on three fronts, Mr. Hevesi said: better science, better accounting, and prolonged involvement by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, which was to have turned oversight over to state health officials in five years. Now the E.P.A. will monitor the deal for 10 years, he said.
Mr. Hevesi said that even with the changes the plan still could allow too much development to take place in sensitive watersheds and that money could still be wasted.
"For every potential initiative in the plan that should lead to pure water, there's another provision that frightens me," he said. "Particularly troubling is allowing additional sewage into clean water."
Eric A. Goldstein, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, lauded the moves by Mr. Hevesi, but pointed out that New York City remains the only large city in the United States that allows any treated waste water into its reservoirs. More than 100 plants pump treated waste water into reservoirs that supply nearly 9 million people in New York City and other communities with drinking water, he said.
Mr. Hevesi added that the agreement still relies heavily on the good faith of upstate communities that for decades have had an antagonistic relationship with New York City. Nothing in the accord would prevent a new lawsuit in the future, even though it settles the lawsuits that were already in the works, he said.
Terms of the revised pact also include an independent study by the National Academy of Sciences of the impact of the plan on water quality. A senior New York City official involved in the watershed negotiations said Mr. Hevesi's insistence on the study and other changes at first inflamed representatives from upstate communities, who felt they had reached a deal last fall.
The official said: "We didn't want to upset the delicate balance we'd struck after all those months of talking. But we wanted the Comptroller on board on this. We didn't want any more controversy."
A key step toward gaining Mr. Hevesi's approval was adding more detail to 32 contracts under which the city will spend money not only on tangible changes like fixing ailing sewage treatment plants, but also $59.9 million on loosely defined programs to foster "environmentally sound" economic development and $13 million on a "good neighbors" fund that is almost completely unfettered.
City auditors will now have access to documents to account for expenditures, and the workings of upstate groups created to supervise watershed programs will be open to more scrutiny, Mr. Hevesi said.
A senior official in the Pataki administration, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said, "There are several good things in this agreement that wouldn't be there if the Comptroller hadn't negotiated for them. We're happy for that, because on many of these points, he took the same position the Governor took -- having more accountability and audits."

HEADLINE: China Warns Denmark On Resolution

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 7

 BODY:
China bluntly warned Denmark today that relations between them would be "severely damaged" if Denmark pressed ahead with plans to sponsor a resolution condemning Beijing for human rights abuses before a United Nations commission in Geneva.
The warning comes after several European Union nations withheld support for the resolution. 
 "If Denmark insists on doing this it will end up the biggest loser," China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Shen Guofang, said in Beijing. "We still hope Denmark will think seriously about the consequences of such action. I can say relations will be severely damaged in the political and economic trade areas."
China issued its threat after France refused to back the resolution, which the European Union has presented to the United Nations Human Rights Commission every year since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.
In doing so, France argued that dialogue is preferable to confrontation with China, but the decision clearly signaled France's unwillingness to jeopardize its commercial relations with Beijing.
The French move came as President Jacques Chirac was preparing to visit Beijing next month, and it followed a recent $2 billion order from China for Airbus passenger jets, which are partly built in France.
Germany, Italy and Spain also withheld their endorsements of the resolution condemning China's human rights record, making it impossible for the European Union to sponsor it as a group.
Last week the Netherlands, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, warned other members that the group's inability to sponsor a resolution this year would undermine its credibility. The failure could also set back the European Union's hopes of developing a common foreign policy.
In the past, although resolutions critical of China have been put forward, Beijing has always succeeded in blocking them, usually by persuading the 53-nation Commission to pledge to take no action, which in practice prevents the resolution from coming to a vote.
Although the Danish resolution has little chance of passing, the United States said today that it will back it.
"I was in Geneva last week lobbying against the no-action motion," said Bill Richardson, the chief American delegate to the United Nations. "We want a full public debate on the human rights situation in China. And we will be supporting the Danish resolution."
While Danish diplomats said the Government had not yet agreed on the resolution's precise text, they said it would probably be similar to last year's version, which was comparatively weak.

Unions Demonstrate Near Office Building

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
Union construction workers demonstrated yesterday outside a downtown office building that they said a developer was transforming into apartments using state tax incentives but with nonunion labor.
About 4,000 men and women, many on their lunch break from nearby work sites, jammed three blocks outside 80 John Street, waving the pennants of dozens of locals, shouting slogans and holding signs like a handwritten one that asked, "Can I have a fat tax break when I'm unemployed?" 
 The developer of 80 John Street, WSA Equities, is converting the former Travelers Insurance building, a 70-year-old tower of 24 stories, into 147 rental units, using a two-year-old state tax-incentive program that has spurred the development of more than 1,100 apartments in lower Manhattan. Union officials said they had lobbied for the tax incentives to create more construction jobs for their members.
Edward J. Malloy, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, said the developer and its contractor were conducting the renovations at night to avoid being seen, paying workers less than the prevailing wages for union labor and denying them health-care coverage and other benefits. William Achenbaum and Fred Oliver, principals of WSA Equities, did not return a call to their Garden City, L.I., offices after the rally. The phone number for the contractor was disconnected.
Donald J. Trump, the developer; Alan G. Hevesi, the City Comptroller, and Louis Coletti, president of the Building Trades Employers Association, each mounted a flatbed truck to speak in support of the unions.

HEADLINE: Most Doubt a Resolve to Change Campaign Financing, Poll Finds

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

 BODY:
While a significant majority of the American people believe that fundamental changes are needed in the campaign financing system, most doubt that President Clinton and Congress are sincerely committed to changing it, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
The President is nevertheless maintaining his strong personal standing with the public, the poll found, despite months of sometimes withering accusations of improper campaign fund-raising tactics. 
 In contrast, Vice President Al Gore has suffered a sizable loss of favorability as the controversy over campaign finances has grown.
Almost 9 of 10 people surveyed see a need for fundamental changes in fund-raising procedures, or even a total overhaul. But only 3 in 10 believe that the President really wants change, despite his announced commitment to it. The resolve of Congress is subject to even greater doubt, with only 23 percent of the public convinced that the lawmakers, for all their talk, actually want to change the current laws.
While Mr. Clinton's commitment to change is being questioned, his personal standing remains strong as Congress gears up for hearings into his 1996 re-election practices. The telephone poll registered a 56 percent job approval rating for the President, largely because of his handling of the economy. That is only seven points below his personal high, registered by CBS News after his second inauguration.
The campaign financing issue gained momentum after the President's re-election with a steady stream of disclosures about the wide net that had been cast by the Clinton-Gore team to reach affluent donors to the Democratic Party. Accounts about a chain of high-priced fund-raising events at the White House, and sleep-over privileges in the Lincoln Bedroom for favored guests, stirred Republican accusations that the President had put White House perquisites up "for sale." Controversy only increased with news that the Democratic National Committee had had to return sizable donations because of questions about their true source and that White House invitations had gone to such figures as a foreign arms dealer and a twice-convicted felon later imprisoned for drug smuggling.
Asked about Mr. Clinton's campaign fund-raising practices, 44 percent of respondents said he had done nothing wrong, while 20 percent judged his activities unethical and 12 percent illegal. Despite his general approval rating, two of five Americans said they thought the President had made or changed policy decisions as a direct result of money he raised from major donors.
The public's general suspicion about politicians' dependence on donors was underlined when 75 percent of those polled estimated that "many public officials" generally made or changed policy positions as a result of political donations. Still, 78 percent were opposed to strict public financing of campaigns as a cure, saying it would cost taxpayers too much.
In contrast to the President's job performance rating, Vice President Gore's favorability rating fell to 25 percent, a drop of 24 points in the last three months. (A majority of Americans withheld an overall opinion, as is typically the case with Vice Presidents.) Mr. Gore has come under special scrutiny for soliciting donations in telephone calls from the White House and at a gathering of Buddhist temple-goers. He has been faulted, in turn, by political observers for seeming less skilled than Mr. Clinton in defending ambitious Clinton-Gore fund-raising techniques.
In many ways, the poll suggested that the public's views on campaign finance were still taking shape. The full details of what occurred during the Presidential campaign have yet to be laid before the public in the hearings scheduled by Congress this spring and summer. Moreover, because the public has rarely been surveyed in depth on campaign finance, any shift in its views is difficult to measure.
And, for all the heat that the issue is generating in Washington, the public is far from rating campaign law overhaul a compelling priority in comparison with crime, schools and the economy. In fact, only 2 respondents, of the 1,347 polled, cited campaign fund-raising when asked to name the nation's most important problem.
"What they do in Washington really doesn't affect me," said Frank Zupancic, a 47-year-old auto mechanic from East Lake, Ohio. "I have to go to work every day, and all they want to do is get deeper in my pocket."
Further, only 12 percent of respondents said they had been following news of the issue "very closely," and 43 percent complained that the news media had been spending too much time on it.
Whatever public reaction may develop from the Congressional hearings, the poll, conducted last Wednesday through Saturday, shows that Americans already sense that there is a clear advantage enjoyed by incumbents under the current system. Three of five estimated that political challengers faced a more difficult time than incumbents under the big-dollar financing pressures of modern campaigning.
Some jaded comments were offered by respondents in elaborating on their replies to the poll, which had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. "Too many politicians are getting rich," said Nade Wiese, a 60-year-old electrician from Steamboat Springs, Colo. "They don't want to change things because there is too much money they can put in their pockets."
As a "top priority" solution, the public favors effective campaign disclosure (54 percent) more strongly than limiting either campaign spending (23 percent) or special-interest contributions (28 percent). On specific proposals for changing the system, more than three of five favor significant free television time for Presidential candidates, while 70 percent favor cutting, to $1,000 from $5,000, the maximum that a political action committee can spend on a single candidate.
"The special-interest groups spend millions to get their point across, and people like me aren't heard at all," said Pam Elliott, a 42-year-old woman on disability in Dyersburg, Tenn. "Money talks."
A 57 percent majority endorsed a need for Congressional hearings, with Americans especially troubled by the possibility that foreign governments might have tried to buy influence through campaign contributions. The foreign threat, already a priority in the Congressional investigations, was rated most troubling by 45 percent of respondents, larger than those who cited special-interest donors (25 percent) and wealthy individuals (21 percent).
"I don't feel it's so important where the money comes from as long as it's within the United States," said Gene Fultz, 66, a retired computer analyst in Norfolk, Va. "The money from outside the country is another issue. That kind of influence is questionable."
At the same time, the public clearly does not want the Republican-controlled Congress to restrict its focus solely to the Democratic campaign. Almost 9 of 10 people said the hearings should investigate the fund-raising activities of both parties.
Republican Congressional leaders contend that the Clinton re-election drive, with its zealous emphasis on a boost of "soft money" donations to the Democratic Party, committed most of the campaign abuses last year. In the early months of the scandal search, the Democratic National Committee has already returned or promised to return more than $3 million in questionable donations. The Times/CBS News Poll, however, found that 77 percent of the public rated the Clinton campaign's financing tactics to be common to both political parties.
For all the doubts about the resolve of both parties to change the system, only 8 percent of the public thinks the current laws work well and need only minor changes. Virtually all the rest endorse fundamental change (50 percent) or complete overhaul (39 percent).
"It would settle things down if Congress did something about it," said Harris Spear, a 75-year-old retired personnel manager in Eugene, Ore. "They could get back to work and do what they're supposed to be doing."

How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted April 2-5 with 1,347 adults throughout the United States.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 36,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, race, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups, the potential sampling error is larger. For example, for either men or women taken as a group, it is plus or minus four percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in question wording or the order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: A Leader Needed on Rent Control

 BODY:
In just 10 weeks the laws protecting more than a million tenants in New York City from unrestricted rent increases will expire. Already the State Legislature is in a familiar uproar over one of the most emotional and complicated issues it will face this year. Yesterday, as tenant groups protested, the Republican-controlled Senate rejected a Democratic attempt to renew the current system of controls. That was a sensible step, because the existing setup is outmoded and unfair to tenants and landlords alike. But the process cannot stop there. What is needed now is an agreement to phase out rent control over the long term with protections for those tenants who need it the most.
Rent controls, which began as an emergency measure during World War II, have managed to survive in New York City because of the huge number of tenants who are voters. But phased decontrol makes sense economically and as a matter of fairness to citizens who pay for housing in the open market. Controls have also deprived owners of the money to keep up their properties or build new ones. This undermines the city's tax base and, at the extremes, creates an absurdly inequitable system protecting some well-to-do tenants at the expense of others. The entire system is presided over by a cumbersome and expensive bureaucracy. 
 On the other hand, swift decontrol of rents would produce hardship for middle-class families vital to the preservation of some neighborhoods. Some poor tenants would suffer, although rents in many low-income neighborhoods are already as high as the market will bear. With abrupt decontrol, middle-class tenants in Greenwich Village, the Upper West Side and other parts of the city might suffer increases of as much as 50 percent. The best answer is to phase out controls over several years while officials monitor the effects of the transition to a market system. Other logical steps would be to protect low-income tenants with gradual adjustments to market prices, while more speedily decontrolling rents for the wealthiest tenants, especially those in underpriced apartments.
The impasse and turmoil in Albany this year derive from predictable posturing by all sides. The Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, is threatening to let rent legislation expire altogether if the Democrats do not go along with some reasonable phasing-out of controls. With the vote yesterday, in which most Republicans from the city went along with efforts to block the extension of current law, Mr. Bruno proved he could take the political heat to demand a change in the current system. The Republicans are rolling in campaign contributions from landlords, but they need to raise their sights now and signal the acceptance of a more modest removal of controls. At the same time the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, whose base is in New York City, should come up with a sounder approach than simply renewing the status quo.
Where is Gov. George Pataki in all this? That is a very good question. While Mr. Pataki has made it clear that he does not like rent control in general, he has refused to take a position on what should replace it. Instead he offers himself as a broker to negotiate differences between the Assembly and Senate. The current situation demands a Governor who is willing and able to lead. He could put forward his own plan and become more than just a passive presence in Albany. Indeed, if he brokers a deal on rent control, then he could move to making one on the state budget, which is now a week overdue.

Bankers Trust's Deal a Bet on Growth-Company Prosperity

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
With its planned acquisition of Alex. Brown & Sons, the Bankers Trust New York Corporation is making a couple of bets.
The first is that the volatile health care and high-technology industries will continue to prosper -- thus leading to a need for underwriters both to take their fast-growing companies public and to help with other capital demands. 
 Bankers Trust is also assuming that the larger companies in these industries will want to go to a big integrated securities firm -- like a combined Bankers Trust-Brown -- for their investment banking needs, rather than smaller, more specialized competitors like Robertson Stephens, Hambrecht & Quist, Montgomery Securities or Cowen & Company.
Seeking to grow beyond its specialties in derivative securities, debt financing and foreign exchange trading, Bankers Trust agreed on Sunday to a $1.7 billion takeover of Alex. Brown, the nation's oldest brokerage firm, which is known for its research and banking skills in the high-technology and health care fields.
"Health care, high technology and telecommunications and media are three critical areas," for the combined firm, said Ted Virtue, a senior managing director at Bankers Trust, yesterday. "I think both from an industry and a product perspective the two firms fit perfectly together."
The Bankers Trust-Brown combination has also put a premium on specialty investment banks that similarly focus on health care and high technology.
The shares of Hambrecht & Quist, which is based in San Francisco, for example, closed at $20.875 yesterday, up $3, as investors speculated that it might soon become an acquisition target. Analysts also said yesterday that Montgomery Securities, Robertson Stephens or smaller firms with well-developed franchises in those businesses might soon attract bidders.
"From an industry point of view," said Joan S. Solotar, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, the Bankers Trust deal for Brown "highlighted the scarcity of good properties for acquisition." Ms. Solotar added that even larger firms -- like Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns and A. G. Edwards -- might attract the interest of buyers as banks and financial companies attempt to build their own investment banking franchises.
Shares in Alex. Brown rose $10, to $63.125 yesterday, after jumping a combined $11.75 on Thursday and Friday. That prompted several market professionals to speculate yesterday that the Securities and Exchange Commission might investigate to see if investors had traded on confidential information. John Heine, a spokesman for the S.E.C., declined to comment on the matter yesterday.
American investment bankers specializing in high technology have already drawn the interest of foreign buyers. Deutsche Bank A.G. hired a high-technology investment banking team from Morgan Stanley & Company last year.
And Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank that owns First Boston, in late March paid an undisclosed sum for a 25 percent stake in Volpe Brown Whelan & Company, a small investment bank that specializes in high-technology companies. The two partners have agreed to establish a $100 million merchant banking fund to invest in high-technology companies.
Some critics and competitors questioned yesterday whether a Bankers Trust-Brown combination would be able to retain the loyalty of Brown's growth-company clients, which tend to prefer the firm's specialized approach.
"This is not the model that we believe is in the best interests of the corporate customer," said Daniel H. Case 3d, the president and chief executive of Hambrecht & Quist, which, like Alex. Brown, specializes in the health care and high-technology sectors. Mr. Case said that his firm was eager to remain focused and independent, contending that it was in the best interests of its clients.
Mr. Virtue dismissed such criticism. "Clients are still going to get the same specialty focus" from the combined firm as they did from Alex. Brown, he said, noting that in the past some Brown corporate clients had left after outgrowing the Baltimore firm's financing capacities. That, he said, would be less likely to happen with the new firm.
"The Microsofts that move from their initial public offerings to the more developed stage will need debt as an alternative to capital as they mature as a company," Mr. Virtue said. Bankers Trust, he argued, could cater to such client needs, offering full-service investment and commercial banking.
The rationale for the takeover, Bankers Trust said yesterday, was "to make one-stop shopping a reality for Bankers Trust and Alex. Brown's clients."
The acquisition certainly brings Bankers Trust a swath of new businesses. Alex. Brown has 95 analysts covering 829 companies, heavily concentrated on technology, health care and other growth companies; its 150 investment bankers have built a thriving business in the market for initial public offerings, where it now has about a 5 percent share.
Brown also has a successful retail stock brokerage with about 450 brokers serving rich clients and producing commissions averaging about $800,000 a year. In addition, the firm has an investment management arm with assets of $12.5 billion.
But the transaction drew additional criticism yesterday, notably for the hefty price that Bankers Trust is paying: more than 2.5 times book value. Shares in Bankers Trust dropped $2.75, to $79.50, yesterday.
Both parties to the merger are niche players, with Bankers Trust focusing on leveraged finance to Brown's health care and high-technology specialties, said Peter K. Gonye, a longtime securities industry executive who is now a principal at Egon Zehnder, an executive search firm in New York.
Consequently, Mr. Gonye said, the combined firm would be vulnerable to a downturn in the securities markets. Indeed, he argued, the combined firm looked like "a one-trick pony" that could easily stumble in a tougher economic environment.
Mr. Case of Hambrecht contended that Alex. Brown would now become part of "a transaction culture" that might lead to the loss of its specialist expertise and long-term relationships. This, he added, should thus be an excellent time to hire disgruntled Brown bankers.
"We believe that Alex. Brown is too big to be little and too little to be big," Mr. Case said, meaning that he thought Brown had grown too big to remain a specialty firm, but did not have the financial muscle to compete with the biggest investment banks.

HEADLINE: Companies Are Finding Tasty Profits in Fancy Food

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
In the large white kitchen, a woman with a white apron stirs a plastic tub of deep red tomato sauce and black olives. Next to her, a woman squeezes dollops of black beans onto dough. Not far from her, another woman delicately closes the tiny bean hors d'oeuvres with her fingers.
For many years, most of these pates and hors d'oeuvres made at Dufour Pastry Kitchens Inc., a rapidly growing specialty food factory tucked between gritty meat packing plants on Manhattan's West Side, ended up on the tables of New York's restaurants. Now they are just as likely to end up on tables in Montreal, Bermuda, Aspen, Colo., and Honolulu. 
 "We didn't want to be a small cottage industry," said Carla Krasner, who, with Judi Arnold, founded the business in 1984.
Dufour Pastry Kitchens is not alone in its strategy. Over the last few years, dozens of local fancy food manufacturers have started exporting to national and international markets. Because of improved packaging, overnight delivery services, a growing appetite for high-end food and an increasing cachet of things made in New York, dozens of companies are moving beyond New York.
"This has happened quietly, not because of any public policy initiative but because local businesses have taken advantage of advances in distribution and communications," said Mitchell Moss, director of New York University's Taub Urban Research Center. "There's a genuine recognition now that food production in New York tends to be small and inventive and innovative."
The number of such manufacturers has grown from only a handful a decade ago to more than 60 now, including such well-known names as Balducci's, H & H Bagels East and Junior's World Famous Cheesecake Inc. But the trend has gone largely undetected because many of the exporters are small, private and family-owned.
Another problem, perhaps, has been defining what is often called gourmet food. One suggestion: food that is more select, expensive and dependent on special attention or handling, said John P. Roberts, president of the National Association for Specialty Food Trade, a Manhattan-based trade group that is the host for fancy food exhibitions.
Nevertheless, there are some strong indicators, including these:
*In a survey of local specialty food manufacturers, the Industrial Technology Assistance Corporation, a nonprofit group, found that the proportion of New York products sold outside of New York climbed from 10.8 percent in 1992 to 26.1 percent in 1996. Four months ago, the group began a program to help these manufacturers increase their products' shelf life and to automate, said Ken Bicknell, the group's field engineer for food, beverage and consumer products.
*In the last 10 years, the number of New York-based specialty food manufacturers belonging to the National Association for Specialty Food Trade, has nearly tripled to 68, Mr. Roberts said.
*D. I. Group, a Batavia, Ill.-based company that distributes specialty foods to Europe, works with more than 60 New York City fancy food manufacturers, up from less than 20 in 1988, said Ernest Mahaffey, president of D. I. Group.
*Tech Pak Inc., a packaging company in Peabody, Mass., estimates that the number of New York clients using refrigerated gel packs to ship fancy food has jumped 10-fold to more than 100 in 8 years, said Coleby Mantz, marketing manager for Tech Pak.
Examples abound. Balducci's mail-order business, started in 1992, now comprises 24 percent of all its sales, offering items like stuffed butterflied lamb. Three-quarters of its mail-order business comes from outside New York City, up from half only five years ago.
H & H Bagels East opened a shipping office in December to handle out-of-town requests to England, Ireland, France and Israel; already, there has been a 50 percent increase in orders. One customer is Jimmy Kaperonis, a former New Yorker who now lives in Athens. He has ordered boxes of plain, cinnamon raisin and poppyseed bagels on several occasions at about $200 a shipment. "I miss them very much," Mr. Kaperonis said. "Everybody likes them and no one here makes them."
Only a few years ago, Michel's Magnifique sold 80 percent of its pates and terrines to New York establishments; now, it sells only 17 to 20 percent, with the rest going to places like Venezuala, Curacao, Mexico and Finland. Since 1993, Sylvia's, the famed Harlem restaurant, has been distributing its renowned barbecue sauce to a growing number of United States markets, as well as Japan, South Africa and England. Another noted restaurant, Sarabeth's, has watched its jams and condiments become an export item, increasing from zero only a few years ago to up to 1,000 cases a year.
"New York City has this allure of being the big city that has everything unique," said Amiram Dror, who, with his wife, Debra Miller, owns Black Hound New York, which has seen its exports climb sharply.
Of course, specialty food exporting can cost twice as much to ship overseas, and sometimes the process is complicated by local customs regulations. But Mr. Roberts anticipates growing demand since people are developing more sophisticated tastes and it is easier to order. Some worry, however, that the blossoming business may soon reach a crossroads.
Mr. Moss says that when exporters get bigger, they will need more space and tax and other incentives if they want to stay in New York.
The city says that it is aware of the "niche" nature of the fancy food business and that it has already offered financial assistance to one such company, International Delights, said Russell A. Harding, executive vice president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation.
Importers, meanwhile, say they have noticed that customers seeking fancy food who used to demand only food from overseas now are just as satisfied with domestically produced high-end food.
"At one time, gourmet food used to be the purview of the importers," said Tim Metzger, vice president of sales and marketing for the Gilway Company, a specialty food importer in Paramus, N.J. "Now, it's not the case, not at all. Whether it's from Brooklyn, N.Y., or Dijon, France, it almost doesn't matter."

Students Take Hospitality

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
The Hospitality Consulting Group of Coopers & Lybrand, the Manhattan accounting firm, is getting an extra hand these days from three sophomores from the Frederick Douglass Academy, a public high school in Manhattan.
Quefe Arner, 15, of the Bronx; Gabriela Orochena, 16, of Manhattan, and Shameen Robinson, 15, of the Bronx are among 140 student interns at travel-related businesses in New York City this year, participants in a program run jointly by the city's Board of Education and the private sector. 
 Administered by the board's Academy of Travel and Tourism, the program, which is duplicated nationwide, tries to interest students from six high schools in careers in hospitality, said Richard Graziano, the academy's director. Students take seven courses offered by their schools, from geography to economics to tourism, and receive paid internships at one of 40 companies, including public relations and accounting companies, hotels and travel agencies.
While the three students at Coopers & Lybrand are doing mostly clerical tasks for now, the chairman of the company's hospitality services unit, Bjorn Hanson, said he planned to give them bigger challenges as their skills developed in the next two years.
"We hope to have them working on spreadsheets and drafting sections of reports," he said. "I hope they get a real sense of all aspects of our business."

HEADLINE: A Gain in Jobs Would Justify Higher Inflation

 BODY:

To the Editor:
If anything, Bob Herbert's "Bogeyman Economics" (column, April 4), which advocates risking higher inflation to create more jobs, understates the justification for promoting economic expansion. 
 Recent studies have found that even if unemployment went as low as 4.5 percent, there would be only a modest rise in inflation -- maybe two percentage points over a three-year period; that there is no loss of national output from rising inflation until rates hit 10 percent, and that in the last two years, thanks to lower unemployment, wage rates for lower paid workers have been increasing faster than the national average.
Thus, even when inflation rates begin to rise, there is no reason to curtail the economic expansion.
There are no output losses to the nation and the benefits from the expansion will disproportionately go to the neediest workers.
Particularly in a period when low-skilled women are being thrown off welfare and affirmative action is being weakened, it is imperative that employment opportunities and earnings of lower paid workers increase even if there may be adverse consequences for Wall Street investors and bondholders.

Mixed Message

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re Bob Herbert's April 4 column: Our economic and political systems are giving us a mixed message: 
 (1) There should be lots of unemployed people because an unemployment rate of 5 percent is necessary to halt inflation; (2) there should be no unemployed people because welfare is too costly.
Does this mean there should be enforced joblessness with no welfare? This is inconsistent with the values Americans like to believe we stand for.

Keeping the Poor Down

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Bob Herbert argues that our economy is constantly manipulated for the benefit of the wealthy, and to the detriment of the poor ("Bogeyman Economics," column, April 4). 
 In fact, greater democracy is a most frightening prospect to the wealthy.
As informational television and computers help create a more informed, better educated and more determined group of people on the bottom of the economic scale, the wealthy seem to be busy thinking of methods and justifications for keeping the poor "in their places."
Beneath the pseudo-economic doomsday babble, there exists the frightening prospect that if a great many of society's have-nots become aware of their rights and learn to fight for them, there will be a forced sharing of money and power. The information age makes this a more imminent possibility.
As Mr. Herbert points out, we should be alert for those who claim to protect us from economic disaster but who seem to be striving mightily to maintain our present levels of poor and unemployed. A democratic nation cannot survive on such a strategy.

HEADLINE: A Kremlin Telltale Expose From the Provinces

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 7

 BODY:
Most government officials wait until they are out of office to publish kiss-and-tell memoirs. Others let it all leak out while they are still on the job.
But a well-known Russian politician has gone one step further: he wrote a memoir critical of President Boris N. Yeltsin's administration before he even stepped into the Kremlin. 
 The politician, Boris Y. Nemtsov, 37, the popular Governor of Nizhny Novgorod, was appointed First Deputy Prime Minister in charge of free market reform three weeks ago and instantly became the shining star of a new economic team led by Anatoly B. Chubais.
This week the Russian publishing house Vagrius is expected to release "A Provincial Man," Mr. Nemtsov's account of his experiences as Governor, which is loaded with acid assessments of his new superiors in Moscow.
In Mr. Nemtsov's view, Mr. Yeltsin is a typical Russian czar, bold but often careless and out of touch. The man he reports to directly, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, is in his view "a good man," but "not quite ready to be Prime Minister in a crisis."
Mr. Nemtsov is not at all sheepish about his somewhat tactless literary debut.
"There are people who urged me to remove everything about Chernomyrdin," he said rather gleefully in an interview. "I said, 'No, let it all be there.' "
He did order his publishers to add a note explaining that the book was written before he joined Mr. Chernomyrdin's team.
Mr. Nemtsov, whose was assigned the formidable tasks of fighting unfair monopolies, fixing Russia's collapsing pension fund and reforming the housing system, called his new job a "kamikaze mission." But with bravado and close attention to his image as a populist and maverick reformer, Mr. Nemtsov seems to be positioning himself for an even more ambitious future.
Intelligent and engaging, Mr. Nemtsov is the darling of Russian reformers and Western economists who admire his efforts to introduce market reforms to backward Nizhny Novgorod.
Though he stoutly denies any plans to run for President, he hardly fits the arch title of his memoirs, "A Provincial Man." No other Russian governor has hobnobbed with the likes of Bill Clinton, Andrei D. Sakharov and Margaret Thatcher.
In the interview he irreverently referred to the former British Prime Minister as "babushka," the Russian word for Grandma. When soliciting her views on privatizing state monopolies and introducing private pension plans, as he recently did, he calls her Baroness.
He writes less admiringly of Mr. Clinton, describing him as "naive." He complained that Mr. Clinton "views Russia and particularly me solely through the prism of American interests."
A few days after being appointed, Mr. Nemtsov announced that he had persuaded Mr. Yeltsin to force Government officials to sell their Mercedez-Benz and Volvo cars at auction and use only Russian-made Volgas, which are in fact made in Nizhny Novgorod.
As reform measures go, it did little to cut Government spending or even increase Volga sales (the director of the ailing car company said the addition orders for limousines would only be a drop in the bucket), but it was a quick, crowd-pleasing way to get attention.
More recently, Mr. Nemtsov has taken up the more challenging battle of promoting an anti-corruption decree that would require companies to bid in open tenders for Government business, whether it be supplying the army with boots or huge construction contracts. Currently, Government contracts are awarded in secret, with large kickbacks to bureaucrats.
The politically delicate decree had existed in draft form for more than two years, but never made it all the way through the tangled and often feuding Russian bureaucracy to Mr. Yeltsin's desk.
"Mr. Yeltsin asked me why this decree had never been discussed in his office," Mr. Nemtsov recalled. "I said, 'I don't know, I've never been in this office, but my idea is that it has to be done immediately.' "
Mr. Nemtsov said he had pushed the draft through by forcing bureaucrats in the Russian Parliament to sit down in his office and not leave until they had signed off on it. He said he then personally rang every clerk in the Kremlin to make sure it did not get sidetracked, and confidently predicted that it would be approved by Mr. Yeltsin this week.
His is the kind of brash self-confidence that causes some of his older, more battle-scarred colleagues to roll their eyes.
"Anyone who says they are sure that they can get Yeltsin to sign something by a certain date is either very stupid, or really inexperienced," said a top administration official who was deposed in the recent Cabinet shuffle that led to Mr. Nemtsov's appointment. "He is smart, but he still has a lot to learn."
His breezy, often amusing and immodest book even includes a mention of his encounter with the actor Richard Gere, who visited Nizhny Novgorod in 1995. The tall and handsome Russian Governor confessed that he was baffled why women all over the world were mesmerized by the "short, skinny" actor. But he allowed that the two Russian women escorting Mr. Gere "were truly beautiful."
Under a chapter heading titled "What I Adore," Mr. Nemtsov wrote, "Women."
But it is his critiques of leading Russian politicians that are most likely to tantalize Russian readers. He described the powerful Mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, often cited as a likely presidential candidate, as "a cautious political figure who pretends he is the chief manager, builder and street-sweeper of Moscow."
Mr. Nemtsov depicts himself as anything but cautious.
The Governor accompanied Mr. Yeltsin on a notorious trip to Berlin, during which the Russian President drank too much and, among other things, snatched the baton away from the conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic.
"He behaved badly, horribly, everybody knows about it," Mr. Nemtsov wrote. "We had a tense conversation. He didn't like it that I allowed myself to reprimand him." He added that Mr. Yeltsin did not hold a grudge.
Mr. Nemtsov, who says he took the Cabinet job mainly because Mr. Yeltsin and his daughter Tatyana pressured him heavily to do so, acts like a man who has nothing to lose. Indeed, he asked for and got a salary of $1,000 a month, which, however modest by Western standards, is considerably more than Mr. Chernomyrdin's average monthly Government wage of $770 a month.
On the other hand, unlike Mr. Chernomyrdin, a former chairman of Gazprom, the giant gas company, Mr. Nemtsov cannot rely on private resources. His book advance was $5,000.
He insists that his willingness to risk his popularity by working for the Kremlin is proof that he does not have presidential ambitions.
"It would be better for me to run the way Clinton did -- directly from the post of Governor," he argued. "The fact that I accepted this job shows I don't have such plans because it is difficult to gain positive points in this job."
But Aleksandr I. Lebed, the outspoken former general who was dismissed after a brief, noisy stint as national security adviser, was not politically damaged by his ouster. If anything, it enhanced his reputation.
When Mr. Nemtsov began his reform efforts in Nizhny Novgorod five years ago, he relied heavily on grants and consultants from Europe and the United States. In his book, Mr. Nemtsov adopted some of the West-bashing tone that is increasingly popular in Russia. He denounces American imperialism and even criticizes ordinary Americans for smiling too much. At home, however, he is often cast as a Westernizer.
Mr. Nemtsov does not deny it -- or back away from lofty comparisons.
"Everyone knows I speak English, including your President," he said. "I usually say, there was a great czar in Russia, Peter the Great. He was not ashamed to go to Holland to study the European experience. Everything good in the West should be in Russia, and everything bad in the West, say, drugs in Holland, should stay there."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Soars vs. Yen Again And Is Strong Against Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose above 126 yen for the first time in four and a half years yesterday and surged against other currencies, too, after Japan's trade minister suggested that he was not too concerned about the dollar's recent gains.
The remarks by the minister, Shinji Sato, came one day after the dollar surpassed 125 yen for the first time since January 1993, and were interpreted by foreign exchange traders as a signal that neither Japan nor the United States would intervene to halt the dollar's ascent for the time being. 
 The dollar was also helped by the third consecutive day of gains in the American stock market as well as by broad weakness in the German mark, which suffered from growing expectations that Europe's single currency would be introduced as scheduled in 1999, as well as news that the German labor market remained weak in March.
"The dollar is seeing strength beyond the scope of what one would have expected," said Jim Powers, vice president of foreign exchange sales at Westdeutsche Landes Bank in New York.
The dollar hit an intraday high of 126.52 yen, the strongest since August 1992, before settling in New York at 126.23 yen, up from 125.56 yen on Monday. The dollar cost 1.7143 marks, up from 1.7109 and the highest since March 6.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin helped inspire the latest surge in the dollar last Friday when he said in a visit to Japan that countries should not use exchange rates as weapons in trade disputes. That was viewed as a sign that the United States was not uncomfortable with the dollar at these levels, even if it was starting to widen the Japanese trade surplus with the United States by making Japanese exports more affordable in this country.
Mr. Sato accelerated the demand for dollars yesterday by telling reporters, "We can't do things every time the dollar goes up by 1 yen."
The dollar was helped further by the unemployment news from Germany, which weakened the mark. Although the jobless rate fell to 11.7 percent last month from 12.2 percent in February, the decline had been expected and was affected by seasonal factors.
Remarks by Guntram Palm, a senior member of Germany's central bank, also put pressure on the mark. Mr. Palm told reporters he believed "more than ever before" that Europe's planned single currency would start on time, taking away the mark's role as Europe's most stable currency.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Copper Prices Move Higher As Drop in Supply Accelerates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Copper prices rose yesterday after a larger-than-expected drop in stockpiles renewed expectations that demand would keep supplies lean.
On other markets, wheat prices rose and soybeans fell. 
 The London Metal Exchange said yesterday that its copper inventories had fallen 6,475 metric tons, to 167,125 tons as of Monday. Analysts had generally expected a decline of 2,000 to 4,000 metric tons. (A metric ton is 1.1 ton.) The exchange's copper stockpile is now 48 percent lower than it was a year earlier.
The decline provided the latest evidence that demand for copper is strong. Builders are the largest consumers of copper, and last week, the Commerce Department reported that American construction spending rose 2.3 percent in February, the second consecutive increase.
"Stockpiles are falling because demand in the U.S. is still fairly good and the recent economic data are very constructive," said William O'Neill, director of futures research at Merrill Lynch in New York.
Copper for May delivery rose 2.15 cents, to $1.069 a pound, on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Monday, copper prices fell to their lowest point since Feb. 4 amid concern that rising interest rates in the United States would curb demand.
Wheat prices rose as a Chinese purchase from Canada raised hopes that other buyers were set to place orders.
China recently bought 500,000 to 1.5 million metric tons of Canadian wheat, traders said, and could buy as much as 100,000 additional tons. Algeria, Egypt and Iran are also expected to order a total of about 650,000 tons soon, traders said.
The sales put added pressure on worldwide supplies. The International Grains Council expects global inventories to total 100 million metric tons by June 30, among the lowest levels of the last 20 years.
Wheat for May delivery, which would come from last year's crop, rose 1.5 cents, to $3.82 a bushel, on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Soybeans fell on concern that demand for the United States supply would fall as record harvests are expected in South America.
July soybeans fell 14 cents, to $8.535 a bushel.

HEADLINE: A Photography Curator Narrows His Focus;
After 29 Years of Displaying Others' Work, John Szarkowski Returns to His Own

BYLINE: By VICKI GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
When John Szarkowski was reminded that it was during his term as director of the photography department at the Museum of Modern Art that photography was recognized as a high art, he responded drily, "Is that what went wrong?" He never did seem entirely happy with new developments in the medium in the late 1970's and 80's, so perhaps the remark was not entirely ironic.
From 1962 to 1991, Mr. Szarkowski (pronounced shar-KOV-ski) presided over photography's ascent to the higher echelons of art and the upper ranks of the art market. Now a director emeritus, he was for almost three decades the most powerful curator in the field; there were not many others for a good part of his tenure. 
 He consistently presented photography as an art form of a level of modernism and importance comparable to that of other work in the museum. His position, and his extraordinarily elegant writing, meant that he set the standards and the course of taste for a large audience that had not ventured into the area of photography before.
Before coming to New York from Wisconsin and assisting the medium onto the glory track, Mr. Szarkowski was a photographer himself, but he did not photograph much during his years at the Modern. Curators seldom do; their cameras languish while the museum calls.
So, of course, he returned to his first love as soon as he stopped answering. The result: a book called "Mr. Bristol's Barn, With Excerpts From Mr. Blinn's Diary" (Abrams). An exhibition of Mr. Szarkowski's photographs of the barn opens tomorrow and continues through May 10 at Pace Wildenstein MacGill at 32 East 57th Street in Manhattan.
Not that he spent the 29-year interim pining. "The Modern was a very demanding job, and an interesting job," he said. "I was very lucky. There were wonderful new photographers then, and wonderful old photographers nobody had seen." For starters, the museum had never before put on one-man shows of Brassai, Bill Brandt or Andre Kertesz.
"God, it was easy!" said the man who did.
In the late 50's, Mr. Szarkowski photographed and wrote the texts for two books: "The Idea of Louis Sullivan," an appreciation of the architect's work, in 1956, and "The Face of Minnesota," in 1958. He won two Guggenheim Fellowships; the first supported the work on the Sullivan book, the second a photographic project in the Canadian wilderness that he never quite finished. (The place was so remote, it could be reached only by canoe, with frequent portages. Mr. Szarkowski, now 71, says he does not think he will go back.)
His more recent subject is the barn on his farm in East Chatham, N.Y., which was built by hand down to the last joint and rafter more than a century ago, when the farm was owned by Abel Bristol. The diary, written by a nearby farmer, Philo Blinn, around the time of the Civil War, makes a crackling case for the difficulty of the small farmer's life in the 19th century. On his 39th birthday, Blinn wrote that he was almost an old man, on his 40th that he had "all the while been so very busy getting ready to live, or in other words, getting something to live on, that I have never thought to improve, to value, to enjoy the present."
Mr. Szarkowski has recorded the barn's hand-hewn geometries and hand-carved graffiti with the clear, straightforward, respectful approach to nuances of fact that characterized so much 19th-century photography. That is precisely what he values most highly in the medium.
In 1958 he wrote, "I want to make pictures possessing the qualities of poise, clarity of purpose and natural beauty, as these qualities were achieved in the work of the good wet-plate photographers," like Mathew Brady, William Henry Jackson and Timothy O'Sullivan.
It is easy to understand why the Modern organized six shows of Atget's utterly clear and totally poised work under Mr. Szarkowski's aegis. Even the sardonic view of the late 20th century that he introduced in a 1967 show called "New Documents: Photographs by Arbus, Friedlander, and Winogrand" flirted with the terms poise, clarity and beauty, but gave them a new edge and precariousness.

Hunting for Images Of the Outdoors
Mr. Szarkowski retired at the museum's mandatory age but neither broke step nor slowed down. As soon as he left the Modern, he began forming a photography collection from scratch for Paine Webber on the theme of land use.
"It has proven a whole lot harder than I thought," he said. "You'd be astonished at how few good pictures that have to do with farming, fishing, mining, logging there are."
He sometimes sends students scurrying off to local historical societies or to the Federal Department of Agriculture to root out pictures of campers, wheat farming and railroad spurs. Such images, he laments, are being allowed to fall off their original glass plates because they do not fit a narrow view of art.
He is nearly finished with another book, on the photographs and writings of Liberty Hyde Bailey, the patron saint of American horticulture. He also hops about the country teaching, at the University of Arizona, Florida International University, the University of Kansas, Williams College, Yale and Harvard.
"Florida was especially good," he said. "Those great Caribbean students, they understand something that other students don't, that art is supposed to have something to do with play, with fun, with dancing. They don't make the mistake of thinking they have to think the thing out before doing it. Maybe it has something to do with the weather."
These teaching stints have convinced him that there are a lot of good young photographers out there, which is not the same as photographers who change notions of what the medium can be. Mr. Szarkowski seriously doubts that there is anyone under 40 today as good as the best photographers over 50 or 60. Maybe, he said, now that he is no longer obligated to look, he is just not looking hard enough. But having responded to the spirit that was abroad in the late 1960's and 70's, and having put it on the world map, he is singularly reluctant to give it up.

Careers Aimed At the Galleries
Students today, he said, understand that they might conceivably make their living selling pictures in art galleries, an idea that did not raise its head until quite recently. So they check out what is being sold, which generally persuades them that the big ticket is self-expression and individuality. Even if they realize that they have not lived long enough to be all that different, they do their best to invent a distinction or to inflate their limited experience to marketable proportions.
"Most of this work, I admit," Mr. Szarkowski said, "seems to me quite tedious and a little sad."
He went on, "It does seem to me that awareness of the galleries has not been altogether salutary for the young photographer." A pause. "Having said that, I would also agree that no other opportunity that has faced photographers within my memory has been altogether salutary either."
He has a solution: "The best way to be a photographer is to be rich." Stieglitz, Strand, and Cartier-Bresson all had some money. Dorothea Lange, who was married to Paul Schuster Taylor, an economics professor, used to speak jokingly of her Taylor Foundation grants.
"Maybe," Mr. Szarkowski said, "photographers should become insurance executives like Wallace Stevens and Charles Ives." Visions of W. Eugene Smith and Diane Arbus compiling actuarial tables dance through the air.
When Mr. Szarkowski began photographing, he wanted to make pictures that would be socially useful, as most people did during the Depression and World War II. After the war, people thought "this was the great opportunity for photography," he said. "This new medium, pictures and text together, proposed a new opportunity to explain life to the world."

The World Will Do As a Starting Point
In 1960, when he canoed into Canada, Mr. Szarkowski hoped to save a wilderness by photographing it, but the idea of social usefulness lost its luster for documentarians over the next few years.
Now, he said, "if you want to save something from exploitation, don't photograph it." And he is convinced that "socially useful" is a decidedly inferior point from which to start out to be an artist.
For him, the world will do fine to start with, and exploring it for some new perception rather than illustrating what is already known is still the best mode of attack.
Mr. Szarkowski recalled that Garry Winogrand, the master of the quickly snatched street photograph, had no objection to people setting up pictures; if they came up with interesting images, more power to them. Winogrand said his problem was that he did not have enough imagination to think up anything half as insane as what he saw on the street all the time.
In 1989, when photography turned 150, Mr. Szarkowski paid tribute with a show and a book called "Photography Until Now." He organized the history of the medium in terms of major technical shifts like photomechanical reproduction that changed the means and often the distribution of images.
The most recent technical change, digitization, has not registered strongly on his viewfinder: "I have absolutely no interest in the fact that you can make a photograph with the Empire State Building where the Chrysler Building is. You have always been able to do that, with scissors."
Mr. Szarkowski conceded that the computer may change photographic styles, but he cannot believe it will change the fact that an individual's view of what is really interesting and important in the world is what makes a picture worth attention. For that matter, he said, "most photographs, whether they shift buildings or not, are not very interesting."
The director emeritus is still actively on the prowl for the few that are.

HEADLINE: Blacks Left Baseball Behind in Rural South

 BODY:

To the Editor:
While baseball's history of racism may help explain declining black interest in the game as Brent Staples claims (" 'A White Man's Place to Be,' " Editorial Notebook, April 8), the great black migration from South to North has likely played a larger role. 
 When most American blacks lived in the rural South, playing fields were plentiful, and blacks who moved North retained their affection for the game. But their children and their children's children have had to adapt to the exigencies of city life. Concrete basketball courts, unlike verdant baseball diamonds, can thrive in cramped urban spaces. It's also cheaper to play basketball -- no gloves or bats required -- than baseball.
Today the spacious suburbs, with plenty of room and money for the national pastime, breed a growing number of professional baseball players and fans. And the suburbs remain disproportionately white.
This geographic reality -- rooted in an economic reality that is the legacy of American racism -- is the likeliest cause of black Americans' turning away from baseball and toward other sports, particularly basketball.

HEADLINE: Nothing Fails Like Success

BYLINE: By Andrew Sullivan; Andrew Sullivan, a senior editor at The New Republic, is the editor of "Same-Sex Marriage: Pro and Con," a reader.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
At first blush, John Major and Newt Gingrich are about as different as two politicians could be. For six interminable years, John Major has mercilessly bored the British public, his fathomless grayness now an emblem of English ennui. Newt Gingrich, on the other hand, bursts with messianic enthusiasm that alternately inspires and bewilders. One exudes the charisma of a mildly panicked bank manager; the other the maturity of a student debate coach.
But for all their differences, Mr. Major and Mr. Gingrich face a similar predicament. Both are the first true conservative leaders to emerge in Britain and America after the cold war, and both have presided over an unprecedented consolidation of the conservative gains of the 1980's. And yet, despite these real achievements, both have been rewarded with approval ratings of around 30 percent and political parties in revolt. Torn apart by their fellow conservatives, both leaders have become symbols of how fragile Anglo-American conservatism has become. 
 Yes, of course, both Mr. Major and Mr. Gingrich made their fair share of personal errors. Mr. Gingrich fatally overplayed his hand in the budget negotiations of 1995 and 1996. Mr. Major began his second term with a disastrous attempt to peg the pound to the Deutsche mark, resulting in Britain's humiliating expulsion from the European Monetary System. And neither has exactly been an elegant communicator of his ideas or goals.
But a very good case can be made nonetheless that their achievements vastly outweigh their howlers. Without Mr. Gingrich, the realignment of 1994 would never have happened. Without him, a balanced budget and welfare reform would never have been shoehorned into President Clinton's agenda.
Mr. Major, too, has quietly overhauled the British economy, ridding it of the boom-bust cycle of the last 50 years, reducing unemployment to half Europe's average, squeezing inflation to Japanese levels and reforming Britain's sclerotic health care and education systems. By their deft positioning, Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Major have also spawned those facile figures, Mr. Clinton and Tony Blair, the British Labor Party leader, whose policies have become flattering shadows of the men they profess to scorn.
And how did conservatives reward their stalwart leaders? For the most part, they have torn at their throats, stabbed them in the back and pushed them to the edge of political extinction. Washington these days is full of off-the-record quotes denigrating the Speaker's leadership and even his sanity. For his part, Mr. Major has been pilloried by the right, in Parliament and in the press for the last five years.
Sure, both leaders have failed to provide the ideological coherence and excitement their supporters remember from the 1980's. But they have failed to provide it because the ideology that inspires their followers bears little relation to the post-cold war reality these leaders actually have to face.
In America, Mr. Gingrich is increasingly isolated from the religious and economic right. The fundamentalist right demands a constitutional amendment to ban virtually all abortion. The economic right demands deep tax cuts as well as a balanced budget. Any governing conservative knows that these things are pipe dreams in conflicted, modern America, and so tries to tack around or toward them.
Bob Dole was impaled on these two unrealities -- taking positions on both abortion and taxes that managed to be both uninspiring to his base and unconvincing to everyone else. And Mr. Gingrich's attempts to square the circle -- by deftly avoiding social issues and tactically delaying tax cuts in favor of a balanced budget -- has only furthered his isolation on the right. From Jack Kemp to Ralph Reed, from The Wall Street Journal to William Kristol's screeds in The Weekly Standard, the derision is deafening.
In Britain, the conservative ideologues have found a tougher litmus test. Their Elysian equivalent to a constitutional abortion ban is a declaration of war on the European Union and a complete restoration of Britain's national sovereignty. (They have mercifully forsaken restoration of the British Empire.)
But any governing conservative knows that these are not realistic options. Britain cannot simply withdraw from Europe without heavy economic cost. Moreover, in the modern world, the complex interdependence of nations is not an idea whose merits are to be debated; it is a fact.
So Mr. Major has tacked to and fro, trying to find a way between Europe's bad policies and Britain's real interests. For this effort, he has been rewarded with scathing contempt from the Tory ranks. The public sees his dithering; the party sees his betrayal, and the electorate will likely see to his political demise when elections are held on May 1.
But the truth is, both Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Major are the true conservatives. They recognize that, after the cold war, clear-cut ideological crusades are no longer easy ventures and that, in the wake of conservatism's recent gains, pragmatic consolidation -- and tactical advance -- is by far the best policy.
Now that the Labor and Democratic parties have moved much closer to the Tory and Republican consensus, the game is no longer a race to the extremes; it's a chess match for the conservative center. And that requires the kind of pragmatic politics that ideological conservatives find as inimical in America as Europhobes do in Britain.
There are, of course, no viable alternative conservative leaders to either Mr. Gingrich or Mr. Major, because there isn't really a viable alternative politics. Kempism failed in 1996. The women of America are hardly likely to rally to a party led by Dick Armey or Pat Buchanan. Popular mavericks, like Senator John McCain, would never win over the party base.
And in Britain, the campaign has shown that John Major is still the most popular Tory around.
But none of that seems to matter to the new Robespierres of the right. In Britain right now, the right wing has effectively hounded its own competent, intrepid leader off the edge of the political cliff. In Washington, it seems only a matter of time before the purists of the party do exactly the same thing.

HEADLINE: An Improved Watershed Deal

 BODY:
The one official who could have delayed and possibly derailed the historic agreement between New York City and upstate communities to protect the city's water supply has now approved it. Alan Hevesi, the City Comptroller, spent nearly six months reviewing every line of the deal and demanding changes, but it was time well spent. The agreement he formally approved yesterday provides for much tighter controls on spending and for periodic scientific reviews that could lead to stronger regulations down the road.
This is not to take anything away from the original plan unveiled last fall by Gov. George Pataki to protect water quality in the city's upstate reservoirs. With the assistance of his chief counsel, Michael Finnegan, the Governor persuaded upstate residents -- in exchange for a huge cash transfusion from New York City -- to go slow on commercial development and accept other restrictions to spare the watershed from further degradation. The city, in return, would be spared the cost of building a $5.1 billion filtration system. This was a political breakthrough, ending years of upstate-downstate hostility. But as the City Comptroller, Mr. Hevesi is obliged to insure that the money is well spent. His fine-tuning improves the chances that it will be. 
 Under the plan, over the next 15 years New York City will buy thousands of acres of land to shield its 19 upstate reservoirs from pollution, spend over $1 billion to build or improve sewage treatment plants near streams that feed the reservoirs, and subsidize "environmentally sound" economic development in the surrounding hills and valleys. In return, Federal officials have granted the city a long-term waiver from rules that would otherwise require filtration.
Mr. Hevesi's amendments will give city auditors much greater control over how and where the money is spent. He also insisted on continuing Federal oversight and on a series of independent scientific studies, the first of which is due in 1999, to monitor water quality. If the scientists say that water quality is not improving, the city can seek to change the terms of the deal.
A few upstate politicians are not happy with Mr. Hevesi's efforts to increase the city's ability to monitor the agreement and demand midcourse adjustments in the future. A few environmentalists, meanwhile, complain that some provisions in the agreement, including the rules governing new sewage treatment plants, are still too weak. Mr. Hevesi himself warns that the deal is merely "a beginning, not an end," and that it will fail unless all concerned live up to their promises.
Less than a year ago, however, there was no deal at all, and few prospects of achieving one. There is now in place an arrangement that will provide the towns and hamlets of the watershed with an economic boost and provide city residents, if all goes well, with a steady supply of inexpensive, high-quality drinking water. The plan is well worth the effort required to make it work.

HEADLINE: What Vanity and Casual Fridays Wrought

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
After years of blue suits, Patrick Yalung has started to think about clothing and has come to this conclusion: he likes it.
"Before, I had all dark suits and all white shirts," said Mr. Yalung, a 38-year-old executive for Wells Fargo in Phoenix. "Now, I get pants with patterns in them and wear them with a sport coat. I guess you could say I've become a little more fashion conscious" -- and willing to spend more on clothing. 
Even as sales of women's apparel have fallen in recent years, sales of men's clothing have been rising. Between 1989 and 1996, sales of men's clothing grew 21.3 percent, to $41.2 billion, a record high, while women's apparel fell 10 percent from their record high, $84 billion in 1989, according to Tactical Retail Solutions, a market research firm in New York.
There is other evidence of men's expanding closets. Figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and trade organizations confirm that men's spending has been rising faster in recent years.
Of course, women still spend nearly twice as much on clothing as men do; this week, women's designers have been strutting their stuff on New York runways, beckoning that huge market. But many retailers at all price levels report that their men's business -- particularly in brand-label sportswear -- is now growing faster than or at least as fast as their women's.
At J. C. Penney, for example, men's sales have grown at a rate of two percentage points faster than women's over the last four years. At Nordstrom Inc., men's wear now accounts for 18 percent of the company's sales, up from 16 percent in the first half of the decade. At the Neiman Marcus subsidiary Bergdorf Goodman, the only real growth is in the men's shops, said the company's chairman, Stephen C. Elkin.
Some makers are also cashing in. Just yesterday, the Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation, renowned for its preppy sportswear, said it would offer stock to the public and boasted of 15 percent growth in its men's wear business.
Men's clothing has traditionally been the last purchase out of the family budget -- after clothing for the rest of the family. But that has been changing for several reasons.
One is the increasingly casual workplace. It was not so many years ago that men had two basic uniforms: suits for work, and jeans and sweat shirts for the weekends. But when the concept of casual Fridays -- and sometimes other weekdays, too -- became a mainstay at a significant number of American companies, many men found themselves without the proper wardrobe.
Suddenly, they actually had to think about what they would wear. "Going casual allowed me to be a little more creative," Mr. Yalung said.
They started looking at clothing like cotton pants, knit shirts and sport coats, and buying them in big numbers. "What we have noticed is that there is a sea change in fashion consciousness in guys," said Isaac Lagnado, the president of Tactical Retail Solutions. "Casual Friday brought a whole new wardrobe with it."
Even political figures have adopted the trend, he said. "You see Al Gore wearing appropriate yuppie casual clothes like pressed khakis, the right casual shoes and a nice sport shirt," he said. "What is more, some of this is actually quite expensive."
Another reason for the change is that while apparel has historically been the domain of women -- retail experts say women pick out roughly half of men's clothing alone -- men are increasingly taking an interest in their own wardrobes. "Men are beginning to shop like women used to shop and women are shopping more like men once did," said Rick Gallagher, vice president of the National Retail Federation. "Women are not driven by fashion as much anymore, but men on the other hand are probably the most label-driven consumers that exist in America."
This trend may go hand in hand with the fact that many men, particularly baby boomers, have been worrying more about their appearance and doing something about it, through plastic surgery, workouts at health clubs and special creams and scrubs that make them feel younger.
"I think the vanity factor is important here," said Therese Byrne, publisher of Retail Maxims, a newsletter in New York. "Men really have historically been the most vain. If you look at the 15th and 16th centuries, they dressed more frilly than women. Somewhere in the 19th century this got annihilated. Now, it is back, bigger than ever."
Men "have been disempowered at work somewhat, so how are they going to feel good about themselves?" Ms. Byrne said. "With clothes. And in the aging of America, men have gotten more ridiculous than women with the hair implants and the eyelifts. They think a woman can get a job over them if she looks younger or fitter or stronger at 40. So they're doing it all, too."
Frilly it isn't, but Tommy Hilfiger's clothing line is among the more striking successes in attracting the increasingly clothing-conscious man. Knit shirts in bright colors and jackets emblazoned with his own name in huge letters are wildly popular among urban and suburban teen-agers alike, as well as middle- and upper-middle-class men who like the sporty, versatile looks and the status of the label. Tommy Hilfiger sales rose from $107 million in 1992 to $478 million in 1996 -- a 347 percent increase.
It is sportswear that attracts men like Dennis Huffman. "I absolutely enjoy shopping for clothes," said Mr. Huffman, 35, operations manager of a small electronic components distribution company in Atlanta, where he does not have to dress up. "It makes me feel good in the same way women do when they buy clothes." While Mr. Huffman spent his 20's in T-shirts and jeans, the last few years he has stocked up on Calvin Klein jeans and Ralph Lauren shirts.
"Once I got out of school," Mr. Huffman said, "I shaved and started making a little money and started noticing big time that there was a difference between being well dressed and not well dressed."
Fueling the men's apparel business at the upper end of the market is a small sliver of mostly wealthy men who rebel against casual looks, loading up on six-button suits, bright imported ties and fussy Edwardian styles that distinguish their wearers from their khaki-clad colleagues at work.
For instance, at Ermenegildo Zegna, a maker and retailer of men's upscale clothing based in New York, the chief executive, Richard Cohen, said revenues that hovered around $400 million for a few years have grown in the last year to closer to $550 million, bolstered by the sales of $1,500 suits of cashmere and other luxury fabrics and $110 geometric-patterned ties.
To be sure, total women's spending on apparel in 1996 was $75.4 billion, Tactical Retail Solutions found, nearly twice the men's figure of $41.2 billion. But spending by women has slowed as they have increasingly diverted their dollars to things like their homes, travel, personal care and children, and as clothing prices have been restrained by lower demand and far too much supply.
By contrast, as men's desire for clothing, particularly brand-name goods, has risen, men's clothing prices have been creeping up. The average price of a man's polo-style shirt is about $17 in this country, Mr. Lagnado said, whereas five years ago it was closer to $12.50. But women's tailored dresses have fallen from an average of $80 to closer to $45 over the same period.
Casual, office-friendly clothing has clearly led the rise in men's spending. While sales of men's suits fell 11 percent between 1994 and 1996, for example, sales of sport coats grew 14 percent, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm in Port Washington, L.I. Sales of casual slacks grew 14 percent over that period, while sales of dress slacks dropped 4 percent.
And while dress shirts gained a respectable 12 percent in sales, knit sport shirts jumped 22 percent, according to NPD.
Retailers and manufacturers have with some success been offering men clothes that can make the transition from a casual workplace to a Saturday-evening dinner. Three years ago, for example, the Haggar Corporation rolled out a line called City Casuals that combines sport jackets with cotton twill pants and knit shirts; the company says the line has grown at about 15 percent a year.
Hartmarx, a maker of men's suits, recently introduced sportswear lines under the Hickey-Freeman and Hart Schaffner & Marx names. There are wool pants, gabardine patterned slacks, knit shirts and sport jackets. Colors are lighter and brighter and most of the clothes are meant to be mixed and matched, just as women have done for years with separates like jackets and skirts.
"The kind of retailers we would like to see buy these products are buying them," said Hartmarx's chief executive, Elbert O. Hand.
Bloomingdale's, part of Federated Department Stores, has tried to create private-label lines that match the sensibility and quality of the brand-name merchandise it sells. Its best-selling line emulates Ralph Lauren's preppy, highly classic sportswear.
"These lines are extremely strong," said Stuart Glasser, the executive vice president in charge of men's collections. "It is the strongest growth in the men's store."
Meanwhile, upscale retailers are already talking about a backlash against casual dress.
"Casual? I'm not a big fan of it," said David Damiba, 25, who works on Wall Street and says he spends about $5,000 a year on thick ties, brightly colored shirts and six-button suits. "I would rather wear a tie. I like coming in dressed up."
Men's styles tend to change more slowly than women's. But for the first time in the 10 years since Giorgio Armani dressed the working man in baggy suits, men's clothing has a silhouette that is slimmer, more tailored and accented with the types of comfortable fabrics women have favored for years.
"This is the most exciting time in men's wear since the late 60's and early 70's," said Stan Tucker, fashion director for Saks Fifth Avenue, a unit of Investcorp. He said the rise of English-looking tailored fashions was experiencing "double-digit growth."
Fashion, of course, is a highly cyclical business, and spending on it goes the same direction as the economy. So the boom could be short- lived. "Men have the need to fill their wardrobes up, so there is some pent-up demand," said Peter Simon, the director of apparel at the NPD Group. "But there is nothing to tell me that sales of men's clothes will continue its rapid pace untethered."

HEADLINE: Ukraine Staggers on Path to the Free Market

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine

 BODY:
Despite hundreds of millions of dollars of American aid, Ukraine is stumbling badly in its transition to a free-market economy, and diplomats and foreign executives blame rampant official corruption, which they say is remarkable even by standards of the region.
In recent weeks several major companies have abandoned Ukraine, following Government actions that diplomats and business people say favored companies in which Ukrainian officials hold personal stakes. 
 The situation has become so serious that some American officials say the $250 million in annual United States aid to the country should be cut off, or made conditional on showing definite progress on curbing the corruption.
"It's all rooted in one thing -- total, unequivocal corruption," David Sweere, an American businessman said of the obstacles facing foreign companies trying to operate here.
Mr. Sweere said the Government's confiscation last fall of all grain produced in the country cost him $5 million, because farmers who owed him grain were forced to turn over their harvest to Ukrainian authorities instead.
Mr. Sweere, who has been trying to break the Government's stranglehold over Ukraine's potentially lucrative agricultural sector, said he has received death threats.
In a confidential cable provided to The New York Times, the American Embassy termed one case involving the abrupt termination of a broadcast license held by an American company "a study of corruption."
It was, the embassy added, "illustrative of the serious difficulties" facing American businesses trying to operate in Ukraine, including such giants as Cargill, Monsanto and Coca-Cola.
[In Washington, the House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign appropriations is to hold hearings on Wednesday on American aid to central Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union. Clinton Administrations officials said they are expecting some pointed questions about Ukraine and reports about the corruption.]
"Serious difficulties," American officials and Western executives say, is diplomatese for corruption. In a series of cables to Washington over the last six months, the embassy described the business environment here as marked by bribes, threats and violence.
American and Ukrainian officials estimate that as much as $100 billion has been spirited out of the country by profiteering officials; if the money were brought back, the country's foreign reserves would nearly double, an American official said.
Ukraine, roughly the size of France in area and population, is now the third-largest beneficiary of American aid, after Israel and Egypt, receiving more than $1 billion since the country's independence in 1991. In that time, the country's standard of living has plummeted -- the average monthly income is about $80 -- while senior Ukrainian officials have become multimillionaires.
All this has prompted some American officials to suggest tight restrictions on aid as the only way to get the Government to get serious about reform. It is an idea, the officials concede, which would run into resistance in Congress, where there is a strong Ukrainian lobby.
When Leonid Kuchma was elected president in 1994, he spoke out strongly against corruption, and under pressure from the World Bank, instituted a number of reforms. For a while there was optimism among Western businesses and diplomats. But now, they say, the Government has regressed and the situation is worse than ever.
As an example, one businessman said he will need licenses from three agencies for a pesticide project, and each license, he said, would give another official the opportunity to demand a bribe. Among the reforms the World Bank had insisted upon was a reduction in the number of licenses.
While Mr. Kuchma himself is considered relatively clean, at least by the prevailing local ethic, some of his closest advisers are muscling in on legitimate businesses, diplomats and business people said.
Pavlo Lazarenko, Ukraine's Prime Minister, is among the many Ukrainian officials who, business people and diplomats say, have made millions through private business dealings while holding public office. Mr. Lazarenko declined a written request for an interview.
According to Western intelligence agencies, Mr. Lazarenko has an interest in United Energy Systems, which has a license to import natural gas and oil. In a country that uses more natural gas than Germany and France combined, this alone nets him an estimated $200 million a year, diplomats and businessmen said.
Business people and diplomats have also raised questions about a decree last August that required farmers to deliver their grain to the state, instead of selling it privately. The state paid the farmers around $85 a ton, at a time when the world market price was close to $200 a ton.
More than five million tons were delivered to the state, which in turn earned as much as $500 million in profits. Diplomats and executives said the proceeds were divided among various public officials.
This is a country that desperately needs foreign investment in order to modernize famously inefficient Communist-era industries, and to raise itself out of its economic cesspool.
But instead of coming in, companies are leaving.
Earlier this year, Tate & Lyle, one of the world's largest sugar producers, shut its refinery in Odessa, after the Government suddenly banned the importation of sugar cane, the only kind the factory could process. The British company had invested $5 million in modernizing the rundown plant, and 1,100 workers now are unemployed. A press spokesman declined to discuss the reasons for the company's departure from Ukraine.
The beneficiaries of the decree are domestic sugar beet growers, inefficient state-owned operations, in which Government officials have economic interests, according to diplomats and business people.
Potentially, one of the most lucrative enterprises in this country of 52 million people will be the sale of mobile phones. Recently, the Government awarded three licenses, one to a company called Kiev Star. Its owners include an adviser to Mr. Kuchma, a Cabinet minister and a Ukrainian with links to organized crime, said officials from two Western countries and a Western businessman close to the Government.
With that, Motorola, which had plans to invest $500 million to build the telecommunications system, announced that it was giving up on Ukraine. "Motorola cannot continue to invest in Ukraine when the Government is constantly changing the rules of the game," the company's spokesman said at the time.
Sometimes, the pressures against foreign investors are expressed overtly, as Joseph Lemire, an American businessman, discovered when he disputed the Government's ruling over a broadcast license for his radio station, Gala Radio.
One night soon after, Mr. Lemire said, he was driving home after dinner at Uncle Sam's, a trendy new watering hole here. A car forced him to pull over and three burly men with automatic weapons drawn demanded that he go with them.
Mr. Lemire refused, an act that most business people here would consider foolhardy.
The American Embassy later determined that the men who accosted Mr. Lemire were police officers, and the 40-year-old former banker turned entrepreneur has no doubt that their intent was to threaten him.
Mr. Lemire was fighting back after the Government had revoked Gala Radio's broadcast license -- just as the station was beginning to turn a profit. They gave it to a competing station in which Ukrainian Government officials have a financial interest, according to Western diplomats and Mr. Lemire.
A Ukrainian arbitration court then ruled that the National Council of Radio and Television Broadcasting, which regulates the airwaves, had acted illegally in taking away Mr. Lemire's license.
The council was not deterred.
"We reject the court's reasoning," the head of the council, Viktor Petrenko, said in an interview.
Mr. Lemire said bitterly, "There is no desire by the Ukrainian Government to ever have foreign investment."

HEADLINE: Canadian Chief Remains Quiet About Quebec

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: TORONTO, April 8

 BODY:
Even with a national election widely expected before summer, it is rare for Prime Minister Jean Chretien to say much these days about the most divisive issue in Canada: the separatist movement in Quebec.
Mr. Chretien freely talks about Canada's shrinking deficit and rebounding economy. But he has said little about how Canada would stay united if Quebec's leaders hold another separatist referendum, as planned, before the year 2000. 
 During his first official visit to Washington today, Mr. Chretien focused almost exclusively on efforts for smooth relations between the United States and Canada. It was President Clinton who, when asked about Quebec, reiterated his support for a united Canada.
After three decades of uncertainty over Quebec and a harrowingly close vote in an October 1995 referendum, many Canadians want to put the Quebec issue out of their minds. But the threat of a Canadian breakup is lately generating a lot more attention, and worry, outside of Canada.
In two recent international conferences -- one held at Wilton Park in England and the other at Tufts University near Boston -- Quebec's separatist movement was compared to more violent nationalist efforts like those in Northern Ireland, India, Sri Lanka and Burundi.
"Just by the virtue of having Canada placed in context with these countries says that despite the protestations of Quebec to the contrary, the threat of a unilateral declaration of independence does raise the possibility of conflict and violence," said Robert Lecker, a professor of English at McGill University in Montreal who took part in one of the conferences.
David Payne, a Quebec official who also attended one of the conferences, suggested, however, that the separatist movement in Quebec is included in such discussions because it shows how using democratic processes like the public referendum can help avoid violent conflict.
"Quebec is generally seen as a model of democratic access to sovereignty," Mr. Payne said. "In no way whatsoever was there an intimation of violence."
In their formal talks today, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Chretien discussed trade issues, disagreements over Cuba and international subjects like the expansion of NATO and peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and Haiti. On Monday, the two countries agreed to meet specific targets for reducing pollution in the Great Lakes.
In Canada, the lack of a pressing agenda for Mr. Chretien's Washington trip led to the widespread assumption that the visit was intended to provide a boost for the coming election, which the Prime Minister is expected to call for early June.
Mr. Chretien's Liberal Party is expected easily to maintain the commanding majority it has held in Parliament since the last election, in October 1993. In recent speeches he never fails to mention that Canada's federal budget deficit has been sharply reduced and that unemployment figures have recently dropped.
The issue of Quebec's threatened separation usually does not come up.
"This threat ought to be Chretien's central concern," wrote a Toronto Star columnist, Rosemary Speirs. "He can't continue to place the issue of Quebec separation on the back burner, as he has tried to do for the last three years, and he wants to do in this election."
Quebec was not on a back burner at a February conference on conflict prevention and violence at Wilton Park, an estate in West Sussex where the British Government has held top-level and confidential meetings since the end of World War II.
In a working group session to analyze the root causes of tensions and conflicts, Canada was studied, along with Burundi, Kenya, South Africa and Sri Lanka.
Professor Lecker of McGill gave an address about rising tensions among English-speaking Quebecers and the threat of secession by non-French-speaking parts of Quebec if the province tries to leave Canada.
"An African leader asked if we knew what the copycat syndrome is," Mr. Lecker said. "Then he remarked that that if Quebec can secede unilaterally, then Africa is lost."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Weak Sale of Inflation Notes Hurts Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities sagged yesterday under the weight of more data showing strength in the economy and disappointment over the latest auction of the Government's new inflation-indexed securities.
Traders said that because of the negative environment, in which investors assembled defensive positions, only the strength of the dollar prevented further losses. 
 The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, by which many lending rates are set, dropped 1 3/32, to a price of 94 6/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 7.10 percent, from 7.06 percent on Monday.
At the Treasury's sale of $8 billion of 10-year inflation-indexed notes, investors displayed less-than-expected demand, driving the price down. The notes yielded 3.65 percent, higher than the 3.62 percent traders expected and higher than the 3.449 percent in the Government's inaugural sale of the notes on Jan. 29. The auction was a reopening of the first issue in January, and was intended to build liquidity, or an active market for the new securities, which protect the value of an investment from inflation. The notes are sold in a so-called Dutch auction, or single-price format, much the way the two-year and five-year notes are sold. That means the notes are awarded at the highest yield needed to sell all the securities.
Bill Gamba, senior vice president and head of government bond trading at Cowen & Company, said, "Since bidding was not as aggressive and retail demand was less than what we saw in January, the Street had to underwrite a lot of this issue themselves."
The bid-to-cover ratio of 2.26 to 1 -- representing the level of demand for the notes -- was far short of the 5-to-1 ratio at the first sale. And the total of noncompetitive bids for the notes was only $36 million, compared with $157 million in January.
In addition to the weakness of the auction of inflation-indexed notes, a report showing that wholesale sales rose in February, another sign of strength in the economy, weighed on the Treasury market.
Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said the report "showed there is a considerable amount of steam left in this economy."
The report showed that sales rose 2.1 percent in February, more than the gain of three-tenths of a percent that analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News expected, and that wholesale inventories were unchanged.
"It's clear that inventories are quite lean," Mr. Chan said, "which indicates that unlike the case that has existed in prior late stages of an expansion, inventories are unlikely to help much in slowing the economy."
That means, he said, that investors in the Treasury market will have to rely on a slowdown in consumer spending or further interest-rate increases by the Fed to rein in the economy and prevent inflation, which erodes the value of bonds. One hint of whether a slowdown in consumer demand will occur will come on Friday when the Government releases its report on retail sales in March.
Traders said that the strength of the dollar, which helped bond prices rise on Monday, limited yesterday's losses. A rising dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like government securities more attractive to foreign investors because of the potential for profit gains in currency translation. Also, interest rates in the United States are attractive vis-a-vis those in some other countries, particularly Japan.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 10-year inflation indexed notes:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

High Price	98.307	High Yield	3.650%	Low Yield	3.450%	Median Yield	3.590%	Accepted at low price	50%	Total applied for	$18,061,641	Accepted	$8,002,618	Noncompetitive	$36,000	Interest set at	3 3/8	
 
The 10-year inflation notes mature on Jan. 15, 2007.

HEADLINE: For US Airways, A Softer Landing?;
Chief Seeks Harmony, for Now, As He Tries to Cut Labor Costs

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
It is the story of the airline industry these days. With carriers generating record profits, many union workers want raises, testing their leverage against executives who say big pay increases would make their airlines less competitive. Pilots and managers have squared off at American and United, and Continental's pilots said last week that they wanted a 38 percent raise.
In this atmosphere of confrontation, the approach of Stephen M. Wolf, chairman and chief executive of US Airways, is an ambitious departure. Mr. Wolf wants to lower costs sharply, but he wants to do it with labor's help. As he tries to turn around the airline, which has lost $2.4 billion in the last decade, he has vowed that there will be no power struggle. 
 "No one has any leverage," he said in November.
That, at least, is the appearance Mr. Wolf has managed to keep up since taking over US Airways a year ago. But in reality, this industry is driven by leverage, and Mr. Wolf is emerging as one of the more subtle practitioners of the art. If Mr. Wolf does not get his way, he is likely to use measured steps, such as the steady shrinking of the airline, to win an agreement with labor leaders without direct confrontation.
This week, Mr. Wolf kicks off a series of meetings with employees at which he will undoubtedly try to persuade them that more drastic measures are needed -- sooner rather than later -- to bring US Airways' high costs in line with those of rivals.
And in a letter to shareholders in the company's just-released annual report, Mr. Wolf wrote that the airline was approaching "a fork in the road."
Clearly, one path heads toward a cost-cutting deal. The second direction, though, would surely not be the status quo. Timothy Ross, an analyst at SBC Warburg, said that to get the attention of labor leaders Mr. Wolf might start cutting unprofitable routes.
That task will become less costly after June, with the expiration of a "no furlough" clause in the pilots' contracts that pays them whether the airline needs them or not. "He may give a glimpse of the iron fist that is inside the velvet glove," Mr. Ross said.
Such a strategy would represent a subtle but important distinction from Mr. Wolf's years as chief executive of United Airlines, where he threatened layoffs and asset sales, with deadlines often attached, if labor did not go along with his plans.
Indeed, if Mr. Wolf is successful in lowering costs by working with unions, not battling them, it will mark a rare victory in this industry. After all, this goal has eluded most executives, who have been seen either as too confrontational -- a frequent criticism of Robert L. Crandall, the chairman of the AMR Corporation, which owns American Airlines -- or too conciliatory, an oft-repeated description of Seth E. Schofield, Mr. Wolf's predecessor at USAir.
"It is hard to find the right formula," Philip Baggaley, an analyst at the Standard & Poor's Corporation, said.
Mr. Wolf's determination not to fight also hints at what motivated him, in January 1996, to take over US Airways, the nation's sixth-largest airline, a clear step down after running United, No. 1. Mr. Wolf appears to be trying to secure his place in the history books simply as a savvy builder of airlines, and not also as a long-time foe of labor.
Mr. Wolf has long shown a lack of interest in talking about himself, and has declined all requests for interviews since coming to US Airways. Yet what he says and does tend to be calibrated as precisely as a jet-engine blade. And thus far, his actions and words have led to remarkable progress: US Airways is more prosperous than ever, with record profits of $263.4 million last year.
Still, it is always easier to get concessions from labor in times of crisis, so the hard part for Mr. Wolf may just be starting.
Like most airlines, US Airways has benefited in recent years from a strong economy and a more disciplined approach to limiting its supply of seats. That gives airlines more control over pricing, and they have raised fares sharply, particularly for last-minute travel. US Airways also has a lock on many routes in the Northeast, where a large percentage of its passengers are business people who pay the highest fares.
Such profits make it difficult for workers to swallow the notion that cuts are urgently needed. All three major unions at the company are negotiating new contracts, and Mr. Wolf is saying to them, in effect: Work with me, and this airline will be bigger and better than ever.
If union leaders have any doubts, they are not sharing them publicly. Mr. Wolf has asked them not to negotiate in the media, and calls to officials representing flight attendants and mechanics were not returned. A spokesman for the pilots, Jim Gardner, said only, "From top to bottom, all of us at US Airways are committed to successfully and profitably meeting our competitive challenges."
Innocuous as that statement sounds, there appears to be some truth to it, at least for now. Though US Airways retains the cost structure that is the industry's highest, it is by many measures a better airline under Mr. Wolf.
For years, USAir, whose name Mr. Wolf changed earlier this year in hopes of giving it a more international flavor, lived up to its reputation as a second-rate airline. Its poor showings in on-time arrivals, customer complaints and lost baggage were often explained away as the result of flying in the congested and weather-beaten Northeast. Service was unpredictable, even on small things like drinks. On one flight, passengers would get an entire can of soda; on the next, they would get a glassful.
Now, key performance yardsticks are posted throughout US Airways' operations, and they have improved sharply. In on-time arrivals, the carrier jumped from eighth a year ago to first by January. It ranked fifth in both consumer complaints and lost baggage in January 1996; this January, it improved to second in complaints and third in lost bags. And the drink policy, among other things, has been standardized. Passengers are served a glass, but can have the whole can if they ask.
"Mr. Wolf has put a professionalism in our company that we've never really had," said Christopher O. Taylor, a flight attendant for the airline for 10 years. "Our airline is starting to look crisper."
Many ideas flowed out of task forces led by Rakesh Gangwal, US Airways' president and a former Wolf lieutenant at United. At every turn, the results of these cooperative efforts with rank-and-file employees are praised by the company -- employee newsletters are filled with such slogans as "Helping Out" and "Moving the Needle."
So far, Mr. Wolf has stuck to his strategy of managing with carrots, not sticks. He has produced a business plan that includes the enticing prospect to employees of more international flying. In the last year, US Airways has started service to Rome, Madrid and Munich.
He also placed an order in November for as many as 400 Airbus aircraft. He made the order contingent, however, on getting concessions that would lead to, as the company said in its recent 10-K filing, "a significant reduction" in labor costs.
Labor expenses at US Airways represented 43 percent of its total costs in the 12-month period ending in September, compared with 37 percent for all major United States carriers. One reason for the high costs is that from its earliest days, US Airways has been run much like a family business, with employees given certain benefits denied those at other airlines. Pilots, for example, have a great deal of flexibility in changing their schedules, which adds administrative costs.
Though all three union contracts are under negotiations, the mechanics and the flight attendants have told management it must first cut a deal with the pilots before they will consider concessions themselves.
For their part, leaders of the Air Line Pilots Association are showing few signs of softening to a proposed 12.5 percent pay cut. Robert Gaudioso, the union chairman who seemed to ally himself with Mr. Wolf at a meeting in November with analysts and reporters, was defeated in a recent election and replaced by Jon Bryan. Mr. Bryan, once a business professor who taught airline operations, will most likely have some suggestions for management on how to run the company more efficiently.
It is not that the unions are unwilling to make concessions. The sticking point has been what they want in return. In 1995, the company and labor leaders worked toward an accord in which the major unions would get stock, profit-sharing and board representation. But, the company says, the pilots made extra demands and the deal fell apart.
The latest talks have been complicated by Mr. Wolf's proposal to compete against Southwest Airlines , Delta Express and Valujet by setting up a separate division with lower costs, into which it would shift as much as 40 percent of its flights.
Mr. Wolf has said in employee newsletters that he considers the advance of low-cost rivals "truly distressing."
"If we don't have a competitive response in place very soon," he added, "it will be a serious issue."
Some analysts say that Mr. Wolf may reach a modest deal with labor, declare victory, then go ahead with the aircraft order. But at the analysts' meeting in November, Mr. Wolf and Mr. Gangwal repeated that they would strike just one long-term deal rather than going back to employees for more concessions later.
Thus far, Mr. Wolf has shown that he means what he says. With no labor agreements on the horizon, Airbus said in January that it would no longer guarantee delivery of 57 planes in 1998 and 1999.
The next step for Mr. Wolf could be grounding one or two plane types, slicing costs by simplifying US Airways' hodgepodge fleet. To employees, such a move might test the definition of "not fighting," but Mr. Wolf would no doubt take the position that he had no choice.
He does have a choice about whether he even needs to be at US Airways. By all accounts, he earned tens of millions of dollars at United, which is owned by the UAL Corporation. And last year, according to US Airways' proxy, his compensation package totaled $5.8 million, including restricted stock that is to vest over a period of four years.
But for now, Mr. Wolf appears to be seeking a less tangible payoff than a paycheck. Though he can claim credit for helping reinvent United as an employee-owned company in July 1994, he was thanked by being immediately replaced with an executive chosen by labor leaders, Gerald Greenwald.
If Mr. Wolf hopes to be perceived as a pioneer in working with unions, it will take an unqualified success at US Airways that includes the support of labor, said Joseph R. Blasi, a professor of management-labor relations at Rutgers University.
"He's afraid that people think he achieved cooperation with labor at United by default," Mr. Blasi said. "If he does it a second time, he will prove his real genius."

HEADLINE: A Fed Official's Romance Raises Issue of Conflict

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
What happens when a top Federal Reserve official who helps set the nation's interest rates becomes romantically involved with a leading investment banker?
For E. Gerald Corrigan, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company who is a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Cathy E. Minehan, the current president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, that question has taken on new urgency after another former Fed official cast doubts on the propriety of their relationship. 
 Mr. Corrigan, in an interview yesterday, said that he and Ms. Minehan were painfully aware of the potential pitfills and had gone to extraordinary lengths to avoid them. Starting in the fall of 1995, Mr. Corrigan said, he and Ms. Minehan worked out arrangements designed to insure that their relationship did not present either of them with a conflict of interest.
The romantic relationship between Mr. Corrigan and Mrs. Minehan began a little less than two years ago, Mr. Corrigan said. While it was not a secret, this week John P. LaWare, a former Fed governor, was quoted in The Boston Globe questioning whether the relationship might not be in the best interest of the Federal Reserve.
Yesterday, in a telephone interview, Mr. LaWare, who retired from the Fed in May 1995, explained his thinking: "I have the highest regard for their integrity, but the very fact of their relationship runs the risk of creating impressions that there may be conflicts of interest."
Mr. Corrigan, 55, joined Goldman, Sachs in January 1994, six months after resigning from the New York Fed, whose president holds a permanent voting seat on the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee.
(The Open Market Committee consists of the seven Washington-based Fed Governors and the 12 Fed regional presidents. All members attend the meetings, which are held roughly every six weeks, but only five of the 12 regional presidents are entitled to vote at any one time.)
As one of the nation's leading bond traders, Goldman, Sachs frequently invests its own capital in Government securities, effectively making bets on the Fed's monetary policy and the direction of interest rates. Mr. Corrigan was named a partner at Goldman, Sachs late last year.
As president of the Boston Fed, Ms. Minehan, 50, sits on the Open Market Committee. Before being named to the post in July 1994, she was the Boston Fed's first vice president and chief operating officer.
Mr. Corrigan, asked about the issue, replied that he and Ms. Minehan had discussed their situation with J. Virgil Mattingly, the Fed's general counsel, and lawyers at Goldman, Sachs, as soon as their relationship started to become serious.
"I can't speak to John LaWare's statement, but we really have gone to great length with the attorneys to cover every base," he said. "On many occasions I have said to Mr. Mattingly: 'Is there anything else that you want to know?' "
Fed officials said yesterday that they could recall no other instance where a voting member of the Open Market Committee had encountered similar potential conflicts of interest because of a personal relationship. But, in an age of many two-career couples, there have been some other sensitive issues involving senior Fed officials.
For instance, David W. Mullins Jr., the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and Mary Ann Gadziala, his then-fiancee and now wife, drew attention in 1994. Ms. Gadziala, a lawyer at the Securities and Exchange Commission, told Business Week that year that she had ignored approaches from law firms and banks about prospective jobs because she was concerned that they might create an appearance of impropriety. In another case, when Sam Cross worked as a senior official at the New York Fed and his wife was a lawyer at Citibank, they both signed letters agreeing not to discuss Fed matters, Fed officials said.
Reading from a statement, Mr. Corrigan said: "We have been repeatedly assured that steps we have taken to avoid conflicts of interest have been appropriate and satisfactory. As necessary, we will remain in consultation with the lawyers in the future."
Under the arrangement, Mr. Corrigan said, Ms. Minehan avoids anysupervisory or regulatory oversight involving Goldman, Sachs. Moreover, Mr. Corrigan and Ms. Minehan "do not discuss issues involving monetary policy," he added, and he does not "directly or indirectly participate in any decisions at Goldman bearing on investments in Government securities."
Mr. Corrigan said that his work at Goldman basically fell into two broad categories: external work with Government clients helping advise them on bank reform and other matters related to financial regulation, and internal work for Goldman's risk management committee related to legal compliance and financial controls.
"Goldman, Sachs is satisfied that appropriate steps have been taken by all parties to guard against any potential conflicts of interest," Robert J. Katz, the firm's general counsel, said. "We explained to the Fed's lawyers what Mr. Corrigan does at Goldman and particularly that he has nothing to do with our trading."
Fed officials in Boston, New York and Washington yesterday referred questions on the matter to Mr. Mattingly, the general counsel. "Obviously it raised some issues because of his position and her position," Mr. Mattingly said. For one thing, Mr. Mattingly said, Ms. Minehan "must accept no gifts from Goldman, Sachs." The Fed also set rules concerning Ms. Minehan's public appearances with Mr. Corrigan. "She is not to appear at all in any kind of situation, client situation, where he is trying to solicit clients," he said.
Mr. Mattingly added that he saw nothing wrong with Ms. Minehan's attendance at a recent conference sponsored by Goldman, Sachs. There were many senior Fed officials at the conference, which dealt with issues important to the Fed. "These two people have met every request that the Boston general counsel and I made," Mr. Mattingly said.

HEADLINE: Bias Charge Rejected on Display of Breasts

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN 

 BODY:
To Adele Buzzetti, the proprietor of the Cozy Cabin, a 20-year-old topless bar in Queens, and her part-time employee, a dancer and a poet who calls herself Vanessa Doe, the city's law restricting sexually oriented businesses discriminates against female dancers. The regulation, which enumerates certain body parts that may not be exposed or touched, forbids the baring of the female breast. It is silent, however, on the question of the male breast.
Are not male breasts also alluring? asked Ms. Buzzetti and Ms. Doe, who brought a sex-bias challenge to the law in Federal court, saying that the law prohibits women from dancing topless, but not men. 
 On their behalf, Lenore Tiefer, a psychologist who specializes in human sexuality, argued that male chests have been increasingly eroticized in recent years. She mentioned a current Diet Coke ad showing women ogling a man, a Ray-Ban sunglasses ad featuring the Olympic runner Michael Johnson in all his pectoral splendor, and the emergence of Calvin Klein underwear models who now rule billboards where the buttoned-up Marlboro Man used to roam.
But yesterday, a Federal judge in Manhattan upheld the constitutionality of the law. The reason, he said, is that in their impact on society, male and female breasts are separate and not equal.
"One does not have to be either a psychologist or a sociologist to recognize that, if it were widely known that 10 topless women were walking down Park Avenue and 10 topless men were walking down Madison Avenue, the effect on the traffic on Park Avenue would be substantially greater than on Madison Avenue," wrote the Federal District Court judge, John S. Martin Jr.
And the effect on local traffic is exactly what the regulation is about, said the judge, a former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. He rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the 1995 zoning ordinance also restricted their First Amendment right to free expression. Citing two Supreme Court decisions on the zoning of sex entertainment businesses, he said the purpose of the city's carefully drawn law was not to curb the dancers' performance but to protect neighborhoods from the impact of the clubs, like crime, reduced property values, and an apparent decline in the community's character.
He also said that despite the explicit ban on female breasts, the regulation did not necessarily permit clubs like Chippendales, which feature male topless dancers, to do business in protected neighborhoods, pointing out that it bans "human male genitals in a discernibly turgid state, even if completely and opaquely concealed." In this regard, he said, the regulation did not reveal an anti-male bias.
"These provisions simply recognize that there are anatomical differences between males and females which in our society elicit different reactions," he wrote.
Ms. Buzzetti declined to comment on the decision, said Stephanie Alter, a lawyer in the firm bringing the case, who deplored the ruling. "The effect is economic," she said. "They've just eliminated a group of jobs for women."
Judge Martin's ruling has no immediate impact on the regulation, which has also been challenged in state courts. Its enforcement is temporarily suspended, until an appellate court issues its ruling.

HEADLINE: Rise in Merit-Based Aid to Students Alters the Landscape of the College Market

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
If you aced the college boards, do we have a bargain for you! That's the not-so-subtle message sent this month to tens of thousands of high-achieving high school seniors, who have been offered hefty college scholarships in spite of the ability of their families to pay full tuition.
And increasingly it is second-tier private colleges that are making the offers, a new study shows. Their liberal use of merit-based aid is slowing the trend toward the ever-greater concentration of talent in more elite institutions. 
 But there is a darker side to this triumph of market forces.
"The big worry is that schools will divert funds that would otherwise go to needy students," said William Bowen, head of the Mellon Foundation and former president of Princeton University.
Squeezed by parents looking for more bang from a tuition buck, educators in recent years have discovered the realities of the competitive market -- a market in which merit scholarships (economists refer to them as discounts) are a key to keeping good students and attracting better ones.
A survey of 379 colleges and universities, to be published in the fall ("The Student Aid Game," Princeton University Press), shows that merit-based aid grew at a 13 percent annual rate during the 1980's, even after adjusting for inflation. And there is reason to believe that the pace has accelerated since.
"Nobody pays retail anymore," said Thomas Williams of Group USA/Nowel-Levitz in Iowa City, management consultants specializing in colleges.
That is welcome news for parents with comfortable incomes who nonetheless shudder at the prospect of paying more than $20,000 a year in tuition.
At the top of the college pecking order stand a few dozen institutions able to skim the cream from the applicant pool and then offer whatever discounts are needed to make tuition affordable to everyone they admit. In 1991 the antitrust division of the Justice Department did force eight Ivy League colleges to abandon their formal agreement to limit aid to those in need, a limit that had applied even when the colleges were competing for budding Einsteins and Updikes. But little has changed: almost all the aid granted by top colleges remains need-based.
"The high moral ground is held most easily when it is buttressed by money and prestige," said Gordon Winston, an economist at Williams College.
In contrast, most private colleges are feeling the pressure to use discounts to attract the best and the brightest. In some cases, discounting is purely defensive.
"We don't try to hit home runs with merit aid," said Michael McPherson, president of Macalester College in St. Paul and a co-author of "The Student Aid Game." Instead, Mr. McPherson said, the goal is to keep his high-cost institution ($24,188 in tuition and fees next year) competitive with the array of good public universities in the region.
Denison University in Ohio is following a similar route, offering discounts of $3,000 to $5,000 (from a full price of $25,620 in 1997-98) to all applicants who graduate in the top half of their high school classes. Enrollment has risen sharply since the policy was adopted in 1994, increasing total tuition revenue by a fourth in spite of the cut in average revenue per student.
In other cases, though, discounting is part of an ambitious strategy to create a virtuous circle, providing irresistible bargains to high achievers in the expectation that they will, in turn, attract better students and faculty. Among the most aggressive in this category: George Washington University and Emory University.
Using merit scholarships to break into a more selective crowd requires deep pockets. "It takes a huge inducement" to attract the best students, said Paul Krugman, an M.I.T. economist, as well as many years to change the academic reputation of a university. "That's why the persistence of college rankings is so high."
But the strategy does occasionally succeed. In the early 1980's, Trinity University in San Antonio bid for a place in the academic limelight by offering free tuition to all National Merit scholars. It no longer does, said Estelle Frerichs, the university's director of financial aid, at least in part because it no longer needs to: in 1993 some 35 percent of the freshman class had scored above 600 in the College Board verbal test, and 65 percent had scored above 600 in the math test. Ms. Frerichs cautions, however, that while a college can attract good students with merit scholarships, "you can't keep them" unless you meet their expectations.
The growth of merit discounting is obviously manna for students from families that would not qualify for need-based aid. And because merit discounts are usually contingent on continuing academic excellence, the practice creates incentives for students to spend more time studying and less time drinking beer.
Morton Schapiro, a dean at the University of Southern California and co-author with Mr. McPherson of "The Student Aid Game," argues that aggressive merit discounting also serves a broader public interest, by spreading the talent beyond the elite institutions. While he acknowledges that there is virtually no research on whether high-achieving college students can motivate low achievers, Mr. Schapiro notes that a host of studies have found that egalitarian placement does raise average performance in primary and secondary schools.
One question casting a pall over what would otherwise be a celebration of freer markets in higher education is whether merit discounts will reduce the aid available for the neediest students. The most comprehensive evidence comes from survey data in "The Student Aid Game."
While need-based aid as a portion of all institutional aid did fall by one-eighth from 1983 to 1991, the total size of the aid pie grew fast enough to keep needy students ahead of the trend. Indeed, the 10 percent real annual growth of need-based aid far outpaced tuition.
What is more, the survey showed that virtually none of the new merit aid was handed out by private colleges and universities that ranked among the top fifth for academic selectivity. Thus, while the "rich" may have got richer through merit aid, they managed to do so only by scaling back their ambitions to attend an elite college. More important, the poor apparently did not suffer in the process.
The final verdict on merit aid is not in, however. Thomas Kane, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, noted that revenue lost in competing for students might be inducing colleges to increase class sizes, skimp on laboratory equipment or eliminate less popular departments.
It is also possible that without the pressure to provide merit aid, colleges would have narrowed the gap left by the Federal Government's declining commitment to need-based financial aid.
"We have no way of comparing what is with what might have been," Mr. Schapiro allowed.
Donald Kennedy, former president of Stanford University, is deeply pessimistic that need-based aid will remain sacrosanct, as all but a handful of colleges are drawn into the very serious game of tuition discounting.
"While more dollars will flow to students," Mr. Kennedy predicted, "some very needy ones will be deprived."

HEADLINE: Federal Appeals Court Upholds California's Ban on Preferences

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 8

 BODY:
A Federal appeals court here upheld the constitutionality of California's Proposition 209 today, ruling that the voters were well within their rights to ban the use of racial and sex-based preferences in affirmative-action programs run by the state.
The unanimous decision by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned an injunction issued by a Federal District Court judge to block the implementation of the ballot measure shortly after its approval in November. 
 "A system which permits one judge to block with the stroke of a pen what 4,736,180 state residents voted to enact as law tests the integrity of our constitutional democracy," one of the judges, Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain, wrote in the higher court's opinion today.
The strongly worded ruling went considerably further than either side had expected. And though it may prove to be only one turn in a long and complex legal battle over affirmative action, supporters of the initiative said they expected the decision to have an immediate effect on the widening national campaign to end decades of race and sex preferences in government hiring, contracting and education.
"I think that we have a long way to go, but the decision of the Ninth Circuit is a crucial one," said Ward Connerly, the Sacramento businessman who led the political campaign for the ballot measure. "It's a nail, it's a spike, it's a dagger in the coffin of preferences. I and those who fought so hard on behalf of 209 are ecstatic about it."
The ruling could allow Proposition 209 to take effect in 21 days. But representatives of the civil rights groups that have opposed the law said they would soon file an appeal before all 19 sitting judges of the Ninth Circuit. If they lose there, opponents of the initiative said, they will take the case to the United States Supreme Court.
President Clinton, who had ordered the Justice Department to join the court fight against the initiative, seemed to concede today that an important battle had been lost. At a White House news conference, he said supporters of affirmative action would have to "regroup and find new ways to achieve the same objective."
"I believe if states are precluded from trying to take appropriate steps that are not quotas and that do not give unqualified people a chance to participate in whatever it is -- economic or educational life -- but do recognize the disadvantages people have experienced, I think that will be a mistake," Mr. Clinton said.
The Ninth Circuit's support for Proposition 209 did not come as a great surprise because of its generally conservative leanings.
Judge O'Scannlain and one of his colleagues, Edward Leavy, were both appointed to the bench by President Ronald Reagan. The third judge in the case, Andrew J. Kleinfeld, is a Bush appointee who is viewed by some legal experts as one of the most conservative members of the Federal judiciary.
By contrast, the judge who issued the preliminary injunction, Thelton E. Henderson, is a Carter appointee who once served on the board of the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California. Judge Henderson was considered sufficiently liberal by supporters of the initiative that they focused much of their legal energy on trying to have him removed from the case.
Lawyers on both sides had accused their adversaries of "shopping" for sympathetic judges. But proponents of the ballot measure could scarcely believe their luck when their request for an emergency order suspending the injunction came before a randomly assigned three-judge panel that appeared to be considerably to the right of the Ninth Circuit's ideological center.
The California Civil Rights Initiative, as the affirmative-action measure is formally called, sought to bar the state government from bringing racial or sex considerations to bear in the decisions it makes in giving out jobs, letting contracts or granting admission to state universities. The measure was approved on Election Day with 54 percent of the vote.
In granting a temporary restraining order on Nov. 27 to opponents of the initiative, Judge Henderson argued that there was a "strong probability" that it might be unconstitutional. In issuing the preliminary injunction on Dec. 23, he said it would violate the equal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it would eliminate only those programs that benefit women and minorities. By contrast, the advantages sometimes given to, say, Army veterans who apply for state benefits would be preserved.
The Ninth Circuit rejected that argument out of hand, saying that the initiative addressed matters of race and sex "in a neutral fashion."
"As a matter of 'conventional' equal protection analysis, there is simply no doubt that Proposition 209 is constitutional," Judge O'Scannlain wrote.
The appeals panel had originally been expected to rule on the motion for emergency relief and then send the appeal to a separate group of randomly selected judges for fuller review. Instead, the motions panel kept the case itself.
Its decision today went well beyond the narrow question of whether Judge Henderson had acted properly in granting the injunction, and it seemed to rule out the possibility that even if the injunction was lifted, the case would be sent back to the District Court for a trial on the ballot measure's merits.
"The only issue before the Ninth Circuit seemed to be whether the preliminary injunction was wrongly granted," said Erwin Chemerinsky, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Southern California. "But the court went ahead and decided on the constitutionality of Proposition 209.
"The Ninth Circuit has said here that the facts alleged by the plaintiffs, even if true, don't add up to a constitutional violation," he added. "If you follow this, there is no point to a trial."
Robert C. Post, a constitutional law expert at Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California, noted that although the case might yet return to the District Court, Judge Henderson would have to rule in a manner consistent with an appeals decision that dismissed most of the precedents he had cited in the case.
"They are saying that Prop. 209 is not a burden to equal treatment," Professor Post said. "They are saying that it is equal treatment."
The lead attorney for the civil rights groups opposed to the law, Mark Rosenbaum, said the appeals court decision flew in the face of "decades of mainstream Supreme Court law."
"It doesn't just force women and minorities to the back of the bus," he said. "It boots them off altogether."

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN ZAIRE;
As Rebels Gain in Zaire, Mobutu Declares Emergency and Imposes Military Rule

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire, April 8

 BODY:
Moving to preserve the power that is rapidly slipping away from him, President Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's longtime dictator, declared a state of emergency throughout the country today, replacing civilian officials with military administrators.
Mr. Mobutu's move, which in fact will give him nominal control over only five of Zaire's eight provinces, came as civilian opposition to his authority continued to grow in the capital and an armed rebellion appeared poised to make new gains in the countryside. 
 The leader of the rebellion, Laurent Kabila, addressing a jubilant crowd today in Mbuji-Mayi, the diamond mining capital of central Zaire, stepped up his threat to Mr. Mobutu's rule by ruling out any power-sharing agreement with the Government and promising to train his guns quickly on Kinshasa, the national capital.
In testimony today before the House of Representatives, the Clinton Administration's Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, George Moose, said of recent events in Zaire, "It is clear that Mobutu, the Mobutu regime, is a thing of the past."
At Mbuji-Mayi, the site of the rebels' latest major victory, Mr. Kabila told a crowd of tens of thousands that his fighters were already as close as 150 miles to the capital. He ruled out any future role for Mr. Mobutu.
But as much as Mr. Mobutu's declaration of a state of emergency was a response to Mr. Kabila's stunning battlefield advances of recent weeks, it was equally a reply to sharp new pressures on the 66-year-old leader brought by a newly appointed Prime Minister who has challenged the President's once unquestioned authority here.
Since Mr. Mobutu reluctantly appointed him Prime Minister last week, Etienne Tshisekedi, a popular, longtime opponent of the President, has moved to dissolve a Parliament packed with supporters of Mr. Mobutu and selected a Government that includes no allies of the President.
Mr. Tshisekedi's boisterous supporters have enjoyed the run of the streets in Kinshasa since Monday, frustrating security forces who have sought to intimidate them and preventing members of Parliament from meeting to remove the new Prime Minister even before he could assume his official functions.
Mr. Tshisekedi's aides have called for a huge demonstration of force on Wednesday to march the Prime Minister to his new offices, and Mr. Mobutu, who still retains the allegiance of several key army units here, seems to have decided to intervene to stop his longtime foe from taking effective power.
"We have to save the furniture," said one close assistant to the President. "He is taking his responsibility before history. Kabila said he is about to take Kinshasa, and Tshisekedi is racing him to the finish line. The risk is a conflagration that will serve as the pretext for an invasion."
Hundreds of Western troops, including American, French and Belgian soldiers, have been positioned just across the Congo River in the Congolese capital, Brazzaville, in preparation for the evacuation of Westerners living here. Since the deployment of those forces began, all sides in the Zairian conflict have expressed fears that foreign political intervention was being prepared.
The terms of the newly decreed state of emergency, which was flashed on television screens this evening without comment, were not announced. But an aide to Mr. Mobutu said they would include a curfew and a strict ban on political activity.
A senior aide to Mr. Tshisekedi said tonight that the Prime Minister's march to claim his office would go ahead as planned, setting the stage for renewed conflict in the streets of the capital.
For the second day, Kinshasa was the scene of rowdy street protests by supporters of Mr. Tshisekedi. They attacked the homes and vehicles of members of Parliament who have begun efforts to unseat Mr. Tshisekedi.
At least one member of Parliament was beaten by a street mob, and a former minister of Mr. Mobutu's was dragged from his car, robbed and beaten near Parliament after he was mistaken for a legislator.
Mr. Tshisekedi was appointed to the office of Prime Minister last week for the third time, in an effort by both supporters and enemies of Mr. Mobutu in the capital to blunt the rebel advance by handing the Government to a popular politician.
Mr. Mobutu's effort to save his 31-year-old rule also came as Mr. Kabila, the rebel leader, is feeling more confidant than ever after seizing the home of Zaire's lucrative diamond industry last weekend and encircling the capital of the country's southern copper belt, Lubumbashi, on Monday. Mr. Kabila vowed to speed up his bid for power.
"Our next objective is the capital, Kinshasa," Mr. Kabila told the rally in Mbuji-Mayi, 600 miles east of here. "All of the evil in this country is decided in Kinshasa."
With an estimated $20 million in official monthly receipts for diamonds and far more money believed to be made through the black market trade, Mbuji-Mayi is Zaire's richest source of hard currency and represents a huge economic boost for the rebellion.
As Mr. Kabila's forces closed in on Lubumbashi, nearly 1,000 miles to the southeast, units of Mr. Mobutu's Presidential Guard were reported to be offering sporadic resistance.
While officers of the Presidential Guard said they had prevailed in several skirmishes with the rebels, Western diplomats here gave them little chance of holding out. And in an unusual announcement, the state radio in Kinshasa seemed to agree today, calling the fall of Lubumbashi "a matter of hours."
Throughout Zaire's six-month civil war, Government troops have typically fled at the approach of Mr. Kabila's forces, pillaging each city as they flee.
Perhaps to insure a measure of dignity in peace talks that adjourned indefinitely today in South Africa, the Government recently sent loyalist units of the Presidential Guard, a heavily armed and relatively well-trained force that is drawn almost exclusively from Mr. Mobutu's northern Ngbandi tribe, to mount a symbolic defense of Lubumbashi.
"They will put up a show, perhaps, but the city is basically undefendable at this point," a regional military expert said.
Coming fast on the heels of Kisangani and Mbuji-Mayi, Lubumbashi's fall would leave Kinshasa as the only major city in Government control. Mr. Kabila now asserts that his forces have advanced deep into two of the four remaining provinces that have escaped their control, including Mr. Mobutu's fief of Equatoria.
For many analysts here, the most imposing potential showdown looming in Zaire is one between Mr. Tshisekedi and Mr. Kabila, who has pointedly refused offers from the new Prime Minister of a number of important ministerial posts.
Mr. Tshisekedi is a native of East Kasai Province, the site of Mbuji-Mayi. And Mr. Kabila's speech and reception there today were being closely watched throughout Zaire for signs of how the contest for power between the two men would play out.
Witnesses to events in Mbuji-Mayi said Mr. Kabila had been received as warmly there as he had been in other major cities recently captured by his forces. But in his speech today, the rebel leader was careful not to make blunt criticisms of Mr. Tshisekedi in one of the Prime Minister's strongholds.
"Tshisekedi's place should not be with Mobutu, but against Mobutu," Mr. Kabila was reported by the BBC as saying. "We are all in the same trench against a common enemy."

HEADLINE: Gino P. Santi, 81, Developer Of Pilot Ejection System, Dies

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Gino P. Santi, a Brooklyn-born Air Force engineer who developed the modern pilot ejection system, died on Thursday at a hospice near his home in Dayton, Ohio. He was 81 and had spent most of his career at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base there.
His wife, Dorothy, said the cause was bone cancer. 
 Almost from the moment man first began to fly planes, people started wondering how to get back down to earth in one piece when things went seriously wrong with the machines.
Parachutes were an obvious solution, and easy enough to use when a pilot could step out on the wing of an open cockpit and leap free of a slow-moving craft. But as planes got faster and closed cockpits became the norm, a combat pilot would often not have enough time to remove the canopy, hoist himself out of his seat and jump before crashing.
And even when he did have time, if the powerful centrifugal forces created as the plane spun out of control did not pin him to his seat, he was likely to be killed or seriously injured when the tail section of his own plane slammed into him or fouled his parachute lines. Those fates that befell more than half those who bailed out of planes in World War II.
Although a prototype system to hurl a pilot free of the cockpit was developed as early as 1910, it was not until the 1930's that work began in earnest on ejection systems.
In part perhaps because Mr. Santi was still in college, studying for bachelor's and master's degrees in civil engineering at City College, some of the early technology seemed almost quixotic: a behind-the-seat pusher, for example, that pilots dubbed the meat grinder because it tended to push them through the propellers.
Then there was the Howard Hughes solution. His mammoth wooden Spruce Goose was equipped with a device to fling a pilot down through a hatch, hardly the direction of choice for a low-flying combat pilot in distress.
The Germans developed an explosive catapult system in World War II, but the explosion often killed pilots or broke their backs. Almost as soon as he went to work on the problem for the Air Force in 1947, Mr. Santi, who had become familiar with aviation engineering during four years with the forerunner of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, came up with his first breakthrough, the use of a controlled explosion that gave the pilot less of a jolt even as it hurled him higher than the German version had.
Mr. Santi's work at Wright was carried on in secrecy lest word of his approach leak out to the enemy: the Navy, which was also working on ejection systems. Millions of future development dollars were at stake, and when the Air Force won the race when the Santi system was perfected in 1949, the Navy somewhat churlishly adopted a British system.
Over the next decades, Mr. Santi, who served two stints of active duty but spent most of his career as a civilian employee of the Air Force, continued to improve the ejection system for use on increasingly fast jet planes, often by overcoming confirmed skeptics with solutions that left them scratching their heads in wonder.
Among other things, he developed the use of the rocket to propel ejection seats and insisted on a design that would eject a pilot safely from the ground, an audacious goal he achieved in part by having the parachute unfurl as the pilot was hurtling upward.
His later designs included automated electrical systems, in which the operations of the complex ejection system vary with air speed and altitude.
One of Mr. Santi's most startling achievements was the development of an instant ejection system in which the pilot is catapulted safely through the canopy, a development so advanced that it was even adopted by the Navy, whose carrier pilots often do not have time to wait for the canopy to be blown away.
Although his last project, a 1978 modification, is still the Air Force standard, Mr. Santi did not always see the full potential of his inventions, like the rapid-inflation air bag he developed in the 1950's to separate a pilot from his seat, long before it became an automotive safety staple.
For all his work on futuristic systems, at home Mr. Santi was a meticulous handyman who kept his sights firmly on the past. His wife, for example, is still using what may well be the nation's oldest operational washer-dryer, but, as she noted yesterday, she no longer drives the 1963 Pontiac station wagon Mr. Santi kept running for close to 25 years.
"I wrecked it," she said.
In addition to his wife he is survived by a son, Victor, of Dayton; four daughters, Janice Shandera of Lincolnville, Me., Martha Heil of Fairfield, Ohio, Linda Roth of Cincinnati and Laura Santi of Columbia, Md.; a sister, Ismene Lindsey of New Milford, N.J., and 11 grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Paying for One Big Party

 BODY:
Politicians make it a business to be sensitive to the most minor wobbles of public opinion. Yet in recent weeks, the leaders of Washington's all-inclusive Incumbent Party have been assuring each other that Americans do not really care about campaign-finance reform. The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll this week exposes their lie. It offered a startling portrayal of a nation that, far from being indifferent, yearns for abolition of a system clearly viewed as corrupt. By ignoring such warnings, Congress deepens the public's already considerable disgust and cynicism.
It is hardly surprising that the respondents in the Times surveys do not see President Clinton or Congress as advocates of reform. Though the economic boom still boosts Mr. Clinton's approval rating, he and his inner circle have no credibility as campaign reformers, and for good reason. Vice President Al Gore, who distanced himself from Whitewater, has seen his ratings plummet following exposure of his own active role in fund-raising. The new chief of staff, Erskine Bowles, who was expected to turn the page on the Arkansas shenanigans, has now been called to testify by the grand jury looking into the possible payment of hush money to Webster Hubbell, the former Associate Attorney General. The House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, remains low in the estimation of voters because of his own financial irregularities. 
 Of the major figures in Washington, only Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, remains personally unmarred by the recent fund-raising scandal. It is thus increasingly difficult to understand why he would want to huddle with Mitch McConnell of Kentucky under the umbrella of special-interest politics. At the very least, he should be leading the charge for broad and open-ended investigations of campaign fund-raising irregularities by the Congressional committees. Given the problems of the White House and the Speaker, unentangled players like Mr. Lott -- or Democrats like Richard Gephardt, Bob Kerrey and John Kerry -- have a real opportunity to serve the country and their own ambitions.
This page has long argued that what some analysts interpret as voter indifference is actually voter cynicism. That is a sentiment that politicians ignore at their peril, for it will inevitably lead to challenges from reformers within or reckless mavericks like Ross Perot from the outside. Mr. Lott would serve the G.O.P. by dropping his support of Senator McConnell's efforts to undermine the reform legislation sponsored by Senators John McCain of Arizona and Russell Feingold of Wisconsin.
Mr. McConnell says he does not want to abridge the freedom of businesses and wealthy individuals to give to the candidates of their choice. That defense of legalized bribery was undercut by a separate poll that came out last week in Business Week, surveying 400 top business executives. About 70 percent of them said they had contributed money in the 1996 political campaign, and 68 percent said they wanted to end the unlimited corporate and individual contributions to political parties known as "soft money." It thus turns out that the very people who are shaken down for the money that corrupts Washington would prefer an honest Congress. In other words, the only thing preventing representative government from producing a new age of reform is the representatives. Don't they read polls inside the Beltway anymore?

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT OFFERS $18 BILLION MORE IN MEDICARE CUTS

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration offered today to make additional cuts of $18 billion in projected Medicare spending over the next five years to help reach agreement on eliminating the Federal deficit, people involved in the budget negotiations said today.
In saying that it was willing to compromise further on Medicare, the issue that has most divided the Administration and Congressional Republicans through two years of budget wars, the White House was clearly seeking to appear flexible as the two sides began their first serious negotiations since their impasse in late 1995 led to a Government shutdown. 
 The Administration had previously proposed a plan that it said would cut the growth of Government health care spending for the elderly by $100 billion over five years, while the most recent Republican offer was $158 billion over six years.
"There is a serious intent here to show that we want to get this process off to the right start," said a senior Administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
Republicans said that they welcomed the Administration proposal but that they wanted to study it further. They said they had offered their own proposals, which they did not specify, for narrowing the gap between the White House and Republican plans for slowing the growth in Medicare spending and averting a long-term financial crisis in the program.
Today's meeting on Capitol Hill, attended by the leaders of the Congressional budget committees and members of the White House economic team, was the first of several scheduled over the next week.
President Clinton has proposed meeting directly with the Republican leadership at the White House next week in an effort to give the process further impetus.
Expressions of optimism by both sides early this year have given way in the last month to predictions that the effort to eliminate the deficit by 2002 was on the verge of collapse. But with both parties eager to strike a deal, the Administration and Congressional Republicans have been conducting quiet preliminary talks for several months even as each tried to pin the blame on the other for the apparent lack of progress.
Both sides said today's discussion had improved the atmosphere and the prospects for a deal, although they must still address myriad other differences, like the size of any tax cut and the depth of spending cuts in military and domestic programs.
"I would assess it for an opening round as a very successful three-and-a-half hour discussion," said Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who heads the Budget Committee.
Franklin D. Raines, the White House budget director, told reporters after the meeting that the two sides were "making progress in that we are moving forward with discussions and we are seeing common ground."
President Clinton had already made one effort at compromise on Medicare this year, saying the day after his inauguration in January that he would move halfway to the last Republican proposal. Mr. Clinton said that compromise would reduce Medicare spending by $100 billion over five years or $138 billion over six years.
But the Congressional Budget Office analyzed Mr. Clinton's plan and found that it would save $82 billion over five years, or $18 billion less than Mr. Clinton said. Republicans have insisted that the budget be balanced using the budget office's analysis rather than on the slightly more optimistic assessments of the White House's Office of Management and Budget.
In today's meeting, Administration officials essentially offered to accept the Congressional Budget Office analysis on Medicare. They presented specific proposals to increase the savings from their plan, mainly by reducing payments to hospitals and other health-care providers, so that their plan would yield $100 billion in reduced spending over five years even under the Congressional Budget Office's assumptions.
Mr. Clinton used the Republican proposals to reduce the growth of Medicare spending as a major theme in his effort to recover from the Republican sweep of Congress in 1994 and to win re-election last year. His continued move toward compromise -- without the Republicans having made any specific counteroffer -- is likely to generate grumbling or worse from liberal Democrats.
White House political strategists have kept a close eye on Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader in the House, who is a likely challenger to Vice President Al Gore for the party's Presidential nomination in 2000 and who has shown a willingness to clash with the Administration.
It is unclear whether the White House can win enough support from Democrats to pass a compromise budget if the party's liberal wing objects. Similarly, Republicans remain divided over how hard to push for deep spending and tax cuts, and Republican negotiators are looking back over their shoulders at their party's right wing, which had vowed to oppose any deal that does not significantly reduce the size and role of the Federal Government and provide sweeping tax cuts.
Republican leaders including Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, have threatened in recent days to declare the President's budget proposals dead and to proceed with their own if there is not progress in the negotiations with the White House in the next week.
But Republicans have so far not produced their own budget proposals, which would require spending reductions to pay for proposed tax cuts.

HEADLINE: Gephardt Wants to Fix Nafta, Not Sabotage It;
Consider the States

 BODY:

To the Editor:
As Thomas L. Friedman says (column, April 3), President Clinton and Vice President Gore must make a more vigorous effort to convince Congress and the country that freer international trade is essential both to our economic progress and our foreign-policy objectives. 
 However, Mr. Friedman's advocacy of "reasonable programs" to assist and retrain the minority of American workers who might lose jobs in the transition falls short of the Presidential commitment essential to progress toward an open world economy.
President Clinton needs to insure that the trade policy advantageous to the nation is also advantageous to every state.
Such a pledge would be more effective in garnering support for free-trade agreements than the one to marshal support for Nafta.
The political viability of a dependable free-trade strategy requires a domestic development strategy to backstop it.

HEADLINE: DANGER ON THE LINE: A special report.;
Standards for Gas Pipelines Unchanged Years After Blast

BYLINE: By JOHN SULLIVAN 

DATELINE: EDISON, N.J., April 8

 BODY:
Three years after a natural gas pipeline explosion destroyed eight apartment buildings here, Federal investigators say little has been done to toughen pipeline safety standards.
In particular, the investigators say, the Department of Transportation regulators who oversee gas pipelines have failed to impose specific standards the investigators recommended for pipeline toughness, for the frequency and types of inspections and for installation of equipment that would allow operators to shut off gas from a broken pipe. 
 The regulators have "a poor history of responding to our recommendations in a timely manner," said James E. Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, an independent investigative agency.
"We have a good working relationship in terms of being able to sit down and discuss our concerns," Mr. Hall said. "However, I feel that they are slow in implementing the changes that we feel are necessary."
The safety board's function is to make recommendations, not to impose regulations, but in its report on the Edison pipeline accident, the board said, "Many Federal pipeline regulations are no more than general statements that lack sufficient guidance to pipeline operators about necessary actions to achieve a safety objective."
Over half the heating oil, gasoline and other petroleum products used in the United States is transported through 1.8 million miles of pipeline. Although most of the pipelines lie in remote areas, some pass through populated regions on their way to cities.
Both industry spokesmen and critics agree that fatal pipeline accidents are rare, and, indeed, only one death has been linked to the explosion in Edison, which occurred on March 23, 1994. According to records from the Federal Department of Transportation, 21 people died in pipeline accidents in 1995, as opposed to 41,000 on the nation's highways.
But safety board reports detail accidents in which a significant loss of life was narrowly avoided. In the New York area, a natural gas pipeline exploded in the Bronx in 1989, destroying two buildings, incinerating 50 cars and killing two people. Two years later, a propane line ignited in upstate New York, leveling a dozen homes in the village of North Blenheim and killing two residents. The Edison explosion caused $25 million in damage, injured nearly 100 people and displaced 1,500. The one fatality was a 32-year-old woman who died of a heart attack shortly after the explosion.
In a 1996 follow-up report on several pipeline accidents, the safety board said the number of such incidents had remained constant since 1986. But, the board went on to say, "The potential threat to public safety from such releases has become more severe in recent years as residential and commercial development adjacent to both natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines has accelerated."
Industry spokesmen and regulators maintained that the safety board had overstated the dangers and potential problems.
Kelley S. Coyner, the Department of Transportation's deputy administrator in charge of pipeline safety, said the office is researching the safety board recommendations and has already made improvements in some areas. In particular, she said, the Government has strengthened regulations requiring contractors to call for information about buried pipelines before beginning excavation work. Because outside damage is the predominant cause of pipeline breaks, Ms. Coyner said, regulators believe that decreasing excavation-related accidents is the most effective way to improve safety.
"You look at the things that are going to do the most to reduce the likelihood of an accident and the consequences when one does occur," she said.
Regulators also point out that the budget of the Federal Office of Pipeline Safety, which regulates the pipeline industry, nearly doubled after the Edison explosion. From $19 million in 1994, the budget jumped to $37 million in 1995 and $32 million in 1996 and 1997. The agency had 30 inspectors in 1994; by the end of this year, it plans to have conducted 57.
Ms. Coyner said the pipeline regulators "work very closely" with the safety board, but also have the responsibility for producing regulations that are practical and effective. Like all regulators, the Office of Pipeline Safety must balance safety concerns with economics and engineering practicality, she said.
"We have a different perspective than they have," she added. "It is our view that there is a lot more to preventing accidents and minimizing the cause of them than just looking at the last accident."
 
The Cause
Focus on Digging In 1994 Blast
The pipeline that runs behind the Durham Woods Apartments in Edison was built in the early 1960's to meet an increasing demand for natural gas in the Northeast. The steel pipe, which is 36 inches in diameter, is part of a 10,000-mile network stretching from Texas to New York. owned by Texas Eastern Transmission Corp., based in Houston.
When Texas Eastern's engineers built the pipeline, they studied 10 routes to find the best path to avoid residential areas. Even as the pipeline was being constructed, the company altered the route several times to avoid development.
But the company could not control the new construction that spread across New Jersey farmland and squeezed in along the pipeline route. The Durham Woods complex was built in 1984.
As part of a company inspection program, which exceeded Federal requirements, a pilot from the Texas Eastern company was flying along the pipeline's route through New Jersey twice a week. The pilot was supposed to make sure that no unreported excavation or construction threatened the line.
Safety board investigators later said that the flights were sufficient to detect new construction, but failed to note work at existing industrial sites.
The investigators have said they believe excavation at a nearby asphalt plant may have gouged and weakened the pipeline in Edison. The excavation was never reported and investigators still do not know when, or by whom, it was done.
Near midnight on March 23, the pipeline finally buckled. The metal shattered under the tremendous pressure of the gas. With a muffled boom, rocks and pipe fragments flew into the air and rained down on the rooftops of the apartment complex.
The sound of the blast and of the rocks hitting the buildings proved to be a blessing. Many residents said they were awakened by the noise and were able to flee. Within two minutes of the initial explosion, the gas ignited, and flames soared 500 feet into the air. The roofs of several nearby apartment buildings ignited almost immediately.
Residents, many in pajamas and nightgowns, fled on foot as the buildings and cars in the parking lots burned. The huge fireball, visible for miles, sowed fear throughout the area. In the hour after the explosion was first reported at 11:55 P.M., more than 200,000 calls came into the Edison Township 911 system.
Within half an hour of the explosion, firefighters were able to prevent the blaze from spreading through the apartment complex. But there was little they could do about the primary fire, which was fed by a stream of natural gas.
At 12:07 A.M., an operator at Texas Eastern's compressor station in Lambertville, N.J., called the company headquarters in Houston to report low pressure in the pipeline.
"My God," the operator said, according to the safety board's report, "I can see a fireball in the sky toward Linden."
The Texas Eastern operator then dispatched an emergency team to the site of the fireball, but the gas continued to flow because the company had no way to shut off the gas remotely. The gigantic fireball continued to burn as gas workers, attempting to reach a manual shut-off valve, had to negotiate heavy traffic caused by people fleeing the explosion. The team finally reached the shut-off valve about five miles from the explosion. They shut off the flow of gas at 2:25 A.M., about two and one-half hours after the explosion.
The apartment buildings destroyed in the fire have since been rebuilt and are once again occupied.
Texas Eastern has also tightened its security procedures, increasing the frequency of aerial and ground patrols and adding 68 remote-controlled valves to pipelines in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The company plans to install 25 more valves by the end of this year, said John Barnett, a spokesman for Texas Eastern.
Mayor George A. Spadoro of Edison, who recalls watching fire engines melt from the heat of the blaze, said the town "ducked a bullet" that night.
"The fact that we had no substantial loss of life was a miracle," he said. "If it had happened 900 feet down the line, it would have been an instantaneous incineration. People would have been trapped."
 
The Aftermath
Trade Groups Cite Regulatory Costs
The safety board tracks how often nine transportation agencies, ranging from the Federal Aviation Administration to the Coast Guard, follow its recommendations. Of those agencies, safety board records show, the Office of Pipeline Safety ranks second lowest, after the Coast Guard.
But industry groups say the safety board often makes recommendations that are impractical and do little to increase actual safety. In fact, trade groups say industrial standards and guidelines, which are used in construction and maintenance of pipelines, already meet the goals the safety board wants regulators to adopt.
"The pipeline companies use practices that are above and beyond what the regulations require," said Terry Boss, a vice president of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America. He said that companies typically spend twice as much on safety programs as Federal regulations require.
One of industry's most common complaints is that regulatory standards often do not keep pace with technology. Mr. Boss said, for example, that companies use measures that provide greater safety than Federal requirements in areas like pipeline toughness and damage prevention.
Mr. Boss said the safety board recommendations do not reflect what is practical or feasible for pipeline companies. Pipeline regulators, on the other hand, try to balance safety requirements with business's ability to carry them out, he said.
"N.T.S.B. has the goal to be a safety agency with no idea of cost-benefit," Mr. Boss said. "They essentially thrive on controversy on these sorts of things."
 
The Responses
Congress Rejects A Strict Safety Bill
During Congressional hearings on the Edison explosion in 1994. Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, said: "The Edison accident should never have happened. We need to acknowledge Edison for what it is: a breakdown in the regulatory and safety program."
The Congressional hearings produced a bill adopting the recommendations made by the safety board, including remote shut-off valves for urban areas and more stringent inspection of pipelines.
"What we tried to do was respond to what we saw as the weakness of the situation and try to establish a framework that would provide serious safety requirements," said Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, one of the bill's sponsors.
Representative Frank Pallone Jr., a New Jersey Democrat who was a primary sponsor of the legislation, said the bill was not introduced until the end of the session in 1994. He said the sponsors expected to take the matter up at the beginning of the 1995 session, but the big Republican victory in Congress changed the course of the legislation.
"The new majority came in with the 'Contract with America' ideology, which is no more regulation, get government out of our lives," Mr. Pallone said. "The pipeline safety act became the first victim of this new philosophy."
Mr. Pallone said the longer the bill languished in committee, the less chance it had of eventual passage.
"Historically, both Congress and the agency are disaster oriented," Mr. Pallone said. "After a few months or a few years, the incentive becomes less, and the industry keeps saying these things are not necessary, and we do not want to be placed under these restrictions."
The 1994 bill did not pass, but in 1996, Congress approved the Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act. It contained fewer of the measures recommended by the safety board. The sponsors of the new law argued that it allowed industry greater flexibility in working with the regulations.
The law, which was opposed by environmentalists, requires that regulators perform a cost-benefit analysis before enacting any new regulations. Mr. Pallone and environmental groups contended that this presents an obstacle to any new regulation by making it subject to costly legal appeals. Supporters say the cost-benefit analysis is nothing more than the typical procedure used by regulators for years, and argue that it forces the Government to adopt practical regulations.
While Mr. Pallone and several other Congressmen said the law would do little to increase public safety, others said it contained several positive steps, including increased financing for pipeline regulators and provisions to protect pipelines from outside damage.
"There are several provisions that I support and that can help, and will help to improve the public safety," Senator Lautenberg said during a floor debate. "At the same time, however, in my view, the legislation should go farther."
Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, the sponsor of the 1996 law, declined to comment. But during debate over the legislation, Senator Lott said the other proposals would "add unnecessary layers of regulations in direct response to specific atypical incidents."
On the other hand, the Senator said, the 1996 law gives more responsibility to pipeline operators, who "have a direct and compelling reason to work hard to keep their systems and the public safe.
"There will always be some who will argue that the Government must spend more and more money for safety concerns," Senator Lott said. "My response is that safety is not just a function of how much the Government spends. I believe the critical factor is how the money is spent, not how much."

HEADLINE: Apparel Industry Group Moves to End Sweatshops

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
A Presidential task force that includes human rights groups, labor unions and apparel industry giants like Nike Inc., Reebok International Ltd. and L.L. Bean has reached a groundbreaking agreement that seeks to end sweatshops by creating a code of conduct on wages and working conditions, including a maximum 60-hour workweek, for apparel factories that American companies use around the world.
The task force has also agreed to set up an association to oversee monitors who would inspect apparel factories worldwide and give a seal of approval to companies that comply with the code of conduct. 
 Task force members vowed to follow the code in the factories they use in the United States and abroad. Participants said they hoped that dozens of other American companies would commit themselves to meeting the standards, and that the effort would eventually lead to a work standards for the clothing industry worldwide.
The members reached agreement at a seven-hour meeting on Monday, attended by Gene Sperling, chairman of the President's National Economic Council. Task force participants said President Clinton hoped to announce the agreement next Monday at a White House ceremony where he will be flanked by industry, labor and human rights officials. Mr. Sperling, who refused to confirm details of the agreement, said, "The progress that's been made represents a unique and historic step to eradicate sweatshops here and around the world."
He said the diverse group of members "were willing to sacrifice each of their sense of what was perfect to achieve something for the common good."
Companies that comply with the code will be able to put a label or tag on their clothing assuring consumers that it was not made in a sweatshop.
Linda Golodner, the co-chairwoman of the task force and president of the National Consumers Federation, said, "The benefit for everyone is what the whole task force was about: that's to make sure consumers can purchase goods that have not been made in a sweatshop and make sure that there's a process in place to check that factories are not sweatshops."
The agreement came after weeks of meetings in which the apparel companies clashed with labor and human rights representatives about minimum wages and maximum hours in factories and who should monitor the factories. Task force members said they are still debating some wording in the proposed guidelines.
Roberta Karp, the task force co-chairwoman who is general counsel at Liz Claiborne Inc., said, "Industry, human rights, labor and the Clinton Administration shared a commitment and our collective work will result in improved working conditions around the world."
Underlining the difficulty of reaching an accord, the task force agreed on an ambiguous standard for wages, saying that while factories that American companies own or contract with should pay the minimum wage in the countries where they are located, there should be a link between wages and the basic needs of workers. Several labor and human rights representatives on the task force contended that in countries like Haiti, the minimum wage is too low to support a family.
At Monday's meeting in Washington, the most hotly debated issue was working hours. The corporate members, which included Nicole Miller, Patagonia and the Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation, agreed to a maximum 60-hour workweek with several wrinkles: that the maximum standard workweek would be 48 hours in countries that do not already have a standard of fewer hours, while the maximum number of overtime hours required of apparel employees would be 12.
The two labor unions represented were the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. Jeff Ballinger, president of Press for Change, a labor rights group that has often deplored the working conditions of shoe factories that American companies use abroad, said the 60-hour maximum was an important step forward.
"If orders are backlogged or if there's a rush, many times workers will have to work 65 to 70 hours a week for weeks on end," he said.
The agreement on maximum hours will even affect factories in the United States, where there is a standard 40-hour workweek, but no limit on how many overtime hours can be worked. Under the new code, participants would agree not to force employees in their American factories to work more than 12 overtime hours beyond the 40-hour workweek.
The task force, which was set up last summer, reached an agreement early on child labor. Factories should not use workers under 15, although in some countries they would be allowed to employ 14-year-olds.
In addition, in an industry where workers often say they are hit, fondled or shouted at, the task force agree on anti-harassment provisions that human rights representatives praised. The code states that all workers be treated with respect and "no employee shall be subject to any physical, sexual, psychological or verbal harassment or abuse."
In one of the major sticking points, labor and human rights members said they wanted human rights groups or church groups to monitor factories, while corporate members said the monitors should generally be accounting firms with international offices, because such firms can easily operate anywhere.
Under the deal, companies could choose accounting firms to serve as monitors but those firms would be asked to work with human rights groups.
Task force members said that they needed to work out many details over the next such months, including how the governing association will be structured, who will serve on it, who will finance the association and the monitoring, and what labels would be put on clothing to show they were not been made in sweatshops.
Stanley Levy, a Los Angeles lawyer on the task force who represents apparel companies, said, "It's a difficult task to get all the parties to reach an agreement that sets worldwide standards."

BYLINE: By CARYN JAMES 

 BODY:
The new series "Fired Up" comes with a topical premise and an edgy lead character, just what most sitcoms lack. Sharon Lawrence (far from her role as the smart but dowdy Sylvia Costas on "N.Y.P.D. Blue") plays Gwen, a chic, aloof public relations executive downsized out of a large company. When she is finally forced to apply for unemployment, the woman who takes her application asks, "What brings you here, Duchess?"
But this promising concept soon turns into another silly sitcom device. Gwen's put-upon assistant, Terry, was also let go. In the first show, the destitute Gwen moves into Terry's large Manhattan loft, which they share with Terry's brother, Danny. The women start a public relations company as equal partners. Before long, "Fired Up" becomes a matter of the actors trying to rise above the contrived material. 
 They do that surprisingly well. Ms. Lawrence has sharp comic timing (though she doesn't really need to drop her voice to Tallulah Bankhead depths to make her point). As the middle-class Terry, Leah Remini is down to earth without being condescending. But only Mark Feuerstein, as Danny, seems completely comfortable. That may be because Danny, an aspiring writer who works in the bar beneath their apartment, is a slightly more believable character from the start.
Tonight's mildly amusing show cranks up the show's premise. But future episodes, though not terrible, never offer the sharp writing this series needs. When Gwen decides to sell her share of a racehorse, the ending is sentimental. The series is scheduled to run in the cushy Thursday night slot after "Seinfeld" through May 15. Long before then the abrasive Gwen shows signs of softening and becoming one more mushy sitcom character.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up Again as Japanese Seem Unfazed by Lower Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar reached another four-and-a-half-year high against the Japanese yen and a three-year high against the German mark yesterday, propelled by the prospect of rising American interest rates and an apparent lack of concern at central banks over the dollar's strength.
It was the dollar's fourth straight day of solid gains, and the momentum of the rise emboldened many traders to join in the buying, especially as the currency passed its 1997 high of 1.7210 marks. 
 "You've got interest rate differentials working in the dollar's favor pretty much around the world," said Ron Hudson, vice president for corporate sales at the Royal Bank of Scotland in New York. For foreign investors looking for the best return, he said, "you want to stick your money in dollars."
In New York trading yesterday, the dollar touched an intraday high of 126.93 yen, the strongest since August 1992, before settling at 126.77 yen, up from 126.52 on Tuesday and up 3.4 percent since Friday, when the rally began. Against the mark, the dollar reached an intraday high of 1.7272, the strongest since March 1994, before settling at 1.7245 marks, up from 1.7143 on Tuesday and up 2.3 percent since Friday. It rose, as well, against the British pound, which eased to $1.6194 yesterday from $1.6260 late Tuesday.
The dollar has been rallying on a combination of higher American interest rates -- which draw investment into this country, increasing the demand for dollar-denominated instruments, continuing economic sluggishness in Japan and Germany, and an apparent easing of trade friction with Japan since Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin's visit there last week.
Currency traders bought dollars starting early in Asian dealings, encouraged by the lack of any official Japanese warnings over the yen's decline. On the contrary, comments from senior Japanese monetary aides have suggested that they are not overly concerned.
The influential head of the Finance Ministry's international finance bureau, Eisuke Sakakibara, reiterated yesterday that it was desirable for foreign exchange rates to reflect economic fundamentals, and his remarks implied to traders that intervention was not warranted.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Italian Silk Industry Upset By a New U.S. Trade Law

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: COMO, Italy

 BODY:
If you sport a silk scarf with a "Made in Italy" label, chances are that not only was its silk yarn spun in China, but it was woven to fabric there, too.
Raw silk has not been produced in Italy since the 1950's. But the pride of the 200 or so textile companies that make this northern Italian city to silk what Maine is to lobsters is their skill in finishing raw silk, dying and printing it, then transforming it into ties, scarves and other apparel that fetch high prices in elegant shops around the world. 
 Since October, however, these companies, which produce 90 percent of Europe's silk exports, have been in conflict with the United States over import legislation enacted last year by Congress. For if that legislation was strictly enforced, much of Italian silk would have to be marked "Made in China."
"Imagine saying this was made in Brazil," said Guido Tettamanti, the secretary of the Italian Silk Association, pounding his desk with a fist, "just because the trees grow there that provided its wood."
The law that upsets Como was enacted to prevent the growing business of "goods shipped through third countries," said Jay Ziegler, a spokesman for the United States trade representative in Washington. The practice undermines the American economy and hurts American textile workers, the law's proponents say, because it allows dealers to skirt quotas on textiles from low-wage countries like China. Piero Costa, an economist with the Italian textile industry group Federtessile says that not companies specializing in cotton goods like sheets or pillow cases are also threatened.
Under the legislation, which took effect in July, at least four steps in the processing of fabrics, like dyeing, printing or stiffening, must be done locally for a product to qualify as made in Italy, and not China. The issue is painful, because the United States has emerged in recent years as Italy's biggest customer for silk, and the principal growth product, scarves, is notably vulnerable because often little finishing is required to transform rough fabric from China into Italian scarves.
Moreover, because of the high price silk fetches, it accounts for a disproportionately large share of the Italian textile industry's export earnings. In the first 11 months of 1996, silk fabrics accounted for less than one-tenth of 1 percent of exports by weight but by value almost 5 percent.
To be sure, the law has thus far blocked few if any European products from entering the United States. But European industry officials like Mr. Costa say the uncertainty it creates discourages growth, and thus in February they prevailed on the senior European trade official, Sir Leon Brittan, to issue an ultimatum to the United States either to take steps to change its provisions, or face a European complaint to the World Trade Organization.
In informal negotiations, the United States is seeking "mutual agreement" with the Europeans, Mr. Ziegler said, though he did not say what form this might take. Washington's main concern, he said, is the effectiveness of a bilateral textile agreement with China that was renewed in January for four years.
What makes the American action particularly painful is that it adds to pressures on the industry that derive from recent changes in Chinese policy. Rather than sell raw silk to the Italians, who weave it and use it to produce the fabrics that go into apparel by luxury designers like Gucci or Valentino, China is increasing efforts to weave large amounts of silk in China and sell it directly on world markets. In 1985, Como's silk makers imported 3,900 tons of raw silk and 600 tons of woven fabric from China; by 1995, raw silk imports dropped to 3,150 tons, while the amount of imported fabric almost tripled, to 1,644 tons.
The result, the Italian silk makers argue, is a glut of low-quality fabric that has turned designers and consumers away from silk. This comes at a time when silk, according to fashion experts like Francesco Lussana, the right-hand man to the designer Gianni Versace, has already lost ground to materials like synthetics and metallic fabrics. Price is part of the problem, he said, but designers are also turning to new blends like silk and mohair, which are soft on one side and smooth on the other, or crisp mixtures of silk and linen.
Thus, after several years of declining demand, China's raw silk exports slumped in 1996 by 5 percent. Exports of woven fabric dropped by 23 percent, while raw silk production plummeted by 30 percent.
What upsets the Europeans about the spat with Washington is that it gnaws at the united front they feel the West should present toward China on textile matters. By drawing China into the World Trade Organization, for instance, Italy hopes to put pressure on Beijing to dismantle domestic monopolies like the China National Silk Import and Export Corporation, which controls the raw silk trade.
Indeed, by negotiating direct access to raw silk supplies, Italy's silk industry, which purchases about one-fifth of all Chinese production, hopes over the long run to establish a trade group in China to compete with the corporation, whose instinctive reaction to lower sales is often to raise prices. Last year, for instance, when exports collapsed, the corporation imposed a levy of $1 a kilogram to offset lost revenues.
"In a way, we are trying to ride the tiger," Mr. Tettamanti said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
The Met markets 'Glory of Byzantium' exhibition to those whose ancestors helped make it glorious.

BYLINE: By Glenn Collins 

 BODY:
ETHNIC marketing" has become a familiar phrase in the advertising lexicon. All too often, though, "ethnic" is used to mean Asian, black or Hispanic.
But now, several American ethnic groups that marketers have long neglected -- Armenian, Greek, Russian and Ukrainian -- are being actively courted in an advertising campaign that appeals to their cultural, historic and religious identities. 
 The reason? To build attendance at "The Glory of Byzantium," the Metropolitan Museum of Art's show about Byzantine culture at its peak, from the 9th Century to the 13th. The exhibition, which opened last month and continues until July 6, offers 350 icons, mosaics, illuminated manuscripts, ivories, frescoes and other works of art produced primarily by the forebears of contemporary Armenians, Greeks, Russians and Ukrainians. The 1990 census counted nearly 424,000 people of those ethnic derivations in just the five boroughs of New York City.
In a campaign that will continue through April, the museum has bought air time on Greek and Russian radio stations in the New York metropolitan area and full-page advertisements in Greek-language publications like The National Herald and Proini, in Svoboda Ukrainian Daily, in Novoye Russkoye Slovo and in The Armenian Mirror-Spectator and The Armenian Reporter.
"This show gives pride of place to a number of ethnic groups whose treasures have been gathered together here for the first and only time," said Harold Holzer, the vice president for communications at the museum.
The Met's curators traveled to museums, private collectors, churches and remote monasteries in 24 countries to assemble the exhibition. Many of the artworks had not been shown in public before; many had never left the monasteries where they were installed more than 1,000 years ago, and some, from a Greek monastery restricted to men since the 10th century, had never been seen by women.
Philippe de Montebello, the Metropolitan's director, who has helped organize more than 400 exhibitions over 20 years, said the show was "by far the most challenging and the most important that I have inaugurated."
The advertisements have been tailored to each ethnic group. For Greek groups, they depict a mosaic of St. Andrew from the Archeological Museum in Serres, Greece. For Ukrainian-Americans, they portray "The Deacon Stephen," a mosaic from the Kiev Architectural Conservation Area. For Russian groups, they carry the representation of St. Luke in an illuminated manuscript from the Russian National Library in St. Petersburg. And for Armenian-Americans, they feature an illuminated page from the Zeyt'un Gospels on vellum created in Armenia in the 13th century.
The Metropolitan will not say how much it is spending to promote the exhibition, but experts on institutional marketing budgets who have studied the advertising campaign said it could not be mounted for less than $200,000. While this would be a drop in the bucket for a giant consumer-products company, it is a considerable commitment for a nonprofit institution.
The Metropolitan first dipped its toe in the waters of ethnic marketing with its "Splendors of Imperial China" exhibition last year, when it aimed at Asian-Americans in a campaign so successful "that one out of every five visitors to the show was Asian-American," Mr. Holzer said.
Indeed, "Splendors" won the highest attendance of any show in the world in 1996, according to a study by The Economist, more than the Vermeer show in Washington and even more than the Cezanne show at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
"Splendors" attracted 426,757 visitors during its two-month run. "Byzantium," thanks in part to the ethnic advertising campaign, has attracted 127,600 in its first three weeks.
The "Byzantium" campaign is not only the museum's most ambitious foray into ethnic marketing, it is also a rarity coming from a cultural institution. "I can't think of a major American advertiser that has run a campaign in Armenian, Greek, Russian," said Arthur Cohen, a founder and principal of LaPlaca Cohen Advertising in Manhattan, the Metropolitan's agency, which also represents the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Cleveland Museum and the Art Institute of Chicago.
"It took us weeks of interviewing people in these communities to identify the right mix of publications" for the campaign, Mr. Cohen added.
Florence Avakian, a correspondent for both The Armenian Mirror-Spectator and Armenian radio programming on WSOU-FM in New Jersey, said: "I haven't seen other museums doing this. It's a very creative way to raise the awareness of an audience that may not have known about the exhibition."
"Many Armenians have already come to the 'Byzantium' exhibition," she added, "and some of them wouldn't have discovered it without the Metropolitan's campaign."
Given its experience so far, will the Met try ethnic marketing again? "If it's appropriate for the exhibition, we'd do it immediately," Mr. Holzer said. "We are living in a community that is a mosaic of cultures in which such marketing is ideal."

HEADLINE: Iraq Defies U.N. Ban With Pilgrimage Flight to Arabia

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: CAIRO, April 9

 BODY:
An Iraqi aircraft flew more than 100 passengers to Saudi Arabia today in the first open defiance of the United Nations air embargo that has been enforced against Iraq since the Persian Gulf war six years ago.
The Government in Baghdad apparently concluded that like Libya, Iraq was not likely to pay any real price for its defiance. Libya has defied a similar embargo three times to fly pilgrims to Saudi Arabia on its own aircraft. 
 The Iraqi authorities gave no indication whether they intended to send more planes into the skies or whether today's flight was merely a symbolic gesture.
The plane was permitted to enter the airspace of Saudi Arabia after the authorities there were informed that it carried pilgrims bound for the Muslim holy sites of Mecca and Medina, Saudi officials said.
The Iraqis on board, all at least 50 years old, were performing the haj, the pilgrimage that Muslims must make at least once in their lives if they have the means to do so.
Since the gulf war, Iraqis who have visited the holy sites have traveled overland, their only option under the United Nations sanctions.
In dispatching the flight today, Iraqi officials said their motives were humanitarian, but they also hoped to arouse anger across the Muslim world against what the Minister of Religious Affairs, Abdul-Muneim Ahmed Saleh, called "this unfair embargo which the infidel countries have imposed and in which Islamic and Arab countries are taking part."
The American-led allied force that drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait in 1991 used Saudi Arabia as its principal staging area, and the Saudi Government remains an unabashed foe of the Iraqi Government and its leader, President Saddam Hussein.
But as custodian of Islam's two holiest sites, the Saudi Government has been deeply reluctant to be seen as denying Muslims the right to perform the haj. The Interior Minister, Prince Nayef ibn Abdel Aziz, said that Saudi Air Force jets had escorted the Russian-built plane from the moment it entered Saudi Arabia, but that the journey to the city of Jidda on the Red Sea coast had been authorized "when it became known that the aircraft had pilgrims on board."
An earlier request by Iraq to use its aircraft to fly pilgrims to Saudi Arabia this year had been rejected by the United Nations Security Council, and today's flight is expected to be met with swift condemnation there.
Until today, the effect of the United Nations air embargo on Iraq and no-flight zones imposed across the north and south of the country by the United States and its allies was to leave all of Iraq's civilian aircraft grounded and its airports shuttered.
Before the Soviet-built Ilyushin-76 plane took off from a military air base on the eastern outskirts of Baghdad, the Iraqi authorities staged a farewell ceremony that made clear that the mission reflected official policy.
The foray was only the latest attempt by Iraq to undermine support for the United Nations sanctions, which were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 and which have left Baghdad politically and economically isolated.
After lengthy negotiations, the Security Council agreed last year to let Iraq sell limited quantities of oil and use the proceeds to buy food, and Iraq dispatched envoys to Japan, Russia and Europe last month to seek support for a further loosening of the sanctions.
In recent months some Arab countries including Egypt, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have become increasingly open in hinting that they would support a lifting of the restrictions against Iraq.
But the Baghdad Government has also had to weather new criticism from United Nations officials, who have condemned the country's human rights record and complained that it is failing to honor its commitment to allow United Nations inspectors full access to information about its weapons programs.
As if to minimize any affront that might be caused by today's foray, the Iraqi authorities called attention to the age of the pilgrims, who included 64 men and 40 women. Among those interviewed by reporters in Iraq, several said they were in declining health and could not endure the hardship of the 1,250-mile land journey from Baghdad to Mecca.

HEADLINE: U.S. Raises Pressure on Mobutu, A Longtime Ally, to Step Down

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
As violence swept through the streets of Zaire's capital today, the White House sharply stepped up pressure on President Mobutu Sese Seko to step aside.
In its harshest comments to date about Mr. Mobutu, a longtime American ally, the White House declared that the end of his autocratic regime was inevitable. "Mobutuism is about to become a creature of history," Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, told reporters this morning. 
 But Administration officials said they remain unsure what kind of rule might follow a collapse of Mr. Mobutu's Government and are wary of the intentions of Laurent Kabila, the leader of Zaire's rebels, who now control about a third of the country.
Officials at the White House and the State Department insisted that they were not calling on President Mobutu to resign, but rather for him to help create a transitional government that would hold democratic elections. Mr. McCurry acknowledged that he was skirting the lip of such a request, saying, "Ambiguity is an art form."
But when pressed for elaboration, he added, "I think that it's clear that we have to move beyond President Mobutu and think about how we begin to structure a government that can address the needs of the Zairian people, and that's what the United States is committing to supporting."
Harshly repudiating a leader that successive Administrations treated as an ally for decades, Mr. McCurry defined "Mobutuism" as "the state of disrepair of the Zairian political economy, the sad conditions that many people in Zaire live in now, the lack of effective political representation that the people of Zaire have suffered under for some time."
From the time he took power in 1965, Mr. Mobutu received hundreds of millions of dollars from the United States until Congress, over the objections of the Bush Administration, cut off all direct military and economic aid in 1990. The United States still provides some aid to Zaire through nongovernmental organizations.
The Central Intelligence Agency worked closely with Mr. Mobutu for years, funnelling money through him to pro-Western guerrilla forces in Angola, according to Angolan military commanders and Western diplomats in Zaire.
About 500 Americans remain in Zaire. American military forces are standing by directly across the Congo River from Kinshasa, the Zaire capital, prepared to evacuate them if necessary, officials said. Mr. McCurry said the American troops had been deployed only to help evacuate United States citizens in Zaire, not to play a wider role in a change in government.
As reports came in about spreading violence and arrests in Kinshasa, American officials seemed uncertain about the rapidly shifting political situation there, although they said they remained in contact with Mr. Mobutu's Government.
"We may have a situation where there are two prime ministers in Zaire, or two people who say they are prime minister," Nicholas Burns, the State Department spokesman, said.
Mr. Burns appeared to be referring to efforts today by Zaire's Prime Minister, Etienne Tshisekedi, a longtime opponent of Mr. Mobutu, to defy the state of emergency that Mr. Mobutu declared on Wednesday.
Administration officials said the United States had not attempted to send signals through intermediaries to urge Mr. Mobutu to step aside. "We couldn't do that," one official said. "Mobutu could have used it against us with the French." The French Government remains an ally of Mr. Mobutu.
Bernard Valero, the press counselor of the French Embassy here, said France supported negotiations between the rebels and Mr. Mobutu's Government, which are taking place in South Africa. The United States is also supporting that process, hoping it will lead to democratic elections.
An Administration official said that Washington remained unsure whether Mr. Kabila, the rebel leader, will embrace democracy. "There's room for hope, but I don't think anyone wants to be overconfident about that," the official said.

Early Gains In Treasuries Fail to Hold

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices were little changed yesterday, with early gains on the back of a strong dollar evaporating by the afternoon.
In the municipal bond market, a $1.2 billion debt sale by New York City was the center of attention. 
 The sluggish trading in the Treasury market reflected investors' caution ahead of reports on retail sales and producer prices tomorrow. Many market participants expect the Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates again, and they are looking to the reports for clues on how many times the Fed may act.
"The only good thing you could say about Wednesday's action is that Thursday's will probably be even more dull," said David Ader, managing analyst with Technical Data in Boston.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond slipped 1/32, to 94 5/32, to yield 7.10 percent, unchanged from Tuesday.
In one of the busiest days of the year thus far for the municipal market, New York's sale accounted for about half of the $2 billion or more debt that states and local government prepared to issue.
About $900 million of the bonds with maturities that range from one year to 30 years were priced through underwriters led by Smith Barney Inc.
The bonds were priced to yield as much as 6.39 percent for a bond due in 2027. Serial bonds with shorter maturities were priced to yield from 4.550 percent for an issue due in 1999 to 5.60 percent in 2005, 6.15 percent in 2010 and 6.250 in 2013. Other long maturities included a bond due April 2017 priced to yield 6.31 percent and August 2017 priced to yield 6.30 percent.
An additional $120 million in taxable bonds was underwritten by Morgan Stanley & Company. They were priced to yield 7.440 percent for an issue due in 2003 and 7.480 percent for another due in 2004.
The $900 million of tax-exempt debt and $120 million of taxable debt is rated Baa1 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, with the exception of a tax-exempt bond due April 2007, which is insured by the Municipal Bond Investor's Assurance Corporation and rated triple-A.
Sylvan G. Feldstein, a municipal bond analyst with Guardian Asset Management, said there was huge retail interest in the city bonds, which he thought were not priced aggressively, but priced fairly to move in the flat market environment.
In the corporate market, the J. C. Penney Company priced $2.5 billion of debt in a six-part offering through underwriters led by the Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation. The offering is rated A2 by Moody's and A by Standard & Poor's.
Underwriters priced $325 million of three-year noncallable notes to yield 6.979 percent, or about 40 basis points more than a comparable Treasury security, and $700 million of five-year noncallable notes to yield 7.259 percent, or about 50 basis points over a comparable Treasury. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The Penney debt also includes $425 million of 10-year noncallable notes with a yield of 7.60 percent, or about 70 basis points more than a comparable Treasury, and $300 million of 20-year noncallable notes with a yield of 7.998 percent, or about 85 basis points more than a similar Treasury.
There are also $350 million of 30-year debentures with a yield of 8.348 percent, or about 120 basis points above a comparable Treasury, and $400 million in 40-year debentures with a yield of 7.412 percent, or about 50 basis points over a Treasury note due in 2005.

HEADLINE: A Continental Divide;
Tensions Grow as Europe Moves to a Unified Market

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
Europe's progress toward political and economic unity, glacial though it may be, is opening the Continent to a level of worldwide competition that is unprecedented in its traditionally insular markets. Radical change is shaking some of Europe's biggest industries, leading to widespread job losses.
Philippe Martinez, head of one of France's leading leftist unions, is having none of it. Seated in an office under a poster with the words "To Privatize Is to Destroy," Mr. Martinez typified the anger displayed by those who think that greater European unity and global competition will destroy jobs, income and a sense of security that huge, Government-owned employers and cosseted industries have provided to generations of his countrymen. 
 "The Government's acting like a greedy investor," he said.
The United States, of course, went through a similar upheaval in recent years as corporations cut tens of thousands of jobs to increase productivity and stay competitive. But in Europe, with rigid social structures and traditionally strong labor movements, the tension is even greater.
In Germany, coal miners from the industrial Ruhr basin stormed into Bonn recently to protest cuts in coal price subsidies, a move they say will destroy thousands of jobs. And in Berlin, construction workers demonstrated to protest the hiring of cheap labor from Ireland, England and Portugal.
In France, truck drivers demanding more pay used their vehicles in February to block highways and ports. More recently, auto workers in France and Belgium took to the streets to protest Renault's plans to close a factory near Brussels, cutting 3,000 jobs, and to lay off 3,000 more workers in France.
Indeed, nowhere is the tension more apparent than in France. While European leaders forge ahead with plans for a single market, much remains to be done in France, and the prospect of restructuring and layoffs is spawning a fierce conflict that pits French values against the harsh realities of international competition.
"There is a clear contradiction between our traditions and our recent political decisions," said Eric Barthalon, chief economist at Paribas, the French financial services company. The absence of public debate about that contradiction is what troubles France, he said, "more than our rigidity."
The conflict is vividly clear at Renault, France's largest auto maker, which is trying to return to profitability after a $924 million loss in 1996. Because of an unfortunate combination of poor organization, manufacturing inefficiencies and a reluctance to venture too far from France, the company has become an also-ran in the world market. A planned marriage with Volvo fell through a few years ago, and now Renault faces the toil of getting into fighting trim to take on an expected invasion of Japanese cars.
Louis Schweitzer, the chairman and chief executive of Renault, readily admits that much of its difficulty lies in the poor organization of its factories, where low output and a multiplicity of models built under one roof prevent the economies of scale required to stay competitive.
What Mr. Schweitzer is slower to acknowledge is the effect of bad management decisions, often made under Government pressure. To save jobs in French factories, overseas investment was neglected. In 1987, Renault, whose full name is Regie Nationale des Usines Renault, pulled out of North America, selling a 46 percent share in American Motors to Chrysler.
In the 1990's, a deal to build trucks with Volvo collapsed when it became clear that the biggest changes, and most job losses, would come not at Volvo's plants in Sweden but at Renault's inefficient factories in France.
Some experts even question the Government's wisdom when, in 1990, it appointed Mr. Schweitzer, a former Government official described by one industry executive as a "very intelligent, thoughtful civil servant," yet "not an automobile man with gasoline in his blood."
Not that Renault has been standing still. To cut costs, Mr. Schweitzer has slashed 30,000 factory jobs, roughly a quarter of the total, since 1990. And Renault has consistently turned out exciting new models, from the bright little Twingo subcompact to the more recent Megane Scenic, a sleek van that European motor magazines named 1997 Car of the Year.
Yet Renault's factories remain bloated and costly, and in December Mr. Schweitzer reshuffled top management, hiring Carlos Ghosn, a hard-nosed turnaround artist, and giving him key management duties.
"The average size of our factories is 125,000 cars a year, while all our competitors are at 200,000, and our plants are more complex than theirs," Mr. Schweitzer said in an interview.
While most car makers seek to concentrate on one model at each plant, Renault's compact Clio, for instance, is assembled at five of its nine European sites. Moreover, while Volkswagen and Fiat have built factories in Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe, Renault remains stubbornly local, with 85 percent of its sales in Europe.
The French Government has for years been gradually selling off control of more than a score of huge enterprises like banks, insurance companies, industrial companies and even Renault itself. Last year, the Government sold stakes in 10 of the largest nationalized industries, and in May shares worth $8.8 billion in France Telecom, Europe's second-largest telecommunications group after Germany's national company, will go on the block.
Moreover, the intertwined ownership common to French business, which tended to cushion executives from the pressure to produce profits, is gradually breaking up. Financial services companies such as Paribas and insurance companies such as Union des Assurances de Paris have begun selling off shares in industrial concerns. Alcatel Alsthom, the telecommunications conglomerate, and PSA Peugeot Citroen, the auto maker, have sold their mutual holdings.
There is a renewed focus on core businesses, and "in the long run we are clearly seeing it helping in our export performance," Mr. Barthalon said.
Change is much in evidence at Paribas. To focus on financial services, Paribas in recent years sold industrial pearls, like shares in the construction supply group Poliet, as well as a retail banking unit. Last year, as banking and investment revenues strengthened, Paribas reported a net profit of $763 million, recovering from a loss of $700 million a year earlier.
But failing to focus on growth, some experts warn, could lead to what Jean-Francois Manzoni, a management expert at Insead, the business school outside Paris, calls a "death spiral."
"You cannot sustain companies that don't create value," Mr. Manzoni said. Yet right now French business leaders, he cautioned, are "only selling pain."
What is driving the change, economists like Mr. Barthalon agree, is the decision to make France part of a single European market.
To cushion its auto industry, France long maintained high barriers to non-European imports -- Japan's share of the French market is just 7 percent, compared with 17 percent in Germany. By 1999, though, those barriers will fall, and the Japanese and South Koreans are gearing up for the onslaught. This month, Toyota announced plans to build a $1.6 billion factory in northern France with an annual capacity of 200,000 cars.
Meanwhile, Mr. Schweitzer rules out any significant mergers, at least for the moment. For Renault to join, for instance, with France's No. 2 car maker, Peugeot, would be " stupid," he said. "We would destroy each other's market share," he declared.
He envisions, instead, further cooperation agreements such as one signed in 1996 with General Motors to jointly make vans starting later this year in France and England, a deal he describes as the "most extensive cooperation" Renault has ever undertaken.
Of course, this talk is not welcome at all at France's powerful labor unions.
Marcel Grignard, the secretary general for miners and metal workers in the CFDT labor union, which represents about 8 percent of Renault workers, says the only way to save jobs at Renault is not to dismiss workers but to shorten working hours. This is what was done at Volkswagen, where in 1993 workers accepted a 28.8-hour workweek, not 36, to save jobs. At Volkswagen, the price was wage cuts of as much as 14.5 percent, which Mr. Grignard is not sure Renault workers would swallow.
And in any case, Volkswagen has had mixed results. Because its plan lacked flexibility, it needed union approval to allow employees to work up to 10 extra hours a week, with a costly 20 percent overtime bonus.
The French Government has tried to create jobs by granting tax relief to businesses that cut work hours and hire more employees, and this has provided some relief. Since 1994, French unemployment has held steady, while 500,000 jobs have been lost in Germany.
But the Government continues to resist proposals by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to reform the labor market by increasing corporate flexibility in setting working hours and reducing the minimum wage, which is $6.60 an hour. After all, the last prime minister to propose a cut in the minimum wage, Eduard Balladur, was forced to backtrack after thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Paris.

HEADLINE: Russian Talks of a Possible NATO Pact

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, April 9

 BODY:
All but conceding defeat in its long battle against NATO's expansion, Russia agreed conditionally today to put its relations with the alliance on a new footing at a meeting in May with President Clinton and other allied leaders.
After talks with President Jacques Chirac of France about a charter that has been under discussion since December, Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov of Russia said today, "We agreed that if the NATO-Russia agreement can be prepared in the coming weeks and if the preparations are satisfactory to all nations concerned, then the signing by heads of state or government of the 16 member states and Russia can take place in Paris on May 27." 
 "We believe plans for enlarging NATO are a very serious mistake," Mr. Primakov said. "But at the same time, we are realists, and we will do our best to get the Russian factor taken into account whatever the course of events." President Boris N. Yeltsin, he said, would come to Paris "with great pleasure" on May 27, assuming the final obstacles to a NATO-Russia charter are resolved by then.
President Clinton is planning to come to Europe on May 28 for ceremonies commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Marshall Plan, the economic aid program that put the western half of the continent back on its feet after World War II.
At that time, Eastern European countries, dominated by the Soviet Union, were invited to take part, but Moscow forced them to decline, and soon competing alliances, NATO and the Warsaw Pact, created a division that lasted until the Berlin wall crumbled in 1989.
The Warsaw Pact collapsed with it, but NATO, led by the United States, is trying to develop a new vocation as a peacekeeping force to insure military, political and economic stability in a region that spawned two world wars.
Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are expected to be among the first former Communist countries invited to join. Mr. Clinton and other NATO leaders plan to extend the invitations at an alliance summit meeting planned in Madrid in early July.
Any Russian hopes that differences of opinion between President Clinton and key European allies would cause the alliance to shelve its expansion plans were disappointed by the enthusiastic backing Mr. Chirac and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany gave the plans in talks they had with Mr. Yeltsin earlier this year.
When he met Mr. Clinton in Helsinki, Finland, last month, Mr. Yeltsin was prepared to say only that the United States and Russia had agreed to disagree about expansion and to keep working on the charter. By agreeing to the May 27 signing date, Western diplomats said, Mr. Yeltsin has created the expectation that any remaining wrinkles could be ironed out by then.
French officials close to Mr. Chirac and Western diplomats said they had no reason to believe that Mr. Primakov had been promised any new concessions. Mr. Chirac flew to Bonn later today for scheduled talks with Mr. Kohl.
NATO's Secretary General, Javier Solana, now visiting Washington and Ottawa, will go to Moscow next week for more talks on the charter, which Russia originally wanted to be a pact requiring ratification by all signers.
What is emerging instead is a formal agreement falling short of a treaty. It would establish a permanent liaison between Russian military officers and the alliance's commanders in Mons, Belgium, and a consultative council in Brussels.
French officials said the Russians were still hoping the allies would put into writing the pledges they have effectively made not to put nuclear arms or substantial ground forces on the soil of new members, at least under current political conditions.
"We have to agree on not creating infrastructure to enable the forward deployment of those forces," Mr. Primakov said in Paris, indicating that Russia wanted NATO to promise not to build modernized bases that would make it easier to move troops and weapons to the new member countries.
NATO has rejected such a pledge, saying it would make second-class members of the countries that join.
