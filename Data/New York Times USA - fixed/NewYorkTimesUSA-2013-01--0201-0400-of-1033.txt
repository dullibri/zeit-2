HEADLINE: Lose Weight for Your Country

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Your spare tire might help you live longer, according to a new study on mortality rates by body mass index, but it is also accelerating the country's debt problems. 

 BODY:
Last week there was a lot of fanfare over a new study showing that overweight people have less risk of dying than people of normal weight. Lovers of butter cookies and Popeyes the world over surely rejoiced at the news. But at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association over the weekend in San Diego, health economists I spoke with expressed dismay over the study's fiscal implications. 
"The study looked at quantity of life, not quality of life, and that's a very important distinction," noted Dana Goldman, director of the University of Southern California's Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics.
A higher body mass index -- a standard measure for determining whether people are overweight or obese -- is associated with a number of chronic illnesses, including diabetes, heart disease and hypertension. These chronic illnesses are expensive to treat. If, as it now turns out, overweight people are living longer in addition to racking up more chronic illnesses, that means Medicare is on the hook for paying for more expensive people for more years. (I should note that Americans in the two highest obesity categories -- B.M.I. of 35 and up -- had a higher mortality rate than everyone else. Research suggests, though, that the obese still cost the government more over the course of their lifetimes because their annual expenses are so high.)
In other words, your spare tire might help you live longer, but it is also accelerating the country's debt problems.
Professor Goldman said the study underscored the fiscal imperative to get more Americans to a normal weight, whether through financial nudges to eat better, like a soda tax, or some sort of biomedical intervention, like an F.D.A.-approved pill that would reduce obesity. Right now, he said, the incentive system for medical practitioners does not encourage treatment of obesity as a disease itself -- only the complications that later result from obesity.
He gave as an example a doctor he knows who has an obese patient taking expensive drugs for various health problems related to being overweight. The doctor told Professor Goldman: "The best thing I could do for this patient would be to take him for a walk. But I don't get paid for that."

HEADLINE: How Much Are Americans Willing to Spend to Defend Europe?

BYLINE: JUDY DEMPSEY


HIGHLIGHT: Given Washington's "pivot" toward Asia, you would think Europe would be doing more to provide for its own military defense. You would be wrong. 

 BODY:
BERLIN - At the end of this month, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the NATO secretary general, will release new figures on defense spending by the 28 Alliance members. 
They will almost certainly show a decline for most countries. The global financial crisis, followed by the euro crisis, has put immense pressure on finance ministries to cut budgets, including, in most places, defense budgets. 
It is interesting to note that Greece, of all European countries, has maintained a fairly high level of spending. Given the shape of the Greek economy, that creates problems of its own which I discuss in my latest Letter from Europe. 
Mr. Rasmussen has repeatedly asked Alliance members to invest in defense to deal with new threats, such as cyber and energy security. He also fears that the technological gap between Europe and the United States will widen so much that 'interoperability,' the ability to operate together on missions, will be endangered.
The United States spends 31 percent of its defense budget on investment. The Europeans spend 22 percent, according to Claude-France Arnould, the chief executive of the E.U.'s European Defence Agency, which was established over a decade ago to promote defense cooperation. 
There are few signs that Europeans are willing to invest more. Indeed, defense spending among E.U. member states was at a record low, Ms. Arnould said during a security conference in Berlin last November.
Both NATO and the E.U. believe there is one way to try bridge this gap: through smart defense or "pooling and sharing."
In practice, it would mean NATO and E.U. members, the majority of whom belong to each other's organization, cooperating much more on defense, instead of - for example - duplicating expensive equipment. 
Ms. Arnould has warned E.U. countries not to use pooling and sharing as an excuse to invest even less. "Pooling and sharing offers a way to acquire together what is out of reach individually and get more efficiency in the deployment of these capabilities," she said. "We see that Europe risks losing significant industrial capability between now and 2020."
Yet, for all the cajoling by NATO, the E.U. and Pentagon officials, little has changed. 
European governments still believe that defense policy and defense spending are intrinsic elements of national sovereignty. 
And while governments will agree to participate in small collaborative projects, such as the European Defense Agency's helicopter training program, they shy away from anything big enough to really improve Europe's military technology sector or its security.
What a foolhardy attitude to have, say analysts, considering that
the Obama administration's security agenda is focusing increasingly on Asia. Surely, analysts add, this should be the time for Europe to take on more responsibility for its own security.

HEADLINE: Ant Study Deepens Concern About Plastic Additives

BYLINE: DAVID JOLLY


HIGHLIGHT: Research shows that phthalate contamination of ants is ubiquitous, and worsens simply with exposure to the air. 

 BODY:
PARIS -- About five years ago, Alain Lenoir, a researcher at François Rabelais University in Tours, France, was studying the biochemical process by which ants differentiate between friends and foes.
Scientists had come to understand that the insects used their antennae to sense the makeup of the hydrocarbons of other ants' cuticles. Using chemical analyses like gas chromatography, Dr. Lenoir had begun focusing in particular on hydrocarbons on Lasius niger, the common black ant.
Dr. Lenoir, who has been studying ants since 1968, found something unexpected: in addition to the hydrocarbons, the analysis was consistently revealing the presence of plastic additives called phthalates, and not just in a few specimens - all of them. 
Other scientists had reported such findings, he said, but he had brushed off the presence of those chemicals as contamination that occurred in the lab. 
Intrigued, Dr. Lenoir, today an emeritus professor, decided to follow up with a new study. The results, published in last month's issue of Science of the Total Environment, an academic journal, confirmed what he had already come to fear.
All of the ants that he and his team studied were contaminated with phthalates, regardless of where the insects originated. For example, the chemical made up as much as 0.59 percent of the substances on the cuticles of ants that had just been collected in a field near Tours.

In another experiment, Dr. Lenoir's team kept the ants in the laboratory in an open plastic box that contained no phthalates. Nonetheless, the amount of the chemicals on the ants' cuticles actually increased - indicating that the phthalates were present in the air and stuck to the ants' cuticles. (The quantity of phthalates on the cuticles of ants in closed boxes did not increase).
Phthalate esters, http://phthalates.americanchemistry.com">according to the American Chemistry Council, belong to "a family of compounds whose primary use is as a vinyl softener. They are colorless, odorless liquids that do not evaporate readily."
The chemicals, also known as plasticizers, are almost inescapable, so essential is their use in the modern economy, appearing in everything from toys to construction materials and cosmetics. For example, the chemistry council notes, it was the addition of a phthalate known as DEHP to polyvinyl chloride - normally a brittle plastic - that made possible the blood bag that we know today, which brought about a revolution in blood storage and delivery.
Unfortunately, there are serious concerns about their health effects, as phthalates are thought to be endocrine disruptors, chemicals that alter the way animal hormones operate. Phthalates are not bound chemically to the plastics to which they are added and enter the environment naturally as the plastic deteriorates with age.
Laboratory testing has shown that pretty much everyone has some degree of phthalates in their bodies. We are exposed to the chemicals regularly, the Centers for Disease Control says, http://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/Phthalates_FactSheet.html">says, by eating and drinking food that has been in contact with containers and products containing phthalates and by breathing in air that contains phthalate vapors or dust contaminated with phthalate particles.
After entering the human body, the chemicals are quickly broken down into metabolites and passed out the through the urine. But the C.D.C. notes that exposure to DEHP has caused adverse effects in laboratory animals, with the development of the male reproductive system in young animals raising the biggest concerns. 
In the absence of certainty on the effects on humans, it said, "precautions should be taken to limit the exposure of the developing male to DEHP."
In 2009, researchers at Mount Sinai Medical Center reported finding evidence suggesting that the chemicals may also contribute to obesity in girls.
"Phthlates are everywhere in the atmosphere," Dr. Lenoir said in an interview. Some of the contamination of the ants in the open boxes certainly must have come from other plastics in the laboratory, he added, though that would have also been the case in people's houses, where plastics are everywhere.
To test the universality of their experience, the scientists also tested ants from places including Hungary, Spain, Morocco, Spain, Greece, Burkina Faso and Egypt. In all of those places, the ants - which had not had direct contact with plastic - tested positive for the presence of phthalates, although in some cases only in trace amounts.
And it wasn't just the ants, the French researchers found. They also tested wood crickets and honeybees, with the same result.
The long-term effects of phthalate contamination on ants is not known. But Dr. Lenoir said he had observed that the fecundity of queen ants appeared to decrease when phthalates were placed on their abdomens, and that he planned to investigate that idea further.

HEADLINE: Rescued by a Bailout, A.I.G. May Sue Its Savior

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: A lawsuit claims that the rescue by the government deprived A.I.G.'s shareholders of tens of billions of dollars and took private property for public use without appropriate compensation. 

 BODY:
Fresh from paying back a $182 billion bailout, the American International Group has been running a nationwide advertising campaign with the tagline "Thank you America."
Behind the scenes, the restored insurance company is weighing whether to tell the government agencies that rescued it during the financial crisis: thanks, but you cheated our shareholders.
The board of A.I.G. will meet on Wednesday to consider joining a $25 billion shareholder lawsuit against the government, court records show. The lawsuit does not argue that government help was not needed. It contends that the onerous nature of the rescue - the taking of what became a 92 percent stake in the company, the deal's high interest rates and the funneling of billions to the insurer's Wall Street clients - deprived shareholders of tens of billions of dollars and violated the Fifth Amendment, which prohibits the taking of private property for "public use, without just compensation."
Maurice R. Greenberg, A.I.G.'s former chief executive, who remains a major investor in the company, filed the lawsuit in 2011 on behalf of fellow shareholders. He has since urged A.I.G. to join the case, a move that could nudge the government into settlement talks. 
The choice is not a simple one for the insurer. Its board members, most of whom joined after the bailout, owe a duty to shareholders to consider the lawsuit. If the board does not give careful consideration to the case, Mr. Greenberg could challenge its decision to abstain.
Should Mr. Greenberg snare a major settlement without A.I.G., the company could face additional lawsuits from other shareholders. Suing the government would not only placate the 87-year-old former chief, but would put A.I.G. in line for a potential payout.
Yet such a move would almost certainly be widely seen as an audacious display of ingratitude. The action would also threaten to inflame tensions in Washington, where the company has become a byword for excessive risk-taking on Wall Street.
Some government officials are already upset with the company for even seriously entertaining the lawsuit, people briefed on the matter said. The people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, noted that without the bailout, A.I.G. shareholders would have fared far worse in bankruptcy.
"On the one hand, from a corporate governance perspective, it appears they're being extra cautious and careful," said Frank Partnoy, a former banker who is now a professor of law and finance at the University of San Diego School of Law. "On the other hand, it's a slap in the face to the taxpayer and the government."
For its part, A.I.G. has seized on the significance and complexity of the case, which is filed in both New York and Washington. A federal judge in New York dismissed the case, while the Washington court allowed it to proceed.
"The A.I.G. board of directors takes its fiduciary duties and business judgment responsibilities seriously," said a spokesman, Jon Diat.
On Wednesday, the case will command the spotlight for several hours at A.I.G.'s Lower Manhattan headquarters.
Mr. Greenberg's company, Starr International, will begin with a 45-minute presentation to the board, according to people briefed on the matter. Mr. Greenberg is expected to attend, they added.
It will be an unusual homecoming of sorts for Mr. Greenberg, who ran A.I.G. for nearly four decades until resigning amid investigations into an accounting scandal in 2005. For some years after his abrupt departure, there was bitterness and litigation between the company and its former chief.
After the Starr briefing on Wednesday, lawyers for the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York - the architects of the bailout and defendants in the cases - will make their presentations. Each side will have a few minutes to rebut.
While the discussions are part of an already scheduled board meeting, securities lawyers say it is rare for an entire board to meet on a single piece of litigation.
"It makes eminent good sense in this case, but I've never heard of this kind of situation," said Henry Hu, a former regulator who is now a professor at the University of Texas School of Law in Austin.
It is unclear whether the directors are leaning toward joining the case. The board said in a court filing that it would probably decide by the end of January.
Until now, the insurance giant has sat on the sidelines. But its delay in making a decision, some officials say, has drawn out the case, forcing the government to pay significant legal costs.
The presentations on Wednesday come on top of hundreds of pages of submissions that the government prepared last year, a time-consuming and costly process. The Justice Department, which assigned about a dozen lawyers to the case and hired outside experts, told a judge handling the matter that Starr was seeking 16 million pages in documents from the government.
"How many?" the startled judge, Thomas C. Wheeler, asked, according to a transcript.
Struck just days after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, the bailout of A.I.G. proved to be among the biggest and thorniest of the financial crisis rescues. The company was on the brink of collapse because of deteriorating mortgage securities that it had insured through credit-default swaps.
Starting in 2010, the insurer embarked on a series of moves aimed at repaying its taxpayer-financed bailout, including selling major divisions. It also held a number of stock offerings for the government to reduce its stake, which eventually generated a roughly $22 billion profit.
Overseeing that comeback was a new chief executive, Robert H. Benmosche, a tough-talking longtime insurance executive. Mr. Benmosche has won plaudits, including from government officials, for his managing of A.I.G.'s public relations even as he helped nurse the company back to financial health.
But he and the rest of A.I.G.'s board must now confront an equally pugnacious predecessor in Mr. Greenberg.
In the case against the government, Mr. Greenberg, through his lead lawyer, David Boies, contends that the bailout plan extracted a "punitive" interest rate of more than 14 percent. The government's huge stake in the company also diluted the holdings of existing shareholders like Starr, which at the time was A.I.G.'s largest investor.
"The government has been saying, 'We're your friend, we owned and controlled you and we let you go.' But A.I.G. doesn't owe loyalty to the government," a person close to Mr. Greenberg said. "It owes loyalty to its shareholders."
The government, Starr argues, used billions of dollars from A.I.G. to settle credit-default swaps the insurer had with banks like Goldman Sachs. The deal, according to the lawsuit, empowered the government to carry out a "backdoor bailout" of Wall Street.
Starr argued that the actions violated the Fifth Amendment. "The government is not empowered to trample shareholder and property rights even in the midst of a financial emergency," the Starr complaint says.
The Treasury Department declined to comment. A spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Jack Gutt, said, "There is no merit to these allegations." He noted that "A.I.G.'s board of directors had an alternative choice to borrowing from the Federal Reserve, and that choice was bankruptcy."
A federal judge in Manhattan agreed, dismissing the case in November. In an 89-page opinion, Judge Paul A. Engelmayer wrote that while Starr's complaint "paints a portrait of government treachery worthy of an Oliver Stone movie," the company "voluntarily accepted the hard terms offered by the one and only rescuer that stood between it and imminent bankruptcy."
The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit recently agreed to review the case on an expedited timeline. The judge in the United States Court of Federal Claims in Washington, meanwhile, has declined to dismiss the case and continues to await A.I.G.'s decision.

HEADLINE: Easing of Rules for Banks Acknowledges Reality

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Less stringent capital and liquidity requirements for banks for the world's banks will help bolster the global economic recovery, which is needed most right now. 

 BODY:
When a global committee of regulators and central bankers agreed to a new set of rules for the banking system a year and a half ago, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, told The Financial Times, "I'm very close to thinking the United States shouldn't be in Basel anymore. I would not have agreed to rules that are blatantly anti-American."
Over the last weekend, Mr. Dimon finally got what he had wanted: a form of deregulation of sorts. The new international capital requirements for banks, known as Basel III - apologies if your eyes are glazing over - were significantly relaxed by regulators. 
Instead of requiring banks to maintain, by 2015, a certain amount of assets that can quickly be turned into cash, the most stringent deadline was pushed to 2019. Perhaps more important, the type of assets that could be counted in a bank's liquidity requirement was changed to be more flexible, including securities backed by mortgages, for example, instead of simply sovereign debt.
 This sounds boring, but it is important stuff. Increasing bank capital and liquidity requirements - think of it as the size of a bank's rainy day fund - is arguably more significant than all of the new laws in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The more capital a bank is required to hold, the lower the chance it could suffer a run on the bank like Lehman Brothers did in 2008.
 Given memories of the financial crisis, the idea that regulators would loosen rules even a smidgen is considered a huge giveaway. The conventional wisdom is that the banks are the big winners and the regulators are, once again, patsies, capitulating under pressure to the all-powerful financial industry. The headlines tell the story: "Banks Win 4-Year Delay as Basel Liquidity Rule Loosened," Bloomberg declared. The Financial Times splashed, " 'Massive Softening' of Basel Rules." "Bank Regulators Retreat," the Huffington Post said. Reuters described the new regulations as a "light touch."
 Mayra Rodríguez Valladares, a managing principal at MRV Associates, a regulatory consulting firm, put it this way, "With every part of Basel III that is gutted, we are increasingly back where we were at the eve of the crisis." She went on to say, "In today's financial world, regulators pretend to supervise while banks pretend to be liquid."
 But this is a knee-jerk response.
 While there is no question that the original rules would do a better job preventing the next 100-year flood in the banking system, their quick adoption most likely would have created their own drag on the economy because bank lending would most likely have been curtailed.
 "If Basel had been implemented this year as written, it almost certainly would have thrown the U.S. and other economies into a recession more than going over the fiscal cliff ever would have," John Berlau of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a research organization promoting free markets, wrote. Mr. Berlau, who may have a penchant for hyperbole, had been calling the deadline the Basel cliff. He added, "Basel III has been delayed, and for Main Street growth and financial stability, that is all to the good."
Mr. Berlau is right. In truth, the reason that regulators ultimately chose to relax the rules was simple practicality: many banks in Europe and some in the United States would have never been able to meet the requirements without significantly reducing the amount of credit they were to extend to Main Street over the next two years, according to people involved in the Basel decision process.
That's the other side of the regulatory coin that Main Street often forgets about. At the time that the original rules were written in 2010, the consensus among economists was that the global economy would be in much better shape today than it is.
 "Nobody set out to make it stronger or weaker, but to make it more realistic," Mervyn A. King, governor of the Bank of England, explained.
 Let's be clear: high capital requirements are a good thing to do to reduce risk in the system. And there is no question that the banks, especially in the United States, are in a much stronger position than they were. Let's also stipulate that the Basel committee did a horrible job before the financial crisis in setting and enforcing proper standards. Basel's loosening of rules before the crisis that worsened the pain of the global banking system.
But the push for stricter rules just as the global economy is trying to nurse itself back to health, simply to satisfy the public, rather to find a solution that balances the risks to the economy and the banking system, would have been a mistake. The chances of a leverage-induced crisis from Wall Street banks right now is quite low.
The challenge for regulators is making sure their memories aren't so short that they seek to scale back the rules again.
An earlier version of this column misstated the affiliation of John Berlau. He is a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, not the Bastiat Institute.

You've probably heard that starting early is one of the best investing decisions you can make. That's because investing done right is short-term boring but long-term exciting.
The reason? The reality of compound interest. Let me explain.
Many people talk about the power of compound interest. Albert Einstein is rumored to have called it the most powerful force in the universe.
Now, I suspect he probably didn't really say that, but whether he did or not, it's a point that we often miss in the discussion about compound interest. Despite its being one of the most powerful forces in the universe, it's not one of the most exciting - at least in the short term. Nothing really great happens until after years and years of discipline and patience.
Take this silly (but true!) story that's often told to demonstrate how powerful compound interest is: If you start with one penny and double it every day for 30 days, you'll end up with $5,368,709.12.
I should add a disclaimer here that if anyone offers you an investment that will double in value every day, you should run as fast as you can in the other direction. But let's get back to the main point. Sure, compound interest -- whether bank interest or another form of investment -- has a powerful outcome, but it takes an awfully long time to become fun and exciting.
Now take a look at our penny example again. One penny doubled is 2 cents. Two cents turns to $0.04, $0.04 to $0.08, $0.08 to $0.16, $0.16 to $0.32, $0.32 to $0.64, and $0.64 to $1.28. Nothing very exciting there.
But when you stick with it, it's that last few times when the figure doubles that it gets very, very exciting. You're looking at $1,342,177.28 becoming $2,684,354.56, and $2,684,354.56 doubling to $5,368,709.12.
That's the case with our investments, too. It's not very exciting at the beginning, but compounding becomes a powerful force after years of patience and discipline.
Let me give you a real example: Say you have Sarah, who decides at 25 to save $1,000 a month. She does that for 10 years. And then she stops. Then you have Roger, who waits until he's 35, and he saves $1,000 a month for 30 years. They both earn 7 percent on their savings.
Now, 30 years after she stops contributing Sarah would have $1,262,089.05. But Roger, who would have put away three times as much as Sarah, would only have $1,133,529.44.
The reason Sarah only saved a third as much as Roger but ended up with more money is because she started earlier.
But here's what you have to understand: Nothing too incredible happened during that first 10 years that Sarah was saving and Roger wasn't. The exciting part happens years down the road. So we have to be patient and disciplined, counting on the fact that compounding is going to do its work in its own time.
It's kind of like planting an oak tree. As Warren Buffett said in an interview with News Inc, "Someone's sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree long ago." The same thing applies to compound interest. We have to live through the boring parts in order to reap the benefits down the road.
And here's the key. Every day you wait you're not cutting off the flat end of the curve like I've drawn in the sketch. You're cutting off the steep end. You can't skip the boring part and get right to the excitement.
That's why we have to get started investing today.
I know that many of us didn't start early. Maybe you haven't even started yet. But this is an incredibly important concept. If you're 45 and haven't started saving, you don't want to be 55 and in the same (actually a much worse) position. So start now.
It's also an incredibly important concept to share with your kids, your grand kids, or even the neighbor's kids down the block. We have to start teaching them that if they want to enjoy the shade of that oak tree, they better darn well plant the seed now.

 At first glance the willingness of Al Jazeera, the satellite network owned by Qatar, to pay some $500 million for Current TV, Al Gore's struggling channel, seems like a vanity project.

HEADLINE: Foreclosure Settlement Said to Be Imminent

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: A $10 billion settlement on foreclosure abuse claims is expected to be announced as early as Monday. | Banks are given more time to meet global regulations designed to prevent financial crises. | Even with new financial rules, challenges remain in policing fraud. | A former chairman of Citigroup is trying to revive a jazz club in Harlem. 

 BODY:
After weeks of negotiations, a $10 billion settlement over claims of foreclosure abuses by 14 banks is expected to be announced as early as Monday. The deal "covers abuses like flawed paperwork and botched loan modifications," Jessica Silver-Greenberg reports in The New York Times, citing several people with knowledge of the discussions.
All 14 banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup, were expected to sign on to the deal. "An estimated $3.75 billion of the $10 billion is to be distributed in cash relief to Americans who went through foreclosure in 2009 and 2010, these people said," according to The Times. "An additional $6 billion is to be directed toward homeowners in danger of losing their homes after falling behind on their monthly payments." The talks almost fell apart over the weekend when some Federal Reserve officials insisted that banks pay an additional $300 million for their role in the 2008 financial crisis, but the officials ultimately backed down, according to The Times.
At first blush, the settlement looks like "another gift to the banks," The New York Times columnist Gretchen Morgenson writes. "One could easily argue that this reported settlement was pushed by the banks so they could limit the damage they would have incurred if an aggressive review had continued." 
Some housing advocates said the deal would not provide enough relief. "It is still unclear how the monetary relief will be distributed among homeowners, but one immediate result of the settlement is the end of a troubled review of millions of loan files," according to The Times. That program, which mandated that banks hire independent consultants to audit loan files, suffered from mounting costs. Only 323,000 homeowners submitted claims. Ms. Morgenson writes: "Stopping the reviews before they are finished means that the banks will be allowed to claim that abuses were rare and that $10 billion is an adequate penalty."
BANKS GET EASING OF RULES ON ASSETS | A group of the world's top regulators and central bankers on Sunday gave banks more time to meet rules designed to prevent financial crises. The rules, which aim to ensure that banks have enough liquid assets on hand to weather crises, will now take full effect on Jan. 1, 2019, rather than the original deadline of Jan. 1, 2015. The committee, meeting in Basel, Switzerland, also loosened the definition of liquid assets.
"The decision marks the first time regulators have publicly backed away from the strict rules imposed by the Basel Committee in 2010," Jack Ewing reports in The New York Times. Banks had complained that the new guidelines would harm lending. Mervyn A. King, governor of the Bank of England and chairman of the group, said the intention was not to make the rules "stronger or weaker" but rather "more realistic." The decision, which was endorsed unanimously by participants, "was a public concession from the authors of the so-called Basel III rules that the regulations could hurt growth if applied too rigorously," Mr. Ewing writes.
AFTER MADOFF, FRAUD STILL DEFIES POLICING | A wave of rules was enacted after the collapse of Bernard L. Madoff's giant Ponzi scheme in 2008. But there remain "persistent problems with policing the industry," Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Susanne Craig report in DealBook. In one case, a financial adviser named Philip Horn pleaded guilty to defrauding more than a dozen clients and Wells Fargo. His scheme, in which he systematically executed and canceled trades in clients' portfolios, pocketing the profits, went on for more than two years, according to court documents.
"Banks have spent millions of dollars to beef up their compliance systems and improve their oversight," DealBook writes. "Regulators, too, have bolstered their efforts, increasing enforcement and adopting new measures. Every month, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a Wall Street watchdog, penalizes more than 100 brokers for various actions, including unauthorized trading and fraudulent activities, as well as smaller violations."
Thomas Ajamie, a plaintiff's lawyer who represents two of Mr. Horn's clients, said, "Theft, Ponzi schemes and other financial scams continue to happen at an alarming rate."
ON THE AGENDA | 
The J.P. Morgan Health Care Conference kicks off in San Francisco. Richard Kovacevich, Wells Fargo's former chief executive, is on CNBC at 8 a.m. Martha Stewart is on CNBC at 10:45 a.m.
PARSONS TRIES TO REVIVE A JAZZ CLUB | Richard D. Parsons, the former chairman of Citigroup and former chief executive of Time Warner, has always wanted to open a jazz spot in Harlem. He is now trying to make that dream a reality, with an effort to revive Minton's Playhouse, a shuttered dive on West 118th Street, according to The New York Times. Mr. Parsons, who is using his own money, plans to reopen Minton's in its original location, with the addition of a new dinner club alongside. "I took my senior prom date to a place called the Hickory House, and we heard Billy Taylor. And I still remember it. It was my first adventure in being a grown up, to listen to some good jazz," Mr. Parsons said. Such clubs have disappeared, he said, and he aimed to "create that feel."
WOLFE ON THE NEW WALL STREET | The Facebook I.P.O. was the "day Wall Street got vaporized," according to Tom Wolfe, author of the classic 1980s novel "The Bonfire of the Vanities." Mr. Wolfe writes in Newsweek: "After Facebook Day, all that 'Wall Street' had been a metonymy for, the big money, the Big Picture of America's economy, the excitement, the sense that this is where things are happening, was gone." Traders once felt like "Masters of the Universe," a phrase from his novel, Mr. Wolfe writes. "In real life, young men on trading floors all over Wall Street read that book and got a kick out of that name, Masters of the Universe. They said it aloud only in a jocular way - they weren't fools, after all - and never mentioned the wave of exaltation that swept through their very souls."
"In terms of sheer pride," the 2008 crash was "a godsend for the poor Masters of the Universe." Mr. Wolfe refers to the main character of his novel, writing, "Sherman McCoy held his tongue, but what he said to himself was, 'Oh, ye Eunuchs of the Universe.'"

HEADLINE: A World Without Grand Bargains


HIGHLIGHT: What the near-impossibility of a major deal on entitlements and taxes should mean for Republican strategy. 

 BODY:
In my Sunday column defending John Boehner's record as Speaker of the House, I make the point that for all the talk about how much more bipartisan and effective Congress used to be, there really isn't a modern historical precedent for the kind of "everybody hurts" bargain on taxes and entitlements that would actually be required to bring our projected spending in line with our projected revenue. The most plausible recent example of such a bargain is the deal that George H.W. Bush struck with Congressional Democrats in 1990, which brought him so much grief and helped inspire a generation of Republican resistance to tax increases: That compromise promised to cut $500 billion from the deficit over five years, which (per my back-of-the-envelope adjustments for inflation) is the equivalent of about $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction over ten years today. $2.5 trillion is a big number ... but it's only slightly more than the combined deficit reduction promised by last year's debt-ceiling deal and this month's tax increases combined - and that combination, of course, has only put a very modest dent in our long-term deficit problem. 
A true grand bargain today, then, would require both sides accepting much, much more pain than either Bush the Elder's White House or the Democrats were willing to accept twenty-odd years ago, in a significantly less polarized environment. And what would the two parties get for that shared pain? In a sense, shared defeat, as Yuval Levin shrewdly points out:
... the left is trying to avoid a fundamental transformation of the structure of our entitlement programs, since liberals believe the structure of those programs is key to their legitimacy and purpose, and so key to sustaining a just society. The right is trying to avoid a fundamental transformation of the relationship of government and society in American life, since conservatives believe the structure of that relationship is essential to American freedom and prosperity. The left would rather see American life altered (with a significantly larger government, a smaller and less active civil society, and a more consolidated but less dynamic economy) than see our welfare-state institutions reformed. The right would rather see our entitlement system altered (with lumbering universal entitlement programs turned into means-tested and market-based safety-net systems for the elderly and the poor) than see the character of our society transformed.
... Thus, Democrats want more revenue so that the entitlement system doesn't have to be reformed, while Republicans want to reform the entitlement system so that the government doesn't have to take up more of the economy. This means that doing a good deal of each at the same time would not give both parties what they want-it would give both parties what they are trying to avoid.
A grand bargain with far higher taxes in return for a thoroughly transformed entitlement system would give each party the means it is after but at the cost of the end it is after. That would be a foolish bargain for both of them.
Thus Levin writes (and I agree) that truly sweeping changes to either our tax code or our entitlement system are more likely to happen through an election or a series of elections that give one party or the other "enough control of the elected branches to advance its fiscal reforms," rather than through the old-fashioned Washington dealmaking that so many pundits pine for. This means, in turn, that a lot of centrist commentators have essentially unreasonable expectations of what Boehner's speakership could possibly accomplish: He could be Sam Rayburn, Thomas Reed and Tip O'Neill rolled into one, and the prospects for a gamechanging deficit deal would only be marginally improved.
But it means that the conservative expectations that Boehner has been trying manage for the last two years are similarly unreasonable. For a party that only controls the House of Representatives, and owes that control more to where district lines are drawn than to a clear national right-of-center majority, there is simply no lever that will move the other branches of government nearly as much as some on the right seems to believe they can be moved. There might be modest concessions on spending that Republicans can extract in exchange for raising the debt ceiling this winter, for instance - but not concessions that would justify the permanent, economy-unsettling brinksmanship that many conservatives seem to think the party should pursue.
By the same token, precisely because it's to imagine the big bipartisan sell-out that the right so fears actually happening, Republicans can probably afford to entertain more incremental bargains without fretting that any concession will eviscerate conservatism as we know it. The almost-deal that Boehner and Obama were negotiating during the last debt-ceiling impasse, for instance, wouldn't have delivered anything like fiscal stability, but it might well have left conservatives in a slightly better position for the long run - by getting a Democratic White House's buy-in for some entitlement reforms, however modest - than the "tax increases plus nothing" that Republicans just ended up having to accept. (You read my exchange with Levin on this subject from the summer of 2011 here; I think the points I made then look pretty plausible in hindsight.) It's possible that the upcoming negotiations surrounding the sequester might offer a similar opportunity: Trading a modest amount of new revenue from tax reform for the kind of modest Social Security reform that the White House seems willing to contemplate might offer conservatism more in the long run than the scheduled "cuts only" approach, which slashes defense spending but leaves entitlements untouched.
I don't expect the latter deal to happen for the same reason that the former didn't: Not because John Boehner is bad at his job, but because the House caucus he's leading contains too many members whose political self-interest doesn't line up with the big-picture interests of either conservatism or the G.O.P, and because the conservative movement contains too many influential figures who are deluded about just how much leverage their cause currently enjoys. (And also, of course, because Senate Democrats have their own "let's not cut entitlements, ever" incentives, which helped kill the Boehner-Obama deal in 2011 and could easily do the same again.) But Boehner's task would become easier, and D.C. politics somewhat healthier, if conservatives could simultaneously recognize that only a major triumph at the ballot box will deliver the major changes that they're seeking, and that in the mean time there is no shame or surrender in trying to govern as though that triumph might not soon arrive.

Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. She recently edited and contributed to "For Love and Money: Care Provision in the United States." 
The latest fiscal cliffhanger was only one in a series of games of political brinkmanship in Congress that are likely to continue. So it's worth trying to understand the underlying strategic dilemma.
What political and economic factors are making negotiations over the future of government spending increasingly contentious? 
Economists increasingly rely on game theory as a tool for understanding behavior in situations where individual or group actors can't be sure what others are going to do. This is not the kind of theory that informs online games (though you can find plenty of apps that involve little furry animals jumping off or over cliffs). 
Rather, it's a theory that emerged partly out of efforts to understand military conflict and is often explained metaphorically by anecdotes that set the stage for a consideration of the relative payoffs to different possible choices.

In technical terms, the fiscal cliff game fits the description of a "game of chicken" made famous in the 1955 film "Rebel Without a Cause." James Dean plays a young man pressured to prove his manhood by racing his car toward a seaside cliff, in competition with another young man named Buzz. The first one to swerve is a chicken. 
In this game, both lose if they follow the same strategy. In the worst case, they both go over the cliff and die. If they both swerve at once, they are both labeled cowards. Each hopes the other will swerve first. In the film, Buzz tries to jump from his moving car but catches his sleeve and goes over the cliff to certain death. Dean's character jumps clear before his car goes over the cliff (sadly Dean died in a car crash just before the film was released). 
The outcome reminds us that unanticipated events amplify the uncertainty of the game itself. 
Another cinematic illustration, based on two countries threatening each other with nuclear annihilation, is Stanley Kubrick's zany 1964 film "Dr. Strangelove, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," which was influenced by the director's conversations with the game theorist and Nobel Prize-winning economist Thomas Schelling. 
Professor Schelling has emphasized several points in his work that are particularly relevant to budget negotiations, including the advantage of "precommitment" that can persuade other actors to swerve (for instance, pretending to tie the steering wheel of the car in place). Acting crazy or irrational, as though one doesn't care about risk, can also serve as an effective strategy. 
House Republicans, especially Tea Party enthusiasts, did their best to strengthen their side's negotiating position by refusing to accept the compromise that the speaker, John Boehner, brought to them in late December. 
Though a tax deal was approved, one could assert (and some have) that President Obama and the Democrats swerved first, agreeing to compromises that, in historical perspective, reveal significant Republican gains.
This outcome can't be explained by differences in boldness or willingness to take risks. In this game, unlike the classic game of chicken, the payoffs to both players are different. Going over the first fiscal cliff by failing to compromise on tax rates would probably have imposed much greater losses, in the long run, on Democrats than on Republicans. 
True, the Republicans might have taken more blame for economic disruption if a tax-rate agreement had not been struck. But a party that hopes to reduce the role of government also gains from political stalemate and dysfunction, which foster disgust with Congressional partisanship. Republicans have the advantage of being able to undermine the very institution they are elected to. 
Furthermore, lack of a tax rate agreement would almost certainly have hurt Democratic constituents the most, taking the wind out of any economic recovery and driving unemployment up. Republican constituents are generally more prosperous and less vulnerable. The Democratic vehicle, rushing toward the cliff, was full of women, children, the elderly and the unemployed. It had no air bag or golden parachute. No wonder it swerved first. 
The political cliff game, likely to shape the coming debt ceiling debate, is likely to have negative economic consequences, creating uncertainty for both consumers and investors. But causality runs the other way as well, from economics to politics.
Increased inequality of wealth and income reduces the incentives for cross-class cooperation. Our most affluent citizens now have less to gain from cooperation with the rest of us than they once had. They can effectively threaten to opt out and invest elsewhere. They can also invest vast resources in lobbying and electioneering.
As a result, both political parties have altered their strategies. In his book "Unequal Democracy: The Political Economy of the New Gilded Age," the political scientist Larry Bartels of Vanderbilt University offers evidence that "elected officials are utterly unresponsive to the policy preferences of millions of low-income citizens." 
The intensity of partisan disagreement has also increased. James C. Garand of Louisiana State University has published research showing that United States senators from states with high levels of income inequality are more ideologically polarized than other senators. 
The greed-is-good game clearly has the potential to drive democracy itself off the cliff.

HEADLINE: Rescued by Bailout, A.I.G. May Follow a 'Thank You' With a Suit

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
Fresh from paying back a $182 billion bailout, the American International Group has been running a nationwide advertising campaign with the tagline "Thank you America."
Behind the scenes, the restored insurance company is weighing whether to tell the government agencies that rescued it during the financial crisis: thanks, but you cheated our shareholders.
The board of A.I.G. will meet on Wednesday to consider joining a $25 billion shareholder lawsuit against the government, court records show. The lawsuit does not argue that government help was not needed. It contends that the onerous nature of the rescue - the taking of what became a 92 percent stake in the company, the deal's high interest rates and the funneling of billions to the insurer's Wall Street clients - deprived shareholders of tens of billions of dollars and violated the Fifth Amendment, which prohibits the taking of private property for "public use, without just compensation."
Maurice R. Greenberg, A.I.G.'s former chief executive, who remains a major investor in the company, filed the lawsuit in 2011 on behalf of fellow shareholders. He has since urged A.I.G. to join the case, a move that could nudge the government into settlement talks. 
The choice is not a simple one for the insurer. Its board members, most of whom joined after the bailout, owe a duty to shareholders to consider the lawsuit. If the board does not give careful consideration to the case, Mr. Greenberg could challenge its decision to abstain.
Should Mr. Greenberg snare a major settlement without A.I.G., the company could face additional lawsuits from other shareholders. Suing the government would not only placate the 87-year-old former chief, but would put A.I.G. in line for a potential payout.
Yet such a move would almost certainly be widely seen as an audacious display of ingratitude. The action would also threaten to inflame tensions in Washington, where the company has become a byword for excessive risk-taking on Wall Street.
Some government officials are already upset with the company for even seriously entertaining the lawsuit, people briefed on the matter said. The people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, noted that without the bailout, A.I.G. shareholders would have fared far worse in bankruptcy.
"On the one hand, from a corporate governance perspective, it appears they're being extra cautious and careful," said Frank Partnoy, a former banker who is now a professor of law and finance at the University of San Diego School of Law. "On the other hand, it's a slap in the face to the taxpayer and the government."
For its part, A.I.G. has seized on the significance and complexity of the case, which is filed in both New York and Washington. A federal judge in New York dismissed the case, while the Washington court allowed it to proceed.
"The A.I.G. board of directors takes its fiduciary duties and business judgment responsibilities seriously," said a spokesman, Jon Diat.
On Wednesday, the case will command the spotlight for several hours at A.I.G.'s Lower Manhattan headquarters.
Mr. Greenberg's company, Starr International, will begin with a 45-minute presentation to the board, according to people briefed on the matter. Mr. Greenberg is expected to attend, they added.
It will be an unusual homecoming of sorts for Mr. Greenberg, who ran A.I.G. for nearly four decades until resigning amid investigations into an accounting scandal in 2005. For some years after his abrupt departure, there was bitterness and litigation between the company and its former chief.
After the Starr briefing on Wednesday, lawyers for the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York - the architects of the bailout and defendants in the cases - will make their presentations. Each side will have a few minutes to rebut.
While the discussions are part of an already scheduled board meeting, securities lawyers say it is rare for an entire board to meet on a single piece of litigation.
"It makes eminent good sense in this case, but I've never heard of this kind of situation," said Henry Hu, a former regulator who is now a professor at the University of Texas School of Law in Austin.
It is unclear whether the directors are leaning toward joining the case. The board said in a court filing that it would probably decide by the end of January.
Until now, the insurance giant has sat on the sidelines. But its delay in making a decision, some officials say, has drawn out the case, forcing the government to pay significant legal costs.
The presentations on Wednesday come on top of hundreds of pages of submissions that the government prepared last year, a time-consuming and costly process. The Justice Department, which assigned about a dozen lawyers to the case and hired outside experts, told a judge handling the matter that Starr was seeking 16 million pages in documents from the government.
"How many?" the startled judge, Thomas C. Wheeler, asked, according to a transcript.
Struck just days after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, the bailout of A.I.G. proved to be among the biggest and thorniest of the financial crisis rescues. The company was on the brink of collapse because of deteriorating mortgage securities that it had insured through credit-default swaps.
Starting in 2010, the insurer embarked on a series of moves aimed at repaying its taxpayer-financed bailout, including selling major divisions. It also held a number of stock offerings for the government to reduce its stake, which eventually generated a roughly $22 billion profit.
Overseeing that comeback was a new chief executive, Robert H. Benmosche, a tough-talking longtime insurance executive. Mr. Benmosche has won plaudits, including from government officials, for his managing of A.I.G.'s public relations even as he helped nurse the company back to financial health.
But he and the rest of A.I.G.'s board must now confront an equally pugnacious predecessor in Mr. Greenberg.
In the case against the government, Mr. Greenberg, through his lead lawyer, David Boies, contends that the bailout plan extracted a "punitive" interest rate of more than 14 percent. The government's huge stake in the company also diluted the holdings of existing shareholders like Starr, which at the time was A.I.G.'s largest investor.
"The government has been saying, 'We're your friend, we owned and controlled you and we let you go.' But A.I.G. doesn't owe loyalty to the government," a person close to Mr. Greenberg said. "It owes loyalty to its shareholders."
The government, Starr argues, used billions of dollars from A.I.G. to settle credit-default swaps the insurer had with banks like Goldman Sachs. The deal, according to the lawsuit, empowered the government to carry out a "backdoor bailout" of Wall Street.
Starr argued that the actions violated the Fifth Amendment. "The government is not empowered to trample shareholder and property rights even in the midst of a financial emergency," the Starr complaint says.
The Treasury Department declined to comment. A spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Jack Gutt, said, "There is no merit to these allegations." He noted that "A.I.G.'s board of directors had an alternative choice to borrowing from the Federal Reserve, and that choice was bankruptcy."
A federal judge in Manhattan agreed, dismissing the case in November. In an 89-page opinion, Judge Paul A. Engelmayer wrote that while Starr's complaint "paints a portrait of government treachery worthy of an Oliver Stone movie," the company "voluntarily accepted the hard terms offered by the one and only rescuer that stood between it and imminent bankruptcy."
The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit recently agreed to review the case on an expedited timeline. The judge in the United States Court of Federal Claims in Washington, meanwhile, has declined to dismiss the case and continues to await A.I.G.'s decision.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Diagnosis: Battered But Vibrant

BYLINE: By BENEDICT CAREY

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- The neighborhood's best-known restaurants were failing, its crime rate was on the rise, and for the first time that anyone could remember there were foreclosures, with once tidy bungalows sitting empty and dark.
For all that, the social scientists studying Chicago neighborhoods in 2010 were betting that the middle-class enclave of Chatham, on the city's South Side, would remain stable through the recession. It had done so for decades, while surrounded by impoverished areas. It had somehow absorbed a wave of newcomers from recently demolished housing projects. And the researchers' data suggested that its strong identity and scores of active block groups had helped protect residents from larger economic threats and offered clues about how to preserve threatened urban communities all over the country.
Chatham should hold, barring some unforeseen cataclysm.
The cataclysm hit on May 19 of that year. That night, a group of assailants jumped Thomas Wortham IV, an off-duty police officer and Iraq war veteran, as he was leaving his parents' house. He resisted and was shot, bleeding to death on the street where he grew up. 
The entire city seemed to stop for breath, holding a memorial attended by hundreds of fellow police officers and citizens, Mayor Richard M. Daley and Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois.
''We were blindsided by this; blindsided by what happened to Tommy,'' said his mother, Carolyn Wortham. ''And yes, you begin to question everything.''
In Chatham, it seemed, all bets were off. Many residents began to think the unthinkable, that maybe it was time to escape the place they had done so much to build.
The community's response to the crisis would test a theory emerging from an ambitious, nearly decade-long study of all of Chicago's neighborhoods -- that a neighborhood's character shapes its economic future at least as much as more obvious factors like income levels and foreclosure rates.
''If Chatham could maintain its relative stability despite such great challenges,'' said William Julius Wilson, a professor of sociology and social policy at Harvard and the author of the 1987 classic, ''The Truly Disadvantaged,'' ''then I think this concept of a neighborhood effect will be a landmark contribution, helping us understand how to prevent the out-migration of citizens and strengthen neighborhoods'' at risk of falling into poverty.
In the days before he died, Officer Wortham was on an East Coast swing, attending a police memorial service in Washington, and later participating in a fund-raising race in New York. On May 19, he was just back and eager to see his parents, to catch up and show off some photographs from the trip.
Fraying at the Edges
Chatham looked the same as ever, but residents were nervous. The recession seemed to be deepening that spring, and local businesses were hanging on for life. Ken Blow, who runs Bull's Eye Barber Shop on East 79th, said that his revenues were down almost 40 percent in the first years of the downturn. He rented out his office to a tattoo artist to help pay expenses. ''For a while there, we would keep the lights off until our first customer walked in, to save money,'' Mr. Blow said.
Captain's Hard Times Dining, across the street from the barbershop, also saw business dwindle. The owner, known as Mother Wade, said she has had to branch out and do catering to stay open. ''Some of what's going on here is that people are not supporting their own, not sitting down to a meal like we used to do,'' Ms. Wade said. ''They'd rather go eat fast food.''
Older residents, perpetually anxious that the younger generation is losing their values of tidiness and mutual respect, now had visible evidence of social erosion. They saw it in the habits of their new neighbors, many of them moving from the Robert Taylor Homes, which were torn down in the mid-2000s.
''The big change going on is that the grandparents are moving out, and some of the younger kids coming in here are picking up behaviors that you would never have seen in Chatham before,'' said Worlee Glover, a salesman who runs a blog called Concerned Citizens of Chatham. ''Loitering out on 79th. Walking up and down the street, eating out of a bag. Eating out on the porch. Those kinds of things.''
The numbers tell part of the story. Chatham historically had a waiting list of would-be buyers, but during the recession its foreclosure rate was 14th highest among some 80 Chicago neighborhoods, according to data gathered from all of the city's neighborhoods to determine which local factors shape behavior.
''Chatham and neighboring Avalon Park are both working class communities, not core ghetto areas, and both were hit hard by recession, particularly Chatham, which got hit economically and with incidents of violence,'' said Robert J. Sampson, a sociologist at Harvard who led the Chicago study and wrote a recently released book based on it, ''Great American City: Chicago and the Enduring Neighborhood Effect'' (University of Chicago, 2012).
Twice in previous weeks, young men from outside the area had fired shots into the scrum around the basketball courts at Cole Park, just across the street from the Worthams' house. Cole Park, all picnics and playgrounds when Thomas IV was growing up, now resembled a street party on most evenings, with teenagers coming just to hang out, Mrs. Wortham said. Seniors and parents of young children stayed away.
''People came from all over the South Side to play at Cole Park for the very reason that it was a safe park,'' said Thomas Wortham III, his father. ''But it got to where no one was controlling it.''
After a short visit with his parents, the younger Mr. Wortham said goodbye around 11 p.m. As he walked along South King Drive to his motorcycle, he had company: someone approaching fast -- no, two men -- and a car trolling, close by.
The next few moments are snapshots in time. A confrontation over the motorcycle. The elder Mr. Wortham yelling from his porch. Gunshots. The father ducking into the house and back out, now with his own gun. More shots. The screeching of tires as two of the assailants fled.
When it was over, three men were down and bleeding on the 8400 block of King Drive, near the playground, here in the Mayberry of the South Side. One assailant was wounded, another dead. Officer Wortham was beyond help.
''We were up all night,'' Mrs. Wortham said. ''I don't even remember what we did. You just can't believe any of it is happening.''
The police arrived in minutes, and the news spread just as fast. ''When I heard, it hurt me so badly I could barely talk,'' said Keith O. Tate, president of the Chatham Avalon Park Community Council. ''I had no voice. A lot of us who'd been working to preserve the neighborhood thought, 'What are we doing all this for? What on earth are we doing here? Are we done here?' ''
They weren't, and what unfolded in the weeks after Officer Wortham's death was partly foreshadowed in the research done by Dr. Sampson and the Chicago neighborhood research team.
In their surveys, asking residents how highly their neighbors valued and enforced respectful behavior from children, the researchers found that Chatham ranked No. 1, above all other similar neighborhoods. On social cohesion, a measure of how regularly people work together to achieve common goals -- organizing street fairs to raise money for a senior home, for example -- it ranked second among black communities on the South Side, behind Avalon Park, just to the east.
Array of Advantages
Chatham has more than a hundred block groups, citizen volunteers who monitor the tidiness of neighborhood lawns, garbage, and noise, as well as organize events, Mr. Tate said.
The neighborhood has something else that many nearby areas do not: uniformly small buildings. Neat rows of one-story brick bungalows and ranch houses stand shoulder to shoulder, at attention, astride modest commercial strips, with few buildings more than three stories tall.
''This is what I call ecological advantage,'' said criminologist Peter St. Jean, the author of ''Pockets of Crime,'' an analysis of the physical spaces criminals occupy. ''In a community with small buildings -- single family houses, like here, for instance -- it is relatively easy for the old lady next door to walk over and tell you there's trash on your lawn, or to turn down the music. It is much more intimidating to approach troublemakers in a larger apartment building; you don't even know where in the building they live.''
Smaller structures provide another advantage in a recession, Dr. St. Jean said: If a building is vacated and boarded up, it's a small blemish on the face of the community, not a large one. ''You do not see any large empty lots or abandoned buildings in this neighborhood,'' he said.
In the wake of Officer Wortham's death, residents of Chatham didn't wait long to act.
''My own father wanted to go to the park by where Tommy Wortham was killed, just to be there,'' said Mr. Tate, the community council president. ''And I told him no, I didn't want to worry about him falling. He said, 'Look, I'm going, with or without you.' ''
Others felt just as strongly, and soon there was a neighborhood gathering to ''take back the park,'' Mrs. Wortham said. Not long after, about 20 police officers, many former colleagues of the Worthams, father and son, showed up at Cole Park and spent the day, in support. ''It was a hot day, and all I can remember is running back and forth from the house to get water for everyone,'' Mr. Wortham said. ''These were officers from all over the city, not just from here. They organized it themselves.''
It's far too early to say that Chatham has rebounded, but there are encouraging signs. The Bull's Eye barbershop is busy again. The neighborhood successfully lobbied a billboard company to remove a gaudy sign advertising cigarettes, Mr. Glover said. Several new businesses are now thriving, including Garrett Popcorn, a boutique popcorn shop that on most days has lines out the door.
Mr. Tate has started an investment pool with other residents who have the means, to buy up foreclosed houses and sell them to ''people who will make good neighbors.''
And according to an analysis by Dr. Sampson, crime around Cole Park almost stopped in the months after Officer Wortham was killed. Crime crept back up in 2012, especially near the neighborhood's borders, but it has been a violent year in Chicago, with homicides up 16 percent over 2011. The crime rate in Chatham remains well below that of nearby areas.
For the social scientists, these findings apply far beyond Chatham, and beyond Chicago. Other South Side neighborhoods, with similar poverty rates, scored significantly lower on these measures of social cohesion and ''efficacy.'' And these neighborhoods -- West Pullman, to the south, for instance, and Greater Grand Crossing to the north, which has newer developments and more young professionals -- have been slower to rebound from the recession, and crime rates remain elevated. The study seems to have zeroed in on the mostly invisible factors that immunize, or at least help protect, a neighborhood from internal wounds, as well as trauma from global economic convulsions.
''The specific neighborhood has a personality that affects virtually all aspects of social life, the choices we make about where to live, about how much disorder we'll tolerate, about how we raise our kids,'' Dr. Sampson said. ''Large-scale forces like the recession of course matter, but they are moderated by local neighborhood factors, whether you're in Chicago or Stockholm'' or other cities.
The ultimate verdict, for Chatham and for the neighborhood effect, may lie in what the Worthams and people like them do in historically cohesive urban communities threatened by creeping poverty and violence. ''I sure did consider leaving when Tommy was killed,'' Mrs. Wortham said.
She took a deep breath. ''But you know, whenever something like this happens, there's plenty of blame to go around. People want to blame the city, the community organizations, the churches, all that. But nothing changes unless people look after their children, and the neighbors do, too. If people aren't behaving, you say something. When I went to school, if I did something wrong, by the time I got home my mother knew about it.''
So did friends' mothers, Mr. Wortham added. Then he gave her a look: it was time for dinner, and to head for home.
More than two years after their son was killed, the Worthams still live across from the park. For now, like many of their longtime neighbors and friends, they're staying put.
Hanging On: This is the first of two articles that look at hard times through the lens of science. Next week: the psychology of borrowing.

HEADLINE: Richard Cramer, 62, Wrote of Presidential Race

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ; Jennifer M. Preston and Katharine Q. Seelye contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Richard Ben Cramer, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and the author of ''What it Takes,'' a superbly detailed account of the 1988 presidential election considered among the finest books about American politics ever written, died in Baltimore on Monday night. He was 62.
His daughter, Ruby Cramer, said he died of complications from lung cancer at Johns Hopkins University Medical Center. 
Mr. Cramer was born on June 12, 1950, in Rochester, N.Y. He went to Johns Hopkins University as an undergraduate and later studied at Columbia University's Graduate of Journalism. He worked at The Baltimore Sun before joining The Philadelphia Inquirer in the 1970s, where he was a Middle East correspondent from 1977 to 1984. He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1979 for his reporting there.
He went on to write for Sports Illustrated, Rolling Stone and Esquire, where in 1986, he wrote an article, ''What Do You Think of Ted Williams Now?,'' about the iconic baseball player. The article, which seemed to strip Mr. Williams bare and reconstruct him anew in the eyes of his fans, became a hallmark of sports journalism.
''It was often said Ted would rather play ball in a lab, where fans couldn't see,'' Mr. Cramer wrote. ''But he never blamed fans for watching him. His hate was for those who couldn't or wouldn't feel with him, his effort, his exultation, pride, rage, or sorrow.'' But Mr. Cramer will be most remembered for ''What it Takes,'' a 1,000-page, vigorously researched tome that delved into the passions, idiosyncrasies and flaws of George H. W. Bush, Bob Dole, Michael Dukakis, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other candidates as they fought for the presidency in 1988.
As he reported for the book, he spent time with the candidates' family members, college roommates and sometimes even their elementary schoolteachers.
He became close with the candidates themselves and in some cases forged friendships that endured after the election. Mr. Biden later gave him tips on fixing up an old farmhouse that he purchased in Maryland, he said in a 2010 interview with Politico.
''He made no bones about the fact that he became friendly with the people he reported on,'' said his longtime friend Stuart Seidel, an editor at National Public Radio. ''He liked Joe Biden and Bob Dole and both Bushes. He did not feel compromised by allowing himself to get close to them. He did not see himself in a confrontational reportorial role -- he was telling a story.''
The book begins with Mr. Bush, then the vice president, throwing out the first pitch at a Houston Astros game in 1986.
''He'll be cheered by 44,131 fans -- and it's not even a risky crowd, the kind that might get testy because oil isn't worth a damn, Houston's economy is down the crapper, and no one's buying aluminum siding,'' he wrote. ''This is a playoff crowd, a corporate-perks crowd, the kind of fellows who were transferred in a few years ago from Stamford, Conn. You know, for that new marketing thing (and were, frankly, delighted by the price of housing), a solid GOP crowd, tax-conscious, white and polite.''
The book is in many ways the product of a bygone era, before quote approval and a micromanaged press corps, and when minute-by-minute coverage of a presidential campaign or anything else was a technological impossibility.
In a 2011 interview with The New York Times, Mr. Cramer described political journalists in his day as wielding real power, a contrast with now, when campaigns can seem to hold reporters at their mercy.
''Even if you had the wherewithal to embarrass a reporter, there was no mechanism to do it,'' Mr. Cramer said. ''And in most cases, you might as well save your breath because the reporter had no shame anyway.''
''What it Takes'' received poor reviews, and sales were initially poor. Fellow journalists were also slow to see its value. Disappointed, Mr. Cramer never again wrote as prodigiously about politics. Rather, he turned his attention to other interests. He wrote a biography about Joe DiMaggio and returned to the Middle East for a book about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Mr. Cramer lived in Chestertown, Md., with his wife, Joan Cramer, who survives him. He was previously married to Carolyn White, with whom he had his daughter, Ruby Cramer.

HEADLINE: Banks to Pay $8.5 Billion To Speed Up Housing Relief

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
Federal regulators on Monday reached an $8.5 billion settlement with 10 major lenders to resolve claims of foreclosure abuses, including the use of flawed paperwork and bungled loan modifications that may have led to wrongful evictions.
The settlement, which includes the nation's largest lenders, like Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, concludes weeks of negotiations between the banks and the federal regulators, led by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. It is intended to end a troubled foreclosure review of millions of loan files that was mandated by the banking regulators. Among the problems that came to light in the last several years were sloppy record-keeping and so-called robo-signing, in which foreclosures were made based on forged or unreviewed documents.
Notably, four banks - Ally Financial, HSBC, OneWest Bank and Everbank - originally part of the negotiations, didn't sign onto the deal. 
Under the settlement, $3.3 billion in cash relief will go to borrowers who went through foreclosure in 2009 and 2010. The remaining $5.2 billion will be directed to homeowners in danger of losing their homes and will be used to reduce the amount of principal owed or the monthly payments, for example. Payments under the settlement, which covers 3.8 million households, could be as much as $125,000.
Regulators said that borrowers would be contacted regarding relief by March 31.
The pact, which was negotiated over the weekend, almost collapsed after officials from the Federal Reserve demanded that the banks pay an additional $300 million to address their part in the 2008 financial crisis, according to several people briefed on the negotiations who spoke on condition of anonymity.
In the end, the Federal Reserve agreed to back down after the banks threatened to torpedo the deal altogether. By signing on to the settlement, the 10 banks can resolve the outstanding chapter in their wrangling with federal banking regulators over foreclosure-related abuses.
In February, five major mortgage servicers, all included in Monday's settlement, agreed to pay $26 billion under a separate deal with 49 state attorneys general, the Justice Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development after allegations arose in 2010 that bank employees were hastily plowing through documents used in foreclosure proceedings without properly reviewing them for accuracy.
The latest foreclosure settlement was driven, to a large extent, by banking regulators, who decided that a mandatory review of loan files was inefficient, costly and simply not yielding relief for homeowners, the people briefed on the matter said.
The goal in scuttling the reviews, which were mandated as part of a consent order in April 2011, was to provide more immediate relief to homeowners.
The comptroller's office and the Federal Reserve said on Monday that the settlement "provides the greatest benefit to consumers subject to unsafe and unsound mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices during the relevant period in a more timely manner than would have occurred under the review process."
Still, some housing advocates argued that while the settlement would supplant the flawed reviews, it did not go far enough in addressing the harm suffered by homeowners. "If the reviews had been done right the first time, banks would have been on the hook to pay far more to homeowners," said Alys Cohen, staff attorney for the National Consumer Law Center.
Concerns about the effectiveness of the review process, known as the Independent Foreclosure Review, began to mount in December within the upper echelons of the comptroller's office, according to the people with knowledge of the matter. Under the terms of the 2011 consent order, 14 banks had to hire independent consultants to analyze millions of loan records to spot any instances in which the banks might have improperly charged fees, denied loan modifications or wrongfully seized homes from borrowers current on their payments or making reduced monthly payments.
Adding to the alarm, these people said, was that the reviews were taking more than 20 hours for every file, at a cost of up to $250 an hour. Since the start of the review, the banks have spent an estimated $1.5 billion to re-examine their foreclosure paperwork. Yet despite the huge bill, the reviews were not providing any relief to borrowers or turning up meaningful instances where homes of borrowers current on their payments were seized, according to these people.
In a series of private meetings that began last month, regulators approached top bank executives to discuss the reviews. At those meetings, officials from the comptroller's office admitted the reviews were problematic and that the agency had "miscalculated" just how much energy and resources would be required to complete the reviews, according to the people with knowledge of the negotiations.
Even though the officials acknowledged the flawed nature of the reviews, these people said, they used the loan reviews to propel a settlement with the banks. The threat, according to the people with knowledge of the negotiations, was that banks that did not sign onto the settlement would be forced to keep poring through loan files until the reviews naturally concluded.
A majority of the banks, looking to move beyond the cumbersome reviews, agreed to the settlement.
As talks heated up in the last week, regulators sent out e-mails to the consulting firms presiding over the reviews, according to two people with knowledge of the correspondence. The e-mails alerted the firms to begin dismantling the reviews.
So far, roughly 495,000 people have submitted claims for their loan files to be reviewed, far fewer than the 3.8 million loans covered under the review. The relief will be distributed to homeowners even if they did not file a claim for their loan files to be reviewed.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Ada Louise Huxtable, Champion of Livable Architecture, Dies at 91

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Ada Louise Huxtable, who pioneered modern architectural criticism in the pages of The New York Times, celebrating buildings that respected human dignity and civic history -- and memorably scalding those that did not -- died on Monday in Manhattan. She was 91.
Her lawyer, Robert N. Shapiro, confirmed her death. She lived in Manhattan and Marblehead, Mass.
Beginning in 1963, as the first full-time architecture critic at an American newspaper, she opened the priestly precincts of design and planning to everyday readers. For that, she won the first Pulitzer Prize for distinguished criticism, in 1970. More recently, she was the architecture critic of The Wall Street Journal.
''Mrs. Huxtable invented a new profession,'' a valedictory Times editorial said in 1981, just as she was leaving the newspaper, ''and, quite simply, changed the way most of us see and think about man-made environments.'' 
At a time when architects were still in thrall to blank-slate urban renewal, Ms. Huxtable championed preservation -- not because old buildings were quaint, or even necessarily historical landmarks, but because they contributed vitally to the cityscape. She was appalled at how profit dictated planning and led developers to squeeze the most floor area onto the least amount of land with the fewest public amenities.
She had no use for banality, monotony, artifice or ostentation, for private greed or governmental ineptitude. She could be eloquent or impertinent, even sarcastic. Gracefully poised in person, she did not shy in print from comparing the worst of contemporary American architecture to the totalitarian excesses of Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin.
''You must love a country very much to be as little satisfied with it as she,'' Daniel Patrick Moynihan, later a United States senator from New York, wrote in his preface to a 1970 collection of Ms. Huxtable's writings, ''Will They Ever Finish Bruckner Boulevard?''
It was the first of several books whose titles alone conveyed her impatient, irreverent tone. These included ''Kicked a Building Lately?'' (1976) and ''Goodbye History, Hello Hamburger'' (1986).
Though knowledgeable about architectural styles, Ms. Huxtable often seemed more interested in social substance. She invited readers to consider a building not as an assembly of pilasters and entablatures but as a public statement whose form and placement had real consequences for its neighbors as well as its occupants.
''I wish people would stop asking me what my favorite buildings are,'' Ms. Huxtable wrote in The Times in 1971, adding, ''I do not think it really matters very much what my personal favorites are, except as they illuminate principles of design and execution useful and essential to the collective spirit that we call society.
''For irreplaceable examples of that spirit I will do real battle.''
Actually, there was no mistaking what Ms. Huxtable liked -- Lever House, the Ford Foundation Building and the CBS Building in Manhattan; the landmark Bronx Grit Chamber; Boston's City Hall; the East Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington; Pennzoil Place in Houston -- and, even more delectably, what she did not.
''The new museum resembles a die-cut Venetian palazzo on lollipops,'' she wrote in 1964 about the Gallery of Modern Art at 2 Columbus Circle. Her description came to be synonymous with the structure itself, ''the lollipop building,'' and was probably more familiar to New Yorkers than the name of the architect: Edward Durell Stone.
The long-abandoned gallery has since been substantially altered as the Museum of Arts and Design. It might be argued that Ms. Huxtable's lollipop epithet helped doom preservationists' later efforts to save the original facade. But Mr. Stone's romantic brand of monumental modernism was never to her liking.
''Albert Speer would have approved,'' she said in 1971 about his Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, linking Mr. Stone indirectly to the Nazis' chief architect. ''The building is a national tragedy. It is a cross between a concrete candy box and a marble sarcophagus in which the art of architecture lies buried.''
This was a far cry from the fawning coverage of new buildings that Ms. Huxtable deplored in the newspapers of the 1950s. And it was welcomed.
Ada Louise Landman was born on March 14, 1921, to Leah Rosenthal Landman and Dr. Michael Louis Landman. She grew up in Manhattan in a Beaux-Arts apartment house, the St. Urban, at Central Park West and 89th Street, and wandered enthralled through Grand Central Terminal, the Museum of Natural History and the Metropolitan Museum.
She attracted notice in The Times at an early age with her stage-set designs for Hunter College productions of ''The Yellow Jacket'' in 1940 and ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' in 1941. After graduating from Hunter in 1941, she attended New York University's Institute of Fine Arts. But her most treasured academic home was probably the Avery Architectural Library at Columbia University.
Out of school, she was hired by Bloomingdale's to sell a furniture line with works by Eero Saarinen and Charles Eames. ''Many young architects and designers made the obligatory tour of the rooms,'' she recalled. ''One of them noticed and married me.''
That was L. Garth Huxtable, an industrial designer. He took many of the photographs that illustrated his wife's books. The couple also collaborated in designing tableware for the Four Seasons restaurant, which opened in 1959 in the Seagram Building. Mr. Huxtable died in 1989. Ms. Huxtable left no immediate survivors.
Ms. Huxtable was assistant curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art from 1946 to 1950. She was a Fulbright fellow, studying Italian architecture and design in 1950-52, and a Guggenheim fellow in 1958. She had also begun writing for architectural journals.
In 1958 she addressed a broader audience in The New York Times Magazine with an article criticizing how newspapers covered urban development. ''Superblocks are built, the physiognomy and services of the city are changed, without discussion,'' Ms. Huxtable wrote. ''Architecture is the stepchild of the popular press.''
Five years later she was invited to become a critic by Clifton Daniel, then assistant managing editor of The Times. Though architectural commentary was not new -- a line could be traced, largely in magazines, to the 19th century through Aline B. Saarinen, Lewis Mumford, Montgomery Schuyler and others -- Ms. Huxtable was being asked to write full time for a general-interest newspaper.
''At first she turned him down, saying daily journalism would disrupt her private life,'' Nan Robertson wrote in her 1992 book ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men and The New York Times.'' ''Daniel looked elsewhere, assiduously, but in his own words, 'I couldn't find anyone better than she was.' ''
Ms. Robertson said Ms. Huxtable followed in the tradition of the foreign affairs columnist Anne O'Hare McCormick: ''so good they could not be ignored by the men who ran the establishment, and so personally assertive that they would not be ignored.''
For her part Ms. Huxtable said The Times made a ''brave gamble'' in the ''belief that the quality of the built world mattered, at a time when environment was still only a dictionary word.''
Feared by some architects, loathed by some developers and not universally admired by scholars, Ms. Huxtable was nonetheless ''a darling of the public,'' Robert A. M. Stern, Thomas Mellins and David Fishman wrote in ''New York 1960,'' published in 1995.
Her exacting standards were well enough known to be a punch line for a New Yorker cartoon by Alan Dunn in 1968. It shows a construction site so raw that only a single steel column has been erected. A hard-hat worker holding a newspaper tells the architect, ''Ada Louise Huxtable already doesn't like it!''
In 1969 the Pulitzer Prizes were expanded to include an award for distinguished criticism or commentary. The first, in 1970, was split by the judges between Ms. Huxtable for criticism and Marquis W. Childs of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch for commentary. She was the second woman, after Mrs. McCormick, 33 years earlier, to win a Pulitzer for The Times. In 1973 she was the second woman ever named to the Times editorial board. (Mrs. McCormick had been the first.) She was succeeded as the daily architecture critic by Paul Goldberger but continued to write about architecture in a Sunday column. She left The Times when she was appointed a MacArthur Fellow in 1981. In her wake, architectural criticism became a staple at big newspapers and grist for subsequent Pulitzer Prizes.
''Before Ada Louise Huxtable, architecture was not a part of the public dialogue,'' Mr. Goldberger said in 1996.
Ms. Huxtable was the author of 11 books. ''Four Walking Tours of Modern Architecture in New York City'' (1961), included a characteristic critique of the Pan Am Building, which was then being built directly behind Grand Central. (It is now the MetLife Building.)
Rather than aesthetics, Ms. Huxtable focused on how the tower would alter the scale of Park Avenue, adding ''an extraordinary burden to existing pedestrian and transportation facilities.'' She continued, ''Its antisocial character directly contradicts the teachings of Walter Gropius, who has collaborated in its design.''
When The Times named her a critic, Ms. Huxtable was working on a six-volume series on New York City architecture. Only the first volume, ''Classic New York: Georgian Gentility to Greek Elegance,'' was published, in 1964.
In it, she extolled not just lovely Greek Revival temples but also mongrelized houses from the early 1800s. ''They rank as 'street architecture' rather than as 'landmarks,' '' she said. ''Their value is contrast, character, visual and emotional change of pace, a sudden sense of intimacy, scale, all evocative qualities of another century.''
Her interest in preservation did not make her an enemy of modernity. In ''The Tall Building Artistically Reconsidered: The Search for a Skyscraper Style'' (1984), Ms. Huxtable said the glass curtain-wall skyscraper, epitomized by the work of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, offered ''a superb vernacular, probably the handsomest and most useful set of architectural conventions since the Georgian row house.''
What infuriated her were ''authentic reproductions'' of historical architecture and ''surrogate environments'' like Colonial Williamsburg and master-planned communities like the Disney Company's Celebration, Fla. ''Private preserves of theme park and supermall increasingly substitute for nature and the public realm, while nostalgia for what never was replaces the genuine urban survival,'' she wrote in ''The Unreal America: Architecture and Illusion'' (1997).
Ms. Huxtable's last book, in 2008, was ''On Architecture: Collected Reflections on a Century of Change.'' And her last column, published in The Journal on Dec. 3, 2012, concerned the impending reconstruction of the New York Public Library eliminating the central stacks. Typically enough, it was titled, ''Undertaking Its Destruction.''
Ultimately, however, what animated and sustained her were not the mistakes but the triumphs. As she said of New York City in The Times in 1968:
''When it is good, this is a city of fantastic strength, sophistication and beauty. It is like no other city in time or place. Visitors and even natives rarely use the words urban character or environmental style, but that is what they are reacting to with awe in the presence of massed, concentrated, steel, stone, power and life.''

HEADLINE: France Orders a Popular Internet Provider to Stop Blocking Online Ads

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
PARIS -- In a potential test case for Europe, the French government on Monday ordered a big Internet service provider to stop blocking online advertisements, saying the company had no right to edit the contents of the Web for users.
The dispute has turned into a gauge of how France, and perhaps the rest of Europe, will mediate a struggle between telecommunications providers against Internet companies like Google, which generate billions of dollars in revenue from traffic that travels freely on their networks.
European telecommunications companies want a share of that money, saying they need it to finance investments in faster broadband networks -- and, as the latest incident shows, they are willing to flex their muscles to get it.
Until now, European regulators have taken a laissez-faire approach, in contrast to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, which has imposed guidelines barring operators of fixed-line broadband networks from blocking access to sites providing lawful content. 
On Monday, Fleur Pellerin, the French minister for the digital economy, said she had persuaded the Internet service provider, Free, to restore full access. The company, which has long balked at carrying the huge volume of traffic from sites owned by Google without compensation, had moved last week to block online ads when it introduced a new version of its Internet access software.
''An Internet service provider cannot unilaterally implement such blocking,'' Ms. Pellerin said at a news conference Monday, after meetings with online publishing and advertising groups, which had complained about a possible loss of revenue.
While she acknowledged that it could be annoying ''when five ads pop up on a site,'' she added that advertising should not be treated differently from other kinds of content. ''This kind of blocking is inconsistent with a free and open Internet, to which I am very attached.''
While rejecting the initiative by Free, Ms. Pellerin said it was legitimate for the company to raise the question of who should pay for expensive network upgrades to handle growing volumes of Internet traffic.
French Internet analysts said advertisements appearing on Google-owned sites or distributed by Google appeared to have been the only ones affected -- fueling speculation that the move was a tactic to try to get Google to share some of its advertising revenue with Internet service providers. Google's YouTube video-sharing site is the biggest bandwidth user among Internet companies.
Google was not represented at the meetings Monday with Ms. Pellerin. In an interesting twist, its case was effectively argued by other Web publishers, including French newspapers, even though these sites, in a related dispute, are seeking their own revenue-sharing arrangement with Google. Separately, French tax collectors are also looking into the company's fiscal practices, under which it largely avoids paying corporate taxes in France by routing its ad revenue through Ireland, which has lower rates. One proposal that has been discussed would be to use receipts from a tax on Google to support local Web sites.
In yet another dispute involving Free and Google, the French telecommunications regulator is investigating complaints that the Internet provider has been discriminating against YouTube. In that case, a French consumer organization, UFC-Que Choisir, said it suspected that Free was limiting customer access to YouTube because of the high amount of bandwidth that the site consumed.
Ms. Pellerin said these issues would be examined separately. Still, the timing of Free's move raised questions, given that it came only days before a scheduled meeting among Ms. Pellerin, Internet companies and telecommunications operators to discuss the financing and regulation of new, higher-speed networks.
''Should users be held hostage to these commercial negotiations? That is not obvious to me,'' said Jérémie Zimmermann, a spokesman for La Quadrature du Net, a group that campaigns against restrictions on the Internet.
European telecommunications companies have the right to manage the flow of Internet content that travels on their networks, by favoring, for example, tiny e-mail messages over bandwidth-heavy videos. They say such network traffic control is essential, as online video takes up ever more of their capacity, especially at peak hours.
But Internet companies like Google say all traffic should be treated equally, an idea known as net neutrality.
In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission in 2010 imposed regulations requiring telecommunications companies to uphold this principle, at least in general terms. The decision stemmed from fears that without rules guaranteeing net neutrality, broadband providers could favor certain Internet content and reject other material, based on business agreements or even political whims.
These concerns were heightened by the unusual structure of the U.S. broadband business, in which telecommunications companies often have local monopolies or duopolies, giving consumers little choice over their provider.
In Europe, by contrast, broadband competition is rampant. Regulators at the European Commission in Brussels and at the national level have said this is sufficient to prevent abuses or censorship. If one service provider were to cut off access to certain content, regulators have said, consumers could simply switch to another network.
Competition has also driven down the price of access in Europe, but this means that network operators have less profit to invest in upgrades. The French government has estimated the cost of rolling out high-speed fiber-optic networks to 50 percent of the country's territory at &#x20ac;25 billion, or about $33 billion, over 15 years.
Some European video sharing sites have contributed to the cost of equipment that Internet service providers need to carry huge volumes of video traffic. But Google, which has maintained a studied silence throughout the dispute with Free, has balked at subsidizing Internet service providers or online publishers.
UFC-Que Choisir said it hoped that the latest twist in the dispute between Free and Google had demonstrated the inadequacy of existing net neutrality protections. Instead, the group is campaigning for legislation.
''More than ever, the public authorities must act in 2013 to guarantee consumers a neutral, quality Internet,'' wrote Alain Bazot, the president of UFC-Que Choisir.
Free, which is controlled by a French technology entrepreneur, Xavier Niel, has attracted 5.2 million broadband customers, roughly 25 percent of the French market, with a &#x20ac;20-a-month offer that undercut established providers like France Télécom, the former national phone monopoly. It is the second-largest broadband provider in France, after France Télécom.
While Mr. Niél is considered an outsider in French business circles, he drew closer to the establishment two years ago when, with two business partners, he bought a controlling stake in the newspaper Le Monde.
Free declined to comment on the meeting with Ms. Pellerin, who hinted that the company might still get something out of the dispute, despite her order to restore advertising.
''What is the financial incentive for operators to invest billions in their networks without seeing any return?'' she said. ''We have to put in place a win-win system.''

HEADLINE: Military in Greece Is Spared Cuts

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY

 BODY:
BERLIN -- The euro crisis has not been good for NATO's secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen. Mr. Rasmussen has used every occasion to cajole alliance members into investing and collaborating more in defense.
He said recently that allied defense expenditures had declined by more than $56 billion compared with 2009. Practically all of those cuts happened in Europe, reducing defense spending there by an average of 15 percent.
Speaking at a meeting of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly in Prague, Mr. Rasmussen added that among the European allies, ''only two devoted more than 2 percent of the gross domestic product to defense.'' 
One of those countries was Greece.
That seems astonishing given that Greece is in a deep economic and financial crisis. Greece's economy has shrunk by 25 percent over the past two years.
During that time, the middle and lower classes -- not the rich business community -- have been hit hardest. The International Monetary Fund and the European Commission have imposed stringent austerity measures in return for loan guarantees. As a result, pensions and health care, transportation and education have all been cut drastically.
The armed forces, so far, have gotten away relatively lightly. During the height of the global financial crisis of 2008, Greek defense expenditures accounted for 3.1 percent of gross domestic product. Over the past two years, Greek defense spending still amounted to 2.1 percent of G.D.P.
''In relative terms, defense expenditure has been reduced given how much gross domestic product has fallen,'' said Alexander S. Kritikos, an economics professor at the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin.
''But the defense budget is still very high. It has been largely insulated from the huge cutbacks borne by the middle classes and poorer people,'' he added.
Last August, the &#x20ac;10 billion, or $13 billion, defense budget was trimmed by &#x20ac;516 million. Even at that, Greece is the second-biggest defense spender among the 27 NATO countries after the United States, according to NATO statistics.
More than 73 percent of its budget is for personnel costs alone, making it one of the highest among NATO allies. Furthermore, military and civilian personnel account for 2.7 percent of Greece's total labor force during, also making it one of the highest in NATO, according to alliance figures.
It is particularly hard to see how the armed forces can justify the current budget, as the money is not spent on supporting NATO or E.U. missions. According to the latest figures from the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, Greece has 10 soldiers based in Afghanistan, out of a total of 102,011 troops from 50 countries.
In its neighborhood, Greece has 118 soldiers serving in NATO's stabilization mission in Kosovo, out of a total of 5,565 troops from 30 contributing countries.
NATO does not publicly comment about any ally. But officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Greek government has not used the financial crisis to overhaul its armed forces by making the purchase of military equipment transparent, or reducing the personnel count of 136,000, of whom 90,000 are soldiers.
Curiously, the Greek public, which has often protested against the austerity measures, has yet to demand that the armed forces carry some of the burden. One reason, analysts say, is Greece's residual fear of Turkey, a leading NATO member -- despite the improvement of relations between the two countries over the past decade.
''It's all very well calling for deeper defense cuts, but geography still matters. Certain fears still run deep,'' said Tomas Valasek, president of the Central European Policy Institute, a security think tank in Bratislava, Slovakia.
Other analysts agree that the Greek armed forces can always resist big defense cuts by playing the Turkey card. ''The generals will always have an excuse to keep the budget high,'' Mr. Kritikos said.
Indeed, over the past several months, the Greek media have written that Turkey violated Greek airspace at least once. In response, the Turkish General Staff said its airspace had been repeatedly violated by Greece, Italy and Israel.
There is another political reason for exempting the army from cuts. Closing some of the 500 military bases and 17 training centers would mean sending tens of thousands of young soldiers into the ranks of the unemployed, adding a dangerous component to social unrest, according to Sipri, a Swedish research institute. Perhaps, analysts said, the Greek armed forces will have to wait for any major restructuring until the country's economy picks up.

HEADLINE: Iranian Oil Minister Concedes Sanctions Have Hurt Exports

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE; Thomas Erdbrink contributed reporting from Tehran.

 BODY:
Iran's oil minister acknowledged for the first time on Monday that petroleum exports and sales had fallen by at least 40 percent over the past year, contradicting his previous denials and providing an unusual public admission that the cumulative impact of Western economic sanctions has grown more severe.
The acknowledgment by the oil minister, Rostam Qasemi, came as new restrictions from the sanctions are threatening to further choke Iran's ability to sell oil, its most important export. Under provisions of an American law that take effect in February, importers of Iranian oil that have been exempted from the sanctions cannot send the money used to buy it to Iran without risking penalties in the United States. The result could impound billions of dollars' worth of Iran's expected oil revenue in the banks of those importing countries. 
Additional punitive measures, which President Obama signed into law last week, broaden the roster of blacklisted Iranian industries to include all energy, shipping and shipbuilding enterprises and seek to restrict barter transactions that Iran has been using to circumvent earlier sanctions. Some critics of the new steps say they nearly amount to a trade embargo.
In another consequence of the sanctions' impact, the Oil Ministry on Monday stopped the sale of jet fuel to Iran's heavily indebted domestic airlines unless they pay cash. The semiofficial Mehr news agency reported that most commercial airline flights inside the country had been canceled as a result.
Mr. Qasemi, a former Revolutionary Guards commander who was appointed oil minister more than a year ago, had consistently asserted that Iran had no problem selling its oil. In September, in an address to the Parliament, he said that oil exports were rising, despite outside data that showed a sharp drop. At other times, he has threatened to halt all oil exports in retaliation for the sanctions, apparently in a vain effort to raise oil prices by frightening global oil traders.
Both the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Iran is a major member, and the International Energy Agency, a group of mostly Western oil-importing countries, have reported that Iran's crude exports fell to roughly a million barrels a day by the end of 2012, compared with 2.4 million a year earlier.
Other Iranian officials have said it is clear that the country's oil exports have suffered.
Economists knowledgeable about Iran's sanctions problems said Mr. Qasemi's acknowledgment of the export decline, made at a parliamentary meeting on finances, was inevitable because the government must find a way to fill a large gap in the budget -- a gap that revenue from oil exports had been expected to fill.
The Iranian Students' News Agency quoted the minister as telling lawmakers that ''there has been a 40 percent decrease in oil sales and a 45 percent decrease in repatriating oil money.'' The agency also quoted him as forecasting further decreases without specifying how much.
''It's common knowledge in Iran that oil exports have fallen,'' said Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, an economics professor at Virginia Tech, who visited his native Iran last month. ''I don't know if the oil minister had been in denial.''
Dr. Salehi-Isfahani suggested that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's government might have to resolve the budget deficit problem with an accounting maneuver that would recalculate the value of Iran's oil sales at half the official foreign-exchange rate -- 25,000 rials per dollar instead of the central bank's artificial rate of 12,260 rials per dollar.
That change would be much closer to the rial's actual value and essentially double the amount -- in rials -- gained from Iranian oil exports. But such a move would also concede the sanctions' severe inflationary impact, which has caused a steep fall in the value of the Iranian currency this past year.
Many Iranians have suffered from the rial's decline, which has essentially made them poorer by raising the price of imported goods. Iran's inflation also has left many Iranian businesses unable to pay wages or bills. The problem surfaced in a new way on Monday with the abrupt cancellation of domestic flights by Iranian airlines, which had been buying fuel on credit.
The head of the Airlines Association, Seyyed Abdol Reza Musavi, told Mehr that flights in Tehran, Kish, Mashhad and other airports had been halted because the carriers failed to repay their debts, and that fuel would now be provided ''on a cash-only basis.'' It was unclear how long the flight suspensions would last.
The sanctions on Iran have been intensifying for the past few years because of its disputed nuclear program, which Iran says is for peaceful use but which Western countries and Israel suspect is meant to develop the ability to make nuclear weapons.

HEADLINE: Cautious Day Pulls S.&P. From Its 5-Year High

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Investors started the week cautiously on Monday, pulling the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down from the five-year high it reached Friday.
The decline occurred after traders appeared to be cashing in on some gains from the stock market surge last week, said Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ.
Investors are also preparing for the latest corporate earnings reports, which will begin Tuesday, Mr. Stovall said. 
''You can summarize it as profit taking and preparation,'' he said. ''Investors are digesting some of those gains from last week and positioning themselves so they're not too far extended if fourth-quarter earnings slip a bit.''
The S.& P. 500 fell 4.58 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 1,461.89.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 50.92 points, or 0.4 percent, to 13,384.29, while the Nasdaq composite index slipped 2.84 points, or 0.1 percent, to 3,098.81.
The S.& P. 500 gained 4.6 percent last week after the government reported that hiring held up in December during the budget negotiations in Washington, with employers adding 155,000 jobs.
Investors started the year encouraged after lawmakers ended an impasse to pass a bill to avoid automatic government spending cuts and tax increases. The law passed on New Year's Day avoided the full force of the budget cuts, which could have dragged the economy into a recession.
Investors are now focusing on corporate profits. Alcoa, the leading aluminum producer, will start the earnings season for the fourth quarter of 2012 after the market closes on Tuesday.
Analysts forecast that companies in the S.& P. 500 will report that quarterly earnings increased 3.3 percent compared with a year earlier, according to S&P Capital IQ. But the events of the last three months of 2012, including Hurricane Sandy, the presidential election and worries about the narrowly avoided fiscal impasse, could make for surprises.
JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and others banks agreed to pay $8.5 billion to settle federal complaints that they had foreclosed on people who should have been allowed to stay in their homes. Bank stocks ended the day little changed.
In a separate agreement, Bank of America settled with Fannie Mae, the government-owned mortgage finance company, over mortgage investments that lost value during the real estate crash. Bank of America shares fell 2 cents, or 0.2 percent to $12.09.
Among the stocks making big moves, Boeing fell $1.56, or 2 percent, to $76.13 after a 787 Dreamliner jet caught fire on the ground Monday morning at Logan International Airport in Boston.
Archer Daniels Midland, the crop-processing company, dropped 4 percent to $28.01. Analysts at JP Morgan Chase said the continuing drought in the Midwest would most likely squeeze the company's profit margins.
Lowe's, the home improvement retailer, fell 82 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $34.76 after the money-management firm Canaccord cut its rating on Lowe's to sell from hold, saying that efforts to improve stores and sales would not be successful.
Stock in the drugstore chain Walgreen Company gained 85 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $38.03 after a Jefferies & Company analyst. Scott A. Mushkin, raised his rating on the company to buy from hold, saying its profits could benefit from flu season, Medicare drug plans and President Obama's health care overhaul.
In the bond market, the price of the 10-year Treasury note ended unchanged from Friday at 97 17/32, and its yield was also unchanged at 1.90 percent.
The yield on the note hit an eight-month high of 1.97 percent in intraday trading on Friday, according to prices from Tradeweb, an operator of fixed-income markets.

HEADLINE: New Funds Help Revive A Theater In St. Paul

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
The Penumbra Theater Company in St. Paul, a leading African-American theatrical organization whose financial woes forced the cancellation of shows and the trimming of staff last year, has raised enough money to resume programming on a limited basis, Penumbra officials announced Monday.
The company took in $359,000 during an emergency fund-raising campaign that ended Dec. 31, allowing it to plug a $340,000 budget shortfall and to mount a production in March of ''Spunk,'' George C. Wolfe's adaptation of stories by Zora Neale Hurston. But long-term challenges remain, notably finding new sources of money to offset shrinking foundation and corporate support. 
While trimming its coming seasons to three productions (from as many as five), Penumbra plans to bolster the business savvy of its directors and focus more on education programs.
''What we're trying to do is have a diverse kind of revenue stream,'' Lou Bellamy, the theater's founder and artistic director, said by telephone. ''There will always be a gap, but we have to fill it with workshops or whatever.'' The problems faced by Penumbra -- founded in 1976 and long a home for artists like August Wilson (a founding member) -- are emblematic of those facing many arts groups that were built by or rose to prominence under a galvanizing personality. Intiman Theater in Seattle, which rose to national prominence under Bartlett Sher, winning a regional theater Tony Award in 2006, has drastically scaled back its offerings since he left in 2010, following years of expanding budgets and inconsistent fund-raising made worse by the fiscal crisis of 2008.
Times have been especially hard for even high-profile black theaters like Penumbra, which last September laid off 6 of its 16 full-time employees and trimmed $800,000 from its $2.7 million budget. The National Black Theater in New York City had been threatened by foreclosure but was able to resolve its problems in June.
''Black theaters and culturally and ethnically specific theaters, for whatever reason, have had a harder time maintaining economic stability,'' said Teresa Eyring, executive director of Theater Communications Group, a national organization for nonprofit professional theaters. ''Sometimes the contributed support has not been as strong as it needs to be, and we actually need to place a stronger focus on theaters like Penumbra.''
Those familiar with black theater companies cite difficulties in attracting board members with stellar connections and business know-how, a failure to tap wealthy African-Americans, and losing out to bigger companies when it comes to corporate and foundation support.
Kate Barr, the executive director of Nonprofits Assistance Fund, a consultant and financing source in the Upper Midwest, called the fund-raising effort ''a major victory.''
''They demonstrated that they can pull together the board, the supporters and staff to talk about themselves differently,'' said Ms. Barr, whose group is working with Penumbra. ''It's not a matter of finding a magic bullet but finding a different way of spending the money you bring in.''
The Penumbra's emergency fund-raising campaign attracted donations from more than 1,400 individuals, corporations and foundations, according to Chris Widdess, the managing director. The 3M Company is donating the services of a team of strategists to help analyze ways that Penumbra can make money. Penumbra has pledged to develop a seven-year business plan by the end of June. Mr. Bellamy, 68, said that he planned to step down in the next couple of years, and that Penumbra is developing a succession plan.
''There will be a new structure, but anything that allows us to maintain our role as authentic interpreters of the African-American experience is a good thing,'' Mr. Bellamy said from Ashland, Ore., where he is directing Wilson's ''Two Trains Running'' at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival starting next month.
Penumbra has always prided itself on community engagement. With its 250-seat theater inside a community center, Penumbra's rehearsals are generally open to the public. Its productions come with free study guides, and its Summer Institute trains young people.
''Spunk'' is its lone offering for the season, which generally runs September through May. The first production of the next season, in September, will be a collaboration with the Arizona Theater Company and the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. The show, still unannounced, would open in Tucson, go to Phoenix and then to Minneapolis. Such co-productions, often presented in larger halls (like the Guthrie's 1,100-seat main stage), have been a way for Penumbra to save money and reach a larger audience.

HEADLINE: Growth of Health Spending Stays Low

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- National health spending climbed to $2.7 trillion in 2011, or an average of $8,700 for every person in the country, but as a share of the economy, it remained stable for the third consecutive year, the Obama administration said Monday.
The rate of increase in health spending, 3.9 percent in 2011, was the same as in 2009 and 2010 -- the lowest annual rates recorded in the 52 years the government has been collecting such data. 
Federal officials could not say for sure whether the low growth in health spending represented the start of a trend or reflected the continuing effects of the recession, which crimped the economy from December 2007 to June 2009.
Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, said that ''the statistics show how the Affordable Care Act is already making a difference,'' saving money for consumers. But a report issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, in her department, said that the law had so far had ''no discernible impact'' on overall health spending.
Although some provisions of the law have taken effect, the report said, ''their influence on overall health spending through 2011 was minimal.''
The recession increased unemployment, reduced the number of people with private health insurance, lowered household income and assets and therefore tended to slow health spending, said Micah B. Hartman, a statistician at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
In the report, federal officials said that total national spending on prescription drugs and doctors' services grew faster in 2011 than in the year before, but that spending on hospital care grew more slowly.
Medicaid spending likewise grew less quickly in 2011 than in the prior year, as states struggled with budget problems. But Medicare spending grew more rapidly, because of an increase in ''the volume and intensity'' of doctors' services and a one-time increase in Medicare payments to skilled nursing homes, said the report, published in the journal Health Affairs.
National health spending grew at roughly the same pace as the overall economy, without adjusting for inflation, so its share of the economy stayed the same, at 17.9 percent in 2011, where it has been since 2009. By contrast, health spending accounted for just 13.8 percent of the economy in 2000.
Health spending grew more than 5 percent each year from 1961 to 2007. It rose at double-digit rates in some years, including every year from 1966 to 1984 and from 1988 to 1990.
The report did not forecast the effects of the new health care law on future spending. Some provisions of the law, including subsidized insurance for millions of Americans, could increase spending, officials said. But the law also trims Medicare payments to many health care providers and authorizes experiments to slow the growth of health spending.
''The jury is still out whether all the innovations we're testing will have much impact,'' said Richard S. Foster, who supervised the preparation of the report as chief actuary of the Medicare agency. ''I am optimistic. There's a lot of potential. More and more health care providers understand that the future cannot be like the past, in which health spending almost always grew faster than the gross domestic product.''
Evidence of the new emphasis can be seen in a series of articles published in The Archives of Internal Medicine, now known as JAMA Internal Medicine, under the title ''Less Is More.'' The series highlights cases in which ''the overuse of medical care may result in harm and in which less care is likely to result in better health.''
Total spending for doctors' services rose 3.6 percent in 2011, to $436 billion, while spending for hospital care increased 4.3 percent, to $850.6 billion.
Spending on prescription drugs at retail stores reached $263 billion in 2011, up 2.9 percent from 2010, when growth was just four-tenths of 1 percent. The latest increase was still well below the average increase of 7.8 percent a year from 2000 to 2010.
Federal officials said the increase in 2011 resulted partly from rapid growth in prices for brand-name drugs.
Prices for specialty drugs, typically prescribed by medical specialists for chronic conditions, have increased at double-digit rates in recent years, the government said. In addition, spending on new brand-name drugs -- those brought to market in the previous two years -- more than doubled from 2010 to 2011, driven by an increase in the number of new medicines.
''In 2011,'' the report said, ''spending for private health insurance premiums increased 3.8 percent, as did spending for benefits. Out-of-pocket spending by consumers increased 2.8 percent in 2011, accelerating from 2.1 percent in 2010 but still slower than the average annual growth rate of 4.7 percent'' from 2002 to 2008.

HEADLINE: Nuclear Accidents

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''The Next Chernobyl?,'' by Khosrow B. Semnani and Gary M. Sandquist (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Jan. 3), rightly calls attention to the Bushehr nuclear power facility in Iran and raises important issues regarding operational safety. 
Nuclear safety is clearly of utmost import, and everything should be done to ensure that the facility is optimally designed and operated and that there is appropriate emergency response planning. However, the writers imply that there have been catastrophic consequences of the Chernobyl and Fukushima accidents.
That is not the case. Let's focus on adverse health consequences. There were 31 immediate deaths of emergency personnel and reactor workers at Chernobyl and none at Fukushima. Many experts predict relatively few radiation-related health consequences from Chernobyl (aside from about 7,000 cases of nonfatal thyroid cancer in children, which were mostly preventable if they had avoided contaminated milk), and even fewer from Fukushima.
We do not wish to trivialize these health effects, but, for example, the 80-year projected death rate from Chernobyl will likely be far less than the annual death rate from motor vehicle accidents in the United States. What is more important is the tremendous social, psychological and economic impact of these accidents.
This is hard to measure in the former Soviet Union, but Japan incurred its first trade deficit in 20 years after the Fukushima accident. We are right to worry about Bushehr -- a nuclear accident anywhere is a nuclear accident everywhere -- but we need to keep the potential health consequences in perspective.
ROBERT PETER GALE ERIC LAX Los Angeles, Jan. 3, 2013
Dr. Gale is a physician with expertise in radiation accidents. He and Mr. Lax are co-authors of the forthcoming ''Radiation: What It Is, What You Need to Know.''

HEADLINE: Easing of Rules For Banks Acknowledges Reality

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
When a global committee of regulators and central bankers agreed to a new set of rules for the banking system a year and a half ago, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, told The Financial Times, "I'm very close to thinking the United States shouldn't be in Basel anymore. I would not have agreed to rules that are blatantly anti-American."
Over the last weekend, Mr. Dimon finally got what he had wanted: a form of deregulation of sorts. The new international capital requirements for banks, known as Basel III - apologies if your eyes are glazing over - were significantly relaxed by regulators. 
Instead of requiring banks to maintain, by 2015, a certain amount of assets that can quickly be turned into cash, the most stringent deadline was pushed to 2019. Perhaps more important, the type of assets that could be counted in a bank's liquidity requirement was changed to be more flexible, including securities backed by mortgages, for example, instead of simply sovereign debt.
This sounds boring, but it is important stuff. Increasing bank capital and liquidity requirements - think of it as the size of a bank's rainy day fund - is arguably more significant than all of the new laws in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The more capital a bank is required to hold, the lower the chance it could suffer a run on the bank like Lehman Brothers did in 2008.
Given memories of the financial crisis, the idea that regulators would loosen rules even a smidgen is considered a huge giveaway. The conventional wisdom is that the banks are the big winners and the regulators are, once again, patsies, capitulating under pressure to the all-powerful financial industry. The headlines tell the story: "Banks Win 4-Year Delay as Basel Liquidity Rule Loosened," Bloomberg declared. The Financial Times splashed, " 'Massive Softening' of Basel Rules." "Bank Regulators Retreat," the Huffington Post said. Reuters described the new regulations as a "light touch."
Mayra Rodríguez Valladares, a managing principal at MRV Associates, a regulatory consulting firm, put it this way, "With every part of Basel III that is gutted, we are increasingly back where we were at the eve of the crisis." She went on to say, "In today's financial world, regulators pretend to supervise while banks pretend to be liquid."
But this is a knee-jerk response.
While there is no question that the original rules would do a better job preventing the next 100-year flood in the banking system, their quick adoption most likely would have created their own drag on the economy because bank lending would most likely have been curtailed.
"If Basel had been implemented this year as written, it almost certainly would have thrown the U.S. and other economies into a recession more than going over the fiscal cliff ever would have," John Berlau of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a research organization promoting free markets, wrote. Mr. Berlau, who may have a penchant for hyperbole, had been calling the deadline the Basel cliff. He added, "Basel III has been delayed, and for Main Street growth and financial stability, that is all to the good."
Mr. Berlau is right. In truth, the reason that regulators ultimately chose to relax the rules was simple practicality: many banks in Europe and some in the United States would have never been able to meet the requirements without significantly reducing the amount of credit they were to extend to Main Street over the next two years, according to people involved in the Basel decision process.
That's the other side of the regulatory coin that Main Street often forgets about. At the time that the original rules were written in 2010, the consensus among economists was that the global economy would be in much better shape today than it is.
"Nobody set out to make it stronger or weaker, but to make it more realistic," Mervyn A. King, governor of the Bank of England, explained.
Let's be clear: high capital requirements are a good thing to do to reduce risk in the system. And there is no question that the banks, especially in the United States, are in a much stronger position than they were. Let's also stipulate that the Basel committee did a horrible job before the financial crisis in setting and enforcing proper standards. Basel's loosening of rules before the crisis that worsened the pain of the global banking system.
But the push for stricter rules just as the global economy is trying to nurse itself back to health, simply to satisfy the public, rather to find a solution that balances the risks to the economy and the banking system, would have been a mistake. The chances of a leverage-induced crisis from Wall Street banks right now is quite low.
The challenge for regulators is making sure their memories aren't so short that they seek to scale back the rules again.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Why Hagel Was Picked

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Americans don't particularly like government, but they do want government to subsidize their health care. They believe that health care spending improves their lives more than any other public good. In a Quinnipiac poll, typical of many others, Americans opposed any cuts to Medicare by a margin of 70 percent to 25 percent.
In a democracy, voters get what they want, so the line tracing federal health care spending looks like the slope of a jet taking off from LaGuardia. Medicare spending is set to nearly double over the next decade. This is the crucial element driving all federal spending over the next few decades and pushing federal debt to about 250 percent of G.D.P. in 30 years. 
There are no conceivable tax increases that can keep up with this spending rise. The Democrats had their best chance in a generation to raise revenue just now, and all they got was a measly $600 billion over 10 years. This is barely a wiggle on the revenue line and does nothing to change the overall fiscal picture.
As a result, health care spending, which people really appreciate, is squeezing out all other spending, which they value far less. Spending on domestic programs -- for education, science, infrastructure and poverty relief -- has already faced the squeeze and will take a huge hit in the years ahead. President Obama excoriated Paul Ryan for offering a budget that would cut spending on domestic programs from its historical norm of 3 or 4 percent of G.D.P. all the way back to 1.8 percent. But the Obama budget is the Ryan budget. According to the Office of Management and Budget, Obama will cut domestic discretionary spending back to 1.8 percent of G.D.P. in six years.
Advocates for children, education and the poor don't even try to defend their programs by lobbying for cutbacks in Medicare. They know that given the choice, voters and politicians care more about middle-class seniors than about poor children.
So far, defense budgets have not been squeezed by the Medicare vice. But that is about to change. Oswald Spengler didn't get much right, but he was certainly correct when he told European leaders that they could either be global military powers or pay for their welfare states, but they couldn't do both.
Europeans, who are ahead of us in confronting that decision, have chosen welfare over global power. European nations can no longer perform many elemental tasks of moving troops and fighting. As late as the 1990s, Europeans were still spending 2.5 percent of G.D.P. on defense. Now that spending is closer to 1.5 percent, and, amid European malaise, it is bound to sink further.
The United States will undergo a similar process. The current budget calls for a steep but possibly appropriate decline in defense spending, from 4.3 percent of G.D.P. to 3 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
But defense planners are notoriously bad at estimating how fast postwar military cuts actually come. After Vietnam, the cold war and the 1991 gulf war, they vastly underestimated the size of the cuts that eventually materialized. And those cuts weren't forced by the Medicare vice. The coming cuts are.
As the federal government becomes a health care state, there will have to be a generation of defense cuts that overwhelm anything in recent history. Keep in mind how brutal the budget pressure is going to be. According to the Government Accountability Office, if we act on entitlements today, we will still have to cut federal spending by 32 percent and raise taxes by 46 percent over the next 75 years to meet current obligations. If we postpone action for another decade, then we have to cut all non-interest federal spending by 37 percent and raise all taxes by 54 percent.
As this sort of crunch gradually tightens, Medicare will be the last to go. Spending on things like Head Start, scientific research and defense will go quicker. These spending cuts will transform America's stature in the world, making us look a lot more like Europe today. This is why Adm. Mike Mullen called the national debt the country's biggest security threat.
Chuck Hagel has been nominated to supervise the beginning of this generation-long process of defense cutbacks. If a Democratic president is going to slash defense, he probably wants a Republican at the Pentagon to give him political cover, and he probably wants a decorated war hero to boot.
All the charges about Hagel's views on Israel or Iran are secondary. The real question is, how will he begin this long cutting process? How will he balance modernizing the military and paying current personnel? How will he recalibrate American defense strategy with, say, 455,000 fewer service members?
How, in short, will Hagel supervise the beginning of America's military decline? If members of Congress don't want America to decline militarily, well, they have no one to blame but the voters and themselves.

HEADLINE: Japan Is Weighing Raising Military Spending

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan's new conservative government announced a review of national military strategy on Monday that analysts said was aimed at offsetting China's growing military power and that may increase defense spending for the first time in a decade. 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ordered his government to replace the nation's five-year military spending plan and to review defense guidelines adopted in 2010 by the left-leaning Democratic Party, which his party defeated in elections last month. Those guidelines called for gradual reductions in defense spending, and in the size of Japan's military, particularly in the number of tanks and infantry members.
Mr. Abe had promised during the election campaign to strengthen the military to defend Japan's control of islands in the East China Sea that are also claimed by China.
Mr. Abe did not release details of his intent on the military revisions, but news reports said the replacement plan would probably reverse the Democrats' cuts, starting with a 120 billion yen, or $1.4 billion, increase in the military budget in the 2013 fiscal year, which begins in April. That would be the first increase in Japanese military spending since 2002, as the nation has tightened its belt during a long economic decline.
The reports said the new spending plan, proposed by members of Mr. Abe's governing Liberal Democratic Party, would seek to increase the number of ground troops, strengthen air and sea defenses around the disputed islands, and buy new early-warning aircraft to guard against Chinese intrusions near the islands, as well as missile launchings by North Korea.
The reports said the plan could also include financing for a feasibility study on acquiring Osprey aircraft, American vertical-takeoff transport planes whose introduction last year to a Marine airfield on Okinawa set off protests. The Osprey can fly farther and faster than Japan's current helicopters, allowing its troops to more easily reach the disputed islands, known as the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China.
Despite a decade of defense cuts, analysts said Japan last year had the world's sixth-largest military budget, spending 4.65 trillion yen, or $53.3 billion, on defense. Japan has one of the largest and most advanced militaries in Asia, though it has kept a low profile to avoid stirring bitter memories of its early-20th-century empire building.
Mr. Abe's efforts to raise Japan's military profile in the region are intended not only to bolster his nation's declining influence, but also to help an economically ailing ally, the United States, counter China's rising military prowess.

HEADLINE: American Group Begins Private Trip to North Korea

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- Bill Richardson, the former governor of New Mexico, led a private delegation including Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman, to North Korea on Monday, a controversial trip to a country that is among the most hostile to the Internet. 
Mr. Richardson, who has visited North Korea several times, called his four-day trip a private humanitarian mission and said he would try to meet with Kenneth Bae, a 44-year-old South Korean-born American citizen who was arrested on charges of ''hostile acts'' against North Korea after entering the country as a tourist in early November.
''I heard from his son who lives in Washington State, who asked me to bring him back,'' Mr. Richardson said in Beijing before boarding a plane bound for Pyongyang. ''I doubt we can do it on this trip.''
In a one-sentence dispatch, the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency confirmed the American group's arrival in Pyongyang, calling it ''a Google delegation.''
Mr. Richardson said his delegation planned to meet with North Korean political, economic and military leaders, and to visit universities.
Mr. Schmidt and Google have kept quiet about why Mr. Schmidt joined the trip, which the State Department advised against, calling the visit unhelpful. Mr. Richardson said Monday that Mr. Schmidt was ''interested in some of the economic issues there, the social media aspect,'' but did not elaborate. Mr. Schmidt is a staunch proponent of Internet connectivity and openness.
Except for a tiny portion of its elite, North Korea's population is blocked from the Internet. Under its new leader, Kim Jong-un, the country has emphasized science and technology but has also vowed to intensify its war against the infiltration of outside information in the isolated country, which it sees as a potential threat to its totalitarian grip on power.
Although it is engaged in a standoff with the United States over its nuclear weapons and missile programs and habitually criticizes American foreign policy as ''imperial,'' North Korea welcomes high-profile American visits to Pyongyang, billing them as signs of respect for its leadership. It runs a special museum for gifts that foreign dignitaries have brought for its leaders.
Washington has never established diplomatic ties with North Korea, and the two countries remain technically at war after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce.
But Mr. Richardson's trip comes at a particularly delicate time for Washington. In the past weeks, it has been trying to muster international support to penalize North Korea for its launching last month of a long-range rocket, which the United States condemned as a violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions banning the country from testing intercontinental ballistic missile technology.
North Korea has often required visits by high-profile Americans, including former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, before releasing American citizens held there on criminal charges. Mr. Richardson, who is also a former ambassador to the United Nations, traveled to Pyongyang in 1996 to negotiate the release of Evan Hunziker, who was held for three months on charges of spying after swimming across the river border between China and North Korea.

HEADLINE: Tax Increases and Bull Markets

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Hard data shows that increases in tax rates often precede a strong bull market, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of "The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform - Why We Need It and What It Will Take." 
Many years ago, I was talking to Jack Kemp, for whom I worked in the 1970s. He told me that just before George H.W. Bush signed into law the 1990 tax increase, which Kemp strenuously opposed, he made an appointment to see Bush and made a last-ditch effort to get him to reject the legislation. Kemp was then serving as secretary of housing and urban development. 
Kemp told me that Bush told him the legislation would stimulate the economy, which was then suffering from a recession that began in July 1990. The expansion of the 1980s, Bush said, didn't begin until Ronald Reagan signed the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982. Kemp was incredulous.
Tefra, as the Reagan tax increase was called, remains the largest peacetime tax increase in American history. Kemp, despite his love for Reagan, opposed it in Congress, asserting that it would tank the economy, which was still in recession.
I laughed when Kemp told me his Bush story, because that was what he expected me to do. But in the back of my mind, I thought Bush was right.
The economic recovery did begin almost exactly when Tefra took effect.

I recalled this incident last week when the stock market rose sharply after the passage of the tax deal, which raised the top income tax rate and the rate on capital gains and dividends. This is the opposite of what should have happened according to Republican doctrine, which holds that the tiniest increase in tax rates, especially on the rich, is economically devastating.
That got me thinking about the impact of other tax increases in history. A little research showed that sharp increases in the stock market have often followed big tax increases.
For example, in 1932 Herbert Hoover enacted a large tax increase to stabilize federal finances devastated by the Great Depression, which began in 1929. Among other things, the 1932 tax increase raised the top federal income tax rate to 63 percent from 25 percent. But the Dow Jones industrial average increased sharply in 1933, rising 69 percent.
The Dow remained flat for the next several years and then took a sharp jump beginning in 1935. Intriguingly, 1935 just happens to be the year Franklin D. Roosevelt rammed a big tax increase on the rich through Congress. In his message to Congress on June 19, 1935, he emphasized that no wealthy person became wealthy alone, but only in cooperation with many others:
Wealth in the modern world does not come merely from individual effort; it results from a combination of individual effort and of the manifold uses to which the community puts that effort.
The top federal income tax rate rose to 79 percent beginning in 1936, from 63 percent. Yet the Dow was up 48 percent in 1935 and another 25 percent in 1936.
Anyone following standard supply-side advice would have sold everything the day Roosevelt sent his message to Congress. But anyone buying that day would have made 50 percent on their money by the end of 1936 if they did as well as the Dow.
World War II led to further tax increases. The really big one came in 1942 and raised revenues by 70 percent, 5 percent of the gross domestic product. The Revenue Act of 1942 was the largest tax increase in American history.
Someone following supply-side theory would undoubtedly have anticipated a stock market crash from such a large tax increase. In fact, an enormous boom followed, despite further large tax increases in 1943, including the institution of tax withholding. From early 1942 through the end of 1945, the Dow doubled, and a supply-sider would have lost out on one of the great bull markets in history.
Fast forward to 1982. Tefra passed the House and Senate on Aug. 19; the Dow closed at 838.57. By the end of the year, it was up to 1,075.70, an increase of 28 percent. The market continued to rise through 1983, closing at 1,258.64.
Bush signed the 1990 budget deal on Nov. 5 of that year, and the Dow closed at 2,502.23. By the end of 1992, the Dow was up 32 percent. Anyone following supply-side theory would have missed yet another bull market.
As most adults are old enough to remember, the 1993 tax increase, which was opposed by every Republican in Congress on the grounds that it would devastate the economy, initiated one of the greatest bull markets in history.
The 1993 legislation raised the top federal income tax rate to 39.6 percent from 31 percent - a huge destruction of incentives for the wealthy,
according to Republican doctrine. It was signed into law on Aug. 10 of that year and the Dow closed at 3,572.73. But by the end of 1993, it was up to 3,754.09, and by the end of 1996 had risen to 6,448.26, a three-year increase of 72 percent.
According to Republican legend, the market didn't take off until Republicans in Congress cut the capital gains tax in 1997. While much of the bull market did come after 1997, there is no denying that Republican predictions about the effect of the 1993 tax increase were dead wrong.
I'm not going to pretend that tax increases always lead to bull markets or that tax cuts have no effect. I'm saying only that the relationship between taxes, on the one hand, and the economy and the stock market, on the other, is vastly more complex than simplistic Republican dogma would have us believe.
Clearly, there are times when a tax increase sets in motion positive economic forces, like deficit reduction or a more expansionary monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, that overwhelm whatever negative effects may result from higher taxes. The precise impact can only be determined by careful analysis unencumbered by dogmatic beliefs not anchored in empirical results.
Insofar as taxes affect the market, I have long suspected that when tax rates are low they make it too easy for investors to get an adequate after-tax return. When rates rise, they must work harder for a higher before-tax return to compensate for the higher taxes. This pushes money into growth sectors.
I'm not prepared to predict that the great bull market of the 2010s began on Jan. 2. But I do know that anyone who thinks tax increases never precede a bull market is wrong. History proves that.

HEADLINE: New Leader for Slow Food USA

BYLINE: JULIA MOSKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Richard McCarthy, the new executive director, co-founded the Crescent City Farmer's Market in New Orleans. 

 BODY:
Slow Food USA, the American chapter of the global Slow Food organization based near Turin, Italy, has hired a new executive director. The group has been without a national leader since Josh Viertel left in May, after a period filled with internal strife over its mission. 
Richard McCarthy, its new leader, was a co-founder of the Crescent City Farmers Market in New Orleans in 1995. As its director, he also leads Market Umbrella, a nonprofit "mentor" organization that advises 1,250 public markets on working with farmers, shoppers, chefs, communities and regulatory officials. 
The question of whether Slow Food should exist in order to celebrate the pleasures of the table, or to advocate for food justice and biodiversity, has dogged the group since it began here in 2001. Mr. McCarthy believes that because food has a special place in American culture, Slow Food can and should do both. "Food is the sweet spot between tradition and innovation, rich and poor, old and young, denim and white linen," he said in an interview (the last refers to farms and restaurants). 
In an interview, Mr. McCarthy said that the core values of the Slow Food global organization - that everyone has the right to good, clean and fair food - would not change under his leadership . But he said the American conversation about food has broadened to include new players, new problems and new solutions. "Slow Food cannot only address the sad and difficult news about food," he said, like childhood obesity, dwindling farm communities and inadequate food safety. "Our mission will remain the same, but our effectiveness will grow."
Mr. McCarthy will move from New Orleans to Brooklyn, where Slow Food USA is based, and assume the post on Jan. 22. Here is more of my interview with him about the future of Slow Food and his plans to lead the organization.
 Q. 
 Many members believe that Slow Food USA missed its chance to engage the larger American public, and is already perceived to be out of the conversation on food. How do you plan to overcome that, and why will you succeed where your predecessors haven't?
 A. 
 It's interesting. Everywhere I travel in my work to grow the capacity of local communities to reclaim some control over the food systems in their regions, I meet Slow Food members. So I don't see Slow Food USA missing its chance to engage the larger American public at all. At some point, I stopped counting how many Slow Food members I'd meet who were working behind the scenes to grow markets, build gardens, change food policies, etc.
During this difficult economic period of nonprofit soul-searching and business model rethinking, some of the pillar organizations haven't even survived the financial realities. And interestingly enough, the ones that have grown -- Wholesome Wave, Fair Food Network, for instance -- are so deeply rooted in the values of good, clean and fair food for all. I find hope in that.
During my tenure, will Slow Food USA be where both leaders as well as vulnerable families come home to Slow Food for nourishing ideas and comfort? I have been asking myself those same questions. I have a great deal to learn as I step out from beneath the umbrella of the farmers' markets into the wider food conversations. I will approach this larger venue with the same instincts that have served me well in the rough-and-tumble place where commerce meets community at markets: listen and build trust.
 Q. 
 Why hasn't Slow Food USA held a national meeting since Slow Food Nation in 2008?
 A. 
 There actually was a national meeting, last year, in Louisville. It was a gathering of local volunteer leaders from across the country. It wasn't a large public event like Slow Food Nation, and with travel dollars melting away from individual and organizational budgets, it's hard to say what scale and tone works in this day and age. Big meetings aren't always better.
I heard marvelous things about last year's gathering in Louisville. In Slow Food's DNA is a proclivity to convene - and I certainly hope that we will be convening people who touch the food system at various points of the delivery from field to fork, as well as those who don't get to touch it enough.
 Q. 
 What is your biggest priority for Slow Food USA?
 A. 
 My biggest priority is to assure its members that the house is standing on solid values, and to assure partners and supporters that you can count on us to be there for them to grow a good, clean and fair food system that serves everybody. I look forward to providing support to Slow Food members and to chapters so that they can become more effective. I hope we can cultivate leaders who listen, who build bridges and who possess the skills to creatively address the conditions that prevent our food system from providing decent livelihoods for farmers, food access for all consumers and the cultural assets that define a sense of place for communities.

HEADLINE: The Child Who Made My Belly Hurt

BYLINE: ALEXANDRA HARNEY


HIGHLIGHT: How can Japan be so obsessed with aging demographics yet so behind on obstetrics and gynecology? 

 BODY:
TOKYO - When it comes to women, Japan is an outlier compared with other highly industrialized countries: It lags regarding women's roles in politics and business, in the salary gap between the genders - and in obstetrics and gynecology. 
Less than 3 percent of Japanese women use pain relief during delivery, according to the Ministry of Health and Welfare, compared with 50 percent in the United States and at least 75 percent in France. And only about 3 percent of Japanese women undergo amniocentesis or other genetic screening during prenatal exams, compared with 64 percent in California, according to Eriko Sase, an adjunct professor at the University of Tokyo's Graduate School of Medicine. 
Often, Japanese doctors don't even mention genetic tests or pain relief. At least one hospital in Tokyo has gone so far as to impose a "no epidural" policy, presumably as part of its emphasis on natural deliveries.
The lack of options for pregnant women is particularly bizarre given Japan's demographic crisis. The country's fertility rate has been below the level needed to replace the population since the mid-1970s. Over the next quarter century, the proportion of elderly will rise from nearly one in four to one in three.
Japan's laggardly status is the result of both supply and demand. Hospitals, including at least one with a neonatal intensive-care unit, have been pulling out of the delivery business altogether. There's also a shortage of obstetricians and anesthesiologists, as well as of doctors who specialize in newborn care, nurses familiar with newborns, midwives and emergency physicians. The higher risk of lawsuits and longer, more unpredictable working hours drive Japanese medical students into easier lines of work - dermatology and cosmetic surgery, for example.
Salary caps on income earned through the national health care system also discourage students from specializing in women's medicine. It's easier to supplement your income by charging more for additional private services as a plastic surgeon than as an obstetrician or anesthesiologist. At the same time, female OB-GYNs often quit or stop delivering babies after they have their own children.
The shortage of OB-GYNs got so bad several years ago that "childbirth refugees" - expectant mothers forced to roam from hospital to hospital in search of a doctor who could deliver their baby - briefly became a national issue. Although the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology has stepped up its recruitment efforts and is trying to find ways to help female obstetricians keep practicing, the industry association admits that doctor shortages are still a serious problem with deep cultural roots.
Yasuhiro Tanaka, an OB-GYN and founder of the Tanaka Women's Clinic in Tokyo, claims to have been the first doctor in Japan to offer epidurals in the 1970s. He believes that the low incidence of pain relief offered to women in Japan is a reflection of the arrogance of the Japanese medical profession. "Medicine is a service industry," he said. "Doctors here don't understand that." 
Apparently, some patients may not either. Japanese women refer to their offspring as onaka wo itameta ko ("the child who made my belly hurt"), and many subscribe to the idea that good mothers are forged only through the pain of childbirth. This embrace of pain dovetails with Japan's nearly universal ethos of gaman, or perseverance during tough times.
"It's a cult," said Mika Kanai, a 43-year-old marketing manager of a cosmetics brand and a mother of one who put her son in an international kindergarten in part because of the level of competition and expectation of conformity among the mothers of children in a Japanese kindergarten. "Japanese women consider suffering a virtue."
Birth practices are always specific to a culture, but in this case culture may be preventing Japan from addressing its economy's largest structural problem: a shrinking work force. Surely a country that is serious about raising its fertility rate would make it easier for expecting mothers to get proper medical care.

HEADLINE: Flag Protest Reignites Northern Ireland Strife

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: A dispute over flying the British flag has sparked a new round of rioting by Northern Ireland loyalists that threatens the province's fragile recovery from a legacy of sectarian conflict. 

 BODY:
LONDON - The Northern Ireland city of Belfast was clearing up on Tuesday after a fifth straight night of rioting by British loyalists that has brought an ugly reminder of decades of sectarian violence that afflicted the province.
The latest unrest, in which police used baton rounds to confront protestors wielding gasoline bombs, hatchets and sledge hammers, marked a further escalation in growing reaction to a decision of the Belfast council to restrict the flying of the British union flag over City Hall.
Northern Ireland has been broadly at peace - and out of the headlines - since a U.S.-brokered peace process culminated in the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement. 
The accord ended 30 years of conflict that divided the territory's loyalist Protestant and nationalist Catholic communities and cost 3,500 lives. 
There are now fears that Protestant extremists and far-right groups are exploiting the flag protest to stir up a loyalist population that feels abandoned by the mainstream Protestant politicians who share power with nationalists in the Northern Ireland government.
The unrest was spurred by a decision of the city council in early December to end the practice of flying the union flag every day and to reserve its display for special days, such as the birthdays of members of the British royal family.
The decision, supported by the moderate Alliance Party, fell between the demands of nationalists, who wanted to ban the flag completely at City Hall, and those of loyalists who demanded its retention. 
Loyalists took to the streets, protesting that the restriction was another assault on their British heritage that stemmed from a peace process they believe has served republican nationalist interests more than their own.
The first protests prompted a call for calm from Hillary Rodham Clinton, the U.S. Secretary of State, who said during a visit to Belfast on Dec. 7 that the violence was "a sad reminder, unfortunately, that - despite how hardy the peace has been - there are still those who not only would test it, but try to destroy it."
As mainstream Protestant leaders accused the protestors of playing into the hands of nationalist republicans, the police in Northern Ireland this week blamed the loyalist paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force (U.V.F.) for stoking the unrest.
Britain First, a small ultra-right movement based on the British mainland, has meanwhile claimed to be at the forefront of supporting what it describes as peaceful flag protests.
Matt Baggott, head of the Northern Ireland police, said on Monday that children as young as 10 had been involved in attacking police in successive nights of rioting centered in the Protestant neighborhood of east Belfast.
More than 60 police officers have been injured and, on Saturday night, gunfire was directed at police lines. Mainstream politicians have received death threats, and a Belfast journalist received a bullet in the mail.
Some commentators have stressed that a small minority is responsible for the unrest. "The vast majority of people in Northern Ireland want no part of this violence," the Belfast Telegraph said in an editorial Tuesday. "They have endured too much to see the fragile peace snatched away from them." 
Northern Ireland has been slowing recovering from the legacy of sectarian strife. However, business leaders fear the latest unrest will undermine its economic regeneration.
David Cameron, the British prime minister, last year chose the Northern Ireland resort of Lough Erne, a 90-minute drive from Belfast, to host a summit of the Group of Eight major economies in June.
He said the gathering, which is due to be attended by, among others, President Barack Obama, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, would be "an opportunity to let the world see what a fantastic place Northern Ireland is."
The people of the province are hoping he did not speak too soon.

HEADLINE: A Bull in Stocks, but a Bear for Free Speech

BYLINE: BILL BISHOP


HIGHLIGHT: Expectations among investors and others are high for change under Xi Jinping, but he appears to be facing his first major test with the public blowup over the censoring of the liberal newspaper Southern Weekend. 

 BODY:
The Shanghai stock market isofficially in bull territory, having climbed just over 20 percent since early December. Economists' forecasts for 2013 economic growth are for the most part cautiously positive, though heavy with caveats about calls for economic reforms. 
 Expectations are high for change under Xi Jinping, who in his first eight weeks in office has undertaken an effective campaign to signal that he is serious about fighting corruption, forcing officials to be more accountable and less imperious, building the rule of law, improving people's livelihoods and pushing forward with economic reforms. 
Rising expectations are good so long as they are fulfilled. Mr. Xi appears to be facing his first major test with the public blowup over the censoring of Southern Weekend, a liberal newspaper in Guangdong Province, the destination of Mr. Xi's recent inspection tour widely seen as signaling homage to Deng Xiaoping and commitment to serious economic reform.
The censorship was widely discussed online and led to protests from the newspaper's employees that rapidly spread throughout Chinese social media. The physical protests were tiny - a few hundred people - but thevirtual expressions of outrage and support have been huge.
Ren Zhiqiang, one of the most outspoken businessmen in China with almost 13 million followers, tweeted on Sina Weibo, "Freedom of press and freedom of speech are rights given to the society and the people by the constitution; they are also symbols of human rights and freedom. Yet they have become pipe dreams without the rule of law, being seriously distorted and restricted. If truth is not allowed to be spoken, would truth disappear?"
In what in China counts as a remarkable act of defiance, some top news sites used acrostics on their front pages to spell out messages of support for Southern Weekend. News sites wererequired to run an editorial on the issue from The Global Times, though several major portals made their displeasure known by adding a disclaimer at the bottom of the piece saying in part that "it does not represent the opinions of this Web site."
Coincidentally, Qin Xiao, a princeling and former chairman of the giant China Merchants Group, is to give a talk in the United States this week in which he is expected to say:
Growing pressure from the Chinese public will force the new Xi Jinping administration to turn the world's most populous country to the path of political and economic reform...[and] that his country must guard against any ''self-delusion'' that China's unique combination of a roaring economy and uncompromising political dictatorship can be sustained.
 A HOPEFUL RESOLUTION to the Southern Weekend situation might be that Mr. Xi realizes the benefits of listening to the liberal media and netizens and renounces the actions around censorship of the Southern Weekend editorial. 
But Mr. Xi and other officials may believe that giving any ground on this issue would open the flood gates to many other aggressive calls for change that, while couched in support for the Communist Party and the Constitution, in reality would likely undermine the Party's rule. 
Mr. Xi increasinglylooks to be a staunch Dengist, meaning he believes in pursuing major economic reform while maintaining the unchallenged rule of the Communist Party.
Loosening controls on the media flies in the face of the Party's decades of focus on ideological work and propaganda control. One or more midlevel officials involved in this mess may need to be sacrificed for expediency, but significant change is unlikely.
Without change, however, an expectations gap for many Chinese will continue to grow. 
China is having its coldest winter in 28 years, and while investors may be enjoying a winter bull market, is it sustainable without a spring?

HEADLINE: Examining the Terms of A.I.G.'s Bailout

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: A lawsuit contends that the government treated the shareholders of American International Group too harshly when carrying out its 2008 rescue of the insurance giant. But a closer look at the $182 billion rescue suggests a different picture. 

 BODY:
The American International Group's former chief executive, Maurice R. Greenberg, is contending in a lawsuit that the government treated the company's shareholders too harshly when carrying out its 2008 rescue of the insurance giant. But a closer look at the $182 billion rescue suggests a different outcome. 
Soon after the bailout, the Treasury Department substantially softened the terms of its support. This lenience made life a lot easier for A.I.G. - and arguably benefited shareholders like Mr. Greenberg.
A.I.G. is weighing whether to join the lawsuit, filed by Mr. Greenberg's investment firm, Starr International Company. A.I.G. most likely will not end up joining forces with Mr. Greenberg, but, as a duty to shareholders, it has to at least give his suit a thorough assessment. 
 One of Starr International's major arguments is that A.I.G.'s bailout terms were far tougher than those granted to other large financial firms. But A.I.G.'s cash needs and internal failings were in many ways far more serious than those of other institutions. In fact, the company was in such dire straits after the rescue that the government chose to loosen the terms of its aid.
The concessions were considerable. 
In early 2009, the Federal Reserve cut the interest rate on a big loan to A.I.G. At the time, the company said that would save it $1 billion a year in interest. 
The Treasury Department made another favorable change. It exchanged $40 billion of preferred shares for new ones that effectively paid no cash dividends to taxpayers. If it had paid the originally agreed 10 percent dividend on all these shares, the insurer would have paid roughly $20 billion from the beginning of 2009 to the end 2012. 
Instead, the preferred shares were converted into common stock, which the government later sold. The Treasury Department made a $5 billion return on its investments. 
The government could have made more, if it had chosen to. 
For example, the Treasury Department could have demanded an even bigger stake in A.I.G. in return for the dividends it did not get. This would have further diluted existing shareholders like Mr. Greenberg. If the Treasury Department had decided on further dilution, A.I.G.'s shares could have become effectively worthless, like those of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage firms also bailed out by taxpayers in 2008. 
Fannie and Freddie's rescue also required that the companies pay a 10 percent dividend on its government money. But the Treasury Department never let them off the hook on that commitment. The result was that taxpayers have received more than $50 billion of dividends so far from Fannie and Freddie. 
In short, A.I.G.'s shareholders may contend they got a raw deal, but it's not that simple.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Warn A.I.G. Not to Join Lawsuit Against U.S.

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Three Democratic lawmakers write to the company's chairman: "A.I.G. apparently seeks to become the poster company for corporate ingratitude and chutzpah." 

 BODY:
As the board of the American International Group weighs whether to join a shareholder lawsuit against the United States government, several lawmakers have a simple message for the bailed-out insurer.
Don't do it. Don't even think about it.
With A.I.G. having fully repaid its $182 billion bailout only weeks ago, the prospect of the company trying to claw back some of the $22 billion in profit that its rescue generated for shareholders doesn't sit right with several members of Congress. 
At issue is the possibility that insurer may join a lawsuit filed by its former chief executive, Maurice R. Greenberg, claiming that the 2008 bailout shortchanged investors and violated their Fifth Amendment rights. The board is scheduled to meet on Wednesday to hear presentations from Mr. Greenberg and representatives from the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the architects of the bailout.
In a letter to A.I.G.'s chairman, Robert S. Miller, three Democratic lawmakers sternly urged the company to avoid "rubbing salt in the wounds" of taxpayers still furious about needing to bail out a public company.
"A.I.G. became the poster company for Wall Street greed, fiscal mismanagement, and executive bonuses - the taxpayer and economy be damned," Representatives Peter Welch of Vermont, Michael Capuano of Massachusetts and Luis V. Gutierrez of Illinois wrote in the letter. "Now, A.I.G. apparently seeks to become the poster company for corporate ingratitude and chutzpah."
And Senator Elizabeth Warren, the new Democratic senator from Massachusetts, added in her own statement:
"A.I.G.'s reckless bets nearly crashed our entire economy. Taxpayers across this country saved A.I.G. from ruin, and it would be outrageous for this company to turn around and sue the federal government because they think the deal wasn't generous enough. Even today, the government provides an ongoing, stealth bailout, propping up A.I.G. with special tax breaks - tax breaks that Congress should stop. A.I.G. should thank American taxpayers for their help, not bite the hand that fed them for helping them out in a crisis."
Representative Maxine Waters of California, the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee, also weighed in, saying: "I would urge the board to drop its consideration of the lawsuit, thank the American public for the $182 billion rescue package that prevented the company's collapse and support the reforms in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that ensure that systemically important financial institutions can no longer hold our economy hostage."
The full letter from Representatives Welch, Capuano and Gutierrez is below:
Mr. Robert S. Miller
Board Chairman
American International Group, Inc.
180 Maiden Lane
New York, NY 10038
Dear Mr. Miller:
According to The New York Times, AIG is actively considering suing the U.S. government for monetary damages after American taxpayers rescued your company from its reckless conduct with a $182 billion bailout.
Don't do it.
Don't even think about it.
AIG became the poster company for Wall Street greed, fiscal mismanagement, and executive bonuses - the taxpayer and economy be damned.
Now, AIG apparently seeks to become the poster company for corporate ingratitude and chutzpah.
Taxpayers are still furious that they rescued a company whose own conduct brought it down. Don't rub salt in the wounds with yet another reckless decision that is on par with the reckless decisions that led to the bailout in the first place.
Sincerely,
PETER WELCH
Member of Congress
MICHAEL CAPUANO
Member of Congress
LUIS V. GUTIERREZ

HEADLINE: A Woman's Place Is in the House. . . and in the Senate

BYLINE: LUISITA LOPEZ TORREGROSA


HIGHLIGHT: A historic tally of women in the legislative branch could bring changes to both the women's movement and to Congress. 

 BODY:
NEW YORK - A huge virtual banner should be draped on the dome of the U.S. Capitol in Washington with the words "Year of the Woman - 2013!" both in celebration of women's victories and as a reminder, should anyone need reminding, that women's time has come.
Great expectations await the 20 female Unites States Senators - the largest number in the history of the 100-member body. It's not parity; it's not an even fight. But it's something we can't sneer at. 
"It would be nice to think there might be more conciliation and moderation and negotiation, and less posturing and drama and fewer political showdowns," Liza Mundy, a fellow at the New America Foundation who specializes in gender issues, told me. "But that remains to be seen." 
With "a critical mass of female senators," said Ms. Mundy, author of "The Richer Sex," about the rise of female breadwinners, "there are more likely to be staff working groups on issues like paid maternity and paternity leave, working families, and pay discrimination." 
In my latest Female Factor column, I write about how what were once called women's issues are increasingly everyone's issues, and how the rise of women into leadership positions further erodes the old distinctions.
Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York, a leading Democratic feminist, has long maintained that if Congress were 51 percent women, "we wouldn't be debating access to contraception - we'd be talking about jobs and the economy." Fresh off her landslide victory in November, she said, "I can only imagine what a majority of women could pull off - from critical laws on gun control to solutions on climate change to better schools for our children."
"We can get there," she said. Touting the success of her Off the Sidelines campaign to enlist and support progressive women candidates, she said, "Women make up the majority of our society, so there's no reason we can't make up the majority of our legislative branch."
Such talk no longer raises eyebrows. The women who took seats in Congress last week are a diverse lot. Among the newcomers are the first openly gay senator, Tammy Baldwin a Wisconsin Democrat, and a liberal darling, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. They join veterans like Ms. Gillibrand, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, both of California, and Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine.
I expect these women and all the others to stand out in the next Congress, raise the tone of the debate and inject a toxic atmosphere with a healthy dose of compassion, reason and dignity.
Liza Mundy believes the game is changing for women. "Our narrative is no longer primarily or purely one of oppression and victimization, but rather a narrative in which women, in some arenas, are, to their surprise, beginning to over-achieve men," she says.
But to other feminists, she says, the issues remain stubbornly the same: the gender pay gap, parity, discrimination, workplace policies. "I and others have been arguing," she says, "that we need to enlarge our argument and acknowledge, even celebrate, women's gains and the challenges they present."
 What do you want and expect from the new female-inflected Washington? Do you agree that women need to expand their argument? What are your top issues? What would you like to see the women of the Senate tackle this year?

HEADLINE: Hands Off, Oil Industry Warns Government

BYLINE: JOHN M. BRODER


HIGHLIGHT: The head of the American Petroleum Institute says that a rosy oil future depends on the federal government's not raising taxes on companies or imposing new environmental rules. 

 BODY:
Jack Gerard, the often-combative chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute, said Tuesday that the United States was "at the crossroads of a great turning point" in the nation's energy history. 
As long as Congress and the Obama administration don't mess it up, he warned.
In a broad-gauge speech in Washington on the state of the American oil and gas industry, Mr. Gerard said that because of new petroleum finds and new drilling techniques - chiefly directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing in shale formations - the United States could become the world's leading energy producer.
"North America could become self-sufficient in liquid fuels in roughly 12 years," Mr. Gerard said, citing figures from the International Energy Agency. "And as a potential energy exporter, we can help bring greater stability to the geopolitics of energy, to say nothing of the positive impacts increased U.S. supply would have for U.S. businesses, workers and consumers."
But he cautioned that this rosy future was dependent on the federal government's not interfering with his industry, by, say, raising taxes on oil companies, or imposing new environmental regulations on fracking operations, or limiting greenhouse gas emissions from refineries.
"The most important thing is to do no harm," Mr. Gerard said in a question-and-answer period after his speech. "Don't overreact and do anything that would impede or discourage what we see going forward state by state today."

He said that North Dakota, Texas and Pennsylvania had seen a huge boom in job creation and economic activity tied to drilling operations on private lands in recent years, while exploration on federal lands and waters has been stagnant or falling. He attributed the discrepancy to more business-friendly regulatory and tax policies at the state level, and he encouraged Congress and federal regulators to follow the lead of officials in state capitals. 
He urged the Obama administration to open more federal land and water to drilling, but said that this did not have to include national parks and environmentally sensitive areas.
Mr. Gerard bristled at a suggestion that major oil companies benefit from billions of dollars in tax subsidies, saying that the Obama administration's assertion that the industry enjoys $4 billion in unnecessary tax breaks is a "myth."
"The oil and gas industry gets no subsidies, zero, nothing," he said. "We get cost-recovery benefits, much like other industries. You can go down the road of allowing economic activity, generating hundreds of billions to the government, or you can take the alternative route by trying to extract new revenue from industry by increasing their cost to do business."
He added, "We not only pay our fair share, we pay more than our fair share."

HEADLINE: As Use of Libraries Grows, Government Support Has Eroded

BYLINE: SAM ROBERTS


HIGHLIGHT: New York City's three library systems are trying to do more with less government support, even as circulation and program attendance have increased, a study by the Center for an Urban Future has found. 

 BODY:
To see how New York City's library systems stack up next to other big cities in terms of government support, you might want to check the cookbook shelves under "chopped liver."
In Columbus, Ohio, the libraries are open an average of 29 more hours a week. San Francisco's receive up to three times as much per capita from the local government.
Meanwhile, New York's three public library systems -- workhorses all -- are trying to do more with less: the city's contribution to their operating budgets has declined by more than 7 percent, adjusted for inflation, over the past decade, even as circulation and program attendance have increased. 
That's the conclusion of an analysis of New York's libraries and a comparison with 21 other major American library systems, plus Toronto's, published Tuesday morning by the Center for an Urban Future. 
In per capita circulation, the New York Public Library (which covers Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island) and the Brooklyn and Queens systems rank 10th, 11th and 9th, respectively; in attendance at public programs, 12th, 4th and 10th; and 12th, 15th and 20th in average hours per week. 
New York City's libraries are open an average of 43 hours a week, about the same as a decade ago and down from a high of 47 hours. "Even the Detroit public library system stays open longer;" the report noted. Columbus's libraries are open an average of 72 hours a week. Despite the relatively short hours, the study found, New York City's libraries "have experienced a 40 percent spike in the number of people attending programs and a 59 percent increase in circulation over the past decade."
San Francisco's government contributed $101 per capita to the city's libraries, the highest of any city in the study, while New York's library systems all received between $30 and $40 per capita, below Seattle, Boston, Detroit and others. 
Among other findings of the study, "Branches of Opportunity" (pdf - see also below), funded by the Charles H. Revson Foundation: some of the biggest increases in library use in the city were in immigrant neighborhoods and in the Bronx; growth was slowest or even declined in branches that were isolated or near public-housing projects; libraries have not been rendered obsolete by technology and "in today's information economy, libraries have only gotten more important, not less."
Over 40 million visits were paid to the New York, Brooklyn and Queens systems in the 2011 fiscal year, the center said, or more than the combined attendance at all the city's professional sports games or major cultural institutions. The libraries circulated 69 million books and other materials and responded to 14.5 million reference questions.
"Although they are often thought of as cultural institutions, the reality is that the public libraries are a key component of the city's human capital system," the center said. "With roots in nearly every community across the five boroughs, New York's public libraries play a critical role in helping adults upgrade their skills and find jobs, assisting immigrants assimilate, fostering reading skills in young people and providing technology access for those who don't have a computer or an Internet connection at home." 
The analysis found that only 20 percent of applicants for English language courses at some branches are placed, that the Woodside branch in Queens has begun stocking books in Nepali (Flushing has the highest circulation of any branch or central library in the city), and that the New York Public Library is planning to give all 1.1 million students library cards because so many schools lack their own libraries or librarians. 
The analysis recommended that the city government contribute more to help extend hours, among other things; let libraries receive state funding for adult literacy programs; and create collaborations with arts and other nonprofit and commercial partners. 
Jonathan Bowles, director of the Center for an Urban Future, said in a statement: "Libraries are uniquely positioned to help the city address several economic, demographic and social challenges that will impact New York in the decades ahead -- from the rapid aging of the city's population (libraries are a go-to resource for seniors) and the continued growth in the number of foreign-born (libraries are the most trusted institution for immigrants) to the rise of the freelance economy (libraries are the original co-working spaces) and troubling increase in the number of disconnected youth (libraries are a safe haven for many teens and young adults)."
"On the downside," he said, "we find that New York policy makers, social service leaders and economic officials have largely failed to see the public libraries as the critical 21st century resource that they are, while the libraries themselves have only begun to make the investments that will keep them relevant in today's digital age."

HEADLINE: The Mumbai/New York Photo Project: On the Waterfront

BYLINE: NISHA SONDHE and NEHA THIRANI


HIGHLIGHT: The waterfronts of both these coastal cities provide respite from chaos for residents, and a living for some. 

 BODY:
Mumbai and New York both teem with the hustle and bustle of urban life but are bordered by the profound stillness that only water could provide. While New York City is made up of three islands -- Manhattan, Staten Island and Long Island -- Mumbai was once an archipelago of seven islands, which were joined together by land reclaimed from the sea by 1838.

In both of these coastal cities, the waterfronts provide residents a respite from chaos, as well as a providing living for some. New York City has 578 miles of coastline, while Mumbai's coastline measures 149 kilometers, or roughly 93 miles. 
Manhattan gets its name from its original inhabitants, the Lenape, who called it "Manahatta," or "hilly island." New York's port made the city a magnet for immigrants and trade from Europe. In 2011, the city celebrated 90 years of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, an agency established to increase commerce and trade in the New York Harbor. While closely regulated by the Department of Environmental Conservation, New York also offers great fishing opportunities.
The original inhabitants of Mumbai were the Koli fishing communities of Maharashtra, and fishing communities still thrive there today. (The Central Institute of Fisheries Education in Mumbai is attempting to gather data on their indigenous traditional knowledge.) Mumbai's growth also came in part because of its excellent natural harbor, which attracted trade and immigrants from Portugal to China. Even now, the Mumbai Port handles 10 percent of India's seaborne trade.
Mumbai's coastline is plagued by numerous problems, including wastewater, garbage, oil spills and a lack of public accessibility, while in New York, the Coastal Management Program is grappling with issues like climate change and natural hazards like storms, flooding and coastal erosion and marine debris. In November, Hurricane Sandy devastated entire communities in coastal New York and New Jersey and killed over 100 people.
But improvements are in the works in both cities. Architects like P.K. Das have drawn up plans for the protection and development of Mumbai's waterfronts. In New York, the federal Coastal Management Program is working with communities increase public access, improve local economies, protect water quality and reinvigorate the waterfronts.

HEADLINE: Dimon Leaves New York Fed Board as His Term Ends

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has left the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York after his second three-year term expired at the end of December. 

 BODY:
Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has left the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, a position that had stirred some controversy after the bank's big trading loss last year. 
Mr. Dimon's three-year term, his second on the board, expired at the end of December. While there are no official term limits, it is common for New York Fed directors to serve no more than two terms.
So far, Mr. Dimon has not been replaced. He was designated a Class A director, elected by and representing banks. Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to comment.
Mr. Dimon's role on the board came under scrutiny last May, when JPMorgan announced a multibillion-dollar trading loss at the bank's chief investment office in London. The incident raised questions about how the risky position could have gone undetected by regulators, which include the Federal Reserve.
 At the time of the news, some called for Mr. Dimon to resign from the board, including Elizabeth Warren, who was at the time running for a Senate seat.
Another critic, Simon Johnson, a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, drafted a petition in May that called for Mr. Dimon to resign.
"There is an undeniable perception problem," Mr. Johnson wrote on the Economix blog of The New York Times. "It is damaging the legitimacy of the Federal Reserve. As Treasury Secretary Geithner implied, this must be 'addressed' - a great Washington euphemism - by Mr. Dimon leaving the board of the New York Fed."
But others came to Mr. Dimon's defense. Ernie Patrikis, a partner at White & Case and a former general counsel at the New York Fed, pointed out that the role of board members like Mr. Dimon was simply to provide the central bank with insight into the financial system.
"The information he provides is more than what he gets. It's a one-sided relationship," Mr. Patrikis said. "In my 30 years at the Fed, I never heard anyone say we should give a break to big bank or a small bank because the individual was a director."
In addition to Class A directors, the board of the New York Fed includes Class B directors, who are elected by banks to represent the public, and Class C directors, who are appointed by the Federal Reserve Board and represent the public.
Mr. Dimon, who was one of three Class A directors, represented the biggest banks, with capital and surplus of more than $1 billion. His successor would also represent large banks.

HEADLINE: Alcoa Earnings Meet Expectations Despite Soft Demand

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Alcoa said on Tuesday that its fourth-quarter earnings met Wall Street's expectations and that it expected slightly higher demand for aluminum this year.
Net income was $242 million, or 21 cents a share, including one-time gains like income from selling a hydroelectric project. 
Without those gains, the company would have made 6 cents a share on revenue of $5.9 billion, meeting analysts' expectations, according to FactSet. Sales were higher than the $5.58 billion that analysts had predicted.
A year ago, the company posted a fourth-quarter loss of $193 million, or 18 cents a share, on revenue of $6 billion, and a loss after special items of 3 cents a share.
The weak global economy has hurt industrial demand for aluminum. But Alcoa expects demand to grow 7 percent in 2013, up from a 6 percent gain in 2012. It said the best prospects were in aerospace and forecast slower improvement in the auto, packaging, and building and construction markets.
The company said it had made record profits in its aluminum-rolling and product-making businesses while cutting costs in its mining and refining, or ''upstream,'' segments.
Alcoa's chief executive, Klaus Kleinfeld, said the company had overcome volatile aluminum prices and global economic weakness and was in a ''strong position to maximize profitable growth'' in 2013.
Alcoa is the first company in the Dow Jones industrial average to report fourth-quarter earnings. Because it makes aluminum for many major industries, investors study its results for clues about the health and direction of the overall economy.
Stock in the company, which is based in New York, closed unchanged in regular trading at $9.10 a share. In late-session trading after the earnings report was released, the stock gained 12 cents to $9.22 a share.

HEADLINE: Tentative Deal Is Reached With Journalists Protesting Censorship at Chinese Newspaper

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG and CHRIS BUCKLEY; Edward Wong reported from Guangzhou, and Chris Buckley from Hong Kong. Jonah M. Kessel contributed reporting from Guangzhou, and Jonathan Ansfield from Beijing. Mia Li contributed research from Guangzhou.

 BODY:
GUANGZHOU, China -- A tentative agreement to defuse a newsroom strike by Chinese journalists over censorship controls in this southeastern provincial capital had been reached by early Wednesday, and some reporters working for Southern Weekend, the newspaper at the heart of the dispute, were told that the paper would publish as usual on Thursday, one journalist in the newsroom said.
''The paper is coming out tomorrow, and the propaganda department is going to hold a meeting with staff about this tomorrow,'' said the journalist, who spoke Wednesday on the condition of anonymity. Several other reporters said that details of the agreement remained murky Wednesday morning, and that the deal could fall apart. 
Protests over censorship at Southern Weekend, one of China's most liberal newspapers, had descended into ideological confrontation on Tuesday, pitting advocates of free speech against supporters of Communist Party control, who wielded red flags and portraits of Mao Zedong.
The face-off outside the headquarters of the company that publishes Southern Weekend came after disgruntled editors and reporters at the paper last week deplored what they called crude meddling by the top propaganda official in Guangdong Province, which has long had a reputation as a bastion of a relatively free press.
With a number of celebrities and business leaders rallying online to the liberal cause, senior propaganda officials in Beijing began this week to roll out a national strategy of demonizing the rebel journalists and their supporters. The Central Propaganda Department issued a directive to news organizations saying the defiant outburst at Southern Weekend, also known as Southern Weekly, had involved ''hostile foreign forces.''
The order, translated by China Digital Times, a research group at the University of California, Berkeley, that studies Chinese news media, said that Chinese journalists must drop their support of Southern Weekend and insisted that ''party control of the media is an unwavering basic principle.''
An editor at a party news organization said the term ''hostile forces'' had been used in an internal discussion with a senior editor about the Southern Weekend conflict. Several Chinese journalists outside Guangdong said Tuesday that a call by Southern Weekend reporters and editors for the dismissal of Tuo Zhen, the top provincial propaganda official, who took up his post in May, was probably too radical for higher authorities to accept.
The protesting journalists at Southern Weekend blame Mr. Tuo, a former journalist, for ordering a drastic change in a New Year's editorial that had originally called for greater respect for constitutional rights. The revised editorial instead praised party policies. Mr. Tuo has not commented on the accusation.
Early Wednesday, there was online chatter among Chinese journalists that Dai Zigeng, the publisher of The Beijing News, had balked at an order from the Central Propaganda Department to print an editorial attacking Southern Weekend. A truncated version ran on Wednesday deep inside the paper, and several Beijing News reporters confirmed that Mr. Dai had been uncomfortable with it.
A former editor for the Nanfang Media Group, which includes Southern Weekend, said provincial propaganda officials and disgruntled journalists talked Tuesday in Guangzhou. The talks focused on the journalists' demands for an inquiry into the New Year's episode and for the newspaper's managers to rescind a statement that absolved Mr. Tuo of responsibility for the editorial.
''They want that statement to be removed, and they also want assurances about relaxing controls on journalists -- not removing party oversight, but making it more reasonable, allowing reporters to challenge officials,'' the editor said. ''The other main demand is for an impartial explanation of what happened, an accounting so it won't happen again.''
Senior Chinese officials have not commented publicly on the censorship dispute at the paper, which could test how far the recently appointed Communist Party leader, Xi Jinping, will go in support of more open economic and political policies.
''I don't believe that Xi is totally hypocritical when he talks about reform,'' said Chen Min, a prominent opinion writer for Southern Weekend who was forced out of the newspaper in 2011 during a party-led crackdown on potential dissent.
Defenders of Communist orthodoxy turned up at the newspaper headquarters on Tuesday to make the case for firm party control of the media.
''We support the Communist Party. Shut down the traitor newspaper,'' said a cardboard sign held up by one of 10 or so conservative demonstrators.
''Southern Weekend has an American dream,'' another sign said. ''We don't want the American dream. We want the Chinese dream.''
Most of the party supporters refused to give their names. One who did, Yang Xingfa, 50, from Hunan Province, said: ''Southern Weekend belongs to the people. However, the paper always ignores the achievements of the Chinese Communist Party and asks why China isn't more like the United States. Outrageous!''
The participants said they had come on their own initiative.
The dueling protests outside the newspaper headquarters reflected the political passions and tensions raised by the quarrel over censorship. Finding a resolution to the standoff poses a challenge both to the central authorities and to Hu Chunhua, the new party chief of Guangdong and a potential candidate to succeed Mr. Xi in a decade.
Hundreds of bystanders watched and took photos on cellphones as the party supporters shouted at the 20 or more protesters who had gathered to denounce censorship, and shoving matches broke out.
One defender of the Southern Weekend journalists was Liang Taiping, 28, a poet who wore a Guy Fawkes mask popularized by ''V for Vendetta,'' the Hollywood movie and British comic book. Mr. Liang said he had bought the mask after watching the movie recently on state-run China Central Television, which had surprised many Chinese with its willingness to show the film uncut, since the film advocates the overthrow of a one-party dictatorship.
''It's the only newspaper in China that's willing to tell the truth,'' said Mr. Liang, who added that he had traveled by train about 350 miles from the southern city of Changsha. ''What's the point of living if you can't even speak freely?''

HEADLINE: Consumer Debt Rises on Cars And Education

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- American consumers borrowed more in November to buy cars and attend school, but they stayed cautious about using their credit cards. 
The Federal Reserve said Tuesday that consumers increased their borrowing in November by $16 billion from October to a seasonally adjusted record of $2.77 trillion.
Borrowing that covers autos and student loans increased $15.2 billion. A category that measures credit card debt rose just $817 million.
The sharp difference in the borrowing gains illustrates a broader trend that began after the recession. Four years ago, Americans carried $1.03 trillion in credit card debt, a high. In November, that figure was 16.5 percent lower.
At the same time, student loan debt has increased significantly. The category that includes auto and student loans is 22.8 percent higher than in July 2008. Many Americans who have lost jobs have gone back to school to get training for new careers.
The November increase also reflected further gains in auto sales, which rose 13.4 percent in 2012 to top 14 million units for the first time in five years. The need to replace vehicles lost to Hurricane Sandy may have helped.

HEADLINE: The Market And Mother Nature

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Whenever I hear the word ''cliff,'' I am reminded of something that President Obama's science adviser, John Holdren, used to say about how we need to respond to climate change because no one can predict when it might take a disruptive, nonlinear turn. ''We are driving toward a cliff in a fog,'' said Holdren about the climate, and that's always a good time ''to start tapping on the brakes.'' Indeed, when you think about how much financial debt we've built up in the market and how much carbon debt we've built up in the atmosphere, the wisest thing we could do as a country today is to start tapping on the brakes by both emitting less carbon to bend the emissions curve down and racking up less debt to bend our debt-to-G.D.P. curve down. Unfortunately, we are still doing neither. 
Indeed, we are actually taunting the two most powerful and merciless forces on the planet, the market and Mother Nature, at the same time. We're essentially saying to both of them: ''Hey, what've you got, baby? No interest rate rises? A little bitty temperature increase? That's all you've got?'' I just hope we get our act together before the market and Mother Nature each show us what they've got.
Let's look at the huge carbon and financial deficits we're amassing. For thousands of years up to the dawn of the industrial age 200 years ago, the Earth's atmosphere contained 280 parts per million of the heat-trapping greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Today, that number is nearly 400 p.p.m., with 450 p.p.m. routinely cited as the tipping point where we create the conditions for out-of-control acceleration. Melting the permafrost in Alaska, Canada and Siberia, for example, would release massive amounts of carbon that would further increase global warming. Permafrost is packed with CO2 and frozen methane, which is 25 times more potent a greenhouse gas than CO2. ''If the tundra continues melting,'' says Hal Harvey, the chief executive of Energy Innovation, ''we could basically release the equivalent of all the carbon that all humanity has emitted from the start of history to now.'' That would really send temperatures soaring, ice melting and sea levels rising.
We're on a similar trajectory with our debt. Mounting deficits have driven America's debt-to-G.D.P. ratio from 36.2 percent in 2007 to 72.8 percent today. In their widely hailed book on credit crises, ''This Time Is Different,'' the economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff argue that countries that allow their debt-to-G.D.P. ratios to exceed 90 percent experience slower growth and greater instability -- much like hitting a climate tipping point. Indeed, they note, those who would point to low interest rates today as some kind of ''all-clear'' for more debt ''should remember that market interest rates can change like the weather.''
There is another striking parallel. At some point, when we allow so much carbon to build up in the atmosphere, our mightiest efforts to cut emissions through energy efficiency, conservation and new technologies will only enable us to stay in place. They won't be able bend the curve downward anymore. And 450 p.p.m. is not a place we want to get stuck. And, at some point, the debt will get so large that big tax increases and spending cuts will simply go to pay interest. We also won't be able to bend that curve anymore, and spending on infrastructure, education and the poor will vanish.
I am struck by how many liberals insist on reducing carbon emissions immediately, but, on the deficit, say there is no urgency because no interest rates rises are in sight. And I am struck by how many conservatives insist we must reduce the deficit immediately, but, on climate, say there is no urgency because, so far, temperature rise has been slight. (Although 2012 was the hottest year on record in the continental U.S.) One reason interest rates are so low is that they are being suppressed by the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing. That won't last. As for the climate, well, ''Mother Nature doesn't do quantitative easing,'' said Harvey. Beware of nonlinear moves in both.
We can't go off coal overnight, and we can't go into recession by cutting spending overnight, but we need to start tapping on the brakes in both realms by agreeing on spending cuts, tax increases and new investments that would be phased in as the economy improves, as well as higher efficiency standards for power plants, buildings, vehicles and appliances that would be phased in, too.
A carbon tax would reinforce and make both strategies easier. According to a September 2012 study by the Congressional Research Service, a small carbon tax of $20 per ton -- escalating by 5.6 percent annually -- could cut the projected 10-year deficit by roughly 50 percent (from $2.3 trillion down to $1.1 trillion).
What would you rather do to help solve our fiscal problem: Give up your home mortgage deduction and wait two more years for Social Security and Medicare, or pay a little extra for gasoline and electricity? These will be our choices. I'd rather pay the little carbon tax, especially since it would clean up the air for our kids, drive innovation and make us less dependent on the most unstable region in the world: the Middle East.
How could a carbon tax not be on the table today?

HEADLINE: Bank Hacks Were Work Of Iranians, Officials Say

BYLINE: By NICOLE PERLROTH and QUENTIN HARDY

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- The attackers hit one American bank after the next. As in so many previous attacks, dozens of online banking sites slowed, hiccupped or ground to a halt before recovering several minutes later.
But there was something disturbingly different about the wave of online attacks on American banks in recent weeks. Security researchers say that instead of exploiting individual computers, the attackers engineered networks of computers in data centers, transforming the online equivalent of a few yapping Chihuahuas into a pack of fire-breathing Godzillas.
The skill required to carry out attacks on this scale has convinced United States government officials and security researchers that they are the work of Iran, most likely in retaliation for economic sanctions and online attacks by the United States. 
''There is no doubt within the U.S. government that Iran is behind these attacks,'' said James A. Lewis, a former official in the State and Commerce Departments and a computer security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
Mr. Lewis said the amount of traffic flooding American banking sites was ''multiple times'' the amount that Russia directed at Estonia in a monthlong online assault in 2007 that nearly crippled the Baltic nation.
American officials have not offered any technical evidence to back up their claims, but computer security experts say the recent attacks showed a level of sophistication far beyond that of amateur hackers. Also, the hackers chose to pursue disruption, not money: another earmark of state-sponsored attacks, the experts said.
''The scale, the scope and the effectiveness of these attacks have been unprecedented,'' said Carl Herberger, vice president of security solutions at Radware, a security firm that has been investigating the attacks on behalf of banks and cloud service providers. ''There have never been this many financial institutions under this much duress.''
Since September, intruders have caused major disruptions to the online banking sites of Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp, PNC, Capital One, Fifth Third Bank, BB&T and HSBC.
They employed DDoS attacks, or distributed denial of service attacks, named because hackers deny customers service by directing large volumes of traffic to a site until it collapses. No bank accounts were breached and no customers' money was taken.
By using data centers, the attackers are simply keeping up with the times. Companies and consumers are increasingly conducting their business over large-scale ''clouds'' of hundreds, even thousands, of networked computer servers.
These clouds are run by Amazon and Google, but also by many smaller players who commonly rent them to other companies. It appears the hackers remotely hijacked some of these clouds and used the computing power to take down American banking sites.
''There's a sense now that attackers are crafting their own private clouds,'' either by creating networks of individual machines or by stealing resources wholesale from poorly maintained corporate clouds, said John Kindervag, an analyst at Forrester Research.
How, exactly, attackers are hijacking data centers is still a mystery. Making matters more complex, they have simultaneously introduced another weapon: encrypted DDoS attacks.
Banks encrypt customers' online transactions for security, but the encryption process consumes system resources. By flooding banking sites with encryption requests, attackers can further slow or cripple sites with fewer requests.
A hacker group calling itself Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters has claimed in online posts that it was responsible for the attacks.
The group said it attacked the banks in retaliation for an anti-Islam video that mocked the Prophet Muhammad, and pledged to continue its campaign until the video was scrubbed from the Internet. It called the campaign Operation Ababil, a reference to a story in the Koran in which Allah sends swallows to defeat an army of elephants dispatched by the king of Yemen to attack Mecca in A.D. 571.
But American intelligence officials say the group is actually a cover for Iran. They claim Iran is waging the attacks in retaliation for Western economic sanctions and for a series of cyberattacks on its own systems. In the last three years, three sophisticated computer viruses -- called Flame, Duqu and Stuxnet -- have hit computers in Iran. The New York Times reported last year that the United States, together with Israel, was responsible for Stuxnet, the virus used to destroy centrifuges in an Iranian nuclear facility in 2010.
''It's a bit of a grudge match,'' said Mr. Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Researchers at Radware who investigated the attacks for several banks found that the traffic was coming from data centers around the world. They discovered that various cloud services and public Web hosting services had been infected with a particularly sophisticated form of malware, called Itsoknoproblembro, that was designed to evade detection by antivirus programs. The malware has existed for years, but the banking attacks were the first time it used data centers to attack external victims.
Botnets, or networks of individual infected slave computers, can typically be traced back to a command and control center, but security experts say Itsoknoproblembro was engineered to make it very difficult to tie it to one party. Security researchers have come up with a new name for servers infected with Itsoknoproblembro: they call them ''bRobots.''
In an amateur botnet, the command and control center can be easily identified, but Mr. Herberger said it had been nearly impossible to do so in this case, suggesting to him that ''the campaign may be state-sponsored versus amateur malware.''
Attackers used the infected servers to fire traffic simultaneously at each banking site until it slowed or collapsed.
By infecting data centers instead of computers, the hackers obtained the computing power to mount enormous denial of service attacks. One of the banks had 40 gigabits of Internet capacity, Mr. Herberger said, a huge amount when you consider that a midsize business may only have one gigabit. But some banks were hit with a sustained flood of traffic that peaked at 70 gigabits.
Mr. Herberger declined to say which cloud service providers had been compromised, citing nondisclosure agreements with Radware's clients, but he said that each new bank attack provided evidence that more data centers had been infected and exploited.
The attackers said last week that they had no intention of halting their campaign. ''Officials of American banks must expect our massive attacks,'' they wrote. ''From now on, none of the U.S. banks will be safe.''

HEADLINE: Only You Can Prevent Digital Wildfires

BYLINE: By LEE HOWELL

 BODY:
IN 1938, thousands of Americans famously mistook a radio adaptation of the H.G. Wells novel ''War of the Worlds'' for a genuine news broadcast. Police stations were flooded with calls from citizens who believed the United States had been invaded by Martians.
It is difficult to imagine a radio play causing such a misunderstanding today, when people can quickly check the latest headlines on their smartphones. But the Internet, like radio in 1938, is a relatively young medium. Is it conceivable that a misleading post on social media could spark a comparable panic? 
We can think of this possibility as a ''digital wildfire.'' In a hyperconnected world, information can travel with unprecedented speed and reach. The benefits of new communication technologies are many and obvious; the potential for pitfalls informs one of the ''risk cases'' explored in the World Economic Forum's Global Risks 2013 report, based on expert input about which risks could manifest themselves over the next 10 years.
Social media can rapidly spread information that is either intentionally or unintentionally misleading or provocative. In the summer of 2012, for example, a Twitter user impersonating the Russian interior minister, Vladimir Kolokoltsev, tweeted that President Bashar al-Assad of Syria had been ''killed or injured''; crude oil prices rose by over one dollar before traders realized that Assad was alive and well. In September 2012, protests over an anti-Islamic film uploaded onto YouTube killed dozens of people.
In October 2012, during Hurricane Sandy, news organizations such as CNN were fooled by an anonymous Twitter user who tweeted that the New York Stock Exchange trading floor was under three feet of water. In this case, the false rumor was quickly put right by other Twitter users, demonstrating that social media can often self-correct. Nonetheless, it is possible to imagine two kinds of scenario in which a digital wildfire could cause havoc.
Firstly, in fast-changing situations -- such as when a natural disaster is unfolding or social tensions are running high -- damage could be done before a correction can come. The real-world equivalent is shouting ''Fire!'' in a crowded theater; even if the lack of fire quickly becomes apparent, people may already have been crushed in a scramble for the exit.
Secondly, we can imagine situations in which false information feeds into an existing world view, making it harder for corrections to penetrate. The November 2012 clashes in Gaza, in which both Israel and Hamas used Twitter extensively, show the growing importance of social media in conflict situations. It is possible to imagine an explosive situation being created as competing false rumors propagate in self-reinforcing loops among like-minded individuals.
What could be done to protect against the risk of digital wildfires? Many jurisdictions already have laws that limit freedom of speech in the real world for reasons such as incitement of violence or panic, and are grappling with how to apply those laws to online activities.
But the task of establishing legal restrictions on online speech is complicated by the fact that digital social norms are not yet entirely well established. New communication technologies, by nature, are not easily confined within national borders, and it would be difficult to limit online anonymity without compromising the usefulness of the Internet as a tool for whistle-blowers and political dissidents in repressive regimes.
Furthermore, any new regulations, however sensible they might seem, could also have unintended consequences. Last December, controversy flared at the World Conference on International Telecommunications in Dubai when the United States among others refused to sign a treaty seeking to establish certain online rules over fears it could lead to more government censorship of the Internet.
If we are to avoid creating new regulations, new norms will need to emerge. Users of social media typically have less to lose than traditional media outlets from spreading information that has not been properly fact-checked, and are typically less aware of laws related to issues such as libel and defamation. Nonetheless, as has already been seen, social pressure can exert a powerful influence.
It will also be necessary for more of the consumers of social media to become more literate in assessing the reliability and bias of sources. Technical solutions -- such as programs and browser extensions that aim to help people assess the credibility of online information and sources -- could help. It is possible to imagine that automated flags for disputed information could ultimately become as ubiquitous among Internet users as programs that protect against spam and malware. What's more, if governments, public bodies and other institutions took the route of putting out better quality, better audited, verifiable information in the first place, then the risk of wildfires would be dampened.
The example of how radio broadcasting evolved after the ''War of the Worlds'' incident is instructive. Broadcasters learned to be more cautious and responsible, and listeners learned to be more savvy and skeptical. A similar shift could help to douse the digital wildfires of the future.
Lee Howell is managing director of the World Economic Forum and editor of the Global Risks 2013 report.

HEADLINE: For One Night at Least, Another Towers Over Messi

BYLINE: By ROB HUGHES

 BODY:
LONDON -- What a striking couple Lionel Messi and Abby Wambach cut at the world player of the year gala in Zurich. And what a difference in their fortunes.
Messi continues to score more goals than any man in his game, and to reap the financial rewards commensurate to being the outstanding player of his generation. His fellow professionals gave him more votes for the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2012 than the next two players combined -- yet his teams won nothing during the calendar year.
Wambach won everything she plays for, leading the United States to Olympic gold in London. Yet she enters the new year technically unemployed, as a professional player, following the collapse of the Women's Professional Soccer league in the United States last year. (There are plans for another league in the United States, but the new venture is at least a year away.) 
At 25, Messi is on the cusp of that great period in sporting life when physical capability merges with experience on the field. He has signed up with Barcelona for the rest of his playing career, and he does what he said in his acceptance speech in Zurich on Monday: He plays for the joy of it.
At 32, and with nowhere to play professionally in her country, Wambach may have to go abroad to see out her prime, and to earn a living at what she does best.
Maybe soccer is still what it was when the magazine France Football set up an award for individual honors in a team game. The first recipient, in 1956, was the English wizard of the wing, Stanley Matthews. The second was Alfredo Di Stéfano, the great Argentine playing for Real Madrid.
And down the decades, before and after FIFA appropriated France Football's Ballon d'Or as its own, it remained predominantly masculine. Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini, Marco van Basten and Ronaldo de Lima: All indisputably left their imprint by becoming the recipients of multiple Ballons d'Or.
On Monday, little Leo Messi, looking so dandy in his polka-dot tuxedo, eclipsed them all in terms of numbers. He now holds an unprecedented four world player of the year awards, and we do not need to catalogue, again, the records he keeps on breaking.
In any case, counting his goals does not give us the measure of the man and the pleasure he gives and gets from being a team player.
Little Leo? In size, maybe. With Wambach nudging the diminutive Brazilian, Marta, off the top of the women's game, Monday also gave us a telling picture of sexual equality in reverse.
This has to be the first time that the female honoree has towered physically over the male on the soccer stage. As they stood side by side, each holding their golden ball, Abby dwarfed Leo.
She is 1.8 meters, or 5-foot-11. He is 1.68 meters in his shoes.
She weighs in at 77 kilograms, or 170 pounds. He tips the scales at 67 kilograms.
They are, according to votes cast in every country among national team coaches, national captains and journalists, the figures and faces of the year just ended.
We shouldn't argue with it, because it's fine that those groups of people managed to look at the sport both ways in 2012. In the men's game, the majority recognized Messi, even above any player from Real Madrid, the team that knocked Barcelona off the top of the Spanish league, or any from the Spanish national team that retained the European Championship last summer, to go along with the world championship it won in South Africa in 2010.
Wambach was recognized for being on the winning team, indeed for imposing her strength and size and goal-scoring opportunism on the highest level of the game.
So whatever the polemicists might say, soccer is about more than the winning.
The votes cast, incidentally, represent a ton of divided opinions. And undoubtedly some politically slanted opinions.
If we take just the men, for example, it is as clear as the ball is round that the Portuguese and the Spanish do not fully appreciate one another.
Cast your mind back to the fall, to when Cristiano Ronaldo pouted and postured and implied he did not feel inclined to celebrate scoring his goals for Real Madrid because the club had not supported his candidacy for the Ballon d'Or.
Some months after that, Iker Casillas, Real's No. 1 goalie since his youth and the club captain for three years, was dropped from the lineup by the coach José Mourinho. This shock, explained only by Mourinho's stating that it was the coach's choice, was exacerbated by Ronaldo wearing the captain's armband by the time Casillas got his place back on the field, after his replacement, Antonio Adán, was red-carded for a reckless foul last Sunday.
Mourinho, like Ronaldo, is a Portuguese living in the Spanish capital.
Portugal did not rate Messi in the top three of the world's best players for the 2012 Ballon d'Or. Its votes went to Ronaldo, and seemingly anyone but Messi.
However, the margin was not even close. Messi received 41.6 percent of the full vote, Ronaldo 23.68, and Andrés Iniesta 10.91. Then came Xavi, Radamel Falcao, Casillas, Andrea Pirlo, Didier Drogba, Robin van Persie and Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
There was consensus on which country leads the world. The FIFA World Xl lineup stacked up this way: Casillas; Dani Alves, Gerard Piqué, Sergio Ramos, Marcelo; Xavi, Xabi Alonso, Iniesta; Ronaldo, Falcao and Messi.
All are employed in Spain. All but Falcao, the Colombian striker employed by Atlético Madrid, represent Real Madrid or Barcelona.
Rightly and properly, the clear winner of the men's coach of the year is the Spaniard Vicente Del Bosque.
Here, again, was a male-female split. Del Bosque blinked in the spotlight, said his few words and sought the shadows. Pia Sundhage, the Swede who coached Team U.S.A., took the microphone and sang her way through the ceremony.
To each his, and her, own.

HEADLINE: Illinois Tries, and Fails, to Fix Its Pensions

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; Steven Yaccino contributed reporting from Chicago.

 BODY:
SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- If ever there was a moment when Illinois's drastically underfinanced pension systems had a real shot at being repaired, some state leaders thought it would be this week.
Nearly everyone in this Democrat-controlled Capitol agreed that the circumstances had reached the point of crisis. More than 30 departing lawmakers were preparing to give up their seats on Wednesday, so worries about political futures could, for now, be tossed aside.
And several proposals, including one requiring higher contributions from state workers and teachers and limiting cost-of-living increases, were on the table. 
But as the lame-duck legislative session drew to a close on Tuesday evening, there was no deal. Lawmakers began talking optimistically about how they would keep searching for a fix to the nation's most underfinanced state public pension system during a new session in the months ahead. And the shortfall in the state's pension systems, now about $96 billion, will keep right on mounting at a rate, according to an estimate by Gov. Pat Quinn, of $17 million a day.
For months, Mr. Quinn and others had held up this weeklong stretch -- before new lawmakers are sworn in -- as a make-or-break moment. ''We have to be bold,'' Mr. Quinn, a Democrat, said Tuesday morning. He urged lawmakers not to allow the state's economy ''to be held hostage by political timidity'' and called a pension overhaul the ''challenge of our time.''
As late as Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Quinn was bringing forth a new proposal, one critics mocked as a ''desperate Hail Mary pass.''
In the end, the failure to overhaul the system, at least for now, was more proof of the tangled nature and expansive size of the problem in a place with a political history like Illinois's. In this state, any fix pits a legislature dominated by Democrats against the wishes of labor unions, long seen as strong supporters of the Democrats. And the State Constitution includes a provision that has stirred endless debate over how much Illinois can change a public sector worker's pension in the first place. It bars pension benefits from being ''diminished or impaired.''
''Some compromises were made, but apparently not enough to pass a bill,'' said Steve Brown, a spokesman for Michael J. Madigan, a Democrat and the longtime speaker of the Illinois House. ''It's another way of demonstrating just how contentious this issue is.''
For a session that had once been seen as a politically opportune moment to take on all sorts of difficult issues, including pensions, same-sex marriage and gambling expansion, many issues were ultimately put aside.
But state lawmakers did approve a contentious measure allowing illegal immigrants to get temporary driver's licenses, clearing the way, experts said, for Illinois to become the fourth state, and the most populous, to allow them to drive legally.
The measure, which Mr. Quinn has said he would sign, will allow an estimated 250,000 illegal immigrants statewide to apply for the licenses, which will be valid for three years.
The measure was approved after tense debate on Tuesday in the State House, where opponents said it could lead to fraud and supporters said it would ensure that illegal immigrants took road and vision tests and bought insurance.
Groups and advocates for immigrants, including Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, cheered the decision on driver's licenses. New Mexico, Utah and Washington State already have similar provisions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
While some states are now wrestling with whether to give driver's licenses to immigrants who qualify for a new Obama administration program granting some illegal immigrants a temporary reprieve from deportation, Illinois's new provision will be broader, reaching beyond those who may qualify for the federal program.
Illegal immigrants who had been living in the state for at least a year would be eligible. Social Security numbers would not be required, though other proof of residence -- like a lease -- would be needed. The licenses, which could be renewed after three years, could not be used for purposes other than driving, including buying guns or boarding airplanes.
On the pension question, plenty of proposals had floated around the Capitol in recent days, including one that would have required higher payments from workers and would have frozen cost-of-living increases for six years. Another, passed last year by the State Senate, would have given workers a choice of sorts between state health care and retirement benefits. And another -- proposed by Governor Quinn in the final hours of the session -- would have created a commission to remake the pension systems. That notion made it through a committee vote, but no further.
As lawmakers here began heading home, John J. Cullerton, a Democrat and the president of the Senate, said, ''We have to start up again -- literally tomorrow.''

HEADLINE: Japan and China Escalate Tensions Over Island Group

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
TOKYO -- The Japanese Foreign Ministry summoned China's ambassador on Tuesday after Chinese ships entered Japanese-controlled waters for 13 hours, a prolonged incursion that seemed to escalate a standoff over a group of disputed islands.
The ministry said the deputy foreign minister, Akitaka Saiki, strongly protested the incursion on Monday by four Chinese surveillance ships near the islands, known as the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. The uninhabited island chain, near Okinawa, has been controlled by Japan for decades but is also claimed by China and Taiwan. 
The Chinese ambassador, Cheng Yonghua, responded by saying that the islands belong to China and that Japanese ships had no right to be there, the ministry said.
The flare-up of tensions over the sovereignty of the islands in the East China Sea has soured ties between Asia's two largest economies, leading to anti-Japanese riots and boycotts of Japanese goods in China. Monday's incursion was one of the longest yet by Chinese vessels since the tensions began several months ago, when the Japanese government began efforts to buy three of the five islands from a private Japanese citizen.
China responded to the eventual purchase in September by beginning regular entries by ships to the waters near the islands, ignoring Japanese demands to stop. The Chinese further increased the pressure last month by dispatching a surveillance plane into what Japan considers its airspace near the islands.
The last such incursion by Chinese ships took place Dec. 31, Japanese news reports said; most last only a few hours.
Japan's top government spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, called the Chinese ships' long stay in the waters Monday ''an extremely unusual incident and very regrettable.''
The frequent incursions are seen by Japanese and American diplomacy experts as a new strategy by China to pressure Japan into officially acknowledging that a territorial dispute exists, something Tokyo has so far refused to do. They also said that by maintaining an almost constant presence, the Chinese may also be hoping to undermine Japan's claims of wielding sole control over the islands.
The frequent Chinese incursions have come to resemble a high seas game of cat and mouse, with vessels from both sides following each other, and using radio or speakers to demand that the other side withdraw. To prevent a dangerous escalation, both sides have so far mainly used nonmilitary ships, like coast guard or fishing surveillance vessels.
Since the Chinese patrol plane flew over the islands Dec. 13, Chinese aircraft have occasionally probed the edge of Japanese-controlled airspace. That included a flight on Saturday, when a propeller plane belonging to China's State Oceanic Administration, which is similar to the coast guard, flew to within 60 miles of the islands.
On Tuesday, the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, ordered his defense minister to step up surveillance around the islands, particularly against Chinese aircraft.
The purchase of some of the islands in September stirred outrage in China, where many see the islands as the last pieces of Chinese territory that remain in Japan's hands from its foray into empire-building in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Japan says China started showing interest in the islands only in recent decades after scientists found evidence of nearby undersea oil and natural gas deposits.
Japan said the purchase was meant to alleviate strains, by keeping the islands out of the hands of a firebrand, right-wing politician who was threatening to buy them. China saw the move as a provocation meant to strengthen Japan's claims to the islands.

HEADLINE: Christie Lauds New Jersey's Fortitude and Presses Congress for Storm Aid

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
TRENTON -- Gov. Chris Christie opened his re-election year on Tuesday with a speech to the Legislature here that sought to underscore the reputation he earned as ''America's governor'' after Hurricane Sandy.
Delivering the annual State of the State address, Mr. Christie spent about two-thirds of his time recalling the devastation in New Jersey from the storm and tales of individual fortitude in the aftermath, including calling out to people affected by the hurricane who were brought to the State Assembly chamber for the speech. While he urged Congress to approve a package of relief money, he mentioned few specifics about rebuilding, or other proposals for the coming year. 
''There is no question that Sandy hit us hard,'' the governor told a chamber packed with lawmakers, dignitaries and guests. ''But there is also no question we are fighting back with everything we've got.''
The speech was noticeably lacking in details about other plans for the coming year. But Mr. Christie, a Republican frequently mentioned as a contender for his party's presidential nomination in 2016, had good reason to emphasize the storm: it sent his popularity soaring, even among Democrats.
Mr. Christie had raised eyebrows among allies of Mitt Romney, his party's nominee in November, for praising President Obama's response to the storm after it ravaged the East Coast in the waning days of the presidential contest.
And the combative governor took his party to task pointedly last week, calling a news conference to denounce the Republican leadership in the House for failing to call a vote on a bill that would have provided $60 billion in storm aid. After the rebuke, the House approved the first $9.7 billion and set a vote on the full relief package next week.
In his speech Tuesday, Mr. Christie urged leaders to pass a ''full, clean Sandy aid bill,'' declaring, ''Some things are above politics.''
''We have waited 72 days, seven times longer than victims of Hurricane Katrina waited,'' Mr. Christie said. ''One thing I hope everyone now clearly understands -- New Jersey, both Republicans and Democrats, will never stand silent when our citizens are being shortchanged.''
As he did in his criticism of House Republicans last week, Mr. Christie tried to use the speech to set himself above partisan bickering. Several times, he declared his state a model for bipartisanship.
''Maybe the folks in Washington, in both parties, could learn something from our record here,'' he said.
But the address was hardly without politics, as was the case of the plea he made to the legislators in the chamber.
''Let's put aside accusations and false charges for purely political advantage,'' he said. ''Let's work together to honor the memories of those lost in Sandy. Let's put the needs of our most victimized citizens ahead of the partisan politics of the day.''
The remark seemed to be a jab at Democrats, who control the Legislature but have yet to coalesce around a single challenger to Mr. Christie. In a news conference Monday, they accused Mr. Christie of focusing on the storm as a way of distracting from the serious economic troubles the state faced even before the storm hit. In a particularly inartful moment, the Senate president, Stephen M. Sweeney, said that rather than propose a plan to encourage job creation, Mr. Christie had ''prayed a lot and got lucky a storm came.''
Mr. Sweeney apologized as soon as the words were out of his mouth, but Democrats did not back away from their criticism after the speech.
While they noted the importance of helping the parts of New Jersey most affected by the storm, they said it could not be at the expense of addressing the problems affecting the rest of the state.
The state's unemployment rate, at 9.6 percent, is among the highest in the nation, well above the national rate and the rate in neighboring states. And the governor built his budget for this year around an exceptionally rosy prediction for economic growth, but revenue is coming in far short of those projections. The administration acknowledges that the shortfall was at least $450 million in the first five months of the fiscal year, and the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services says it is $700 million. That will almost inevitably force difficult budget cuts in the next six months.
''We all share the goal of rebuilding New Jersey following Sandy,'' said Sheila Oliver, the Assembly speaker. ''But we also must remember that rebuilding after Sandy isn't the only pressing concern.''

HEADLINE: Two Soldiers Die in Clashes In Kashmir, India Says

BYLINE: By DECLAN WALSH; Ismail Khan contributed reporting from Peshawar, Pakistan.

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Indian and Pakistani soldiers traded gunfire in the disputed territory of Kashmir for the second time in three days on Tuesday, this time leading to Indian claims that the Pakistanis had killed two Indian soldiers.
The surge in fatal combat is a troubling development in Kashmir, a disputed mountainous area that has been a focus of bitter tensions between the neighbors over six decades. A cease-fire has been in place for almost 10 years.
But while both sides have exchanged angry accusations of cross-border infiltration, the flare-ups have received muted news coverage and showed few signs of escalating into a diplomatic crisis. 
The Indian military said fighting erupted on Tuesday on its side of the de facto border, known as the Line of Control, when an Indian patrol clashed with Pakistani soldiers who had crept across under cover of fog. The Pakistanis retreated after a brief firefight in which two Indian soldiers were killed, an Indian Army officer said.
''The government of India considers the incident as a provocative action, and we condemn it,'' the Indian Defense Ministry said in a statement. ''The government will take up the incident with the Pakistan government. We expect Islamabad to honor the cease-fire agreement strictly.''
Pakistan's military quickly rejected that version of events. A military official, speaking on the customary condition of anonymity, called it ''Indian propaganda'' to divert attention from a clash on Sunday in which a Pakistani soldier reportedly died.
''Pakistan military officials deny Indian allegation of unprovoked firing,'' the official said in a text message sent to journalists. The official military spokesman was not available for further comment.
It is difficult to discern the truth about clashes in the heights of Kashmir, partly because the terrain is so rugged and remote, but mostly because the area is tightly militarized on both sides and is largely out of bounds for reporters.
But the latest salvo of physical and public relations exchanges did highlight the emotional pull of the Kashmir conflict for the militaries in both countries, which have fought two major wars over the territory. Less clear was whether the skirmishes would have any effect on broader bilateral political and economic initiatives.
After high-level diplomatic visits over the past year, the rivals have loosened visa restrictions for business travelers and have taken tentative steps to unlock vast trade potential. The advances have come at a time when Pakistani public opinion has been largely preoccupied with anger toward the United States, particularly after the American commando raid in Abbottabad that killed Osama bin Laden in May 2011.
Tensions have eased significantly in recent months, but a rise in American drone strikes against militant targets in the tribal belt, which continued on Tuesday, could threaten that.
Early Tuesday, remotely piloted aircraft controlled by the Central Intelligence Agency killed at least 12 people in two separate attacks in North Waziristan, the main hub of militant activity, said a senior security official based in the tribal belt. It was the fourth of day of drone attacks this month, a sharp escalation over the strike rate late last year.
In the first episode, several drones fired on a house in the Mir Ali district, killing eight people, including Sheik Yasin al-Kuwaiti, a senior figure in Al Qaeda, said the official, who spoke on the customary condition of anonymity. ''Eight missiles were fired into the compound where he was living with his family,'' the official said. ''The house has been turned into rubble.''
Fifteen minutes later, a second strike on another house in the same area killed four people and wounded two, local tribesmen said. All of the dead were described as local Islamist militants.

HEADLINE: A Bold Dissenter at the Fed, Hoping His Doubts Are Wrong

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
RICHMOND, Va. -- Jeffrey M. Lacker, the Federal Reserve's most persistent internal critic, does not much resemble a firebrand. He is personally cheerful, professionally inclined to see both sides of an issue and quick to acknowledge he may not be right. He says he would rather be wrong.
But for the last several years, Mr. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, has warned repeatedly that the central bank's extraordinary efforts to stimulate growth are ineffective and inappropriate and, worst of all, that the Fed is undermining its hard-won ability to control inflation.
Last year, Mr. Lacker cast the sole dissenting vote at each of the eight meetings of the Fed's policy-making committee, only the third time in history a Fed official dissented so regularly. 
''We're at the limits of our understanding of how monetary policy affects the economy,'' Mr. Lacker said in a recent interview in his office atop the bank's skyscraper here. ''Sometimes when you test the limits you find out where the limits are by breaking through and going too far.''
As the Fed enters the sixth year of its campaign to revitalize the economy, the debate between the Fed's majority and Mr. Lacker -- whose views are shared by others inside the central bank, as well as some outside observers -- highlights the extent to which the Fed is operating in uncharted territory, making choices that have few precedents, unclear benefits and uncertain consequences.
The economy continues to muddle along, shadowed by the threat of another government breakdown, and the crisis of high unemployment is only slowly receding. But in trying to address those problems by suppressing interest rates, the Fed risks the unleashing of speculation and inflation.
It is basically a matter of disposition: is it better to risk doing too much, or not enough?
Mr. Lacker, 57, often uses the word ''humility'' in describing his views. He means that the Fed should recognize that its power to stimulate the economy is limited, both for technical reasons and because it should not encroach on the domain of elected officials by picking winners and losers.
As he sees it, the Fed's current effort to reduce unemployment by purchasing mortgage-backed securities crossed both lines. He sees little evidence that it will help to create jobs. And he says that buying mortgage bonds is a form of fiscal policy, because it lowers interest rates for a particular kind of borrower.
But Mr. Lacker is at pains to emphasize that his disagreement with the other 11 members of the Federal Open Market Committee, who supported the purchases, is not about the need for help.
''It's very unfair to think of me as not caring about the unemployed,'' he said. ''It just seems to me that there are real impediments, that just throwing money at the economy is unlikely to solve the problems that are keeping a 55-year-old furniture worker from finding a good competitive job.''
That sense of caution is deeply frustrating to proponents of the Fed's recent efforts. The economists Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer wrote in a paper published last month that such pessimism about the power of monetary policy is ''the most dangerous idea in Federal Reserve history.''
''The view that hubris can cause central bankers to do great harm clearly has an important element of truth,'' wrote the Romers, both professors at the University of California, Berkeley. ''But the hundred years of Federal Reserve history show that humility can also cause large harms.''
It also makes an interesting contrast with Mr. Lacker's personality. His favorite escape is driving a Porsche Boxster racecar; a model sits on a shelf at his office. He jokes that the track is the only place that people don't ask him about interest rates -- although, he adds, they do care about fuel prices.
And at the Fed, an institution that likes consensus, dissenting also requires a certain amount of boldness. Mr. Lacker has now said no at 13 of the 24 regular policy meetings he has attended as a voting member, one-third of all dissents since Ben S. Bernanke became the Fed's chairman in 2006. He voted in 2006, 2009 and 2012 as part of the regular rotation of reserve bank presidents.
Even some who sympathize with his concerns doubt the efficacy of such public stands.
''The Fed is a club and dissenting puts you outside the club,'' said Allen H. Meltzer, a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University who is a leading historian of the central bank. ''You send the message to the public and that's a good thing, but you also send a message inside the Fed and that's not a good thing. You are isolating yourself.''
But Gary H. Stern, who served as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis from 1985 until 2009, said that the dissents were valuable.
''If you have a forceful and compelling rationale, I think that is constructive internally and externally,'' Mr. Stern said. ''I think the Fed obviously has been in my opinion dealt a difficult hand. To some extent the waters are uncharted. It would be in a way remarkable if you had unanimity under these circumstances and I think Jeff's concerns about what the Fed can accomplish in this environment and what the risks on the inflation side may be, I think that those points need to be taken seriously.''
Mr. Lacker joined the Richmond Fed as an economist in 1989 after working as a professor at Purdue University. The regional reserve banks tend to gather like-minded economists, and Richmond has a long tradition of skepticism about monetary policy.
He became president in 2004, in an era of complacent satisfaction for central bankers, who took credit for a period of extraordinary economic stability that Mr. Bernanke and others called ''The Great Moderation.'' Mr. Lacker recalled that he regarded the major questions of monetary policy as settled.
''I thought we'd converged around a good healthy framework where the range of debate was going to be limited,'' he said. ''I was wrong about that.''
He continued to agree with Mr. Bernanke and the majority of the committee about some things. He dissented only once during 2009, otherwise voting with the majority in support of the Fed's efforts to stimulate the economy by suppressing interest rates and buying Treasury securities. He also supports Mr. Bernanke's efforts to increase transparency; he sees his own efforts to explain his dissents as part of the broader work of demystifying monetary policy.
Given the consequences if he's right, does he ever worry that he's not shouting loudly enough?
''I haven't been running around like my hair's on fire,'' he said. ''And I think for me that reflects some humility. I'm not absolutely certain that the risks I worry about are going to show up. The majority of the committee, and the course they're on, they could be right.''
''And,'' he said, ''I sincerely hope that they are right.''

HEADLINE: Q. and A. With Former U.S. Commander in Afghanistan

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As the Obama administration weighs how many troops to keep in Afghanistan after 2014, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal cautioned that the United States still needs to keep forces there to help stabilize the country and urged a continued effort to advise the Afghan military that appears to be more extensive than the White House has in mind.
''If we allow Afghanistan to become completely unstable, Pakistan's stability is really difficult,'' the former American commander in Afghanistan said in a recent interview. ''So I think there's a geostrategic argument for it.''
General McChrystal offered his analysis of Afghanistan in the interview, which coincided with the release of his book ''My Share of the Task: A Memoir,'' published by Portfolio/Penguin. 
The general, who is retired from the Army, was fired by President Obama from his post in 2010 after an article in Rolling Stone quoted him and his staff as making dismissive comments about the White House.
His comments come as Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president, is scheduled to begin a series of high-level meetings this week in Washington.
Regarding Afghanistan, some analysts have urged that the United States rely mainly on small numbers of commandos to carry out raids against Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups.
But General McChrystal asserted that such ''counterterrorism'' operations work best when they are coupled with ''counterinsurgency'' efforts to build up the ability of the host nation to govern and bolster the capability of its forces.
He also noted that to carry out commando raids, the American military needs bases, an intelligence network and arrangements for medical evacuation. ''But if you don't have the support of the Afghan people, if you are just in there doing what you want to do on their terrain, there's no reason for them to be supportive of this,'' he said. ''We'd be fighting our own war on their territory, and they're just not that interested in that.''
On troop numbers, General McChrystal declined to say how many troops the United States might need to keep in Afghanistan after 2014. (The White House is considering retaining a force of 3,000 to 9,000 troops, which would be complemented by a much smaller number of troops from other NATO nations).
General McChrystal agreed that the American force, currently 66,000 troops, should be substantially reduced. But he cautioned advised against retaining too small a force.
''We had 7,500 in Afghanistan in the summer of 2002 when I was first stationed there,'' he said. ''And 7,500 wouldn't do much.''
An important question for the NATO mission after 2014 is what level of the Afghan military hierarchy would allied nations advise. Under the largest of the troop options under consideration by the White House, it is generally expected that NATO would advise seven regional Afghan Army corps and several regional Afghan police headquarters.
It is unlikely that NATO officers will advise Afghan battalions on the battlefield under this option as that would require many more advisers than the alliance is likely to muster.
But General McChrystal suggested that a more extensive advisery effort was needed to make the Afghan military more effective. ''My personal tendency would be to get advisers a little bit lower than corps; I'd want them down to battalion level,'' he said.
General McChrystal said he voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 but declined to say whom he had voted for in 2012. He would not discuss the Rolling Stone article in detail but insisted that he had intended no disrespect for the president or his aides.
After the article was published, General McChrystal said that he arrived at his fateful meeting with Mr. Obama on June 23, 2010, with his resignation in hand. The decision whether to accept it was up to the president.
''I walked in with it in my pocket and I said, 'Whatever's best for the mission,''' General McChrystal recalled. ''And we had a good conversation and then he said he was going to accept it.''
The interview was conducted at General McChrystal's consulting firm in Alexandria, Va., which has the trappings of a military headquarters, including a horseshoe-shape table for the general and his staff facing an array of wall clocks that showed the time in political and economic power centers: Washington, London, Dubai and Beijing.
Following are excerpts from interview. Some questions have been edited.
QUESTION: You wrote in your book that there was a ''deficit of trust'' between the White House and the Defense Department on Afghanistan at the start of the Obama administration. Did this exist during the Bush administration?
GENERAL McCHRYSTAL: I think with the beginning of any political administration, you have to build trust, and it takes time. The challenge that we faced with the arrival of the Obama administration is, they didn't really have time to build trust before they had to make big, difficult decisions.
I go back and think of President Kennedy, who had a military service background, but he comes into the presidency and he's faced with a decision on the Bay of Pigs, with the C.I.A. and the military giving him data, and it turns out very badly. It really set back their ability to build trust over time.
With the start of the Obama administration, we had a financial crisis, we had a new administration, and yet we had this compressed decision-making timeline on Afghanistan before people had been able to mature relationships and trust to go at this as effectively as I think they would have liked to.
Q. Do you think the trust has improved?
A. I think it's a problem that needs to be worked at.
Q. During the Afghanistan review you conducted in 2009, the options ranged from sending 80,000 troops on the high end and 40,000 as your recommended course of action. President Obama decided to send 30,000 American troops and to seek 10,000 troops from allied nations. Did those allied contributions materialize, and did this meet your requirement?
A. In December, when the president made the decision, I thought that I had generally gotten what I had asked for. I was concerned about the allied 10,000, and at the end of the day I'm not sure how many of those came. ... I know there was an intent to get the full 10,000.
Q. How did you design and carry out your strategy in Afghanistan?
A. I went over there with the expectation that we didn't need additional forces. ... We did an operational assessment, and we identified 80 key districts out of 364 in the country. ... It was a little like David Plouffe might do for an election strategy: those places that make a big difference.
We assessed that if we could control -- achieve a decent level of security -- in those 80 key districts over a reasonable period of time, that would be enough to make the Taliban strategy irrelevant. They wouldn't be able to influence enough of the population enough of the time to win. We thought we'd be able to ''change Afghan perceptions,'' which of course was the key thing.
So we did the analysis, and we ran computer runs over and over. And we came down to that we were going to need the equivalent of 40,000 more forces to give us enough bridge capability until we could grow Afghan forces. ...
Q. How did you interpret the mission in Afghanistan at that point?
A. At that point, I thought the primary focus was to keep Afghanistan from being a potential safe haven for Al Qaeda, but it also said that we were to create, essentially, a stable Afghanistan. Implied in that was, the state of Afghanistan had to survive as a sovereign state. To do that, you had to solve the biggest problem, which was this uncertainty caused by this insurgency. There was no way to cure the patient partially. You had to cure the patient ''mostly'' to do that. And I thought everybody understood that.
Q. How did you determine the sequencing of the strategy geographically and in terms of fighting seasons?
A. The war in Afghanistan is all about people's minds. It is not a military campaign like World War II. So you're trying first to convince the Afghan people that this is going to succeed, and as you go over time they'll be able to solve the problem.
When I took over, the forces that had been approved for General McKiernan [Gen. David D. McKiernan, the former American commander in Afghanistan] were already focused and had begun to arrive into Helmand. Helmand was the area with the highest levels of violence. ... I made the decision that we needed to continue with that strategy for several reasons.
First, we needed to take advantage of the forces. If -- if I tried to change them elsewhere, it would take me time to figure out where. It would take time to build, and it would be months to change. I didn't think we had months. We had the election coming up in August, and those forces had been brought to help secure certain areas for the election. ... If we could secure the Helmand River Valley, it was going to be a clear indication that, if the Taliban couldn't be effective in their heartland, they weren't going to be effective elsewhere. ...
Now, there was a certain argument that says, ''Why don't you go to Kandahar first?'' Well, the first thing: Kandahar wasn't under siege. Kandahar wasn't about to fall. ... So we made a decision to use the next set of forces to secure Kandahar -- not to capture it, because it wasn't enemy-controlled, but to secure it.
We felt that that would tremendously increase confidence, particularly in the Pashtun south, which we needed.
Q. How did eastern Afghanistan fit into your strategy?
A. The east was important -- obviously, Kunar, Nuristan and all were important. And if you consider the host area and the Haqqani network [a militant group based in Pakistan and Afghanistan] it's their key -- they affect Kabul. RC-East [Regional Command East], the U.S. division there, the 82nd and then the 101st, they needed additional forces but they were in pretty good shape. I thought that, if anybody could continue to make progress without additionalforces initially, they could.
Q. Did you intend to shift effort there later?
A. Yes, as we achieved what we wanted in Helmand and Kandahar, I felt we could continue to increase forces in the east and, if necessary, in the north, although I was hoping to arrest the problem in the north partially by arresting it elsewhere.
Q. What did you accomplish by the end of your Afghanistan tour?
A. When I arrived in 2009 ... there was this sense of gloom. The allies that I talked to were literally saying, ''Let's get ready to turn the lights out.''
I think we turned the mind-set, not completely, but we changed the mind-set of the ISAF forces [the International Security Assistance Force, the American-led NATO command in Afghanistan] towards protecting the population -- not 100 percent but a huge shift toward effective counterinsurgency.
We changed the mind-set of the Afghans in several ways. We continued to affect President Karzai's view of it. He didn't become a robust, war-fighting president, but he went a lot farther than he ever had before.
We started to build the Afghan National Police and the army in a very serious way.
Q. How did this affect Pakistan's behavior?
A. It was in their interest for us to succeed, and I think they knew that, but they didn't think we were going to succeed. So their actions were often in contradiction to what they wanted to happen, because they felt we were going to lose and were trying to hedge their bets by doing other things. They were supporting the Haqqanis, they were allowing the Afghan Taliban to have refuge inside Pakistan and things like that -- pretty clearly.
I was trying to convince the Pakistanis that we were going to pull this off, so it was in their interest to help us. And I think we convinced them we were moving in the right direction -- General Kayani [Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the Pakistani Army chief] told me face to face, ''I think you've got the right strategy now.''
Q. What did you accomplish on the ground?
A. Two things. One, we don't write a lot about it in the book, but we increased the pressure through our special operations. We quadrupled them, and we started the pressure that had worked so well in Iraq. But it only worked in Iraq, really, when we were complemented by an effective counterinsurgency effort. So what I was trying to do here was, increase that in a precision way and help tamp down the enemy network while we got the counterinsurgency part going as well.
I think in areas like Helmand and -- it was just starting, when I left, in Kandahar -- we did make progress. If you go down to the Helmand River Valley now, it's very different. ... We thought we had to prove to people that counterinsurgency worked in Afghanistan. I think we proved part of that.
Q. Which part?
A. That the military part of counterinsurgency works in Afghanistan. ... I don't think it's proven yet that the government of Afghanistan could rise to meet what they have to do. Because if they can't do it, another pillar of counterinsurgency is missing, and you have to have it.
Q. There is a sense that Afghanistan is a lost cause.
A. In fall 2001, there had been 22, 23 years of constant turmoil inside the country. They'd lost 1.2 million Afghans during the Soviet war. They had this big diaspora of people leaving. The memory of what happened during the civil war, '92 to '96, the first part of it -- that's deeply etched on people, particularly inside Kabul. We kind of gloss over it, we go, ''Yeah, that civil war ended, move on.'' It was as long as our civil war, and 40,000 people were killed in Kabul by [former mujahedeen commander Gulbuddin] Hekmatyar's shelling. People had deep animosities, hatreds and what not that came from that era. And the Taliban era was, of course, problematic at best. ... If a country can be psychologically damaged, Afghanistan was psychologically damaged. ... My biggest criticism of all of us is that we didn't make a great effort to understand that. ... We didn't really say, ''This is a badly abused nation, and helping this get on its feet is going to be a long-term, difficult, expensive project.''
Q. What is our stake today?
A. I think it's both emotional and geostrategic. I'll start with the emotional part. The emotional part is, we did come in. We fought Al Qaeda, and threw apart their government. And we did incur a certain responsibility there. We raised expectations as well. We raised expectations for the 15 million Afghan females, that they might have a different future. We raised expectations of Afghan children that they'd be able to go to school, and all of these things. They may have been unrealistic expectations, but we raised them. ...
I think that, over time, there's been a certain cynicism that has risen, by people in the U.S., that ''It's so hard, and the Afghans won't help themselves, and the Pakistanis can't be trusted -- we should just stay away from that.''
And there's been a cynicism on the part of people in the region, saying: ''You use us when it's helpful. You use us when Henry Kissinger needs to sneak into China in 1971, or you use us when you need the Northern Alliance to overthrow the Taliban so you can get at Al Qaeda, or you use us when you need to fight the Soviet Union during the cold war -- but you don't help when you don't need us.'' That's sort of the emotional part of it. ...
I don't think there are many places in the world that ''don't matter'' anymore. ... If we allow Afghanistan to become completely unstable, Pakistan's stability is really difficult. ... So I think there's a geostrategic argument for it.
Q. Is it possible to succeed in Afghanistan today?
A. I believe it can succeed for several reasons: one, the Taliban are not really very strong. They're not a popular National Liberation Front, they don't bring a compelling narrative of a better future. In fact, they are antithetical to what a certain percentage of the Afghan population wants. The more educated part, the females, don't want a Taliban regime. ... Having said that, Afghanistan has got to take a multiethnic society with some huge fissures in it, meld that back into a country. And it's been a nation before. The idea that it hasn't is incorrect, in my view. ... They've got this level of corruption which undermines and corrodes the legitimacy of everyone. Anyone in a position of power is either corrupt or assumed to be corrupt, and the assumption of corruption is as bad as the reality of it.
Q. Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president, is going to be here next week. Can the United States work with him?
A. I might put myself inside the Afghan government and say, ''Can they work with the United States?'' And they might write equally interesting memos about the challenges of working with us. ...
My opinion is, we have to stop any idea that says, ''Well, we don't like Karzai -- let's get another." Stop. They elected him -- you can argue about the election, but I believe they did elect him. There's a lot of corruption, but I think he would have been the winner anyway. So that's the first thing and we've got to respect that. ...
I think President Karzai's successor is unclear. I don't see any heir apparent, and that's a little disturbing to me.
Q. Can one maintain a counterterrorism capability in Afghanistan without a complementary counterinsurgency effort?
A. If you take the raid into Abbotabad, that was years of gathering intelligence, some on the ground, some in the air, some signals intelligence. It was launched from bases -- not just a single base, it needed a network. It had medevac available. It had this infrastructure that supported it that isn't seen by people who just look at a couple helicopters landing in a compound.
CT [counterterrorism] typically requires that. ... Otherwise, it's really, really hard. It's like trying to do Desert One that was going to go into Tehran. ...
If you don't have the support of the Afghan people. ... There's no reason for them to be supportive of this. ... I think any country where we're just launching from or operating within becomes a target for the terrorists, too. And then they have a legitimate reason to go, ''What's in it for us?''
Q. For counterterrorism efforts to be effective, you need to do more than counterterrorism?
A. The most important CT thing you can do is strengthen the countries it's operating in. Terrorism is two things: it's a symptom of frustration, but it also operates in areas that are less governed and can't deal with it. So you have to try to create places where you have enough stability in the government where they can provide for the people and you're not causing terrorists to grow, or not encouraging terrorists. ...
What we need is a stable Afghanistan. ... I personally think there's going to be a military component that I urge be mostly enabling for the institution building, and them doing most of the fighting. I think it's trainers, logistics support, institutions, leadership, things like that. I don't think it's a huge footprint on the ground. I would be very reticent to put a lot there because of the resistance to it, there's a negative side. And helping the governance get better.
Q. The White House is considering keeping 3,000 to 9,000 troops in Afghanistan after 2014. What can one accomplish with 3,000 or 6,000 or 9,000 troops?
A. I honestly haven't done the math on it. We had 7,500 in Afghanistan in the summer of 2002 when I was first stationed there. And 7,500 wouldn't do much, because by the time you had a pretty small headquarters at Bagram, you were running the airfield, you had some people starting to train A.N.S.F. (Afghan National Security Forces). ... Pretty soon you don't have much reach.
Q. What is needed politically?
A. It goes back to, ''What do you think the mission is? What are you trying to do?'' If you make the decision that Afghanistan is a strategic, important priority for the U.S. and we're going to have a reasonable level of effort...that doesn't end the civilian requirement. That doesn't end the requirement for governance help or U.S.A.I.D.-kind of assistance. It actually opens the way for it.
Q. Do the Afghans want that?
A. I thought that they did. I thought there was a great thirst for stable, credible government at the local level. Now, sometimes it's the eye of the beholder. ... But I think the average Afghan desperately wants that.
Q. Was Afghanistan worth it?
A. I think it should have been done differently from the beginning. ... People ask me what we should have done, and I say, ''On Sept. 12, 2001, we should have sent 10,000 people to language school.''

HEADLINE: Nashville's Latest Big Hit Could Be the City Itself

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
NASHVILLE -- Portland knows the feeling. Austin had it once, too. So did Dallas. Even Las Vegas enjoyed a brief moment as the nation's ''it'' city.
Now, it's Nashville's turn.
Here in a city once embarrassed by its Grand Ole Opry roots, a place that sat on the sidelines while its Southern sisters boomed economically, it is hard to find a resident who does not break into the goofy grin of the newly popular when the subject of Nashville's status comes up.
Mayor Karl Dean, a Democrat in his second term, is the head cheerleader.
''It's good to be Nashville right now,'' he said during a recent tour of his favorite civic sites, the biggest of which is a publicly financed gamble: a new $623 million downtown convention center complex that is the one of the most expensive public projects in Tennessee history. 
The city remains traditionally Southern in its sensibility, but it has taken on the luster of the current. On a Venn diagram, the place where conservative Christians and hipsters overlap would be today's Nashville.
Flush with young new residents and alive with immigrants, tourists and music, the city made its way to the top of all kinds of lists in 2012.
A Gallup poll ranked it in the top five regions for job growth. A national entrepreneurs' group called it one of the best places to begin a technology start-up. Critics admire its growing food scene. GQ magazine declared it simply ''Nowville.''
And then there is the television show. ''Nashville,'' a song-filled ABC drama about two warring country divas, had its premiere in October with nine million viewers. It appears to be doing for the city of 610,000 people what the prime-time soap opera ''Dallas'' did for that Texas city in the '80s.
''You can't buy that,'' Mr. Dean said. ''The city looks great in it.''
Different regions capture the nation's fancy for different reasons. Sometimes, as with Silicon Valley, innovation and economic engines drive it. Other times, it's a bold civic event, like the Olympics, or a cultural wave, like the way grunge music elevated Seattle.
Here in a fast-growing metropolitan region with more than 1.6 million people, the ingredients for Nashville's rise are as much economic as they are cultural and, critics worry, could be as fleeting as its fame.
''People are too smug about how fortunate we are now,'' said the Southern journalist John Egerton, 77, who has lived in Nashville since the 1970s.
''We ought to be paying more attention to how many people we have who are ill-fed and ill-housed and ill-educated,'' he said.
Many will argue that the city's schools need improvement, and although it remains more progressive on social issues than Tennessee as a whole, the city, with its largely white population, still struggles with a legacy of segregation and has had public battles over immigration and sexual orientation.From an economic standpoint, it has been a measured rise. When the housing boom hit the South, Nashville, long a sleepy capital city with a Bible Belt sensibility, did not reap the financial gains seen in cities like Atlanta, whose metropolitan region is more than three times its size.
But Nashville's modest growth meant a softer fall and a quicker path out of recession. By July 2012, real estate closings were up 28 percent over the previous year. Unemployment in Davidson County, which includes Nashville, is about 5.7 percent, compared with 7.8 percent nationally, and job growth is predicted to rise by 18 percent in next five years, said Garrett Harper, vice president for research with the Nashville Chamber of Commerce.
He and others attribute Nashville's stability and current economic health to a staid mix of employers in fields like health care management, religious publishing, car manufacturing and higher education, led by Vanderbilt University.
By some estimates, half of the nation's health care plans are run by companies in the Nashville area.
''Health care is countercyclical,'' Mr. Harper said. ''It inoculates the city against a lot of the winds that blow.''
But the music industry is the bedrock of Nashville's economy. In the past two decades, country music has grown into a national darling. The city has attracted musicians and producers whose work moves beyond the twang and heartache.
On a recent evening, Nashville's once-seedy honky-tonk district was jammed with young hopefuls pulling guitars out of Hondas, a bus from ''America's Got Talent'' and Aerosmith fans heading to the Bridgestone Arena.
It is not uncommon to see the power couple Keith Urban and Nicole Kidman show up at a popular restaurant, or to pass Vince Gill on the street.
Music celebrities are attracted to a state with no income tax and a ready-made talent pool. But they also just like it.
Jennifer Nettles, of the country duo Sugarland, spent 17 years in Atlanta and has been dipping in and out of New York and Nashville for years. She recently bought a farm here, had a baby and is settling in with her husband, Justin Miller.
''Part of what is really attractive about Nashville right now is that it isn't Atlanta, and I love Atlanta,'' she said. ''There's a bit of charm and a richness a city the size of Nashville allows for.''
As if to underscore Nashville's position in the nation's musical hierarchy, the city hosted the annual Grammy nomination concert in December. It was the first time the show was not held in Los Angeles.
But to be a truly great city, some skeptics argue, it has to be a place that tends to its residents first and tourists second.
The city's politicians are banking on the tourists. At the center of the plan is the Music City Center, a huge convention center whose main section is shaped like a giant guitar laid on its back.
It sits on 19 downtown acres and is attached to both the Country Music Hall of Fame and an 800-room, $270 million Omni Hotel, which is expected to open in the fall.
To pay for it all, the city offered generous tax breaks and based public financing on increased hotel and rental car fees and taxes. To lure the hotel, for example, the city discounted property taxes by more than 60 percent for 25 years.
The idea was to help the city land bigger conventions, like the National Rifle Association conference, which will bring 48,000 people to the city in 2015.
But using generous economic incentives and relying on conventions has been called an outdated economic strategy.
''This was probably a good idea in 1985. And probably a good idea in 1995, said Emily Evans, a member of the region's Metropolitan Council. ''But in 2012, the momentum for that kind of economic development has past.''
She once called the convention center a ''riverboat gamble.''
''In giving away your tax base for the purpose of expanding your tax base in the future,'' Ms. Evans said, ''you make it difficult to deliver on the fundamentals, the things that make your city livable, like parks and roads and schools.''
Mr. Dean, a former city lawyer who became mayor in 2007 and led the city's recovery from historic floods in 2010, said the project, which got under way during the recession, has been a fight every step of the way.
''The gains for the city are real and tangible,'' he said.
The mayor has orchestrated more than a dozen tax incentive deals over the past few years. Most recently, he arranged a $66 million incentive package to help the health care giant HCA Holdings move part of its Nashville operations to new midtown high-rise buildings.
He acknowledges that more needs to be done on transportation and education, but in the meantime, he, like most of Nashville's residents, is enjoying its ride.
''I love the rhythm of this town and the pace of it and the tone of it,'' said Mr. Egerton, the writer. ''I think Nashville is a big unfinished song.''

HEADLINE: Health Care And Profits, A Poor Mix

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
Thirty years ago, Bonnie Svarstad and Chester Bond of the School of Pharmacy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison discovered an interesting pattern in the use of sedatives at nursing homes in the south of the state.
Patients entering church-affiliated nonprofit homes were prescribed drugs roughly as often as those entering profit-making ''proprietary'' institutions. But patients in proprietary homes received, on average, more than four times the dose of patients at nonprofits.
Writing about his colleagues' research in his 1988 book ''The Nonprofit Economy,'' the economist Burton Weisbrod provided a straightforward explanation: ''differences in the pursuit of profit.'' Sedatives are cheap, Mr. Weisbrod noted. ''Less expensive than, say, giving special attention to more active patients who need to be kept busy.''
This behavior was hardly surprising. Hospitals run for profit are also less likely than nonprofit and government-run institutions to offer services like home health care and psychiatric emergency care, which are not as profitable as open-heart surgery. 
A shareholder might even applaud the creativity with which profit-seeking institutions go about seeking profit. But the consequences of this pursuit might not be so great for other stakeholders in the system -- patients, for instance. One study found that patients' mortality rates spiked when nonprofit hospitals switched to become profit-making, and their staff levels declined.
These profit-maximizing tactics point to a troubling conflict of interest that goes beyond the private delivery of health care. They raise a broader, more important question: How much should we rely on the private sector to satisfy broad social needs?
From health to pensions to education, the United States relies on private enterprise more than pretty much every other advanced, industrial nation to provide essential social services. The government pays Medicare Advantage plans to deliver health care to aging Americans. It provides a tax break to encourage employers to cover workers under 65.
Businesses devote almost 6 percent of the nation's economic output to pay for health insurance for their employees. This amounts to nine times similar private spending on health benefits across the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, on average. Private plans cover more than a third of pension benefits. The average for 30 countries in the O.E.C.D. is just over one-fifth.
We let the private sector handle tasks other countries would never dream of moving outside the government's purview. Consider bail bondsmen and their rugged sidekicks, the bounty hunters.
American TV audiences may reminisce fondly about Lee Majors in ''The Fall Guy'' chasing bad guys in a souped-up GMC truck -- a cheap way to get felons to court. People in most other nations see them as an undue commercial intrusion into the criminal justice system that discriminates against the poor.
Our reliance on private enterprise to provide the most essential services stems, in part, from a more narrow understanding of our collective responsibility to provide social goods. Private American health care has stood out for decades among industrial nations, where public universal coverage has long been considered a right of citizenship. But our faith in private solutions also draws on an ingrained belief that big government serves too many disparate objectives and must cater to too many conflicting interests to deliver services fairly and effectively.
Our trust appears undeserved, however. Our track record suggests that handing over responsibility for social goals to private enterprise is providing us with social goods of lower quality, distributed more inequitably and at a higher cost than if government delivered or paid for them directly.
The government's most expensive housing support program -- it will cost about $140 billion this year -- is a tax break for individuals to buy homes on the private market.
According to the Tax Policy Center, this break will benefit only 20 percent of mostly well-to-do taxpayers, and most economists agree that it does nothing to further its purported goal of increasing homeownership. Tax breaks for private pensions also mostly benefit the wealthy. And 401(k) plans are riskier and costlier to administer than Social Security.
From the high administrative costs incurred by health insurers to screen out sick patients to the array of expensive treatments prescribed by doctors who earn more money for every treatment they provide, our private health care industry provides perhaps the clearest illustration of how the profit motive can send incentives astray.
By many objective measures, the mostly private American system delivers worse value for money than every other in the developed world. We spend nearly 18 percent of the nation's economic output on health care and still manage to leave tens of millions of Americans without adequate access to care.
Britain gets universal coverage for 10 percent of gross domestic product. Germany and France for 12 percent. What's more, our free market for health services produces no better health than the public health care systems in other advanced nations. On some measures -- infant mortality, for instance -- it does much worse.
In a way, private delivery of health care misleads Americans about the financial burdens they must bear to lead an adequate existence. If they were to consider the additional private spending on health care as a form of tax -- an indispensable cost to live a healthy life -- the nation's tax bill would rise to about 31 percent from 25 percent of the nation's G.D.P. -- much closer to the 34 percent average across the O.E.C.D.
A quarter of a century ago, a belief swept across America that we could reduce the ballooning costs of the government's health care entitlements just by handing over their management to the private sector. Private companies would have a strong incentive to identify and wipe out wasteful treatment. They could encourage healthy lifestyles among beneficiaries, lowering use of costly care. Competition for government contracts would keep the overall price down.
We now know this didn't work as advertised. Competition wasn't as robust as hoped. Health maintenance organizations didn't keep costs in check, and they spent heavily on administration and screening to enroll only the healthiest, most profitable beneficiaries.
One study of Medicare spending found that the program saved no money by relying on H.M.O.'s. Another found that moving Medicaid recipients into H.M.O.'s increased the average cost per beneficiary by 12 percent with no improvement in the quality of care for the poor. Two years ago, President Obama's health care law cut almost $150 billion from Medicare simply by reducing payments to private plans that provide similar care to plain vanilla Medicare at a higher cost.
Today, again, entitlements are at the center of the national debate. Our elected officials are consumed by slashing a budget deficit that is expected to balloon over coming decades. With both Democrats and Republicans unwilling to raise taxes on the middle class, the discussion is quickly boiling down to how deeply entitlements must be cut.
We may want to broaden the debate. The relevant question is how best we can serve our social needs at the lowest possible cost. One answer is that we have a lot of room to do better. Improving the delivery of social services like health care and pensions may be possible without increasing the burden on American families, simply by removing the profit motive from the equation.

HEADLINE: Historic Power Plant in Providence, R.I., May Get Another Chance at an Encore

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH ABBOTT

 BODY:
PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- As the new year dawns on Rhode Island's capital city, a place still suffering a hangover from the recession, there is renewed interest in a waterfront building that has been vacant since plans to create a museum and hotel there collapsed in 2008.
Known popularly as Dynamo House -- the name for the failed project begun in 2007 by Baltimore-based developer Struever Brothers Eccles & Rouse -- the building is a former power plant on the National Register of Historic Places, with distinctive arched windows and thick brick walls. 
Until recently, plans called for a 55,000-square-foot Rhode Island history museum that would be affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution in a portion of the old power plant. The Heritage Harbor Museum was to showcase Rhode Island's diverse ethnic and cultural history and was the cherished dream of more than a dozen local cultural organizations.
But now that dream and the future of Dynamo House itself are in flux.
The property sits tangled in litigation. In recent weeks, the head of the nonprofit group that partnered with Struever Brothers and was overseeing the museum project said a museum in the former power plant was no longer feasible.
Museum economics have changed considerably in the last five years, said Ken Orenstein, interim executive director of the nonprofit group, Heritage Harbor Corporation. ''The building plan is not viable,'' Mr. Orenstein said.
At the same time, a new investment group named Dynamo House Funding L.L.C., which is affiliated with the Baltimore-based Harbor East Development Group, has taken over Struever Brothers' position in the property by acquiring the developer's mortgage with Citibank. It plans to secure the building and make it fit for a different type of development, Mr. Orenstein said.
According to James S. Bennett, director of economic development for Providence, ''serious'' possible tenants have looked at the building in recent months, though he declined to say who they were. Sources knowledgeable about the site said that Brown University might be interested since Dynamo House is in the city's Jewelry District, where Brown has expanded in recent years.
Mr. Bennett said the city had made finding a new use for the building a priority, and would not consider the alternative: ''It's not going to be torn down,'' he said.
The new group is in the process of trying to clear the property's title, which was muddied by mechanics' liens after Struever Brothers left Providence in 2009, leaving several subcontractors unpaid. It also must remove an easement on the property, which states that a museum must be built on the site, Mr. Bennett said.
To that end, negotiations are under way between Dynamo House Funding and Heritage Harbor over the value of the easement, and efforts are being made to reach out to the subcontractors in Rhode Island to whom Struever Brothers owes money. According to records in Providence Superior Court, a dozen or so individuals and companies contend that Struever Brothers never paid them for work they did on Dynamo House.
''It was a big mess,'' said Joseph J. Reale Jr., a Providence lawyer who represents two of the subcontractors seeking payment.
Struever Brothers originally planned a $137 million conversion of the power plant, including the development of a ''five star'' waterfront hotel. In a 2007 agreement, Heritage Harbor gave Struever Brothers title to the property in exchange for development of the museum space.
But, walloped by a sinking economy, Struever Brothers abandoned the project. Construction had started in 2007, but didn't last long; for the last four years, the property has been vacant and exposed to the elements.
C. William Struever, a principal partner in Struever Brothers and the company's founder, said the Dynamo House project was ''very sad for me'' and a ''heartache'' because his company could not complete it. He said he was happy the new entity would step in to make the property usable. He said he was optimistic for the city and would do what he could in his limited capacity to see Dynamo House rehabilitated.
A prominent East Coast developer that specializes in the adaptive reuse of abandoned industrial buildings, Struever Brothers had a number of projects under way in Rhode Island in 2007, in addition to Dynamo House. These included mill renovations in the town of West Warwick and a $300 million mixed-use project in Providence.
But by 2008, when work stopped at Dynamo House and at other Struever projects here, it became apparent that the developer was experiencing financial trouble. Eventually, Struever Brothers defaulted on nearly $6 million in loans. In Providence, the company laid off workers and shut down its office in 2009.
Some people say they were mistreated by Struever Brothers, ''and other people say they did some good things for the city,'' said John Sinnott, who was let go from his position as Rhode Island director of operations for the company in June 2008.
Before the company's fortunes soured, Struever Brothers had successfully rehabilitated several blighted properties in Rhode Island, including three former mill buildings in Providence. In the mid-2000s, Struever Brothers' Web site estimated its investment in the state to be $500 million.
A 2008 change to Rhode Island's historic tax credit program, which provides a financial benefit to developers of historic properties, created a shortfall in the project's funding.
Mr. Struever once estimated the gap at $9 million. Struever Brothers' lender on a $23 million construction loan, Citibank, stopped making disbursement on the Dynamo House project in 2009.
Advocates for the museum said they understand that the recession created unforeseeable problems for Struever Brothers, though they wish the developer had been more forthcoming, and sooner, about its financial difficulties.
''I don't agree with the way they walked away from the project,'' said Patrick Conley, a Providence lawyer and member of Heritage Harbor's board.
The nonprofit has had to redefine its goals because of the aborted Dynamo House project, Mr. Conley and others said.
Now, instead of building a museum, it will create a foundation to further its mission of educating Rhode Islanders about their history.
Mr. Struever has opened a new development firm in Baltimore, called Cross Street Partners, which won a $3 million grant from the state of Maryland in 2011 to convert a former printing plant in Baltimore.

HEADLINE: Rhode Island Likely to Lose a House Seat

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
It may seem early to be thinking about the redistribution of House seats that will take place after the Census in 2020, but one state, Rhode Island, is being forced to because its population is declining.
The tiny state was already singled out a year ago as one likely to lose one of its two House seats in 2020 after the Census Bureau released its estimated population figures.
Now, there is further evidence that Rhode Island's second seat could be on the chopping block. 
According to population estimates released last month, only two states -- Rhode Island and Vermont -- lost people from July 2011 to July 2012. Vermont lost more (581) than Rhode Island (354), but Vermont already has only one House seat. All states are required to have at least one.
Since 2004, Rhode Island has lost more than 24,000 people, surpassing, according to The Providence Journal, any of its previous decade-to-decade losses. The population in July was estimated to be 1,050,000.
William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, said it was unlikely that Rhode Island would continue to lose people at that same rapid rate. ''The long-term scenario will be at best tepid population gain,'' he said. But as the national economy improves, people will continue to leave.
''It's quite likely that the state could lose a Congressional seat, as it barely retained its second seat after the past census,'' Mr. Frey added. ''If it loses its second seat, it will be the first time the state had one seat since 1793.''
For three decades, starting in 1912, Rhode Island had three House seats. A state's population helps determine the amount of federal money it receives, and the number of House seats determines the number of electoral votes each state has in presidential elections.
Other states like New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Illinois could also be on track to lose a seat in 2020 because their population growth is not as strong as that in the mountain west and the southeast.
The biggest winner after the 2020 Census is likely to be Texas, which at this rate is projected to gain three seats; California and Florida are each likely to gain one.
Susan Strate, population estimates program manager at the University of Massachusetts Donahue Institute, attributed the population drain in Rhode Island to a combination of factors.
''There were more deaths, fewer births, an older population and a general outflow of people to the South and the West that's been happening for years,'' she said, though the number of births still exceeds the number of deaths.
Also, she said, the points of entry for immigrants to this country have shifted over the years away from the Northeast, which used to be where immigrants first settled. All of these factors mean there are fewer people of childbearing age in the state to replenish the population.
Edward M. Mazze, a former dean and current business professor at the College of Business Administration at the University of Rhode Island, said the lack of jobs and high taxes had also driven some residents away.
When he used to raise money for the college, he said, he spent much of his time in Florida because so many people from Rhode Island had moved there. ''Naples, Fla., is known as Rhode Island of the South,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Analysts Skeptical as Majority Owner Takes Role as Chief Executive of Sears

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Just hours after a board discussion on Monday, a note went out to Sears Holdings employees from Edward S. Lampert, the company's majority owner and chairman, that he would now be its chief executive.
''I believe in our company,'' Mr. Lampert wrote.
But not everyone shares his optimism.
Seven years after he engineered the merger of Sears and Kmart, Mr. Lampert's plans for the company face a new round of skepticism.
On Monday, Sears announced that its chief executive of two years, Louis J. D'Ambrosio, would be stepping aside because of a health issue in his family and that Mr. Lampert would assume the role. Despite the unexpected departure, Sears is not expected to change course. 
''The reality is, Eddie's been running the company the whole time,'' said Gary Balter, an analyst at Credit Suisse.
Mr. Lampert once stepped back from day-to-day management, but more recently he has increased involvement in Sears as he has scaled back his influence on other investments. He maintains an office at Sears headquarters in Hoffman Estates, Ill., although he lives on the East Coast.
If employees ''wanted to make merchandising decisions, they had to fly up to Connecticut to get approval from Eddie. He was making day-to-day decisions in this company, and clearly he's making the capital decisions,'' Mr. Balter said.
But Mr. Lampert is a money man, not a merchant, and analysts question his plans for reviving Sears, which has faltered since he combined Sears and Kmart. It has valuable assets, they say, but sales and profitability continue to slide. In his most recent chairman's letter, Mr. Lampert outlined some ways he wanted to take Sears forward, including building on its loyalty program and expanding what he called ''integrated'' options -- allowing shoppers to buy online, in stores, via mobile devices or a combination. He highlighted Sears's liquidity options and its ownership of and access to cash from Lands' End, the clothing retailer Sears bought in 2002, and its real estate, ''should the circumstances warrant.'' He further wrote, ''We do not expect to utilize or execute all of these options,'' but he said he wanted to reassure vendors.
''If you're unwilling to try new things, and to fail and learn, you don't have a shot,'' Mr. Lampert said in an interview last year. ''That doesn't mean you're going to be successful, but you have to try to change.''
Mr. Lampert's new role as chief executive of a struggling company is a new one for him.
When he was younger, Mr. Lampert made a name for himself with his fast rise through the ranks at Goldman Sachs, his brash courtship of Wall Street idols like Richard Rainwater and Robert Rubin and, when he started his investment fund ESL Investments in 1988, the high returns at the fund. He invested in struggling retailers like AutoNation and AutoZone in the 1990s and early 2000s, then bought a controlling stake in Kmart when it was in bankruptcy. In 2005, he completed the merger with Sears.
And, adding some Hollywood flair to the story line, after being kidnapped at gunpoint from a parking garage in 2003, Mr. Lampert, after being held for about 30 hours, managed to negotiate his own release.
Fortune called the billionaire ''the best investor of his generation.'' Bloomberg Businessweek asked if he was ''The Next Warren Buffett?''
But Sears value has declined since then. His initial idea was to combine the best of Sears and Kmart and sell some appealing locations to competitors. But the recession meant the real estate was no longer in demand, and now many large retailers are downsizing or closing stores.
As the real estate options diminished, Sears was losing sales. The people Mr. Lampert hired to run the company were not retailers, and instead had backgrounds in fast food, supply chains and technology.
Sears's sales have declined for five straight years, and its market capitalization now is 15 percent of what it was at the beginning of 2006. In the third quarter, the company lost $498 million, up from $410 million for the same quarter in 2011. Sales fell by $548 million, to $8.9 billion.
In the last year, Mr. Lampert has directed a cleanup of the balance sheet. He sold some valuable real estate, spun off business units and reduced inventory to assuage liquidity concerns after a dismal 2011 holiday sales season.
This year, it spun off a profitable hardware retail division and part of its stake in Sears Canada.
In February, the company said it would sell some of its most profitable stores in exchange for cash. General Growth Properties, the mall operator, bought 11 properties for $270 million, including a Sears in a highly profitable high-end mall in Hawaii. The problem, though, is once it gets rid of its best properties, Sears is left with middling stores in lower-traffic locations.
And it is not putting money into stores at the rate that competitors are. Its capital expenditures in 2011, its most recent full fiscal year, were about 1 percent of sales. Wal-Mart, by contrast, spent about 2.5 percent of sales on capital expenditures in its most recent fiscal year and Target spent about 3.5 percent of sales.
Mr. D'Ambrosio made some improvements to stores that analysts applauded. He hired Ron Boire, formerly of Toys ''R'' Us and Brookstone, to lead merchandising and stores, expanded a loyalty program and equipped clerks with technological tools. And with his arrival, capital expenditures -- money spent on store remodeling, among other things -- ticked up slightly.
''They've underspent for years in terms of keeping their stores fresh and new looking and appealing to consumers, but there were signs of progress in the last few quarters. The margins were getting better, sales were getting better,'' said Evan Mann, senior high-yield analyst at Gimme Credit, a bond research service.
Online sales are a bright spot. Those increased 20 percent for Kmart and Sears combined in the nine weeks ended Dec. 29, the company said Monday. And Sears's apparel business appeared to be benefiting from J. C. Penney's stumbles, Mr. Mann said. The company said Monday that the apparel category at Sears's domestic stores is expected to have its sixth consecutive quarter of increases in sales at stores open at least a year.
Still, those figures are overshadowed by over all revenue and profitability declines at Sears.
These days, Mr. Lampert, 50, appears more subdued. Recently, he has largely avoided the press; the company rarely holds conference calls for analysts, a standard practice among retailers. Sears declined to make Mr. D'Ambrosio or Mr. Lampert available for interviews on Tuesday. Last spring, Mr. Lampert moved from Connecticut to Florida, buying a house off Biscayne Bay for a reported $40 million. He still looks for under-the-radar deals, apparently; the house was not on the market.

HEADLINE: Fed Up With Banks

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
Like many people, Josh Reich got fed up with his bank after it charged him overdraft fees and he endured painful customer service calls to fight them. But unlike most people, Mr. Reich, a software engineer from Australia, decided to come up with a better way to bank.
Mr. Reich and a co-founder, Shamir Karkal, created Simple, an online banking start-up company based in Portland, Ore., that offers its customers free checking accounts and data-rich analysis of their transactions and spending habits. 
Few entrepreneurs dare to set their sights on industries as large and entrenched as banking and expect to flourish. But Mr. Reich, 34, a professed data nerd who has built computers and tinkered with the innards of sophisticated cameras, holds a master's degree in business and has a robust background in financial data analysis. He is confident that Simple's minimalist approach -- it promises not to charge any fees for any services -- will draw fans and customers.
''Banks make money by keeping customers confused,'' Mr. Reich said. ''There's no incentives to make the experience better.''
Of course, inviting people to trust a start-up with their money is a lot to ask. The company, which began signing up customers late last year in a deliberately slow fashion, now has 20,000 and has processed transactions worth more than $200 million.
It also has the backing of prominent venture capital firms including Shasta Ventures, SV Angel and IA Ventures and has raised more than $13 million. Simple has few, if any, direct competitors, although some services like SmartyPig and Mint offer analysis of bank accounts and financial transactions.
Simple is actually not a bank. It has deals with CBW Bank and Bancorp, federally insured banks, to hold its customers' money.
And it has built slick apps for the Web and mobile devices to give customers an overview of their accounts and transactions. But it encourages customers to treat it as a bank, closing their more traditional accounts and only using Simple.
The company's biggest challenge, banking analysts say, will be to persuade people to give it a try.
''It is extremely difficult to get consumers to change and leave their banks,'' said Jacob Jegher, an analyst at Celent, a research and consulting firm. ''Plus, although they are not a bank, they still operate like a financial institution, and they will face challenges that big banks have decades of experience with.''
After the financial crisis, smaller community banks and credit unions gained customers eager for alternatives to larger corporate banks. Experts say Simple could attract those customers as well.
Early adopters are warming to the service; during a speech last fall at a conference aimed at technology enthusiasts, designers and creative people, Mr. Reich asked how many in attendance were Simple customers. A majority of the crowd raised hands.
Mr. Reich said Simple was keeping its first group of customers small to allow it to work out any kinks. (Already there have been some flaws, like one that briefly locked several users out of their accounts in November.) At this stage, those who want a Simple account have to request an invitation on its site, though these are handed out fairly liberally to those who meet the minimal qualifications of Simple and its bank partners.
Customers receive a plain white card that can be used like a debit card. The company offers most traditional banking features, like direct deposit and money transfers. But there is plenty it does not offer, like joint or business checking accounts, or paper checkbooks, which may be a deal killer for some.
The start-up does not have physical bank branches or automated teller machines, nor does it plan to build any. As a result, Simple customers cannot make cash deposits and must rely on the Internet and phone for service.
Simple tries to make up for what it does not have with modern software design and data analysis.
Each Simple transaction is tagged with detailed information that allows customers to search their accounts with plain English commands like ''Show me how much I spent on meals over $30 last month,'' or ''Show me how much money I spent on gifts in December.''
Customers can see transactions plotted on a map or search for all transactions in a particular state or country, something that would be difficult with a traditional bank account.
''Banks throw out a lot of data,'' Mr. Reich said. ''There are 80 fields of data per transaction, and banks only show you a few: the dollar amount, the place and the date. We can use much more than that to let people have real-time financial data.'' The general approach is intended to appeal to technically adept people who are tuned into the rising interest in analyzing one's personal data and behavior, as captured by tracking tools like Nike Plus and Jawbone's Up bracelet.
In the same way that such tools can help people learn more about their physical activity and how many hours a night they sleep, Simple hopes to offer insights into spending behavior.
Simple will have to expand to survive. It makes money by earning interest on the cash it carries and from interchange fees, which it gets from each swipe of the card. It will require a large enough base of deposits and customers to cover its costs.
And there is always the risk that Simple's greatest advantage -- its data tools -- could be copied by competitors, Mr. Jegher, the Celent analyst, said: ''Can they get to critical mass before banks catch up with their own digital tools to offer a competing experience?''
Some of Simple's early users are big fans, like Chris Lanphear, 30, a Web developer in Fort Collins, Colo., who signed up in July.
Mr. Lanphear said he had been hesitant to try Simple at first because of the company's lack of physical infrastructure, ''but then I realized it doesn't ensure better service if you see the face of the person you are talking to.''
He said he had been impressed with Simple's quick responses, via phone and e-mail, to questions about transactions and charges. The tracking features helped him realize he was spending too much on dining out, so he decided to cut back.
Mr. Lanphear was impressed enough to move over to Simple and close his old bank account. ''I figured it couldn't be worse than the alternatives,'' he said. ''But it's actually turning out to be much better.''

HEADLINE: An Extended Family, Sharing Extended Pain

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
Trouble comes in surging waves for the men and women in ''Water by the Spoonful,'' the Pulitzer Prize-winning play by Quiara Alegría Hudes that is making its New York premiere at the Second Stage Theater. Almost all the characters in this moving collage of lives in crisis have a grim history -- and maybe a grimmer future -- of substance abuse. Often their addictions have cost them dearly, leading to poverty, isolation and unbridgeable chasms between once-loving parents and children.
And yet for a drama peopled by characters who have traveled a long way in the dark, ''Water by the Spoonful'' gives off a shimmering, sustaining warmth. Ms. Hudes writes with such empathy and vibrant humor about people helping one another to face down their demons that regeneration and renewal always seem to be just around the corner.
The most prominent strand in the play's multilayered plot concerns the continuing struggles of Elliot Ortiz (Armando Riesco), a former Marine who was wounded during a brief tour in Iraq. An aspiring actor who is scraping together a living working at a Subway sandwich shop, Elliot walks with a limp, even after multiple surgeries, and is plagued by nightmares about a traumatic encounter with a civilian in Iraq. 
He lives in Philadelphia with the aunt who raised him. Now Elliot has become her caretaker as her death approaches. Elliot's older cousin Yaz (Zabryna Guevara) mostly offers emotional support. Although she is the kid from their extended Puerto Rican family who made good, teaching music at Swarthmore, the stress of an impending divorce has distracted her from offering the help Elliot could sorely use. Only when Elliot's aunt finally succumbs does Yaz find herself drawn back into the turbulent family drama, as arrangements for the funeral must be made.
Scenes depicting Elliot and Yaz trying to keep their lives on a steady course in the shadow of loss alternate with dispatches from cyberspace, exchanges among four people on a chat forum for recovering crack addicts. The administrator -- her online handle is Haikumom (Liza Colón-Zayas) -- tries to keep the peace in this sometimes fractious group, as when a newbie, John (Bill Heck), enters the conversation with a long post about how his Saturday-only addiction is interfering with his otherwise glittering life: a lovely wife and son, and a big bank account, thanks to the sale of a company he started.
His complacency about his problem riles two chat room participants: Clayton (Frankie Faison), a middle-aged I.R.S. worker in San Diego, and a young woman, Madeleine (Sue Jean Kim), who's just returned from the digital void to announce that she's three months sober and has moved to Japan, where she was born before being adopted by an American family, to kick-start her life.
The two strands of the plot are connected when it is revealed that Haikumom is Odessa, a long-estranged member of the Ortiz family. She learns of the death of her relative -- a beloved figure in the local Puerto Rican neighborhood -- when she reads of it in the paper.
''Water by the Spoonful'' is the second in a trilogy of plays by Ms. Hudes centering on the Ortiz family. (The first, ''Elliot, a Soldier's Fugue,'' was a finalist for the Pulitzer, and the final installment, ''The Happiest Song Plays Last,'' is to be produced at the Goodman Theater this spring.)
Although this play's focus is comparatively broad -- the half-dozen primary characters are all given fully developed, overlapping story lines -- Ms. Hudes writes with precision and economy, so that the play doesn't feel unwieldy or overstuffed. (What does feel oppressive, unfortunately, is Neil Patel's unattractive set.)
The dovetailing of some of the stories does occasionally seem too pat: the growing friendship between Madeleine and Clayton, resulting in his impulsive trip to Japan, I found a little romanticized. But they all illuminate the play's dominant theme, the myriad ways in which human lives can intersect, and the potentially great rewards -- or irreparable damage -- that can result from the unlikely spark of those connections.
For Elliot, the mother-child bond was brutally sundered when he was just a boy, and yet the wound remains raw. And Odessa's impulsive desire to connect with John -- she defends him when he comes in for verbal strafing on the Web forum -- brings them into surprising intimacy, arrestingly depicted in the play's tender final image.
Under the direction of Davis McCallum, who also staged the premiere production in 2011 at Hartford Stage, the play's fine performers breathe richly felt life into their roles. Mr. Riesco's movingly drawn Elliot has the life-toughened exterior of a young man who is keeping his anxieties under tight but tenuous control. (Mr. Riesco portrayed the same character in the 2006 New York premiere of ''Soldier's Fugue.'')
As Yaz, Ms. Guevara exudes a brisk competence that occasionally falters to reveal the harassed insecurity of a woman who has had to fight to grasp every opportunity life has tossed her way.
The static quality of the scenes that are ''set'' online is mostly erased by animated performances from Mr. Heck (''Angels in America,'' ''The Orphans' Home Cycle''), as the upper-middle-class striver in secret thrall to an unlikely (for him) drug; Ms. Kim as the exuberant Madeleine, whose comfort in her online connections has given way to a yearning need for a more tangible relationship; and Mr. Faison's avuncular Clayton, who has all but resigned himself to a life of solitude after his grown son's rejection. (Still, there are moments when the character's off-line activities make it unlikely that they would also be tapping away online simultaneously.)
In a brief scene depicting one of Yaz's lectures, she tries to impress on her students the beauty of John Coltrane's music. Playing a snippet from his 1964 composition ''A Love Supreme,'' she speaks of how he uses dissonance as ''a gateway to resolution.'' A year later, she says, his ideas had evolved, so that ''the ugliness bore no promise of a happy ending.''
''Water by the Spoonful'' could be said to occupy the territory somewhere between those two strategies. Resolution remains tentative for most of the characters, and while the promise of a happy ending is in sight for at least some of them, all have learned from hard experience that people break promises as often as they keep them.

HEADLINE: A Mind-Boggling Claim

 BODY:
The board of the American International Group will meet on Wednesday to consider joining a misguided lawsuit against the government, which spent $182 billion to save the insurance giant from near certain failure. 
As part of its fiduciary duty, the board is required to consider the suit, but it would be well advised to vote against joining the case, which was initiated by the company's former top executive, Maurice Greenberg. Mr. Greenberg argues that the government put onerous terms on its bailout, hurting the interests of shareholders of the company, including him.
It is unclear exactly what Mr. Greenberg, who left A.I.G. in 2005 but remained a big shareholder in the company, thinks he will achieve with the $25 billion lawsuit. He and his lawyers have argued that the government's terms violated the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against taking of private property for ''public use, without just compensation.'' They assert the 14 percent interest rate the Federal Reserve Bank of New York charged on its loans to A.I.G. were punitive and that the government unfairly diluted the holdings of shareholders like Mr. Greenberg, who along with affiliated investors owned about 12 percent of the company before the bailout.
The case has been filed in courts in Washington and New York. In Washington, it is being heard in United States Court of Federal Claims. The Federal District Court in New York dismissed the case in November, a ruling that is now before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
The allegations ignore the fact that in September 2008 when the government stepped in to help A.I.G., no private investors were willing to finance the company, which many feared had been made insolvent by its enormous bets on mortgage-related investments. In fact, just four months before the bailout, Mr. Greenberg himself described the situation at the company as a ''crisis.'' Had the Treasury and Federal Reserve not stepped in, A.I.G. would have filed for bankruptcy protection, wiping out its shareholders and institutions that it did business with.
If Mr. Greenberg and A.I.G. are truly interested in holding someone to account for the losses that the company's shareholders have suffered, they should look within. Why not sue the executives who pushed the company into making toxic investments or the board members who did a poor job supervising management? They are far more responsible for the losses the shareholders suffered than the government, which cleaned up the mess at a substantial risk to taxpayers.
The Treasury recently sold its remaining stake in the company for more than it invested, but it could very well have suffered huge losses had the Obama administration and Congress not taken steps to stabilize the economy and the housing market.
A.I.G. should be praising, not suing, the government. And, in fact, the company has been running TV ads thanking the country for coming to its rescue . A.I.G.'s directors should keep those ads and the history of the bailout in mind when they meet on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Menstrual Shame and Superstitions in India

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''The Taboo of Menstruation,'' by Rose George (Op-Ed, Dec. 29), sheds a welcome light on the unfortunate effects of menstrual superstitions and ignorance in parts of India. Unfortunately, similar taboos with similar debilitating outcomes exist in other regions saddled with the kinds of anti-women prejudices from which such practices are derived. 
And lest those of us from America and other technologically advanced countries become too smug in believing that we are liberated from the peculiar notions identified in the article, we need to recognize that many girls here grow up either uninformed or misinformed about the menstrual cycle and feel the same kind of shame or embarrassment about their periods.
While it is heartening to hear about progressive efforts on the menstrual front in India, it is important to advance that cause in every country where girls are taught to feel that their bodies are tainted once a month.
DAVID LINTON New York, Dec. 29, 2012
The writer, a professor of communication arts at Marymount Manhattan College, is editor of the newsletter of the Society for Menstrual Cycle Research.
To the Editor:
Rose George is to be commended for bringing ''The Taboo of Menstruation'' to a broad audience. It is just one of myriad issues that women and girls are facing today in India.
Sexual abuse, rape, and lack of proper nutrition, access to education and counseling are keeping millions of women and girls from reaching their potential and are in clear violation of their human rights. The public demonstrations now taking place in India, over the death of a woman who was gang-raped, are bringing global attention to these issues.
India has contributed to and driven globalization in the areas of culture, technology, literature and research. Now attention must be turned to those women and girls who have so much potential, yet are being left behind economically.
ELIZABETH HOWARD ZOE TIMMS New York, Dec. 31, 2012
The writers are, respectively, president and founder/director of the Women's Education Project.
To the Editor:
My grandmother in India refused to let her daughters or daughters-in-law enter the kitchen or visit the temple during their menstrual periods because it was considered genuinely disrespectful and unhygienic. My wife and daughters today ignore the taboo of menstruation.
While things are slowly changing, religious institutions among Hindus, Jains and Buddhists in America and India can take a proactive role in rejecting this taboo. Scholars and leaders at temples need to discuss the issue openly and encourage women to abandon the old practices and men to advocate on behalf of their mothers, wives, daughters and sisters. The taboo of menstruation has no correlation to disrespect or impure hygiene.
MANOJ JAIN Memphis, Jan. 3, 2013
The writer is an infectious diseases doctor and a member of the Jain community in North America.

HEADLINE: Texas Budget Surplus Proves as Contentious As a Previous Shortfall

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Tex. -- The last time Texas lawmakers began a legislative session, a cost-cutting fervor filled the marble hallways of the Capitol in January 2011 as the state faced a budget shortfall of as much as $27 billion. Legislators warned of sparing nothing and no one from deep cutbacks -- from highways, to prisons, to health care for the poor, to programs for preschool children.
Two years later, as lawmakers met Tuesday for the opening of the Legislature, the state's financial picture was not nearly as dire. A boom in revenues from sales taxes as well as taxes from oil and natural gas production have given Texas a budget surplus that the state comptroller has estimated at $8.8 billion.
But the question of what to do with the surplus is proving just as contentious as debate over the shortfall two years ago, and will most likely frame much of the wrangling throughout the fast-paced 140-day regular session. 
Republican and Democratic members of the State House and Senate have offered competing visions of how to use the surplus and how the state should respond to rapid population growth, severe drought, the federal health care overhaul and a host of other issues.
Education advocates and Democratic lawmakers have called for the Legislature to restore some or all of the $5.4 billion cuts made to public education in the 2011 session. But Republican leaders and other fiscal conservatives have expressed reluctance to finance anything beyond growth in student enrollment particularly when a lawsuit against the state over how it finances public education will not be resolved until later in the year.
''I think there's going to be a group of people who think we've got the money, we need to spend it,'' said Representative Jim Pitts, Republican of Waxahachie and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. ''I think there's going to be a group of people who think we need to cut our budget more. The session could be very difficult because of those two groups of people pushing us.''
Shortly after noon inside the Capitol's Senate chamber, Gov. Rick Perry told senators that the comptroller's revenue estimate released the day before was good news, but cautioned them to retain the state's fiscally conservative model. Mr. Perry has called on lawmakers to support his so-called Texas Budget Compact, a Tea Party-style pledge to oppose new taxes and to replace the current spending limit for the state budget with an even stricter formula.
''There are interests all across the state who view Monday's revenue estimates as the equivalent of ringing the dinner bell,'' Mr. Perry said, adding, ''However, in the face of that kind of pressure, we have to remember that Monday's revenue estimate represents not a chance to spend freely, but an opportunity to rededicate ourselves to the very policies that have made Texas economically strong.''
Mr. Perry's speech rankled some Democrats, who described the increased revenues as a ''so-called surplus,'' because services for public education, health care and other programs had been slashed statewide. ''That's why you raise revenue -- to spend it wisely,'' said Senator John Whitmire, a Houston Democrat. ''There's not a state agency in this state that is being adequately funded. Higher ed, public ed, social services, highways, parks -- all of them are hurting. You shouldn't start out by saying, 'No.' No is not a program.''
Mr. Perry's remarks to the senators were interrupted briefly when a member of Mr. Whitmire's staff who had been standing at the back of the chamber collapsed. Senators and others rushed to help her, but she appeared to be unharmed. When Mr. Perry stepped to the microphone again, he quipped, to applause and laughter, ''I have not had that kind of impact on anyone in a long time.''
Mr. Perry has been busy building up his political capital, and perhaps his own ego, after his unsuccessful campaign for president. He has indicated that he is considering running for re-election in 2014 and has not ruled out making another run for the White House in 2016. His influence over the Legislature in light of his possible future campaigns remains an unknown factor as the session gets under way, but many believe his stumble on the national stage has not set him back in his home state.
''He now looks a little more human maybe after his presidential run,'' said Michael Quinn Sullivan, the president of Texans for Fiscal Responsibility. ''But don't confuse looking human with looking weak. The governor is still the governor.''
In Texas, lawmakers convene every other year and set state spending in a two-year budget cycle. While the 83rd Legislature was already being called one of the state's most inexperienced -- with nearly 50 first-time legislators in the House and Senate -- it was also described by some as likely to be one of the most conservative. Republican leaders, including Mr. Perry, have expressed support for a so-called ''fetal pain'' bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. In addition, lawmakers have proposed requiring those applying for welfare and unemployment benefits to undergo drug testing and allowing teachers who are licensed to carry concealed handguns to wear their weapons in the classroom.
But aside from those proposals, the surplus has allowed the Legislature to focus on issues that have often been pushed aside in leaner budget times, including seeking new ways to finance long-delayed infrastructure projects, like the building of roads and reservoirs.
Though they lost their supermajority in the House in the November elections, Republicans continue to control both chambers of the Legislature and to hold every statewide elected office. But the tone of the session will likely be set not only by numbers, but by the political dynamics at play.
The far-right agenda of grass-roots and Tea Party activists has come to dominate the Republican Party in Texas, turning moderate Republicans into an endangered species for the most part. Mainstream Republicans are likely to use the legislative session to bolster their conservative credentials, particularly after Ted Cruz, a Tea Party favorite, defeated one of the state's most powerful Republicans, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, in a United States Senate race last year.
Mr. Dewhurst, who presides over the Senate as lieutenant governor and has indicated he plans to run for re-election, said that his campaign taught him a number of things -- including doing a better job communicating his accomplishments to voters -- but that his conservative record was impeccable. ''To be up in Washington as a freshman senator in which nothing's going to go on, you're going to have gridlock so noisy you can't hear,'' he said. ''I'm glad to be here.''

HEADLINE: Unemployment Rises to a New High in Euro Zone

BYLINE: By MELISSA EDDY and DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
BERLIN -- Unemployment in the euro zone rose to a new high in November, according to data released Tuesday that also showed that the troubles in the 17-nation currency bloc were straining its strongest member, Germany.
The euro zone jobless rate rose to 11.8 percent in November from 11.7 percent in October, according to Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union. Eurostat estimated that 18.8 million people in the euro zone were unemployed in November, two million more than a year earlier.
Germany has provided momentum to the European economy over the past three years, as strong exports protected the country from the crisis.
But on Tuesday, the Federal Statistics Office in Berlin said that German exports declined 3.4 percent while imports slid 3.7 percent in November from a month earlier. The weakness narrowed Germany's trade surplus to &#x20ac;14.6 billion, or $19 billion. 
German factory orders also fell in November amid weak demand from outside the euro area, the Economy Ministry said Tuesday. Orders, adjusted for seasonal swings and inflation, slid 1.8 percent from October, when they jumped 3.8 percent.
''The November numbers are not a one-off but an extension of the current trend of weakening exports,'' Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING, wrote in a research note Tuesday. He pointed out that German exports had fallen about 4 percent since May.
''Today's data confirmed our view that exports should have turned from driver of growth into drag on growth,'' he wrote.
A separate report from Eurostat showed that retail sales fell 2.6 percent in November from a year earlier, though they gained 0.1 percent from October.
The gloomy reports come as the Governing Council of the European Central Bank prepares to hold a policy meeting Thursday, followed by an interest-rate announcement. Despite a sharp decline in bank lending reported last week, which had some analysts suggesting that the central bank might try new steps to stimulate the economy, economists surveyed by Reuters said they expected the E.C.B. to leave policy unchanged in January as it waited for a clearer picture of economic conditions.
Like their counterparts in the United States, Japan and Britain, the monetary authorities in the euro zone have already opened the spigots, allowing banks to borrow essentially as much as they want at the benchmark rate. Mario Draghi, president of the E.C.B., has pledged to do whatever is necessary to ensure the stability of the euro, including, if needed, buying the sovereign bonds of Spain and Italy to hold their borrowing costs to sustainable levels.
The president of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, said Monday in Lisbon that ''the existential threat against the euro has essentially been overcome. ''
''In 2013 the question won't be if the euro will, or will not, implode,'' he said.
The central bank's actions have succeeded in calming markets and driving down government bond yields for embattled countries. The European Commission reported Tuesday that an index of economic sentiment in the euro zone had improved by 1.3 points in December, to 87. ''Economic sentiment in the euro area improved among consumers and across all sectors, except retail trade,'' the commission reported.
Gilles Moëc, an economist at Deutsche Bank in London, said the data Tuesday were consistent with expectations that the euro zone economy would remain in recession through the winter, with the unemployment rate possibly rising to as high as 12.4 percent.
''We're still far below the level of growth that would stabilize the labor market,'' he said.
But he added that the commission's report on economic sentiments, as well as recent surveys of purchasing managers, suggested that the downturn in the manufacturing sector had ''bottomed out,'' making possible a return to growth later in the year.
''External demand seems to be holding up better than we had thought,'' Mr. Moëc said. ''Now we are to a large extent dependent on what happens in the United States,'' he added, referring to the negotiations on spending.
Europe also got a vote of confidence from Tokyo on Tuesday, as Finance Minister Taro Aso said Japan would buy bonds of the European Stability Mechanism, the euro zone bailout fund, as well as sovereign debt in the currency zone.
''The financial stability of Europe will help the stability of foreign exchange rates, including the yen,'' Mr. Aso was quoted by the Nikkei newspaper as saying.
Attacking joblessness may require governments to ease back on austerity measures that many economists, including some at the International Monetary Fund, say might have gone too far. In France, President François Hollande has vowed to turn around the flagging labor market, where, according to Eurostat, unemployment was 10.5 percent in November.
Eurostat said Spain, which is suffering from the collapse of a real estate bubble and the impact of a raft of tough austerity measures, had the highest unemployment rate in the bloc, at 26.6 percent. Greece, where the sovereign debt crisis began, was next at 26 percent, according to data released in September. The lowest rates were in Austria, at 4.5 percent; Luxembourg, at 5.1 percent; and Germany, at 5.4 percent.
Worryingly, youth unemployment in the euro zone continued to grow, with 5.8 million people under age 25 classified as jobless in November, up 420,000 from a year earlier.
The Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras, who was in Berlin for talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday, singled out youth unemployment as one of the biggest challenges Greece faces in reviving its economy. But he said at a news conference before meeting the chancellor that, over all, he was positive.
''I see the glass half-full,'' Mr. Samaras said before taking part in an economic conference in Berlin. ''We're delivering and Europe's helping.''
It was the Greek prime minister's second trip to Berlin since taking office. The mood appeared lighter than during his visit in August, which came on the heels of calls from within Ms. Merkel's government for Greece to leave the common currency.
Greece is focusing its efforts on winning back the trust of Europeans, as well as the markets, Mr. Samaras said. But he emphasized that high unemployment, especially among young people, weighed heavily on Greeks.
''I would like to make it clear up front that our country is making enormous efforts and many are paying a high price, in order to get things back on track,'' Mr. Samaras said.
Ms. Merkel said that Greece's European partners must continue to support the country. She was perhaps wary of the fragility of Mr. Samaras's three-party coalition government, which has been pushing through deeply unpopular reforms.
''We also must do everything to guarantee economic growth, security and jobs,'' Ms. Merkel said.
David Jolly reported from Paris. James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels and Hiroko Tabuchi from Tokyo.

HEADLINE: Macau's Gaming Take: Sign of Chinese Emigration?

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: Are Macau's fast-rising gambling revenues a sign of a expanding Chinese economy or of shrinking confidence among wealthy Chinese who may be "washing" their money in order to emigrate? Or both? 

 BODY:
BEIJING - Why did gambling boom in Macau in 2012, even as China's economy slowed? A Hong Kong online magazine that follows the scene closely has a smart take: emigration. 
First, the facts. Last year, Macau earned $38 billion from gaming, a 13.5 percent increase from the $33.5 billion in 2011.
"Let's put some perspective on the record $38 billion in gaming revenues collected by Macau's casino industry in 2012," wrote the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Jan. 2. 
Macau has long outstripped Las Vegas in terms of revenue, and the 2012 figure "is higher than the $35.64 billion collected by the entire U.S. commercial casino industry in 2011," the Review-Journal wrote.
"During December, Macau's 35 casinos collected a single-month record of $3.5 billion in gaming revenues, more than half of what the Strip's casinos collected in all of 2011," it wrote.
Pretty astonishing stuff, especially in a year when the growth of the Chinese economy actually fell to a three-year low of 7.4 percent in the third quarter. 
Excluding some kind of inverse psychological relationship between growth and gambling, where people might actually enjoy risking their money in a falling economy, the surge in gambling revenue didn't seem to make sense. 
Week in China, a Hong Kong online news magazine, suggests something quite different and fascinating: with so many rich Chinese using the casinos to wash money to finance their emigration to other countries, the gambling take is actually a bellwether of confidence among rich Chinese in their country, the magazine says. In this scenario, the higher the take, the lower the confidence.
As my colleague, Ian Johnson, wrote recently, rich Chinese are emigrating in ever higher numbers 
"In 2010, the last year for which complete statistics are available, 508,000 Chinese left for the 34 developed countries that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development," Ian wrote. "That is a 45 percent increase over 2000."
"Individual countries report the trend continuing. In 2011, the United States received 87,000 permanent residents from China, up from 70,000 the year before," Ian wrote.
Hence the higher spending in Macau, as people move their money from China to overseas, even though the government has forecast something of a recovery and 7.5 percent growth for 2013. 
Reasons for emigration vary, but a key one cited by many is that they feel their money isn't safe in China where the rule of law is weak and where, as one aspiring emigre put it to the immigration lawyer Mikael Charette, "You can be a tiger, but there is always a hunter somewhere," as I reported in a Letter from China back in 2010.
It all "makes more sense when you realize Macau offers an escape route for 'smart money' to leave the country," Week in China wrote.
"Once this cash reaches the casinos - helped by some financial engineering from the junket operators - it becomes Hong Kong dollars. Much is gambled but plenty also flows into banks offshore," Week in China wrote.
Junkets?
These are the middlemen who locate wealthy Chinese on the mainland who want to gamble, or, some say, move their money overseas. Aided by a financial commission, they get the money to Macau where the wealthy hit the casinos and, in this scenario, move the rest out in convertible foreign currency. 
As Week in China wrote in early 2012: "So if gaming revenues continue to surge this year it's a safe bet that corrupt officials and savvy businesspeople are feeling fearful about the future and are getting their money out."
Surge they did. 
Of course, China's economy is still growing fast and that means quite a lot of people just have more money to play with. But by any standards, Macau's gambling take in 2012 was extremely high, and came in a year with considerable political uncertainty as China experienced a once-in-a-decade leadership changeover, a major political scandal in the shape of the fall of Bo Xilai, and warnings against corruption by the new leader, Xi Jinping. Sign of a growing economy, or, as Week in China says, a growing loss of confidence?

HEADLINE: The Labor Market Post-Budget Deal

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: The recently enacted budget compromise, which increased taxes and extended unemployment benefits, is unlikely to help the labor market this year, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
Federal taxes and spending rules were scheduled to expire at the end of 2012, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act, passed last week, established new ones. As a result, it is unlikely that the United States labor market will grow in 2013.
Fiscal policy primarily affects the labor market in the short term by shaping the reward for working and producing. (Government employment also has obvious aggregate employment effects in the short term, as it did with its temporary Census hiring in 2010, but federal hiring or firing on that scale was not discussed in connection with the new legislation.) 
It is helpful to summarize the important policy effects on the labor market from workers' perspectives in terms of marginal tax rates. By that I mean the extra taxes paid (counting subsidies as a negative tax paid) by people when they work compared with when they do not work, expressed as a ratio to total employee compensation when working.
Policies that raise the marginal tax rate reduce the reward to working and vice versa. Many government programs contribute to the marginal tax rate, including, but not limited to, the personal income tax.

The most widely discussed change in 2013 is that the top 1 percent or so of taxpayers face higher rates of federal personal income taxation than they did in 2012. Most taxpayers do not face higher federal personal income tax rates, and the Tax Policy Center estimates that this tax change in the new agreement increased nationwide average marginal tax rates less than 0.5 percentage point. (Note that the center expresses rates in cash income units, while I express the rates as percentages of total employee compensation, which makes my numerical percentages a bit less, similar to measuring distance in meters rather than in yards.) The Medicare tax goes up in 2013 a bit for a small fraction of the labor force. This was a scheduled part of previous legislation.
A table displaying marginal tax rates on different categories of income shows that changes of half a percentage point or so in the marginal tax rate have occurred frequently during the postwar period. The personal income tax increase this year should by itself have a negative short-term effect on employment -- but too small to be obvious in the aggregate employment statistics. Because the tax increase is concentrated on people who are more productive and who spend more on a per-capita basis, it will have a somewhat larger short-term negative impact on productivity and spending.
The federal payroll tax is greater this year than it was last year, because its temporary cut was permitted to expire. That increase is 1.8 percentage points when expressed as a share of total employee compensation (some of which escapes payroll tax). The payroll and personal income tax increases together have increased the average marginal tax rate by about 2.2 percentage points.
What surprised me was that the payroll tax cut was allowed to expire, but the purported temporary extensions of unemployment insurance were not. Unemployment insurance extensions add to the marginal tax rate, and subtract from the reward to work, because they provide income to people when they do not work.
Allowing the extensions to expire would have subtracted about 2.2 percentage points from the average marginal tax rate (see Chapter 5 of my recent book) and left 2013 marginal tax rates almost exactly as they were in 2012 despite a payroll tax increase.
Instead, the average marginal tax rate has increased about 2.2 percentage points, putting the rates about halfway back to their stimulus law highs in 2010. For this reason, the labor market could give back about half of its admittedly small recovery from the recession, measured in terms of hours worked per capita.
Population is expected to grow about 1 percent in 2013, and that growth by itself tends to increase aggregate hours worked and employment. But even when the population growth is added to the marginal tax rate increase, it seems more likely than not that aggregate hours worked and employment will fail to grow during the year.

HEADLINE: UBS Executives Questioned by Parliament Over Rate-Rigging Case

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Senior executives at UBS faced scrutiny from British politicians on Wednesday over a recent rate-manipulation scandal that led the Swiss banking giant to pay a combined $1.5 billion fine to global authorities. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Senior executives of the Swiss banking giant UBS faced tough questioning from British politicians on Wednesday over a recent rate-rigging scandal that led the company to pay $1.5 billion in fines to global authorities.
During almost three hours of testimony, Andrea Orcel, chief executive of UBS's investment bank, and the firm's chief risk and compliance officers were questioned over why the illegal activity, conducted over six years through 2010, had not been discovered earlier.
"This scandal which took place at UBS was a shocker of enormous proportions," said Andrew Tyrie, a politician who heads up the British Parliament's commission on banking standards, which is investigating misconduct in the country's financial services sector. 
The fines were levied last month after American, British and Swiss regulators discovered that around 40 UBS employees had manipulated key benchmark interest rates to portray the bank as being in a healthier financial position than it actually was.
UBS's Japanese subsidiary pleaded guilty to fraud charges in the case, which included the manipulation of both the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and the Euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor. Together, the rates underpin trillions of dollars of financial products worldwide, including sophisticated derivatives and home mortgages.
In the United States, the Justice Department has brought charges against two former UBS traders, Thomas Hayes and Roger Darin, over their roles in the illegal activity.
"These are industrywide problems," said Mr. Orcel, a deal-making veteran who has advised on some of Europe's biggest banking takeovers and who joined UBS last year from Bank of America. "We all got probably too arrogant, too self-convinced that things were correct the way they were. I think the industry needs to change."
Mr. Orcel helped broker the $97 billion acquisition of the Dutch bank ABN Amro in 2007 by a consortium of banks led by Royal Bank of Scotland. The mistimed deal played a role in R.B.S. being bailed out by the British government during the financial crisis.
Mr. Orcel, who one British politician referred to as the "Ronaldo of investment banking" - a reference to the Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo - was asked lawmakers whether he still would have supported the ABN Amro deal.
"Knowing what we know now, we would have advised them not to proceed," Mr. Orcel said.
The British politicians peppered Mr. Orcel; Philip J. Lofts, UBS's chief risk officer; and the firm's global head of compliance, Andrew Williams, with questions about why the illegal activity had not been discovered despite several internal audits of the bank's trading activity.
The UBS officials acknowledged that only 18 of the 40 individuals linked to the scandal had been fired because of the illegal activity, though some of the implicated traders moved to other banks before the misconduct was detected. Some employees connected to the illegal activity remained at the bank, the executives said.
The hearing in London also focused on the activities of Mr. Hayes, who worked at UBS from 2006 to 2009. He recorded around $260 million in profits during his time at the bank, though the UBS officials could not say how much of that could be linked to manipulation of rates.
"His conduct was reprehensible," Mr. Williams of UBS said. "We were all disgusted by it."
When asked what steps the bank's board had taken in the wake of the scandal, Mr. Williams said the Libor investigation had played a role in the firm's decision to reduce its exposure to risky trading activity. Last year, the Swiss bank announced 10,000 job cuts, with a large percent of the layoffs expected in the firm's investment bank.
"We are going to get out of much of the proprietary side of investment banking and go back to a client-focused model," Mr. Williams said.
UBS is the latest global bank to be linked to the rate-manipulation scandal. Last year, the British bank Barclays agreed to a $450 million settlement with authorities after some of its traders were found to have altered Libor rate submissions for financial gain. Some of the bank's senior executives, including the chief executive at the time, Robert E. Diamond Jr., resigned.
More financial penalties are expected. The Royal Bank of Scotland has said it expects to announce an agreement with authorities before it reports earnings in February, and Deutsche Bank has also said it had taken steps to cover potential fines.
Several American banks, including Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, are also under investigation.
"This didn't just involve traders at UBS," said Pat McFadden, a member of Parliament. "This was a widespread practice in the banking industry. It was a serious corruption of the financial process."
The $1.5 billion levied against UBS is the largest penalty so far in the five-year investigation into the manipulation of rates, and was a new blow for the bank. Last year, UBS revealed a $2.3 billion loss related to illegal activity by a trader that led to the resignation of the firm's former chief executive, Oswald Grübel. The bank agreed to pay a $47.5 million fine to British authorities.
UBS also agreed to pay American regulators $780 million in 2009 to settle allegations that it helped American clients evade taxes, and the bank also wrote down around $50 billion of sophisticated credit products during the financial crisis.
Marcel Rohner, Mr. Grübel's predecessor as UBS chief; several former chief executives of UBS's investment banking unit; and senior officials from the Financial Services Authority, the British regulator, are to testify on Thursday in connection with the recent illegal activity at UBS.
An earlier version of this post misidentified the UBS chief executive who resigned after the trading loss. It was Oswald Grübel, not Marcel Rohner, who was Mr. Grübel's predecessor.

HEADLINE: The Great Dissenters

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Dissenting from Fed decisions eight times in a single year makes for some rare company. 

 BODY:
My article about Jeffrey Lacker on Wednesday mentions that he is the third member of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee to dissent at least eight times in a single year. 
So who were the other two?
One instance is quite recent. In 2010, Thomas M. Hoenig, then president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, dissented at eight straight meetings. His reasons were similar to Mr. Lacker's - concern that the aggressive efforts to stimulate the economy would undermine the stability of financial markets and loosen the Fed's control of inflation.
Mr. Hoenig gave an interesting defense of dissenting, whatever the reasons, in a speech early the year after.
"A deliberative body does not gain credibility by concealing dissent when decision making is most difficult," he said. "In fact, credibility is sacrificed as those on the outside realize that unanimity - difficult in any environment - simply may not be a reasonable expectation when the path ahead is the most confounding."
The other instance dates back to 1980, when Henry C. Wallich, a Fed governor, dissented nine times because he felt that the central bank under Chairman Paul Volcker was not moving fast enough to bring inflation under control.
"Like burglary, inflation is an extralegal form of redistribution," Mr. Wallich once wrote, according to his obituary. ''Unfortunately, many economists share with politicians the habit of always regarding inflation as the lesser of any alternative evils."
He did not, however, dissent at every meeting that year. And according to William Greider's "Secrets of the Temple," he did not share Mr. Hoenig's sense of purpose.
"It is not a pleasant thing to have to keep dissenting," he quotes Mr. Wallich as saying. "It makes one quite useless. To be a constant dissenter is a fruitless thing."

HEADLINE: Wall Street's Elite, Including Ina Drew, Honors JPMorgan's Former Leader

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: A gala held at the Museum of American Finance in Manhattan to honor William B. Harrison Jr., former chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, attracted a number of old-school Wall Street celebrities. 

 BODY:
Ina Drew has kept a low profile since she left JPMorgan Chase last year after the bank's multibillion-dollar trading loss.
But Ms. Drew, former head of JPMorgan's chief investment office, was mingling with the elite of Wall Street on Tuesday evening at a gala honoring her old boss, William B. Harrison Jr., once the chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan.
The annual event held at the Museum of American Finance in Manhattan attracted a number of old-school Wall Street celebrities, among them John C. Whitehead, the leader of Goldman Sachs in the 1970s and 1980s, and William H. Donaldson, a former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The gala, which coincided with the centennial of the Federal Reserve, raised $750,000 for the museum, the most ever, said David J. Cowen, the museum's head. 
 Ms. Drew sat at the table by the stage with Mr. Harrison and Duncan L. Niederauer, the chief executive of NYSE Euronext. And James E. Staley, a longtime JPMorgan executive who is joining BlueMountain Capital Management, made a brief appearance.
The award Mr. Harrison received, recognizing his financial leadership and charitable work, was named for Mr. Whitehead, who is 90. In his acceptance speech, Mr. Harrison touched on some current issues, criticizing the state of financial regulation.
"In my opinion, banks were not 100 percent responsible for what happened in the financial crisis," he said. "If you treat them like they were, you get what we have today."
Mr. Harrison also defended the financial industry's consolidation in the 1990s and early 2000s, when he built what became the modern JPMorgan Chase.
"In terms of consolidation, a lot of people don't like that. But I can assure you, there was a reason to do it," he said. "This is not something you do for fun."
Mr. Harrison was introduced by Erskine B. Bowles, former White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton.
"For the past 50 years, Billy Harrison has been my hero, my adviser, my confidant, my pal and, most importantly, my best friend," Mr. Bowles said.
The two, who met at preparatory school in Virginia, were fraternity brothers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and later roommates when they moved to New York in 1968. Mr. Bowles is the godfather of Mr. Harrison's daughter Katie.
Mr. Bowles recalled Mr. Harrison's first job at Chemical Bank, the firm that eventually became JPMorgan Chase. At the time, he made a starting salary of $7,500.
"For the life of me, I couldn't figure out how I was going to help him spend all that money," Mr. Bowles said.
A range of financial types showed up to pay their respects, including James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer; Muriel F. Siebert, a former superintendent of banks in New York; and David A. Coulter, the Warburg Pincus managing director.
In an interview before the dinner began, Mr. Whitehead offered his thoughts on the state of finance.
"I think it's very important that Wall Street recover its reputation," Mr. Whitehead said. "That will take new leadership."
The former Goldman Sachs leader received his share of praise from the evening's speakers. Mr. Niederauer of NYSE Euronext said Mr. Whitehead was "a compass" for him.
"I try to have as many things in common with John as I can," Mr. Niederauer said.
Mr. Bowles's praise of Mr. Harrison was so effusive, it prompted a quip from Mr. Harrison.
"Unlike some other C.E.O.'s at the time, I did not have a personal public relations firm supporting my cause," Mr. Harrison said. "The reason I didn't is because I had Erskine Bowles."

HEADLINE: New Target in Finger-Pointing Over Housing Bubble

BYLINE: JESSE EISINGER


HIGHLIGHT: The same critics that assailed the government's role in the boom and bust in the housing market are attacking the Federal Housing Administration for its lending standards. 

 BODY:
No matter how many times people debunk the notion that government policy created the housing bubble, it doesn't die. It's part of what the blogger Barry Ritholtz has called the "big lie" of the financial crisis. Now, we are having another argument about whether the government is creating a new housing disaster for taxpayers.
The target this time: the Federal Housing Administration, the government mortgage insurer, mostly for low-to-moderate income and minority borrowers. Late last year, the F.H.A. issued its annual report to Congress. According to estimates, over its lifetime the agency will have to pay more out on the mortgages it has insured than it has taken in. The report estimated the potential shortfall at $16 billion, which is a lot in absolute terms, but minuscule in relation to the federal budget and the $1.1 trillion F.H.A. portfolio. 
Despite these modest numbers (more on that below), the same crew that assailed the government's role in the housing bubble is now rending its garments about the F.H.A. Critics, like Edward J. Pinto of the American Enterprise Institute, argue that the agency has not only failed to help low-income communities, but is actually destroying them with reckless loans.
 Next month, we may end up doing it all again, when the Office of Management and Budget issues its analysis of the agency's finances, using a different methodology.
So is the F.H.A. in trouble and in need of an imminent bailout?
Not really. According to the actuarial analysis, if the agency stopped backing mortgages right now, it would have a deficit after 30 years. But even by that analysis, it has enough cash for many years. And it will not stop insuring mortgages. In fact, it's backing what are probably going to be very safe and profitable home loans right now, so even if it drew money from the United States Treasury, it would almost certainly be able to pay it back eventually.
And if there is a Treasury infusion, taxpayers should consider it a bargain. The agency has been a rare bright spot in the Obama administration's otherwise dismal record on housing.
In both the boom and bust, the F.H.A. functioned as one would hope a government lending operation would. As the bubble grew and private lenders went nuts, its market share dwindled. (Maybe this wasn't on purpose, but it's better to be lucky than smart.) When the market crashed, the F.H.A. stepped in.
Without the agency's lending, mortgage rates would have doubled and home prices would have dropped another 25 percent, estimates Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics.
John Griffith, a housing policy analyst for the liberal Center for American Progress, has produced several useful rejoinders to the F.H.A.'s critics. He points out that compared to the private sector, the agency is doing quite well. Yes, the agency faces a high rate of delinquencies, but they pale when compared with private sector subprime loans.
At their peak in the fourth quarter of 2009, 9.4 percent of the F.H.A. loans were seriously delinquent, compared with 30.6 percent of subprime loans, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
"To go this far without significant problems after the worst housing crisis since the Great Depression is remarkable," Mr. Griffith said.
The F.H.A. hasn't been perfect. Far from it. The agency was too aggressive with its lending. When it stepped in as the market was collapsing, it should have had more careful lending standards. Now, it has tightened them up and raised its fees, which will put the agency in much better shape.
And its history isn't pure. One of its more disastrous policies was to allow something called seller-financed loans, where a nonprofit organization would broker a deal for a low-income borrower. In truth, someone else, like a developer, would front the costs and this would inflate the cost of house itself. Low-income borrowers could find themselves underwater almost immediately.
"A phenomenal mistake," Mr. Griffith said. The F.H.A. considered banning such loans. But the private sector lobbied for them, and with a push from Congress, the loans continued until 2009.
Yet, the criticism of F.H.A. from Mr. Pinto of the American Enterprise Institute, who in the late 1980s was the chief credit officer of Fannie Mae, goes far beyond that. Mr. Pinto says the F.H.A. has a record of 60 years of "mission failure" and that it's getting worse. Its lending standards have been eroding for years, and now it has an unacceptably high failure rate, he says. His work, including a study late last year, aims to show the F.H.A. has actually hurt the low-income and minority communities it purports to serve.
Mr. Pinto's study cites high rates of delinquencies in many neighborhoods, but that's no surprise. The housing market crashed in many cities. To have high default rates in those areas is hardly a sign of out-of-control government lending.
"I respect Ed, but he's dead wrong," Mr. Zandi of Moody's said. "He's got it absolutely backward." The private sector, not government, led us into the bubble.
Mr. Pinto has beenrepeatedlycriticized for exaggerating the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the mortgage crisis. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission took a long hard look at them, because Peter J. Wallison, a major proponent of the theory that the government created the housing bubble, sat on the commission. The commission found that the Pinto analysis was flawed.
Mr. Pinto is undaunted. He told me he believed that "federal housing policy was the cause of the housing boom and bust. That was what got us into this mess. People want to deny it."
That is what is known, as the Freudians tell us, as projection.
The debate has important consequences. If the F.H.A. does turn out to be a disaster, it undermines the idea that the government can serve a valuable role in financing loans to deserving and responsible people who can't afford traditional mortgages.

HEADLINE: Continuity on Obama's Economic Team

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT and KITTY BENNETT


HIGHLIGHT: Jacob J. Lew is part of a small circle of economic advisers who have ascended to prominent roles in the first term of the Obama presidency and will shape policy in the second. 

 BODY:
After President Obama took office in 2009, Jacob J. Lew became a deputy secretary of state within days. Gene Sperling was serving as an adviser to the Treasury secretary. Austan Goolsbee, a longtime Obama adviser, was serving on Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. Alan B. Krueger would become an assistant secretary of the Treasury within a few months.
In the last four years, all of these men have gone on to higher jobs within the Obama administration, and Mr. Lew is expected to be named Treasury secretary soon. Mr. Sperling is the top economic adviser inside the West Wing, while Mr. Krueger is the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Mr. Goolsbee preceded him at the council before returning to the University of Chicago. 
As a picture on Wednesday's front page of The New York Times makes clear, Mr. Obama's economic team is made up almost entirely of people who have been with the administration from the very beginning. This approach has benefits, especially because many of the budget battles of the second term will be extensions of the battles of the first.

"We've got a weird negotiation - let's call it a multiyear negotiation," Mr. Goolsbee said this week on the Charlie Rose show. In 2011, the Obama administration and Congressional Republicans agreed to spending cuts with no new tax revenue, Mr. Goolsbee noted. Last month, the two sides agreed to new tax revenue with no spending cuts. In coming talks, the parties will discuss more of each, with Democrats pushing for more tax revenue and Republicans for more spending cuts.
"After a year and a half of negotiating, we may have a grand bargain; it's just not a grand bargain they actually struck all at once at the same table," Mr. Goolsbee added.
But if Mr. Obama's personnel strategy brings the benefit of consistency, it also has downsides. "Can it really be the case," Ezra Klein of The Washington Post asked, "that after four very difficult years, there is nothing the White House would gain in its second term by bringing in outsiders with fresh experience, different relationships and a new perspective?"
For more on Mr. Lew, currently the White House chief of staff, see this recent profile by Sheryl Gay Stolberg or this 2010 profile by Jackie Calmes. In May, Annie Lowrey noted that his name seemed logical to include in any list of potential nominees. A 2009 article by Eric Lipton described the significant salary Mr. Lew made while working at Citigroup.
In January, Noah Rosenberg noted that Mr. Lew, who grew up in Queens, continued to live in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. In 1999, when Mr. Lew was the Clinton administration's budget director, Tim Weiner dug into his New York roots.
Washington Jewish Week profiled Mr. Lew last year, describing him as a "'regular guy' who values the importance of friendship." National Journal described him this way: "Tall and thin, with Harry Potter-like glasses and salt-and-pepper hair, he looks like a typical Washington technocrat, an image that belies his talent for combat."
The Hill contrasted his speaking style with that of Rahm Emanuel, a former chief of staff. In 2001, The Washington Post noted Mr. Lew's long history as a budget negotiator, including in the 1980's debate over Social Security.

HEADLINE: Far From the Spotlight, Parenthetical History Made

BYLINE: BEN ROTHENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: Benjamin Balleret (ranked No. 636) and Guillaume Couillard (not ranked at all) played the longest tiebreak in men's singles history in Florida on Sunday. 

 BODY:
While the elites of tennis gather in Melbourne to compete for a record first-place prize of $2.5 million at the 2013 Australian Open, a different sort of record excess was created on the opposite sides of the globe and the tennis pantheon, at a Futures tournament in Plantation, Fla., with a total prize pool of just $10,000 to be divvied up amongst all competitors.
The qualifying rounds of a Futures tournament such as the Plantation Openserve as a sort of cattle call for tennis players, mostly young though some old, looking to keep some presence as a professional player. The enormous 128-player field is the size of a Grand Slam main draw, although most competitors in Plantation were unranked. To advance through the bloated bracket to the main draw requires four wins; some A.T.P. qualifying tournaments require as few as two. 
At No. 636 in the A.T.P. rankings, Benjamin Balleret of Monaco had the sixth-highest ranking in the qualifying draw. Notching 6-3, 6-2 and 6-1, 6-1 victories against opponents ranked outside the top 1,000 in the first two rounds, Balleret moved into a third-round meeting with a player from his own small country: Guillaume Couillard, an unranked, mostly retired 37-year-old who has served as the player-captain for the Monegasque Davis Cup team for five years.
Couillard had only entered the tournament in Plantation to give himself some preparation for the principality's next Davis Cup tie, a February clash with Belarus. It will be his team-high 34th career Davis Cup appearance.
The meeting of Balleret and Couillard Sunday in the third round of qualifying would have been somewhat remarkable in and of itself, given that they come from a country with a population of roughly 36,000 people and spanning less than a square mile.
The match, which on Court 19 was one of more than a dozen being played simultaneously at the facility, did not start remarkably. The higher-ranked Balleret earned an early break and a 4-1 lead. Couillard broke back and leveled the set at 4-4, and four games later at 6-6 a tiebreak was required.
There were only about ten people in attendance as the decider began. This did not include any chair umpire, line judges or ball kids, but did include a roving tournament official who watched courtside.
Couillard took an early minibreak advantage for a 2-0 lead, but the tiebreak was back on serve at 3-2. And so the two continued in the first-to-seven, win-by-two format, hanging within one point of the another for an additional 65 points.
Play became more economical as the scores went deeper into double digits.
"There were many service winners," Couillard said in an email translated from French. "Exchanges were increasingly short."
Balleret credited the evenness of the contest to the familiarity the two countrymen have with one another's playing styles.
"We know each other very good, so it was more tactics than nerves," he said in a telephone interview.
"Near 20-all, I started to tell myself that it was too late to lose this tiebreak, that we were already too far in," Couillard recalled.
Couillard had one of his 11 set points at 23-22, but fatigue in his racket hand caused cramping, resulting in his first and second serves both landing near Balleret's feet.
At the change of ends at 24-all--the first ever such occasion in a singles match--the two could not help but laugh.
"We looked at each other and laughed," Couillard said. "It had become funny--and stressful."
The two would later inaugurate the first ever changes of end at 27-all, 30-all, and 33-all, before Balleret finally pulled away at 36-34, on his 19th set point.
"I was a bit frustrated," Balleret said of his inability to capitalize on his lead in a more timely fashion. "But when you play someone you know, you don't express so much your feelings. So I was frustrated inside, and really when I won the set I was just like 'come on!' I was shouting at the last point. But it was really relief."
The previous record for longest tiebreak in a men's singles match had been 38 points, which Balleret and Couillard had nearly doubled. The longest tiebreak on record in any match was 50 points, in a men's doubles match at Wimbledon in 1985.
The Twitter account of theInternational Tennis Federation's Pro Circuit, which oversees Futures tournaments, tweeted Monday that it believed Balleret and Couillard's 70-point excursion to be the longest tiebreak ever: "We haven't been able to find a tie-break that went longer than this." 
Despite their obliteration of the record books, the two friends continued the match without any fanfare, and without knowledge of what they had achieved.
"No bathroom break, nothing," Balleret said of the gap between sets for recovery from the relentless tiebreak. "Not a long time. Normal."
"I did not think for one second that it would be a record," Couillard said. "Not until long after the match when people contacted me to discuss it."
"We didn't think of this, really," Balleret said of his awareness of the record during the match. "We knew it was long, of course."
Couillard held serve to open the second set, but Balleret took the next six to complete the unprecedented 7-6(34), 6-1 scoreline.
"I went a break up and I think he just quit," Balleret said of the second set. "He was tired. He had been working so hard in that tiebreak."
The two did not begin to consider the rarity of their feat until they were approached by a tournament supervisor after the match.
"When the supervisor told me it should be a record, I said 'No, I don't think so,'" said Balleret. "But he said 'yes' again. I said 'OK, maybe.'"
Balleret added: "He told me this morning, that yes, it was a record."
"It's very nice to have this record with my Davis Cup partner," Couillard said. "Even if I lost."
"It's funny, of course, we were laughing about this today," Balleret said of having created this record with a longtime friend and microstate compatriot. "It's a nice story we can keep together and talk about together later."
But the record-setting moment did not compare to what Balleret cited as the high point of his career, facing Roger Federer in 2006 at his home tournament, the Monte Carlo Masters.
"When I played Federer in 2006, it's not a comparable feeling," he said. "As I told you, we were not thinking about doing something special. And it's difficult to play a friend that you know really well. So, no, I didn't have the best feeling on court yesterday."
Rather than awe, Balleret said, the first reaction the score often evokes is the assumption of a clerical error.
"My little brother saw the score," he said. "He said, 'Is that a mistake?' I was like no, no, it's real. A lot of people have asked me if it was a mistake. Even the supervisor told me that some people from the I.T.F., send him a message saying he made a mistake on the draw. And he told them no, it's not a mistake."
Balleret was back on court Monday for his final round qualifying match against Ricardo Ojeda Lara of Spain, which was coincidentally put on the same court, Court 19, where he had obliviously made history the day before.
He won the match 6-1, 6-0, comfortably advancing into the main draw but falling well short of making any additional history.

HEADLINE: A.I.G. Says It Will Not Join Lawsuit Against Government

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The board of the American International Group has declined to join a lawsuit against the federal government over its $182 billion taxpayer-financed bailout, the company said on Wednesday. 

 BODY:
 9:09 p.m. | Updated 
The American International Group will not join a lawsuit against the federal government over its $182 billion financial crisis bailout, the company said on Wednesday.
The decision by A.I.G.'s board follows a public uproar that erupted after The New York Times reported on Monday night that the company was weighing whether to join a $25 billion lawsuit filed by its former chief executive, Maurice R. Greenberg, on behalf of fellow shareholders.
That case argues that shareholders lost tens of billions of dollars when the government attached onerous terms to the bailout. Lawmakers and others had pilloried the company, saying that joining a lawsuit against its rescuers would make it "the poster company for corporate ingratitude and chutzpah." 
On Wednesday, the board of the insurance company gathered at its headquarters in Lower Manhattan to listen to presentations from Mr. Greenberg and the government. Senior officials from the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the defendants in the lawsuit, were accompanied by lawyers from Davis Polk & Wardwell and Debevoise & Plimpton.
A timekeeper was on hand to ensure that each side stayed within the agreed limits: about 45 minutes for Mr. Greenberg and 30 minutes for each government agency, followed by a few minutes for rebuttals.
The government argued that Mr. Greenberg's claims were frivolous, as the company's only alternative was bankruptcy - a far worse outcome for shareholders.
After the meeting, which lasted all morning, the board voted unanimously to steer clear of the case. It also decided to ask Mr. Greenberg to forgo legal claims in the company's name.
"The board's decision today was about continuing to move this company forward, not backward," Robert H. Benmosche, A.I.G.'s chief executive and a director, wrote in an internal memorandum to employees. "We as a company have kept our promise to return every dollar America invested in us, plus a substantial profit."
The decision on Wednesday ends more than a year of suspense over what A.I.G. would do. Starr International, a company run by Mr. Greenberg, filed the case in late 2011 in federal courts in Washington and New York and has long pressured the company to join.
The lawsuit claimed that the fine print of the bailout, including the deal's high interest rates and the funneling of billions to the insurer's Wall Street clients, violated the Fifth Amendment, which prohibits the taking of private property for "public use, without just compensation."
The board's vote deals a blow to Mr. Greenberg's case, which had already been dismissed in the Federal District Court in Manhattan. That decision is under review by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; the judge in the Court of Federal Claims in Washington declined to dismiss the case.
David Boies, the prominent trial lawyer representing Mr. Greenberg, said in a statement: "We continue to believe that the attempt by the A.I.G. board to prevent Starr International from pursuing claims on behalf of A.I.G. shareholders is contrary to the shareholders' interests."
A.I.G.'s directors faced a difficult choice, debating the matter extensively during a dinner in the corporate dining room Tuesday night. While they were required to weigh the claims, joining the case would have added fuel to the public fire over the company's rescue, one of the biggest and most controversial of the financial crisis.
The meeting coincided with an aggressive advertising campaign by the company thanking taxpayers for rescuing it during the crisis. And it comes only weeks after the insurer fully repaid its bailout, generating about $22 billion in profit for the public.
But the members of A.I.G.'s board, most of whom joined after the rescue effort, owed a duty to shareholders to consider the lawsuit. Mr. Greenberg could challenge the decision to abstain from the suit as failing to fulfill legal obligations to investors.
"The board was legally required to consider the Starr demand - the law and the courts required it - and we did so thoughtfully, weighing all the appropriate factors," Mr. Benmosche wrote in the company memo. "That is what sound corporate governance and properly undertaking our responsibilities and obligations to our shareholders are all about."
As the company sat on the sidelines for months, the government racked up huge legal costs as lawyers prepared hundreds of pages of court submissions.
But Henry T. C. Hu, a former regulator and now a professor of law at the University of Texas Law School, said that the brevity of the board's deliberations on Wednesday implied that its mind had already been made up.
"The speed of the board decision today suggests that the remarkably unusual and expensive mock trial was a waste of time, besides insulting to the public and regulators," he said. "A.I.G. should, at a minimum, fully reimburse the Treasury and the Federal Reserve for all time and expense that A.I.G. has inflicted."

HEADLINE: The Politics of the Platinum Coin

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Why the real-life consequences of a pundit's hypothetical would be ugly ... for the Democrats. 

 BODY:
I don't feel qualified to comment definitively on the technical legality or constitutionality of the widely-bruited proposal that President Obama should respond to House Republicans' debt ceiling brinksmanship by threatening to mint a $1 trillion platinum coin. But I do feel qualified to raise some questions about the political consequences that proponents of "minting the coin" (a group that includes some very smart people not normally given to flights of ideological fancy) seem to think will follow from such a gambit. Here is Matt Yglesias, speaking for a multitude of would-be minters:
Obviously financing the government by exploiting an accidental loophole in a bill meant to create commemorative coins is a bad idea. But it's equally obvious that forcing the executive branch to default on legally valid bills is also a bad idea. And if Obama once again evades default by making substantive policy concessions to House Republicans, then he's going to normalize this hostage-taking process. Putting some other nutty ideas on the table, by contrast, might actually get us back to normal. 
I would just ask platinum coin proponents, is this generally how politics works of late? One party behaves irresponsibly, the other side counters with a wave of irresponsibility of its own (because that's the only way to make those crazies see reason ...), and then the first party recognizes the error of its ways and everyone returns to behaving reasonably? Does that pattern describe the polarized Washington that we've come to know and love?
I think not. Instead, here's what would actually happen if the president was understood to be taking the "mint the coin" option seriously. Those Republicans in Congress who believe that they're justified in risking chaos in order to combat the White House's fiscal irresponsibility would have their hand immeasurably strengthened. The internal pressure on the Republican leadership not to cut a deal with the coin-minting tyrant Obama would be be ratcheted significantly higher. And public opinion, which currently favors Obama and the Democrats and regards Congressional Republicans as the more irresponsible party in these negotiations, would probably tilt sharply the other way, essentially validating Republican intransigence.
In other words, a White House that played the coin card in negotiations would be answering threats to sabotage the nation's credit with a threat to ... massively sabotage its own political position. And that sabotage would have inevitable consequences for the actual effectiveness of the coin maneuver in the event that the debt ceiling wasn't lifted: If Republicans were successful in portraying coin-minting as a Bond villain scheme rather than a legitimate policy move - and I really, really think they would be, no matter how the media covered it - then it's hard to see the markets maintaining any kind of equilibrium while the White House used a maneuver that even its apologists concede is "usually a sign of severe distress" to cover the government's obligations. The coin would still court some sort of economic calamity, in other words, while raising the odds that Obama rather than the Republicans would be blamed for it. And the pressure to compromise on fiscal issues would suddenly lie heavier on the Democrats, and lighter on the party that hadn't just tried to do a "nutty" (that's Yglesias's word, not mine) platinum-based end-run around Congress.
So what should the White House do instead? Well, they should assume that the John Boehner and Mitch McConnell aren't actually going to throw the country into a fiscal crisis and an economic tailspin, and negotiate accordingly. That might mean offering symbolic concessions and seeking out face-saving legislative maneuvers, or it might mean offering no concessions at all - but it wouldn't mean trying to match the Republicans irresponsibility for irresponsibility, in a constantly escalating game of "can you top this?"
Yes, refusing to play that game means living with the possibility that Republicans really will tip the country into a crisis. But so long as the G.O.P. controls the House of Representatives, that possibility will always be there: That's just life in a system of checks and balances. If Republicans are actually as apocalyptic as the coin-minters seem to think, then they will eventually find some way to precipitate a crisis, platinum coins or no - at which point the proper Democratic response would be to leverage the crisis and its aftermath into the absolute and total destruction of the G.O.P. in 2014 and 2016. In a constitutional republic, electoral annihilation, not tit-for-tat nuttiness, is the only effective way to deal with a party that can't be trusted with even a share of power.
Because I don't think the Congressional G.O.P.'s leaders actually fall into that category, I'm confident that the debt ceiling will be raised and the platinum coin will remain just a pundit's hypothetical. But that said, there are elements within the current Republican Party that would be ready to throw the country into crisis, if they held their party's reins. And I can't imagine any better way for liberals to encourage and empower those elements than to seriously consider a policy course that would seem to vindicate every perfervid paranoia about Obama-era liberalism that the American right has ever entertained.

HEADLINE: A.I.G. Rejects Shareholder Suit

BYLINE: VIKAS BAJAJ


HIGHLIGHT: The insurance giant won't join an opportunistic lawsuit against the very government agencies that saved it. 

 BODY:
The American International Group has wisely chosen to avoid joining a shareholder lawsuit against government agencies that bailed it out with $182 billion in loans and capital. In an unequivocal statement released Wednesday afternoon, the company said its board would not join a case brought by Starr International, the investment vehicle controlled by A.I.G.'s former top executive Maurice "Hank" Greenberg, in courts in New York and Washington. 
"The AIG Board has determined to refuse Starr's demand in its entirety," the company said, "and will neither pursue these claims itself nor permit Starr to pursue them in AIG's name."
Mr. Greenberg's lawsuit, which demands $25 billion in damages against the government, has always smacked of opportunism. Instead of suing the executives and directors responsible for A.I.G.'s financial problems, he chose to go after the government, which saved the company, because it clearly has more money at its disposal than former A.I.G. officials.

The company's decision will not immediately affect the case but it will likely bolster the government's position that the terms of the bailout did not amount to a violation of the Fifth Amendment (which prohibits the government from taking private property with just compensation). As my colleague Peter Eavis pointed out in a recent post on Dealbook, a strong argument can be made that the government was more than fair to A.I.G. and its shareholders by easing the terms of its initial bailout.
Nobody wanted the government to bail out A.I.G. - least of all taxpayers. It's true that the Treasury recently reported making a "positive return" of $22.7 billion on its investment. But it could have easily lost money on A.I.G. had the recession been more prolonged than it was, or had the housing market not recovered as fast as it did. The United States Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York did not step in for the sake of making a profit, in the manner of private equity funds. They helped the insurance giant because its collapse would have destabilized the whole economy.
Now that A.I.G. is back on its feet, the last thing it needs to do is sue the institutions that helped get it there.

HEADLINE: Deep Cuts Raise Questions About Morgan Stanley

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG


HIGHLIGHT: Morgan Stanley has been shrinking its business of trading bonds, commodities and other investments, leaving that to be dominated by its Wall Street rivals. 

 BODY:
When Morgan Stanley's top executives gathered in mid-September at the Gramercy Park Hotel in Manhattan to discuss strategy, some participants complained that the room was too small.
Apparently, that was the point: James P. Gorman, Morgan Stanley's chief executive, chose the cramped quarters to force discussion among the executives, said people briefed on his decision but not authorized to speak on the record.
These days, it is the Wall Street firm that is finding itself a bit boxed in.
 Regulatory demands, weak markets and lower credit ratings have weighed on all banks, but perhaps more so on Morgan Stanley, the smallest of the big Wall Street firms. In the three years that Mr. Gorman, 54, has been at the helm, the bank has been progressively shrinking its business of trading bonds, commodities and other investments and expanding into wealth management. 
Now the storied company - whose take-no-prisoners trading desks have at times been rivaled only by firms like Goldman Sachs - is cutting even deeper, raising questions among some on Wall Street about whether it should spin off or ditch much of its trading business as its Swiss rival UBS has, a suggestion the firm eschews.
Morgan Stanley is planning another deep round of cuts: 1,600 jobs, accounting for 6 percent of its support work force, and, more telling, 6 percent of institutional securities, which includes its once vaunted trading business.
The planned cuts come just a week ahead of the release of fourth-quarter earnings, which are expected to show the gains the firm has made since the financial crisis in areas like stock trading, banking and wealth management but still will be weighed down by the diminished earnings power of its fixed income business.
Whether the company can avoid shrinking further - and a number of analysts say that additional cuts will be needed - and revive the fixed-income trading business will have significant ripple effects in the financial world.
While the strategy of cutting in some places and building out wealth management may lead to a more stable company, the retreat also means that the fixed-income trading business over all is becoming increasingly dominated by two Wall Street banks - JPMorgan Chase and Goldman - as well as by hedge funds and other investment firms that are more lightly regulated than banks like Morgan Stanley.
Before the financial crisis, the fixed income division at Morgan Stanley, which was created by J. P. Morgan partners when Depression-era laws forced them to split banking from trading, was one of the firm's biggest moneymakers. Now, it is a drain on operations, producing just 20 percent of its revenue but tying up roughly half of its capital.
In recent years, the fixed-income department has not been able to make enough money to cover the cost to Morgan Stanley of this capital, according to people briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak on the record.
The fallout can be seen in compensation: a year ago, 110 of the roughly 500 managing directors in sales and trading did not get a bonus, and that number is expected to grow next week when bonuses are handed out.
Still, Mr. Gorman has received high marks from some on Wall Street for playing a difficult hand in the wake of the financial crisis. On Wednesday, he received a big vote of confidence when Daniel S. Loeb's hedge fund told investors that it was taking a stake, saying that Morgan Stanley was "in the early innings of a turnaround."
Still, hobbled by the new realities on Wall Street, that turnaround has so far proved to be a Sisyphean task.
The stock, said the shareholder Christopher Grisanti, has "languished." Mr. Grisanti is the owner and co-founder of Grisanti Capital Management, which owns 690,000 shares of Morgan Stanley, valued at $13.5 million.
While the stock has risen since Mr. Grisanti bought it, it is down almost 40 percent since Mr. Gorman took over in January 2010, and big shareholders like the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ of Japan, which holds a 22 percent stake valued at $8.5 billion, have had little in the way of returns. Morgan Stanley's return on equity, Wall Street's main benchmark of profitability, is 6 percent, down from 23.8 percent in 2006.
Morgan Stanley's board, said people briefed on the matter, has discussed closing its fixed-income department. Instead, the firm is shrinking the unit, arguing that it is important to offer its customers those trading services. By cutting jobs and costs and exiting lines like structured products and other complex financial investments and focusing on less risky, less capital-intensive businesses like the trading of interest rates, executives contended that the division can generate a healthy return.
"We are not going to pull a UBS," the senior executive Colm Kelleher told a private dinner of Morgan Stanley shareholders at Oceana restaurant in Midtown Manhattan.
A Morgan Stanley spokesman, Wesley McDade, said the firm was optimistic about its prospects.
"In 2013, we expect to benefit from the many strategic decisions we have taken, including an aggressive move into wealth management, a further strengthening of our pre-eminent equities and investment banking franchises, and the repositioning of our fixed income business to meet the realities of the new world," he said.
Morgan Stanley wants to achieve a return on equity of 10 percent in the near term, and it is making progress as it continues to shed both employees and risky assets. Longer term, Morgan Stanley is shooting for a return on equity in the middle teens, according to people briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak on the record.
Critics said Morgan Stanley executives initially moved too slowly to cut business lines, and set unrealistic revenue goals for the division that were never met.
Recently, Mr. Gorman tapped one of his bankers, John Pruzan, to be his eyes and ears in meetings about the revamping of the department. Even that move was not without controversy, though. Some executives in that department, including the fixed income chief Kenneth deRegt, felt it added an unnecessary layer of management.
At the same time, while trying to squeeze risk out, it has taken some surprising ones, hiring for instance a powerful and controversial trader to run its rates desk, a primary center of growth for the fixed-income department. That trader, Glenn Hadden, is under investigation by a key regulator for his trading in Treasury futures. In 2009, he was put on leave at Goldman because of a separate trading incident.
Through Mr. McDade, the Morgan Stanley spokesman, Mr. Hadden declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Hadden also declined to comment, but has said that his client did not engage in manipulative activity.
The firm Mr. Gorman runs bears little resemblance to the one that existed before the financial crisis. Mr. Gorman's predecessor, John J. Mack, pushed risk-taking, leading to a $9 billion loss in 2007, one of the largest single trading losses in history, as well as billions of dollars in additional losses because of exposure to bond insurers.
These events nearly crippled the firm, and Morgan Stanley was forced to sell a piece of itself to Mitsubishi, which injected $9 billion into the firm. Not long after, in January 2009, Morgan Stanley made another important strategic investment, combining its wealth management operations with Citigroup in a joint venture that gave Morgan Stanley control.
Still, just weeks after taking over as chief, Mr. Gorman took the stage at a Hilton in Midtown Manhattan on a cold winter day to assure a standing-room-only crowd of investors that maintaining the firm's position as one of Wall Street's most powerful investment banks was a top priority for him.
Even in early 2010, however, it was clear to many inside the firm that he would have his work cut out for him.
Every Wednesday, executives from various corners of the bank who belonged to what was known as the asset liability committee would meet at noon to examine the cost to the firm of everything from looming credit-rating downgrades to regulatory changes.
"It was the most depressing meeting ever," said one attendee who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "It was very clear the Morgan Stanley we knew was never coming back."

HEADLINE: Higher Taxes? They Make This Owner Want to Hire More Employees

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Jed Horovitz of Internet Video Archive says that if a business is deeply affected by a tax rate change of a few percent, "it has other, more pressing problems!" 

 BODY:
Beginning in November, just after the election - and a thorough debate over how higher taxes might affect small businesses - we started inviting readers to share the intimate details of their businesses' financial conditions. We are particularly interested in exploring the relationship between income taxes and investment.
Now, with a "fiscal cliff" deal in place that preserves tax rates for most Americans but raises them for the very wealthy, we present the first of what we hope will be a series of small-business tax profiles - posts that look at how tax policies affect specific businesses. Our first owner, Jed Horovitz, believes - contrary to the claim advanced by many small-business owners - that higher taxes encourage more investment. He made this point in a comment to our October examination of claims Mitt Romney made at the first presidential debate. (We have sought owners with differing view points through such organizations as the National Federation of Independent Business and the S Corporation Association, both of which strongly opposed any income tax increase.)
 THE OWNER AND HIS COMPANY Mr. Horovitz, 62, is president and chief executive of Internet Video Archive, which supplies streaming film trailers to the Web sites of 85 clients (including, as it happens, The New York Times). The company employs 19 people and is based in Haddon Heights, N.J., near Philadelphia. 
 THE FINANCIALS Mr. Horovitz estimates that the company will have $2 million in revenue in 2012. Its biggest expense - or investment - is employee salaries: about $1.1 million, he said, which does not include Mr. Horovitz's pay. (He said he took his own payment as a draw of profits from the company, which is organized as a limited liability corporation.) To do much of its work, the company uses cloud computing. Storing videos and delivering them to clients in 2012 cost about $200,000. Leased software and other Internet services costs came to $100,000. Given this reliance on Internet-based services, capital expenditures on hardware and owned software was just $50,000. Sales and marketing expenses were $150,000. Rent and other office expenses amounted to $100,000. Insurance and legal costs were $50,000.
Those expenses totaled about $1.75 million in 2012, leaving Internet Video Archive with a taxable income of about $250,000. However, Mr. Horovitz owns the company's building, so the rent it pays goes to him. And his wife draws a salary as the company's director of marketing and communications. All told, Mr. Horovitz expects his taxable income will reach $450,000 to $500,000.
 THE TAX BITE For the past few years, Mr. Horovitz's household income has landed him in the top two tax brackets. "My effective rate has been 25 percent," he said. Using the Tax Policy Center's ever-useful Tax Calculator, we can estimate how much federal tax he would pay in 2013, assuming his (and his company's) financials do not change a lot. If the Horovitzes take a standard deduction off income of $450,000, then according to the Tax Policy Center calculator, they will pay $121,576 under the newly enacted American Taxpayer Relief Act, a few hundred dollars more than if the Bush tax cuts had remained in place. (Even though the tax rates remain the same for the Horovitzes, the new law phases out the personal exemptions for married couples making more than $267,200, which adds nearly $3,000 to the couple's regular income tax liability. However, with the Bush tax cuts still in place, they would also be subject to the alternative minimum tax, which nearly evens things out.)
If, on the other hand, his household income is $500,000 in 2013, he will pay $140,815, according to the calculator, almost $4,500 more than if the Bush tax cuts had remained in effect. "The marginal difference is not very much, especially as a percent of our expenses or income," Mr. Horovitz said. "Since my particular bracket is right on the edge of this divide, it isn't that big a push to make me spend or save. If a business is deeply impacted by a tax rate of a few percent, it has other, more pressing problems!" (In fact, the Horovitzes itemize their deductions, which further reduces their taxable income and would presumably result in lower taxes under either situation produced by the tax calculator.)
As far as tax breaks go, Mr. Horovitz said, "I take what's available." But, he added, "I don't devote too much time to it, in terms of planning ahead. My accountant once said to me, 'If you're making money and paying taxes, it's a good thing.' You don't want to waste your life figuring out how not to pay more taxes. Spend your time trying to make more money."
 AND THE IMPACT ON INVESTMENT In Mr. Horovitz's view, small-business owners are being disingenuous when they claim that higher taxes would discourage further investment in their companies. "It's true if you wait until the end of the year, and you're talking about the money that's been taxed, then of course you have less after taxes. But if you spend it before it's taxed, it reduces the taxes you pay.
"They're not really thinking long term, and they're not thinking sustainably," he continued. "That's not a very aggressive way of running a business. It's a timid way of running a business. And I don't think it's what they really do - they're not timid."
Mr. Horovitz said that he is eager to expand Internet Video Archive because the company is finally able to take advantage of economies of scale. "We've just gotten to a tipping point in the last couple years," he said. "Because our expenses have really been the same, but our revenues were $1.5 million, or one-and-a-quarter million." Before 2012, when he drew up a budget, he estimated his pretax income would come to about $300,000. "We grew more than I expected," he said. "I wish that I had come up with more ways to invest in my company over the year. And as I'm doing the budget for next year, I'm planning on spending more."
In 2013, Mr. Horovitz plans to spend an additional $100,000 to $200,000. "We're spending more on marketing travel, to reach out and find new customers," he said. He plans to hire two additional people - "people who aren't necessary to service the business I've got, but to grow the business." And, he added, "I've given people raises because we grew more than expected and I think part of that is their productivity went up."
Mr. Horovitz said: "People say higher taxes are a disincentive to investment - yes, if this is your last year in business. But if it's not your last year in business, it's an incentive to investment."
 If you're a business owner and an employer, and you're willing to talk openly about your finances, your taxes, and your investment plans, we'd like to hear from you. Please e-mail The Agenda and let us know you're interested.

HEADLINE: The Obama Coalition vs. Corporate America

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: How much does the shape and scope of the president's electoral success threaten the policy-making ascendancy of big business? 

 BODY:
The slow implosion of the Republican Party - along with the growing strength of a Democratic coalition dominated by low-to-middle-income voters - threatens the power of the corporate establishment and will force big business to find new ways to reassert control of the policy-making process.
The warning signs are everywhere.
The development carrying perhaps the most symbolic significance was the abandonment last week by 85 House Republicans and 40 of the 47 Republican senators of their longstanding commitment not to raise taxes. The tax increase was imposed on the affluent, a core Republican constituency. The Wall Street Journal's editorial page did not mince words, not that it ever does: 
The Senate-White House compromise grudgingly passed by the House is a Beltway classic: the biggest tax increase in 20 years in return for spending increases, and all spun for political purposes as a "tax cut for the middle class."
The potential institutionalization of a majority Democratic coalition of the downscale - including single women, minorities, union members and the young - is equally (if not more) ominous for members of the top 0.1 percent and for the corporations that have profited over the past 40 years.
Voters in this ascendant coalition believe "politicians help the rich get richer and corporations collect record profits while refusing to hire or increase wages or salaries for workers," according to an extensive study conducted by the Democratic polling firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research.
Although there is a pro-business wing of the Democratic Party - associated with figures like current and former Treasury Secretaries Timothy Geithner and Robert Rubin, and with centrists like Senators Mark Warner of Virginia, Thomas R. Carper of Delaware and Max Baucus of Montana - this faction is in danger of being submerged by a surge of redistributional demands coming from voters in the bottom half, income-wise.
This isn't the only thing causing problems for what we used to call Big Business - represented by the Business Roundtable, the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the American Bankers Association and other trade associations - which faces a set of challenges that have the potential to threaten its clout.
Economists on both the right and left, from Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard University to the Times columnist Paul Krugman, are increasingly talking about the detrimental consequences of high concentrations of economic and political power - concentrations that threaten the innovation that is supposed to be what makes unequal outcomes worth the price.
Daron Acemoglu of M.I.T., who wrote the highly regarded book "Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty" with James A. Robinson of Harvard, argues that concentrations of wealth and market power allow "the already well off and already well organized" to exercise excessive leverage through "lobbying, campaign contributions and otherwise" that distort market processes.
The wide range of hostility to big business is reflected in the views of Erick Erickson, the influential right-wing bloggerat RedState.com who, "through a mix of incendiary posts, canny self-promotion (he has 24,540 Twitter followers) and endorsement of conservative primary candidates" has made himself "a conservative powerhouse." Erickson contends that a central failing of the Republican Party is its subservience to the business elite:
The Republican Establishment gets their head patted as they sip wine with major C.E.O.s who want Washington to just do something. But these C.E.O.s have something in common. They want Washington to work for them. Washington working for Fortune 500 does not equate to Washington working for families or entrepreneurs or small businesses. We have an unlevel playing field with Washington picking winners and losers with cushy jobs for the elites when they leave the Capitol.
A second development that raises the level of hostility to corporate chieftains is the fact that there has been, over the past decade, a sharp decline in the reward for work.
Margaret Jacobson and Filippo Occhino of the Cleveland Federal Reserve documented this decline in a paper published in September, "Labor's Declining Share of Income and Rising Inequality." The following chart shows the continuing shift in the distribution of national income from labor to the owners of capital, beginning in 2000:
An additional chart put together by the Cleveland Fed demonstrates that from 1948 to 1973 compensation rose at almost exactly the same rate as productivity; in other words, workers gained proportionately as their productivity improved. Over the following two decades, from 1974 to 1995, however, the rate of compensation growth fell behind productivity by roughly 0.25 percent a year, and then fell even further, by 0.5 percent, over the years from 1996 to 2011. For a worker making $25,000 a year in 1974, the failure of his pay to keep up with his productivity growth means that he made $5,763 less in 2011, $43,225, than he would have had his pay kept up with productivity gains, $48,988.
The more workers recognize that their wages are not keeping up with their productivity gains, the more they are likely to press for redistributive government action through tax policy or by other means.
Jacobson and Occhino write
that economists have identified three long-term factors that explain why "the wage-productivity gap has widened and the share of income accruing to labor has declined." The first is the decline of unions and the resulting weakening of the bargaining power of labor. The second has been the movement of well paying jobs overseas - the "migration of relatively more labor-intensive sectors from advanced economies to emerging economies. As a consequence, the sectors remaining in the advanced economies are relatively less labor-intensive, and the average share of labor income is lower." The third factor is automation and technology advances which have encouraged a shift from workers to machines -- "technological change connected with improvements in information and communication technologies, which has raised the marginal productivity and return to capital relative to labor."
The shift of income from labor to capital occurs at a time (and may well be one of the causes) of huge increases in the share of income flowing to C.E.O.'s and those at the top of the income distribution.
Although the stars are lined up in favor of the anti-corporate left, American business, when its back is to the wall, has historically proved to be extraordinarily resourceful.
Just over 40 years ago, at a similarly volatile moment, Lewis F. Powell, Jr. wrote a 6,030-word memo to the United States Chamber of Commerce that has gained legendary status: The Powell Manifesto or, as it was formally titled, "Confidential Memorandum: Attack on American Free Enterprise System." The soon-to-be-appointed associate justice of the Supreme Court warned: "We are not dealing with sporadic or isolated attacks from a relatively few extremists or even from the minority socialist cadre. Rather, the assault on the enterprise system is broadly based and consistently pursued. It is gaining momentum and converts."
In the face of this onslaught, business mobilized and by 1977 was back on top, defeating liberal initiatives like consumer protection and labor law reform during the Carter administration. Then, in 1980, a unified coalition of corporations and trade associations helped Ronald Reagan win the presidency, and the Republican Party wrested control of the Senate.
The 1980 election marked the start of a quarter-century of corporate political hegemony that permeated the administrations of Reagan, George Bush, and George W. Bush - as well as, to a substantial degree, the administration of Bill Clinton.
In other words, the current Republican implosion notwithstanding, it would not be surprising to see conservative feet on Democratic throats before too much time has passed.

HEADLINE: Planning Summer (Already!) Amid Winter's Chill

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: Plan summer now to mitigate both stress and expense. 

 BODY:
Unbelievably, it is time to plan for summer.
For working parents, summer presents a logistical challenge, and often a significant expense. Last year, the American Express Spending and Saving Tracker estimated that average per-child summer spending on everything from travel to camp to child care hovered around $600, while affluent families spent $1,000 or more - and many Motherlode readers scoffed in disbelief, noting that their expenses for even the least glamorous of camps or day care for the 10 or more weeks of summer could easily run multiples of that.
Planning ahead can help mitigate both the stress and the cost. As difficult as it is to think about summer when ponds are just freezing over and snowy fields beckon kids and sleds, now is the time to take a hard look at who will do what when in June, July and August. 
Parents with children who want to return to particular camps may find that their camp offers a discount for returning campers. Many camps, from the long-established overnights to day camps of all kinds, offer early registration discounts. If you're able to pay up front, camps might offer an even larger discount.
Parents of long-time campers struggling with finances this year should certainly call camp staff. Many camps (again, overnight and day, from mountain biking to robotics) have scholarships available, and now is the time to ask or apply. Camps are often family-run small businesses, and could also be open to trading services for camp time. If you could update an online registration system, provide cords of wood for campfires, or resurface a tennis court, say so.
If it's too soon to register for your choices, you should mark your calendars with registration dates. E-mail science museums, theaters and town recreation departments to be put on their mailing lists. In our town, the most economical, working-parent-friendly camps for young children fill up fast, as do the most desirable or limited offerings. (Vermont's famous Cirkus Smirkus camps? Already full for 2013.) Camps and summer care for children younger than kindergarten are the most difficult to find.
Free camps are out there, too - last year, Pacific University in Oregon offered a free four-week long computer science camp for girls. New York City Public school students can apply to programs like G.O.A.L.S., a six-week-long program of academic enrichment for girls, or the co-ed Summer Arts Institute. Those programs are competitive; our local college runs week-long free robotics camps (some for girls, some co-ed) and admits children based on a lottery, but you need to know when to apply and, of course, you need a back-up plan. Apple's retail stores ran free "camps" in some locations last year, focused on movie making (on their products, of course). To find free camps in your area, I suggest multiple concentrated Web searches adding locations and interests, subjects and ages to the phrase "free summer camp."
"Unstructured" summer time can benefit from a little planning, too. Many parents with flexible schedules and fond summer memories of biking and roaming the neighborhood (myself included) don't choose a full summer of planned activity. Working parents whose children need supervision can reach out now to similarly situated friends to trade weeks of multifamily child care, or could agree now to hire one or two high school or college students to run an at-home "camp" for several families' worth of children. Similarly, now is the time to book grandparents for a care-giving visit.
If you can plan a week or more of unstructured time at home with your children, or a family vacation, you'll enjoy it more if everything else is in place to make the rest of your summer run smoothly. Many of us parents made some version of the same resolution this year: to be more present, to be more purposeful, to make decisions about what we want to do rather than drifting. Plan now, and you'll have a better chance of creating the summer you want to remember.
So: it's January. Do you know what your children will do this summer?

HIGHLIGHT: Peace without optimism in Afghanistan's south; euro-zone unemployment hits a new high; Obama's increasingly male inner circle; a slapdash post-Fukushima cleanup. 

 BODY:
 NEWS In Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan, places that were once Taliban strongholds have been transformed by the American troop surge that brought tens of thousands of marines three years ago. But there is little faith in the government's ability to maintain those security gains once the Americans leave, and many assume that the Taliban will return. Alissa J. Rubin reports from Loy Bagh, Afghanistan. 
Unemployment in the euro zone rose to a new high in November, according to data released Tuesday that also showed that the troubles in the 17-nation currency bloc were straining its strongest member, Germany. Melissa Eddy and David Jolly report from Berlin and Paris.
President Barack Obama's inner circle, it appears, will be dominated by men well into his second term. And from the White House down the ranks, his administration has significantly exceeded the Bush administration in appointing women but has done no better than the Clinton administration, according to an analysis of personnel data by The New York Times. Annie Lowrey reports from Washington.
A surge in sales of one of Australia's most popular brands of infant formula has led to barren shelves in baby aisles, and even rationing of baby food in some retail outlets. But the run on formula is not the result of a local baby boom - instead, it is being attributed to Chinese visitors, apparently concerned about domestic food safety standards, who are believed to be buying in bulk and carrying it home. Matt Siegel reports from Sydney.
More than a year and a half since the nuclear crisis in Japan, much of Japan's post-Fukushima cleanup remains primitive, slapdash and bereft of the cleanup methods lauded by government scientists as effective in removing harmful radioactive cesium from the environment. Hiroko Tabuchi reports from Nahara, Japan.
In the remote Sakha-Yakutia region of Siberia, the wolf population is growing by leaps and bounds - so much so that the governor has declared a state of emergency, though wildlife experts said the move was largely symbolic. Andrew E. Kramer reports from Moscow.
 ARTS Armed with digital technology, hundreds of Cuban filmmakers are laying the foundations of an independent movie industry outside the state apparatus that has defined Cuban cinema for much of the Castro era - and still, much to the frustration of some filmmakers, controls access to the island's movie theaters. Victoria Burnett reports from Havana.
 SPORTS What a striking couple Lionel Messi and Abby Wambach cut at the world player of the year gala in Zurich - and what a striking difference in their fortunes. Rob Hughes on soccer.

HEADLINE: Former SAC Analyst Assists Insider Trading Crackdown

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: A former SAC analyst has given federal agents the names of about 20 people he said had engaged in insider trading. | Dish Network challenges Sprint Nextel's bid for Clearwire. | Lawmakers warn A.I.G. not to sue the government. | A new banking company is offering an alternative to people frustrated with red tape and fees. 

 BODY:
Wesley Wang, a former analyst at SAC Capital Advisors, has given federal agents the names of about 20 people that he said had engaged in insider trading, according to a court filing, DealBook's Peter Lattman reports. Federal prosecutors said the extraordinary assistance was still yielding results, as the government continues to circle SAC, the hedge fund owned by Steven A. Cohen.
The government described Mr. Wang's cooperation in a letter filed in connection with Mr. Wang's sentencing. "In addition to the 20 names, the government said that information provided by Mr. Wang has contributed to the criminal convictions of more than 10 people," Mr. Lattman reports. Others are said to be named in the letter, but that section was heavily redacted. Mr. Wang's sentencing is scheduled for Wednesday afternoon in Federal District Court in Manhattan, and prosecutors urged Judge Jed. S. Rakoff to be lenient.
 "The full extent of Wang's information and cooperation remains to be fully realized," the government said in the filing. "Even taking into account what has been developed to date, it is exceptional." 
SAC, meanwhile, is looking to keep its employees satisfied. The firm is raising bonuses by three percentage points for equity, macro and commodity portfolio managers, Bloomberg News reports, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter. "The program is intended to retain our most valuable resource, our investment professionals," said Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for SAC.
But one prominent investor is said to be pulling out. Titan Advisors, a money manager that oversees about $3 billion, is withdrawing its money from SAC as part of a broader shift away from larger hedge funds into smaller ones, Reuters reports, citing a letter sent to investors. "The decision by Titan, a so-called hedge fund of funds, turned some heads on Wall Street because the firm's founder, George Fox, is a friend of Cohen's and his Port Chester, New York-based investment firm is one of SAC Capital's oldest outside investors."
DISH NETWORK MAKES RIVAL BID FOR CLEARWIRE | Dish Network on Tuesday challenged Sprint Nextel's bid for Clearwire, the wireless network operator, with an unsolicited bid that values Clearwire's shares at $4.9 billion. The offer of $3.30 a share is 11 percent more than the existing proposal by Sprint, Clearwire's majority owner. With investors apparently anticipating a bidding war, shares in Clearwire rose more than 8 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday to $3.16.
Both bidders are interested in Clearwire's spectrum. Dish offered to "pay $2.2 billion for a portion of Clearwire's valuable wireless spectrum and forge new commercial ties with Clearwire, fulfilling a vision of creating a new cellphone service provider," DealBook writes. But the Dish proposal faces significant challenges. Sprint, which already owns more than 50 percent of Clearwire, called the offer by Dish "illusory" and "not viable."
 LAWMAKERS WARN A.I.G. TO BACK DOWN | The board of the American International Group is scheduled to meet on Wednesday to consider whether to join a shareholder lawsuit against the United States government. But the prospect of the bailed-out insurer trying to claw back money from its rescuer does not sit well with several lawmakers.
"Don't do it. Don't even think about it," Representatives Peter Welch of Vermont, Michael Capuano of Massachusetts and Luis V. Gutierrez of Illinois wrote in a letter to A.I.G.'s chairman, Robert S. Miller. "A.I.G. became the poster company for Wall Street greed, fiscal mismanagement, and executive bonuses - the taxpayer and economy be damned. Now, A.I.G. apparently seeks to become the poster company for corporate ingratitude and chutzpah."
The company is weighing whether to join a lawsuit by the former chief executive, Maurice R. Greenberg, who claims the government treated the company's shareholders too harshly in the bailout. "But a closer look at the $182 billion rescue suggests a different outcome," DealBook's Peter Eavis writes. "Soon after the bailout, the Treasury Department substantially softened the terms of its support. This lenience made life a lot easier for A.I.G. - and arguably benefited shareholders like Mr. Greenberg."
ON THE AGENDA | Byron Wien, vice chairman of the Blackstone Group's advisory services division, is scheduled to be a co-host on CNBC from 7 to 9 a.m. Sheila Bair, former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, is on CNBC at 10 a.m. Tim Armstrong, AOL's chief executive, is on CNBC at 11:20 a.m. and on Bloomberg TV at 6 p.m. Constellation Brands reports earnings before the market opens.
FINANCIAL START-UP, SIMPLE, TAKES ON BANKS | A new company called Simple, based in Portland, Ore., is looking to offer an alternative to bank customers frustrated with red tape and fees. The company, which has deals with CBW Bank and Bancorp to hold its customers' money, offers free checking accounts and data-rich analysis of transactions, promising not to charge any fees for its services, The New York Times reports. "Banks make money by keeping customers confused," Josh Reich, a co-founder, said. "There's no incentives to make the experience better."
The Times writes: "Few entrepreneurs dare to set their sights on industries as large and entrenched as banking and expect to flourish." But after beginning to sign up customers late last year, the company has already processed transactions worth more than $200 million and has raised more than $13 million from investors.
FLOWERS'S NEW PAD | The private equity investor J. Christopher Flowers bought an Upper East Side co-op apartment for $20 million in cash at the end of last year, before an expected increase in capital gains taxes, Bloomberg News reports. The six-bedroom abode, on Park Avenue and 66th Street, had been listed for $23.5 million in April 2011, and includes a gym and a library. Another financier, James Zelter, chief investment officer of the credit business of Apollo Global Management, paid $19.5 million in cash in December for a four-bedroom duplex on Fifth Ave., across from Central Park.

HEADLINE: Khuzami, S.E.C. Enforcement Chief Who Reinvigorated Unit, to Step Down

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Robert Khuzami, a former terrorism prosecutor who revamped the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement unit after the financial crisis, is stepping down from the agency, ending a four-tenure that included significant actions against some of Wall Street's largest firms. 

 BODY:
After becoming the public face of Wall Street oversight and reining in firms like Goldman Sachs, Robert S. Khuzami is walking away from the spotlight.
Mr. Khuzami, 56, a former terrorism prosecutor who revamped the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement unit in the wake of the financial crisis, said Wednesday that he was stepping down from the agency after a four-year tenure.
His departure signals the end of an important chapter in the history of the agency, which has been praised for taking action against some of Wall Street's largest banks after the 2008 financial crisis, but has also drawn criticism for not doing enough to punish top executives at those same firms.
Mr. Khuzami inherited a demoralized unit in 2009. It was much maligned for missing years of warning signs of the credit bubble and Bernard L. Madoff's Ponzi scheme. 
An imposing presence with a piercing stare, Mr. Khuzami quickly reorganized the management ranks in the enforcement division, creating specialized units to track complex corners of Wall Street, and applied aggressive prosecutorial tactics to civil cases. Under him, the division has logged a record number of actions, many of them against companies at the center of the crisis.
"They know we're out there, and we're smarter and can cover more ground," Mr. Khuzami said in an interview.
His successor, who has not been named, will face significant challenges. For example, the enforcement unit must contend with the increasingly influentialhigh-speed trading firms that, by some accounts, have destabilized the stock market.
The unit also faces lingering questions about its negotiating tactics. Some consumer advocates complain that the agency's headline-grabbing settlements hardly made a dent in the billions of dollars of profits earned on Wall Street. The enforcement division notably butted heads with a prominent federal judge in New York, Jed S. Rakoff, who in 2010 called the agency's $150 million settlement with Bank of America over lax public disclosures "half-baked justice at best."
Mr. Khuzami's departure in about two weeks will be part of a broader exodus from the S.E.C. after the resignation of its chairwoman, Mary L. Schapiro, in November. Among the other people departing are the agency's head of trading and markets and its director of corporation finance. Elisse B. Walter, Ms. Schapiro's replacement as chairwoman, has named interim officials to those positions.
But officials say the enforcement division could struggle under a provisional leader. The chief of the unit, they note, is the top cop on Wall Street, effectively setting the tone for financial oversight.
Ms. Walter is weighing a short list of candidates to replace Mr. Khuzami, people briefed on the matter said. The list includes the enforcement division's chief litigation counsel, Matthew T. Martens, and Mr. Khuzami's current deputy, George S. Canellos.
As for Mr. Khuzami, described alternately as harsh or playful with his employees, he is positioned for a lucrative job at a white-shoe law firm.
"I don't know what I'm doing next, but I loved the last four years and I'm sad it's ending," he said.
Mr. Khuzami, a native of Rochester, N.Y., had a bohemian upbringing that hardly hinted at a path to the S.E.C. His parents were ballroom dancers, his sister a muralist and his brother a drummer. They jokingly refer to Mr. Khuzami as "the white sheep" of the family.
He put himself through school by working odd jobs as a dishwasher, bartender and overnight dockworker. He was hired out of law school as a junior lawyer at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft in New York.
Mr. Khuzami then tried out for the United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York under Rudolph W. Giuliani, but missed the cut. When the office hired him in the early 1990s, he was assigned to terrorism prosecutions. The move led to a career-defining case: the conviction of Omar Abdel-Rahman, the so-called Blind Sheik tied to the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. He later ran a securities task force for the United States attorney's office.
After more than a decade as a prosecutor, he departed for Deutsche Bank, where he eventually became general counsel for the firm's American arm.
In 2009, he caught Ms. Schapiro's attention. She was searching for an aggressive personality to shake up the S.E.C.'s enforcement team.
"It had to be someone who was a great prosecutor," Ms. Schapiro said in an interview.
Mr. Khuzami soon hatched a plan for overhauling - some officials called it dismantling - the enforcement division.
He arrived in Washington with strategies straight from the playbook of the United States attorney's office. He pushed the S.E.C. to offer leniency for cooperating witnesses and to strike deferred prosecution agreements with companies that promised to behave.
He poached former prosecutors for his staff, including Lorin L. Reisner. He plucked other hires from Wall Street, including traders and compliance officers. Adam Storch, then a 29-year-old Goldman Sachs vice president, became the unit's first chief operating officer.
Under Mr. Khuzami's direction, the enforcement team eliminated a layer of management, moving senior lawyers onto the front lines of investigations. He mandated that all enforcement employees carry a BlackBerry, holding them accountable beyond the 9-to-5 workday.
Mr. Khuzami created the Office of Market Intelligence to analyze tips and complaints from investors. He also opened five units to track some of the darkest corners of finance, focusing on structured products like derivatives, market abuse and the secretive world of hedge fund returns.
"The changes were necessary and dramatic," Ms. Schapiro said.
Mr. Khuzami introduced the broad outlines of reform in spring 2009 at a retreat in Solomons Island, Md., an annual gathering of nearly 200 senior enforcement officials. "It's time to get serious about change," he told the packed Holiday Inn conference room, according to attendees.
But his message worried enforcement lawyers, who lined up at the microphones to question new procedures and to raise concerns about potential violations of their contracts. A few top officials, some of whom were widely respected, were about to be left on the sideline.
"Everyone in the office was scared, but we also started working harder," said Thomas A. Sporkin, who ran the Office of Market Intelligence until last year, when he left the agency.
The group faced growing pains. Mr. Khuzami had a knack for grilling lawyers about the details of enforcement cases, according to staff members. And he urged his employees to ask each night, "How did I add value today?" - a line he repeated in an e-mail to staff on Wednesday.
Employees also recalled a softer side. As a motivational tool, they said, Mr. Khuzami would publicly perform for his staff. At a swearing-in ceremony for new members, he quoted poetry by Gwendolyn Brooks. Once, he donned a red wig at an awards ceremony to sing a version of the "Annie" theme song, "Tomorrow," with the lyrics twisted to fit the S.E.C.
"Even though he scares the hell out of people," one employee said, "you like him because he's genuine."
His tactics appeared to bear fruit. During his tenure, the enforcement unit leveled more charges than in any comparable four-year period, including a record number of cases in 2011.
Mr. Khuzami emphasized that the unit was also tracking bigger game. It took aim at billionaire hedge fund managers, including Philip Falcone, and filed cases involving collateralized debt obligations, a crackdown that ensnared prominent names on Wall Street. At the urging of Mr. Khuzami and Mr. Reisner, the S.E.C. brought a landmark case against Goldman Sachs, netting a record settlement of $550 million in 2010.
"He's really broadened the net," said Mary Jo White, a white-collar-criminal defense lawyer at Debevoise & Plimpton, who was Mr. Khuzami's boss when she was the United States attorney in Manhattan.
Some consumer advocates say the enforcement unit remains too timid. They complain that it opted not to charge Lehman Brothers executives and was soft on firms like Bank of America and Citigroup. In 2011, Judge Rakoff refused to bless a $285 million deal with Citigroup in a case involving a collateralized debt obligation, calling it "pocket change."
Critics also question why the agency sued only a handful of top executives who ran companies at the center of the credit crisis.
"If you're rich and connected on Wall Street, then don't worry about the S.E.C.," said Dennis M. Kelleher, chief executive of Better Markets, a nonprofit advocacy group critical of the financial industry.
Mr. Khuzami dismissed the grumbling, noting that his unit sued 65 senior executives involved in the crisis, including the leaders of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and most of the major mortgage companies that caused the housing bubble. In the cases involving big banks, he said, there was not enough evidence to implicate chief executives.
Despite their differences, Judge Rakoff credited Mr. Khuzami with a rapid turnaround of the enforcement division.
"Although, from our different perspectives, Rob Khuzami and I sharply disagree about some matters, over all I think he has done a terrific job," he said.

HEADLINE: A.I.G. Says It Will Not Sue the U.S.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
9:09 p.m. | Updated
The American International Group will not join a lawsuit against the federal government over its $182 billion financial crisis bailout, the company said on Wednesday.
The decision by A.I.G.'s board follows a public uproar that erupted after The New York Times reported on Monday night that the company was weighing whether to join a $25 billion lawsuit filed by its former chief executive, Maurice R. Greenberg, on behalf of fellow shareholders.
That case argues that shareholders lost tens of billions of dollars when the government attached onerous terms to the bailout. Lawmakers and others had pilloried the company, saying that joining a lawsuit against its rescuers would make it "the poster company for corporate ingratitude and chutzpah." 
On Wednesday, the board of the insurance company gathered at its headquarters in Lower Manhattan to listen to presentations from Mr. Greenberg and the government. Senior officials from the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the defendants in the lawsuit, were accompanied by lawyers from Davis Polk & Wardwell and Debevoise & Plimpton.
A timekeeper was on hand to ensure that each side stayed within the agreed limits: about 45 minutes for Mr. Greenberg and 30 minutes for each government agency, followed by a few minutes for rebuttals.
The government argued that Mr. Greenberg's claims were frivolous, as the company's only alternative was bankruptcy - a far worse outcome for shareholders.
After the meeting, which lasted all morning, the board voted unanimously to steer clear of the case. It also decided to ask Mr. Greenberg to forgo legal claims in the company's name.
"The board's decision today was about continuing to move this company forward, not backward," Robert H. Benmosche, A.I.G.'s chief executive and a director, wrote in an internal memorandum to employees. "We as a company have kept our promise to return every dollar America invested in us, plus a substantial profit."
The decision on Wednesday ends more than a year of suspense over what A.I.G. would do. Starr International, a company run by Mr. Greenberg, filed the case in late 2011 in federal courts in Washington and New York and has long pressured the company to join.
The lawsuit claimed that the fine print of the bailout, including the deal's high interest rates and the funneling of billions to the insurer's Wall Street clients, violated the Fifth Amendment, which prohibits the taking of private property for "public use, without just compensation."
The board's vote deals a blow to Mr. Greenberg's case, which had already been dismissed in the Federal District Court in Manhattan. That decision is under review by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; the judge in the Court of Federal Claims in Washington declined to dismiss the case.
David Boies, the prominent trial lawyer representing Mr. Greenberg, said in a statement: "We continue to believe that the attempt by the A.I.G. board to prevent Starr International from pursuing claims on behalf of A.I.G. shareholders is contrary to the shareholders' interests."
A.I.G.'s directors faced a difficult choice, debating the matter extensively during a dinner in the corporate dining room Tuesday night. While they were required to weigh the claims, joining the case would have added fuel to the public fire over the company's rescue, one of the biggest and most controversial of the financial crisis.
The meeting coincided with an aggressive advertising campaign by the company thanking taxpayers for rescuing it during the crisis. And it comes only weeks after the insurer fully repaid its bailout, generating about $22 billion in profit for the public.
But the members of A.I.G.'s board, most of whom joined after the rescue effort, owed a duty to shareholders to consider the lawsuit. Mr. Greenberg could challenge the decision to abstain from the suit as failing to fulfill legal obligations to investors.
"The board was legally required to consider the Starr demand - the law and the courts required it - and we did so thoughtfully, weighing all the appropriate factors," Mr. Benmosche wrote in the company memo. "That is what sound corporate governance and properly undertaking our responsibilities and obligations to our shareholders are all about."
As the company sat on the sidelines for months, the government racked up huge legal costs as lawyers prepared hundreds of pages of court submissions.
But Henry T. C. Hu, a former regulator and now a professor of law at the University of Texas Law School, said that the brevity of the board's deliberations on Wednesday implied that its mind had already been made up.
"The speed of the board decision today suggests that the remarkably unusual and expensive mock trial was a waste of time, besides insulting to the public and regulators," he said. "A.I.G. should, at a minimum, fully reimburse the Treasury and the Federal Reserve for all time and expense that A.I.G. has inflicted."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Seeks To Penalize 2 Auditors In Bank Case

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
In its first case against auditors stemming from the financial crisis, the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday took action against two KPMG employees who had given a clean audit opinion to a Nebraska-based bank holding company that later failed because of bad loans it had made to real estate developers in Nevada and Florida.
The S.E.C. asked an administrative law judge to bar John J. Aesoph, 40, a partner in the Omaha office of KPMG, and Darren M. Bennett, 35, a senior manager, for their roles in an audit of TierOne in 2008. 
That included what the S.E.C. said was a failure to take steps to review the audit after evidence emerged that the auditors had been misled about whether the bank had taken large enough write-downs on the value of real estate development loans.
''Aesoph and Bennett merely rubber-stamped TierOne's collateral value estimates and ignored the red flags surrounding the bank's troubled real estate loans,'' said Robert Khuzami, the commission's enforcement director. ''Auditors must adhere to professional auditing standards and exercise due diligence rather than merely relying on management's representations.''
George S. Canellos, the deputy director of the division, said the case was ''in keeping with our focus on the important responsibility of gatekeepers'' who fail to do their jobs properly.
He pointed to a case filed last month against eight former directors of Morgan Keegan mutual funds, who were charged with failing to prevent fund managers from overvaluing fund assets during the financial crisis.
Lawyers for Mr. Aesoph and Mr. Bennett did not comment on the case, but KPMG issued a statement saying, ''Our partner and senior manager look forward to presenting the facts in support of the work that was performed under the circumstances at TierOne.'' A KPMG spokesman said Mr. Aesoph and Mr. Bennett remained at the company.
TierOne was a savings bank that focused on its home markets in Iowa, Kansas and Nebraska until it began to look for faster growing markets and opened loan production offices in Arizona, Colorado, Florida and Nevada. Loans to developers grew in those markets, leaving the bank exposed when property values began to plummet.
In 2008, TierOne closed those offices and wrote down the value of some of its largest loans. But the S.E.C. said that in doing so, the bank had not acted rapidly enough, particularly with regard to Nevada loans.
It said the auditors should have noted numerous red flags, including the fact that the few new appraisals that were done showed management had underestimated the expected losses.
It noted that the auditors had signed off on the financial statements even after the Office of Thrift Supervision, the bank's primary regulator, warned of serious problems.
In 2010, the bank failed and was taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which estimated its losses would be $298 million, or about 10 percent of total assets. The F.D.I.C. has since revised the estimate to $212 million.
KPMG, one of the largest audit firms in the world, was not named as a defendant in the case, which may reflect the S.E.C.'s lack of possible remedies as much as it does a view of the firm's actions.
Under the law, the S.E.C. does not have the authority to levy financial penalties on auditors who fail to do their jobs. It can only suspend or bar them from practicing before the commission, a penalty that would prevent them from having any role in accounting or auditing the books of a public company.
Taking such a step against KPMG would be tantamount to putting it out of business, something the commission would not want to do in any but the most extreme circumstances.
The commission previously filed charges against three former officials of TierOne, two of whom settled and one of whom is fighting it in federal court in Omaha.

HEADLINE: G.M. Chief Expects To Regain Market Share

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Despite steady profits, last year was a rocky one for General Motors, raising questions about the strength of the company's comeback from its bankruptcy and government bailout.
G.M., the nation's biggest automaker, posted its lowest United States market share in decades, searched for answers to its longstanding troubles in Europe and struggled to overcome the lingering, politically charged stigma of being ''Government Motors.''
On Wednesday, G.M.'s chief executive, Daniel Akerson, acknowledged that the company still had a long way to go before it completed its turnaround. But he said that a host of promising new products should help it gain traction this year. 
''This is going to be a strong year for product introductions, not only in North America, but around the globe,'' Mr. Akerson said in a briefing with reporters at G.M.'s headquarters. ''In 2013 and '14, the sun will be at our backs.''
In 2012, the company's share of the United States market sank to 17.9 percent, down from 19.6 percent the year before. It was the company's lowest market share in more than 50 years.
And while the overall American market grew 13.4 percent last year, G.M.'s sales increased just 3.7 percent. By contrast, Toyota and Honda rebounded sharply from supply disruptions caused by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and rivals like Chrysler and Volkswagen made big sales gains.
''It was a very mediocre year for G.M.,'' said Rebecca Lindland, an analyst at the research firm IHS Automotive. ''They are still kind of finding their way postbankruptcy.''
Mr. Akerson, 64, said he expected G.M. to make ''modest'' market-share improvements this year, as it refreshes its showrooms with 13 new products, including redesigned versions of its Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks.
''What you'll see is a G.M. that is projecting some confidence and some vigor,'' he said.
That description has hardly applied to G.M. since it was forced into bankruptcy in 2009 by the Obama administration as a condition for the final portions of its $49.5 billion government bailout.
The company emerged as a smaller, leaner competitor with fewer brands, employees and factories, and a revamped management team led by Mr. Akerson, a government-appointed board member who took over as chief executive in the fall of 2010.
Since its bankruptcy, G.M. has had some success introducing new cars in the United States, like the Chevrolet Cruze and the Cadillac ATS. It has also continued to grow in China.
In addition, the company has reduced its pension overhang by buying out some salaried workers and transferring its long-term obligations to the rest of the white-collar work force to an outside insurance firm.
G.M. also received good news last month when the Treasury Department agreed to sell 200 million of the G.M. shares owned by taxpayers back to the company and pledged to sell its remaining 300 million shares by early 2014.
''I think it's important for that chapter to close on that part of our history,'' Mr. Akerson said.
G.M. is expected to report healthy earnings this month for the fourth quarter of 2012, which would be its 12th straight profitable quarter. But it is still losing considerable money in Europe, where the economic downturn has depressed vehicle sales for several automakers.
The company has forecast that its 2012 losses in Europe will be at least $1.5 billion. Mr. Akerson said he hoped the losses could be trimmed by one-third this year, but reiterated that G.M.'s European operations would not break even until mid-decade.
He said there were no new plans for job cuts or factory closings on the Continent although the company planned to continue whittling down costs there. ''We are taking out cost structure intelligently, more with a scalpel than a knife,'' he said.
Mr. Akerson said that the company's finances had improved and that he hoped it would be able to shed its junk credit rating this year and return to an investment-grade rating, which would allow it to reduce its borrowing costs.
But he was circumspect when discussing his own future. A former executive with the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, he declined to put a timetable on his tenure as G.M.'s chief.
''I think I will be here next year at this time,'' he said. ''But I don't know how long that will run.''
In the short term, Mr. Akerson said he hoped G.M. could generate excitement for its new products next week at the industry's big annual trade show in Detroit.
The company is set to unveil a coming redesign of its Corvette sports car, as well as a Cadillac version of its Volt plug-in hybrid. Consumers will also get their first look at the new pickups, which are scheduled to have their debut later this year.
The auto show spotlight could become a turning point in the public's perception of G.M., said Ms. Lindland of IHS.
''The reality is that this company still has many challenges ahead,'' she said. ''It's not the behemoth it once was, but they're still not quite nimble yet.''

HEADLINE: James M. Buchanan, Economic Scholar and Nobel Laureate, Dies at 93

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
James M. Buchanan, a scholar and author whose analyses of economic and political decision-making won the 1986 Nobel in economic sciences and shaped a generation of conservative thinking about deficits, taxes and the size of government, died on Wednesday in Blacksburg, Va. He was 93.
Alex Tabarrok, the director of the Center for Study of Public Choice at George Mason University, which Mr. Buchanan founded, confirmed his death.
Dr. Buchanan, a professor emeritus at George Mason, in Fairfax, Va., was a leading proponent of public choice theory, which assumes that politicians and government officials, like everyone else, are motivated by self-interest -- getting re-elected or gaining more power -- and do not necessarily act in the public interest.
He argued that their actions could be analyzed, and even predicted, by applying the tools of economics to political science in ways that yield insights into the tendencies of governments to grow, increase spending, borrow money, run large deficits and let regulations proliferate. 
The logic of self-interest was nothing new. Machiavelli's 16th-century treatise ''The Prince'' detailed cynical rules of statecraft to extend political power. Thomas Hobbes, in his 17th-century book ''Leviathan,'' held that aggressive, self-serving acts were ''natural'' unless forbidden by law. Adam Smith's ''The Wealth of Nations,'' published in 1776, noted that people pursuing their own good also produced benefits for society at large.
But Dr. Buchanan contended that the pursuit of self-interest by modern politicians often led to harmful public results. Courting voters at election time, for example, legislators will approve tax cuts and spending increases for projects and entitlements favored by the electorate. This combination can lead to ever-rising deficits, public debt burdens and increasingly large governments to conduct the public's business.
Indeed, he said, governments had grown so vast and complex that it was no longer possible for elected officials to make more than a fraction of the policy decisions that genuinely affect the people. Thus, he said, much discretionary power is actually held by civil functionaries who can manipulate priorities, impose barriers to entitlements and pressure legislators for rules and budgets favorable to their own interests.
Dr. Buchanan did not invent the theory of public choice, an idea whose origins are obscure but that arose in modern economics literature in the late 1940s. But from the 1950s onward, he became its leading proponent, spearheading a group of economists in Virginia that sought to change the nature of the political process, to bring it more into line with what the group considered the wishes of most Americans.
In lectures, articles and more than 30 books, Dr. Buchanan amplified on the theory of public choice and argued for smaller government, lower deficits and fewer regulations -- a spectrum of policy objectives that were ascendant in the 1980s conservative agenda of President Ronald Reagan.
Over the years since Dr. Buchanan won the Nobel, much of what he predicted has played out. Government is bigger than ever. Tax revenue has fallen far short of public programs' needs. Public and private borrowing has become a way of life. Politicians still act in their own interests while espousing the public good, and national deficits have soared into the trillions.
Dr. Buchanan partly blamed Keynesian economics for what he considered a decline in America's fiscal discipline. John Maynard Keynes argued that budget deficits were not only unavoidable but in fiscal emergencies were even desirable as a means to increase spending, create jobs and cut unemployment. But that reasoning allowed politicians to rationalize deficits under many circumstances and over long periods, Dr. Buchanan contended.
In a commentary in The New York Times in March 2011, Tyler Cowen, an economics professor at George Mason, said his colleague Dr. Buchanan had accurately forecast that deficit spending for short-term gains would evolve into ''a permanent disconnect'' between government outlays and revenue.
''We end up institutionalizing irresponsibility in the federal government, the largest and most central institution in our society,'' Dr. Cowen wrote. ''As we fail to make progress on entitlement reform with each passing year, Professor Buchanan's essentially moral critique of deficit spending looks more prophetic.''
James McGill Buchanan Jr. was born in Murfreesboro, Tenn., on Oct. 2, 1919, the son of a farmer and a schoolteacher, Lila Scott Buchanan. His grandfather John Price Buchanan was governor of Tennessee from 1891 to 1893.
He attended Middle Tennessee State Teachers College in Murfreesboro, living at home and milking cows to pay his way. He graduated first in his class in 1940, and earned a master's degree in economics at the University of Tennessee in 1941. He joined the Navy, became an officer and served in World War II on the staff of Adm. Chester W. Nimitz, the Pacific Fleet commander.
In 1945, he married Anne Bakke. The couple had no children.
Dr. Buchanan earned his doctorate in 1948 at the University of Chicago, a hive of brilliant conservative economists known as the Chicago School, where he was influenced by the free-market economist Frank Hyneman Knight and by the writings of the 19th-century Swedish economist Knut Wicksell, who likened politics to fair exchanges among citizens and organizations.
Dr. Buchanan began teaching economics at the University of Tennessee, rising to full professor in 1950. He moved to Florida State University in 1951, and became chairman of its economics department in 1954. On a Fulbright grant, he studied in Italy in 1955-56, further developing his ideas on politics and economics.
He then became chairman of the economics department at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, where in 1957 he and the economist G. Warren Nutter founded the Thomas Jefferson Center for Studies in Political Economy. Dr. Buchanan, its director for a decade, called it ''a community of scholars who wished to preserve a social order based on individual liberty.''
After a year at the University of California, Los Angeles, Dr. Buchanan, in 1969, joined the Virginia Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg, where he and the economist Gordon Tullock founded the Center for Study of Public Choice. They moved the center to George Mason in 1983, and it became the headquarters for public choice disciples. Conservative foundations helped support the center financially. Dr. Buchanan lived in Blacksburg.
Dr. Buchanan, an austere man with a severe aspect that many students found intimidating, often spoke of complex phenomena in metaphors, referring, for example, to politics as a game and to the Constitution as its rules. His books included ''The Calculus of Consent: Logical Foundations of Constitutional Democracy'' (1962, with Gordon Tullock) and ''The Limits of Liberty: Between Anarchy and Leviathan'' (1975).
He was a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian research organization in Washington. He called himself a libertarian, but insisted that his ideas were primarily academic, not narrowly political, even when they inspired citizens' property tax revolts or balanced-budget movements.
In awarding his Nobel, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences cited his work on economic and political decision-making. ''Buchanan's foremost achievement,'' it said, ''is that he has consistently and tenaciously emphasized the significance of fundamental rules and applied the concept of the political system as an exchange process for the achievement of mutual advantages.''
Dr. Buchanan said the prize highlighted his long struggle for a concept. ''I have faced a sometimes lonely and mostly losing battle of ideas for some 30 years now in efforts to bring academic economists' opinions into line with those of the man on the street,'' he said. ''My task has been to 'uneducate' the economists.''

HEADLINE: A Trillion-Dollar Coin as a Way to Handle the Debt Hits a Jackpot of Jests

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A bizarre but seemingly legal idea to get around the country's debt ceiling using a trillion-dollar coin is having its day in Washington.
The proposal, which originated in economics and business blogs and has a vanishingly remote chance of happening, has won ample attention and garnered new controversy as Republicans and the White House seem to be headed for yet another standoff over a legal limit on the country's debt -- a fight that may come as soon as next month.
On Wednesday, the idea of a trillion-dollar coin made it all the way to the White House. 
''There is no Plan B, there is no backup plan. There is Congress's responsibility to pay the bills of the United States,'' said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, who responded to a dozen questions about the trillion-dollar coin at a news conference. ''I have no coins in my pocket,'' he later added.
But Mr. Carney did not rule the idea out explicitly, deferring later questions to the Treasury Department. That has left a few supporters hoping that in one of his last acts in office, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner might trot out a shiny platinum coin emblazoned with ''In God We Trust'' and a 1 with 12 zeros behind it.
The workaround would come from exploiting a 1997 law that allows the Treasury to ''mint and issue platinum bullion coins and proof platinum coins in accordance with such specifications, designs, varieties, quantities, denominations, and inscriptions as the secretary, in the secretary's discretion, may prescribe from time to time.''
The idea was that a secretary might authorize the creation of a commemorative eagle coin, for instance, to be put on sale for collectors. But the law inadvertently gave the Treasury secretary the power to mint, say, a $1 trillion coin, or even a $5 trillion coin, or even a $1 quadrillion coin.
Rather than selling it, he might deposit it at the Federal Reserve. Presto! The shiny new asset would erase a trillion dollars in debt liabilities. Then, the Treasury could carry out its spending -- including disbursing Social Security checks and Medicare payments -- without hitting the ceiling, a cap on total debt issuance that currently stands at about $16.4 trillion.
When Congress raised the ceiling again, the administration could then take the platinum coin and destroy it. With a token the size of a penny, the White House could head off another round of Congressional brinkmanship and another run at a fiscal cliff.
Blog commentators came up with the idea in 2010, and it gained some attention from financial writers and monetary policy followers during the 2011 debt ceiling standoff. Now, with Republicans and the White House again at odds, the country is expected to run out of spare cash sometime between mid-February and early March.
Thus, some members of the liberal intelligentsia and a number of prominent economics commentators -- most notably Joe Weisenthal of Business Insider, who is also a prolific user of Twitter, and Josh Barro of Bloomberg View -- resurrected the trillion-dollar coin idea.
This time, they went on a vigorous public relations campaign as well. The hashtag #mintthecoin has drummed up hundreds of social media responses, and a petition on the White House Web site has more than 7,000 signatures. The idea also won apparent support from some heavy hitters, like the Nobel laureate and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman and Donald Marron, the Republican economist who heads the Tax Policy Center. (Mr. Marron, to be fair, suggests minting a $25 billion coin, not a $1 trillion one.)
''It's pretty wild,'' Mr. Weisenthal said of his campaign's success, saying the point was to expose the ''absurdity'' of the debt ceiling debate in the first place. ''If you think the trillion-dollar coin is silly, you should think the debate over whether a rich country would fail to pay its bills is silly.''
But what seemed an absurd idea has transformed into a politically actionable one -- even though no member of the Obama administration has endorsed it -- and it has set off a political firestorm.
Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, signed on to the trillion-dollar coin plan, telling Capital New York: ''It sounds silly but it's absolutely legal. And it would normally not be proper to consider such a thing, except when you're faced with blackmail to destroy the country's economy, you have to consider things.''
But he might find resistance from Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon, who said he would introduce legislation to close the loophole and end the debate once and for all.
''My wife and I have owned and operated a small business since 1986. When it came time to pay the bills, we couldn't just mint a coin to create more money out of thin air,'' Mr. Walden said.
The National Republican Congressional Committee, which mocked up a fake trillion-dollar coin with President Obama's face on it, noted the absurdity of the idea by saying that the amount of platinum it would take to mint a trillion-dollar coin would sink the Titanic.
(A technical point, but a relevant one: such a coin would not need to contain a trillion dollars' worth of platinum.)
The decision is pending with the Obama administration, and the Treasury Department said it had no further comment. But when asked at the White House news conference if anyone in the administration was examining using the coin to get around the ceiling, Mr. Carney responded, ''Not that I know of.''

HEADLINE: Cuomo and Legislative Leaders Say They're Close to Deal on New Gun Laws

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN and DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and legislative leaders believe they are close to an agreement on a package of gun laws that includes a restrictive ban on assault weapons, and lawmakers hope to vote on it as soon as next week.
Mr. Cuomo, delivering his third annual State of the State address on Wednesday, called on lawmakers to approve the toughest assault weapons ban in the nation. And, displaying an unsual degree of speed for Albany, lawmakers seemed prepared to move quickly on the governor's request. 
''Forget the extremists -- it's simple,'' Mr. Cuomo said to a crescendo of applause near the end of his nearly-80-minute speech. ''No one hunts with an assault rifle. No one needs 10 bullets to kill a deer. End the madness now.''
Mr. Cuomo not only proposed a far more restrictive assault weapons ban than currently exists in New York, but he also proposed a more comprehensive ban on large-capacity magazines. He also proposed to require background checks for private sales of guns, not just at gun shows and stores. And he called for tougher penalties for buying guns illegally or for using them to commit crimes, as well as for uniform licensing standards across the state.
''This is not taking away people's guns,'' he said. ''That is not what this is about. It is about ending the unnecessary risk of high-capacity assault rifles.''
Mr. Cuomo has been working feverishly to negotiate a deal with lawmakers, and he is said to be close to one that would allow for rapid passage of the gun measures.
Indeed, the Senate Republican leader, Dean G. Skelos of Long Island, said on Wednesday that Republicans were having productive negotiations with Mr. Cuomo. ''I think our goal is to try to get something done by the end of this week, present it to conference next week, and we'll see where we go,'' he said.
Mr. Cuomo, rewriting his agenda after the trauma of the Newtown, Conn., school massacre and the devastation of Hurricane Sandy, proposed a number of measures intended to limit the damage from future storms, in addition to steps intended to reduce the scourge of gun violence.
The governor, a Democrat who has come under attack from the liberal wing of his party as he contemplates a 2016 bid for the presidency, also tacked aggressively to the left with new proposals in his address, delivered in an auditorium at the Capitol complex. He proposed an increase of the state minimum wage to $8.75 an hour from $7.25 an hour, tougher greenhouse gas standards, solar jobs programs, a $1 billion affordable-housing initiative, grants for schools that extend school days and a 10-point plan for women that included strengthening abortion rights laws and enacting equal-pay legislation that garnered the loudest applause.
Mr. Cuomo did not say how his many proposals would be financed; he is to introduce his budget later this month.
The governor said he would continue to push for a referendum in November on expanding casino gambling, and described casinos as vehicles for improving the upstate economy. He said that, at first, he would allow as many as three full-scale casinos upstate, and none in New York City, in an effort to lure tourists to travel upstate.
But guns and the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy were focal points of his address. In New York, the debate resulting from the Newtown school bloodshed was amplified by the shooting deaths of two firefighters in Webster, N.Y.; Mr. Cuomo gave flags to the families of the firefighters, and the police chief from Rochester, which is near Webster, called on New York to lead the nation on gun control.
Speaking of Hurricane Sandy, the governor drew from the early progress of four commissions he created in the wake of the storm, though many of their proposals are still works in progress.
''Climate change is real,'' he said. ''It is denial to say each of these situations is a once-in-a-lifetime. There is a 100-year flood every two years now. It is inarguable that the sea is warmer and there is changing weather pattern, and the time to act is now.''
Among his proposals was a bailout fund for homeowners who want to move out of flood-prone regions, and aid to build homes to better withstand floods. He also called for measures to better protect subways, public utilities, the fuel delivery system and the New York Harbor.
And he excoriated Washington for waiting so long to provide New York and New Jersey with federal storm aid.
''That is just too little and it is too late, and it has nothing to do with the way Congress has acted in the past,'' he said. ''This has long been established that in the face of a disaster, the national government comes in to help.''
''Remember New York,'' he added, ''because New York will not forget, I promise you.''

HEADLINE: Cuomo Calls for the State to Return to Its Progressive Ideals

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who spent his first two years in office establishing himself as a fiscal conservative, turned left in his third annual address to the Legislature, and sought to reclaim the state's progressive mantle.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, had two emotional fulcrums in his sprawling 78-minute address: gun violence and Hurricane Sandy. But most of the speech was devoted to an onslaught of proposals favored by the left wing of his party. 
He proposed increasing the minimum wage to $8.75 an hour from $7.25 an hour, public financing of elections, tougher greenhouse gas standards, solar jobs programs, a $1 billion affordable housing initiative, grants for schools that extend school days and a 10-point women's rights program that garnered loud applause for its provisions strengthening abortion rights laws and enacting equal pay legislation.
''We are a community based on progressive principles,'' the governor said, in a speech to several hundred lawmakers and guests at an auditorium in the Capitol complex. ''We must remain that progressive capital of the nation.''
How the state would pay for any new programs was not clear. The governor is to introduce his budget this month, but until Congress decides how much aid to send to New York to defray the costs of rebuilding after Hurricane Sandy, the state's financial picture will be clouded.
The governor promised not to raise taxes. He has made similar promises in the past, but then agreed to support a new higher tax bracket for the state's highest earners. And he said he would continue to push for a referendum in November allowing an expansion of casino gambling, describing casinos as vehicles for improving the upstate economy. He said that, at first, he would allow as many as three full-scale casinos upstate, and none in New York City, in an effort to lure tourists to travel to economically struggling areas.
Overall, the speech served to reposition the governor, who has faced criticism from the left wing of his party for paying too little attention to their concerns. Liberals praised the governor in 2011 for persuading lawmakers to pass same-sex marriage legislation. But his first two years in office focused on a centrist fiscal policy that included a cap on property tax increases, steep spending cuts and contentious negotiations with unions that resulted in a cut to the pension benefits of future state employees.
Now Mr. Cuomo, who is considered, at least in New York, a presidential contender for 2016, is emphasizing proposals -- some new and some he has suggested in the past -- that cheer his Democratic base. Progressive proposals by Mr. Cuomo are also likely to face a more receptive audience in the Legislature this year because the Senate, which had been controlled by Republicans, is now controlled by a coalition that includes several Democrats, as well as all of the Republicans. The Assembly is controlled by Democrats.
Few advocacy groups on the left found issues they could not applaud. Environmental Advocates of New York said Mr. Cuomo ''showed true leadership'' in his comments on climate change. Andrea Miller, president of Naral Pro-Choice New York, said of his proposed women's initiatives, ''He heard the call and is a true leader.''
Bob Master, director of legislative action at the Communications Workers of America, said, ''To the extent he's using this speech to appeal to the liberal primary electorate, doing something meaningful on public financing would be a big achievement.''
Republicans also saw the trend, but bemoaned it. Assemblyman Steve Katz, a Hudson Valley Republican, called the speech ''a sharp veer to the left offering big government solutions for all problems.''
Even the cover of a 300-page book that accompanied the speech was something of a kitchen sink -- an odd tableau that superimposed a stark image of Breezy Point, the Queens neighborhood devastated by Hurricane Sandy, on the front lawn of the Capitol building, with a new model of the Tappan Zee Bridge soaring overhead.
The governor gave some of his most impassioned remarks to date on guns, a cause he has voiced support for in the past but has not made a legislative priority. Mr. Cuomo's legislative agenda was clearly upended by the recent mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., and the killings of two firefighters in Webster, N.Y. ''End the madness now,'' he said Wednesday.
''Forget the extremists -- it's simple,'' the governor added, to a burst of applause. ''No one hunts with an assault rifle. No one needs 10 bullets to kill a deer.''
The governor also continued to use Hurricane Sandy as a reason to talk about global warming.
''Climate change is real,'' he said. ''It is denial to say each of these situations is a once-in-a-lifetime. There is a 100-year flood every two years now. It is inarguable that the sea is warmer and there is a changing weather pattern, and the time to act is now.''
Among his proposals were a bailout fund for homeowners who want to move out of flood-prone regions, and aid for building homes that can withstand floods -- ideas that are contingent on how much federal aid comes through. He also called for measures to better protect subways, public utilities, the fuel delivery system and New York Harbor.
And he excoriated Washington for waiting so long to provide New York and New Jersey with federal storm aid.
''That is just too little and it is too late, and it has nothing to do with the way Congress has acted in the past,'' he said. ''This has long been established, that in the face of a disaster, the national government comes in to help.''
''Remember New York,'' he added, ''because New York will not forget, I promise you.''

HEADLINE: In the Finger-Pointing Over the Housing Bubble, a New Target Emerges

BYLINE: By JESSE EISINGER, PROPUBLICA. 
Jesse Eisinger is a reporter for ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest. E-mail: jesse@propublica.org Twitter: @eisingerj.

 BODY:
No matter how many times people debunk the notion that government policy created the housing bubble, it doesn't die. It's part of what the blogger Barry Ritholtz has called the "big lie" of the financial crisis. Now, we are having another argument about whether the government is creating a new housing disaster for taxpayers.
The target this time: the Federal Housing Administration, the government mortgage insurer, mostly for low-to-moderate income and minority borrowers. Late last year, the F.H.A. issued its annual report to Congress. According to estimates, over its lifetime the agency will have to pay more out on the mortgages it has insured than it has taken in. The report estimated the potential shortfall at $16 billion, which is a lot in absolute terms, but minuscule in relation to the federal budget and the $1.1 trillion F.H.A. portfolio. 
Despite these modest numbers (more on that below), the same crew that assailed the government's role in the housing bubble is now rending its garments about the F.H.A. Critics, like Edward J. Pinto of the American Enterprise Institute, argue that the agency has not only failed to help low-income communities, but is actually destroying them with reckless loans.
Next month, we may end up doing it all again, when the Office of Management and Budget issues its analysis of the agency's finances, using a different methodology.
So is the F.H.A. in trouble and in need of an imminent bailout?
Not really. According to the actuarial analysis, if the agency stopped backing mortgages right now, it would have a deficit after 30 years. But even by that analysis, it has enough cash for many years. And it will not stop insuring mortgages. In fact, it's backing what are probably going to be very safe and profitable home loans right now, so even if it drew money from the United States Treasury, it would almost certainly be able to pay it back eventually.
And if there is a Treasury infusion, taxpayers should consider it a bargain. The agency has been a rare bright spot in the Obama administration's otherwise dismal record on housing.
In both the boom and bust, the F.H.A. functioned as one would hope a government lending operation would. As the bubble grew and private lenders went nuts, its market share dwindled. (Maybe this wasn't on purpose, but it's better to be lucky than smart.) When the market crashed, the F.H.A. stepped in.
Without the agency's lending, mortgage rates would have doubled and home prices would have dropped another 25 percent, estimates Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics.
John Griffith, a housing policy analyst for the liberal Center for American Progress, has produced several useful rejoinders to the F.H.A.'s critics. He points out that compared to the private sector, the agency is doing quite well. Yes, the agency faces a high rate of delinquencies, but they pale when compared with private sector subprime loans.
At their peak in the fourth quarter of 2009, 9.4 percent of the F.H.A. loans were seriously delinquent, compared with 30.6 percent of subprime loans, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
"To go this far without significant problems after the worst housing crisis since the Great Depression is remarkable," Mr. Griffith said.
The F.H.A. hasn't been perfect. Far from it. The agency was too aggressive with its lending. When it stepped in as the market was collapsing, it should have had more careful lending standards. Now, it has tightened them up and raised its fees, which will put the agency in much better shape.
And its history isn't pure. One of its more disastrous policies was to allow something called seller-financed loans, where a nonprofit organization would broker a deal for a low-income borrower. In truth, someone else, like a developer, would front the costs and this would inflate the cost of house itself. Low-income borrowers could find themselves underwater almost immediately.
"A phenomenal mistake," Mr. Griffith said. The F.H.A. considered banning such loans. But the private sector lobbied for them, and with a push from Congress, the loans continued until 2009.
Yet, the criticism of F.H.A. from Mr. Pinto of the American Enterprise Institute, who in the late 1980s was the chief credit officer of Fannie Mae, goes far beyond that. Mr. Pinto says the F.H.A. has a record of 60 years of "mission failure" and that it's getting worse. Its lending standards have been eroding for years, and now it has an unacceptably high failure rate, he says. His work, including a study late last year, aims to show the F.H.A. has actually hurt the low-income and minority communities it purports to serve.
Mr. Pinto's study cites high rates of delinquencies in many neighborhoods, but that's no surprise. The housing market crashed in many cities. To have high default rates in those areas is hardly a sign of out-of-control government lending.
"I respect Ed, but he's dead wrong," Mr. Zandi of Moody's said. "He's got it absolutely backward." The private sector, not government, led us into the bubble.
Mr. Pinto has been repeatedly criticized for exaggerating the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the mortgage crisis. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission took a long hard look at them, because Peter J. Wallison, a major proponent of the theory that the government created the housing bubble, sat on the commission. The commission found that the Pinto analysis was flawed.
Mr. Pinto is undaunted. He told me he believed that "federal housing policy was the cause of the housing boom and bust. That was what got us into this mess. People want to deny it."
That is what is known, as the Freudians tell us, as projection.
The debate has important consequences. If the F.H.A. does turn out to be a disaster, it undermines the idea that the government can serve a valuable role in financing loans to deserving and responsible people who can't afford traditional mortgages.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Cash for Hay Driving Thieves To Move Bundles

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
DENVER -- Across the West, ranchers, farmers and county sheriffs are grappling with a new scourge: hay rustling.
Months of punishing drought and grass fires have pushed the price of hay, grain and other animal feed to near records, making the golden bales an increasingly irresistible target for thieves. Some steal them for profit. Others are fellow farmers acting out of desperation, their fields too brown to graze animals and their finances too wrecked to afford enough feed for their cattle.
''It's the economics of the times,'' said Jack McGrath, the undersheriff in Colorado's Weld County, where hay thefts rose to 15 last year from 7 in 2011. 
At Mark Reifenrath's farm in northern Colorado, the thieves struck at night.
Two men driving a stolen pickup opened an unguarded farm gate by the side of the road, rolled into Mr. Reifenrath's alfalfa field and headed toward their quarry: 800-pound square bundles of freshly cut hay.
They set to work that October night, hefting two bales onto a flatbed trailer. They might have gotten more, but an employee happened by and noticed flashlight beams bouncing around in the darkness.
Something was up. He yelled out, and the men disappeared into a patch of cattails, leaving behind a half-loaded trailer.
''Maybe it's not the crime of the century, but it affects us,'' Mr. Reifenrath said.
Sheriffs in rural counties in Colorado, Oklahoma, Nebraska and Kansas say the spike in hay thefts is part of a broader rise in agricultural crime.
California's farmers have grappled recently with growing thefts of grapes, beehives and avocados, and sheriffs say high prices of scrap metal have made agricultural machinery -- whether it works or not -- an appealing target. Dubious online merchants are selling feed to farmers but never delivering. On the range, wire fences are being clipped to allow interloping herds to poach grazing land.
Most thieves make off with less than a ton of hay -- about $200 to $300 worth, depending on the quality. But on Labor Day in Wellington, Colo., thieves hot-wired a front-end loader and stole enough hay from Conrad T. Swanson's ranch to fill the flatbed trailer of a semi.
''It's not like someone was just driving by and took enough to feed a horse,'' Mr. Swanson said.
Law enforcement officials said they could do little to prevent the thefts or catch the culprits. Most of the hay is nipped at night along remote roads, from fields and barns hundreds of yards from the nearest home. Because one bundle of hay tends to look like every other one, once a bale is stolen, reclaiming it is harder than finding a needle in a -- well, never mind.
To ward off the hay thieves, farmers are padlocking their gates and painting their bales with their brands. Some are splicing their hay with ribbons that mark their ownership.
In Tillman County, Okla., hay thefts became so rampant that Sheriff Bobby Whittington decided to lay a trap. He bugged a bale in a particularly theft-prone field with a GPS unit and set to waiting, sure that thieves would strike. Sure enough, his phone rang one night in March last year with the news that the tracking device was on the move.
The sheriff hopped into his car and headed toward the signal. When he reached it, he found his culprits, and the bugged bale. Pulling them over, he said, he told the driver, ''We need to talk about that hay bale you've got there.''
The men were belligerent at first, Mr. Whittington said, until he explained how he had tracked them down. Before being arrested, the driver offered a plea.
''He just hung his old head and said, 'Can I take it back?''' Mr. Whittington said. ''And I said, 'No.'''

HEADLINE: Restoring Iran's Heritage of Magnificent Homes in an Age of High-Rises

BYLINE: By THOMAS ERDBRINK

 BODY:
KASHAN, Iran -- A petite woman in gray boots and a checkered scarf, Shanaz Nader had spent much of her adult life abroad, with long stretches in Tokyo, London and New York. But here she was braving a cold wind in this desert city three hours south of Tehran, making her way through a maze of high mud-brick walls.
Black-clad women waited at a small bakery as the rattling noise of a motorcycle in the distance echoed through the alleys. Finally, Mrs. Nader, an interior designer in Tehran, reached her destination: a large, two-panel wood door that opened up to her fully renovated weekend home, a majestic old Iranian house with four bedrooms, colored-glass windows, a separate office, two garden areas and a large rectangular marble fountain. 
After boiling tea, Mrs. Nader, 68, sighed and sat down under an arched passageway. The sun reflected in the fountain, as the wind blew in faint sounds of the midday call to prayer.
''Whenever I dreamed of Iran while being in some faraway place, I dreamed of owning such a house,'' she said.
For thousands of years, houses with secluded gardens and courtyards have been a cornerstone of Iranian architecture, which strongly influenced structures like the Alhambra and the Taj Mahal. Similar dwellings are described in literature from Achaemenid times, around 700 B.C., and their old Persian name is the root for the word ''paradise.''
But in past decades the houses fell out of favor and were widely demolished to make way for glassed apartment blocks, especially in Tehran. The sprawling family gardens on the flanks of the Alborz Mountains in the capital have long since been demolished to make way for high rises, turning landowners into millionaires but wiping out Iran's architectural heritage.
But Mrs. Nader and some others are beginning to reverse that trend. In recent years, dozens of houses and palaces in Kashan, a city known for its carpets and traditional Iranian architecture, have been painstakingly renovated into holiday homes and hotels.
She was drawn to Kashan in 2008 when the owner of one of the palaces, Manoucheri House, built 200 years ago by a local merchant family, asked for her help in transforming it into a boutique hotel. Well known in Tehran for her basic but tasteful furniture and printed textiles that strike a delicate balance between the old and the new, Mrs. Nader was an obvious choice for the job, and she jumped at the opportunity.
Now, all across the old neighborhoods of Kashan, laborers are renovating houses that until recently were neglected by their owners.
At first the newcomers stirred opposition from local people, apparently upset that some of the renovations were being done with government money, which they wanted for building modern housing. ''Hundreds of people signed a petition asking for the old houses to be flattened instead,'' said Akbar Arezugar, 54, a renovation supervisor from Kashan. ''But when the renovation was done, the cleric who was leading the opposition personally called everybody involved, apologized and applauded the work we had done.''
While many Iranian cities face unemployment and an economic downturn because of sanctions and mismanagement of the economy, the burst of renovations -- most of them by individuals -- is keeping Kashan bustling.
Mohsen Shahi, a 26-year-old architect, said he much preferred working on the renovations to designing apartment buildings, something that many of his university friends are doing. ''If I had an unlimited budget I would buy old houses and rebuild them the way they were,'' he said.
Mr. Shahi was working on the Ameri House, a huge property with seven courtyards with fountains and dozens of rooms that is scheduled to open as a hotel in April. ''For a long time it seemed as though our love for culture had diminished in our country,'' he said. ''Those old families that once built these beautiful houses were not thinking of profits, but of their legacies. Thankfully, now we are starting to learn from them.''
When her work on the boutique hotel was finished, Mrs. Nader looked for a place of her own. The first time she saw her house it was run-down and filled with dirt. Parts were even slated for demolition. ''I bought it for $20,000 and people said I was crazy,'' she said, while giving a tour of the house. The restoration cost another $300,000, she said, and has been worth every penny.
She is planning to write a book on traditional Iranian architecture, and has also built an office where she wants to work with local architects.
For most people, it is a labor of love. For the hotels, renovation costs are high, without much prospect of making profits. There are almost no foreign tourists anymore making their way to Kashan, which lies 30 miles north of Iran's main uranium enrichment facility in Natanz. Many people fear the nuclear site could one day come under attack, with possibly deadly consequences for those living in its vicinity.
''Sometimes I worry about the future,'' she said, standing on one of the roofs of her house. In the distance, snow-capped mountain peaks basked in the sun. ''But history shows that Iran always lands on its feet. I'm not abandoning ship.''

HEADLINE: Shares Rise as Companies Begin to Report Earnings

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks rose on Wall Street on Wednesday after corporate earnings reports got off to a good start.
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 61.66 points to 13,390.51. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 3.87 points to 1,461.02, and the Nasdaq composite rose 14 to 3,105.81. 
Stocks are facing their first big challenge of the year as companies start to report earnings for the fourth quarter of 2012. Throughout last year, analysts cut their outlook for earnings growth in the period and now expect them to rise by 3.21 percent, according to data from S&P Capital IQ.
''Maybe earnings expectations were a little too low,'' Ryan Detrick, a strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research, said. ''You don't need to have great earnings, you just need to beat those expectations'' for stocks to rally, he said.
Early indications were decent. The aluminum maker Alcoa reported late Tuesday that it swung to a profit for the fourth quarter, with earnings that met Wall Street's expectations. The company brought in more revenue than analysts had expected, and the company predicted rising demand for aluminum this year as the aerospace industry gains strength. Alcoa is usually the first Dow component to report earnings every quarter.
Despite the better revenue number, Alcoa's stock performance Wednesday was lackluster. It traded higher for part of the day, then ended down 2 cents at $9.08 a share.
Other companies fared better after reporting earnings. Helen of Troy, which sells personal care products under brands like Dr. Scholl's and Vidal Sassoon, rose 2.7 percent, up 90 cents to $34.43 after reporting a 15 percent increase in quarterly net income.
Boeing was the biggest gainer of the 30 stocks in the Dow. It jumped 3.5 percent, up $2.63 to $76.76, after two days of sharp declines set off by new problems for its 787 Dreamliner. Boeing said it had ''extreme confidence'' in the plane even as federal investigators tried to determine the cause of a fire on Monday aboard an empty Japan Airlines plane in Boston and a fuel leak in another Japan Airlines 787 on Tuesday.
The wireless network operator Clearwire rose 7.2 percent, or 21 cents, to $3.13, after Dish network made an unsolicited offer to buy the company, which has already agreed to sell itself to Sprint. Dish rose 88 cents to $36.85, and Sprint fell 9 cents to $5.88.
The online education company Apollo Group fell 7.8 percent after reporting a sharp decline in fall term student sign-ups at the University of Phoenix, which it operates. The stock fell $1.62, to $19.32 a share.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 1/32, to 97 29/32, and the yield was unchanged at 1.86 percent.

HEADLINE: A Slimming Wall Street Giant

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
When Morgan Stanley's top executives gathered in mid-September at the Gramercy Park Hotel in Manhattan to discuss strategy, some participants complained that the room was too small.
Apparently, that was the point: James P. Gorman, Morgan Stanley's chief executive, chose the cramped quarters to force discussion among the executives, said people briefed on his decision but not authorized to speak on the record.
These days, it is the Wall Street firm that is finding itself a bit boxed in.
Regulatory demands, weak markets and lower credit ratings have weighed on all banks, but perhaps more so on Morgan Stanley, the smallest of the big Wall Street firms. In the three years that Mr. Gorman, 54, has been at the helm, the bank has been progressively shrinking its business of trading bonds, commodities and other investments and expanding into wealth management. 
Now the storied company - whose take-no-prisoners trading desks have at times been rivaled only by firms like Goldman Sachs - is cutting even deeper, raising questions among some on Wall Street about whether it should spin off or ditch much of its trading business as its Swiss rival UBS has, a suggestion the firm eschews.
Morgan Stanley is planning another deep round of cuts: 1,600 jobs, accounting for 6 percent of its support work force, and, more telling, 6 percent of institutional securities, which includes its once vaunted trading business.
The planned cuts come just a week ahead of the release of fourth-quarter earnings, which are expected to show the gains the firm has made since the financial crisis in areas like stock trading, banking and wealth management but still will be weighed down by the diminished earnings power of its fixed income business.
Whether the company can avoid shrinking further - and a number of analysts say that additional cuts will be needed - and revive the fixed-income trading business will have significant ripple effects in the financial world.
While the strategy of cutting in some places and building out wealth management may lead to a more stable company, the retreat also means that the fixed-income trading business over all is becoming increasingly dominated by two Wall Street banks - JPMorgan Chase and Goldman - as well as by hedge funds and other investment firms that are more lightly regulated than banks like Morgan Stanley.
Before the financial crisis, the fixed income division at Morgan Stanley, which was created by J. P. Morgan partners when Depression-era laws forced them to split banking from trading, was one of the firm's biggest moneymakers. Now, it is a drain on operations, producing just 20 percent of its revenue but tying up roughly half of its capital.
In recent years, the fixed-income department has not been able to make enough money to cover the cost to Morgan Stanley of this capital, according to people briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak on the record.
The fallout can be seen in compensation: a year ago, 110 of the roughly 500 managing directors in sales and trading did not get a bonus, and that number is expected to grow next week when bonuses are handed out.
Still, Mr. Gorman has received high marks from some on Wall Street for playing a difficult hand in the wake of the financial crisis. On Wednesday, he received a big vote of confidence when Daniel S. Loeb's hedge fund told investors that it was taking a stake, saying that Morgan Stanley was "in the early innings of a turnaround."
Still, hobbled by the new realities on Wall Street, that turnaround has so far proved to be a Sisyphean task.
The stock, said the shareholder Christopher Grisanti, has "languished." Mr. Grisanti is the owner and co-founder of Grisanti Capital Management, which owns 690,000 shares of Morgan Stanley, valued at $13.5 million.
While the stock has risen since Mr. Grisanti bought it, it is down almost 40 percent since Mr. Gorman took over in January 2010, and big shareholders like the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ of Japan, which holds a 22 percent stake valued at $8.5 billion, have had little in the way of returns. Morgan Stanley's return on equity, Wall Street's main benchmark of profitability, is 6 percent, down from 23.8 percent in 2006.
Morgan Stanley's board, said people briefed on the matter, has discussed closing its fixed-income department. Instead, the firm is shrinking the unit, arguing that it is important to offer its customers those trading services. By cutting jobs and costs and exiting lines like structured products and other complex financial investments and focusing on less risky, less capital-intensive businesses like the trading of interest rates, executives contended that the division can generate a healthy return.
"We are not going to pull a UBS," the senior executive Colm Kelleher told a private dinner of Morgan Stanley shareholders at Oceana restaurant in Midtown Manhattan.
A Morgan Stanley spokesman, Wesley McDade, said the firm was optimistic about its prospects.
"In 2013, we expect to benefit from the many strategic decisions we have taken, including an aggressive move into wealth management, a further strengthening of our pre-eminent equities and investment banking franchises, and the repositioning of our fixed income business to meet the realities of the new world," he said.
Morgan Stanley wants to achieve a return on equity of 10 percent in the near term, and it is making progress as it continues to shed both employees and risky assets. Longer term, Morgan Stanley is shooting for a return on equity in the middle teens, according to people briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak on the record.
Critics said Morgan Stanley executives initially moved too slowly to cut business lines, and set unrealistic revenue goals for the division that were never met.
Recently, Mr. Gorman tapped one of his bankers, John Pruzan, to be his eyes and ears in meetings about the revamping of the department. Even that move was not without controversy, though. Some executives in that department, including the fixed income chief Kenneth deRegt, felt it added an unnecessary layer of management.
At the same time, while trying to squeeze risk out, it has taken some surprising ones, hiring for instance a powerful and controversial trader to run its rates desk, a primary center of growth for the fixed-income department. That trader, Glenn Hadden, is under investigation by a key regulator for his trading in Treasury futures. In 2009, he was put on leave at Goldman because of a separate trading incident.
Through Mr. McDade, the Morgan Stanley spokesman, Mr. Hadden declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Hadden also declined to comment, but has said that his client did not engage in manipulative activity.
The firm Mr. Gorman runs bears little resemblance to the one that existed before the financial crisis. Mr. Gorman's predecessor, John J. Mack, pushed risk-taking, leading to a $9 billion loss in 2007, one of the largest single trading losses in history, as well as billions of dollars in additional losses because of exposure to bond insurers.
These events nearly crippled the firm, and Morgan Stanley was forced to sell a piece of itself to Mitsubishi, which injected $9 billion into the firm. Not long after, in January 2009, Morgan Stanley made another important strategic investment, combining its wealth management operations with Citigroup in a joint venture that gave Morgan Stanley control.
Still, just weeks after taking over as chief, Mr. Gorman took the stage at a Hilton in Midtown Manhattan on a cold winter day to assure a standing-room-only crowd of investors that maintaining the firm's position as one of Wall Street's most powerful investment banks was a top priority for him.
Even in early 2010, however, it was clear to many inside the firm that he would have his work cut out for him.
Every Wednesday, executives from various corners of the bank who belonged to what was known as the asset liability committee would meet at noon to examine the cost to the firm of everything from looming credit-rating downgrades to regulatory changes.
"It was the most depressing meeting ever," said one attendee who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "It was very clear the Morgan Stanley we knew was never coming back."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Cure for Frostbite: Summer Plans

BYLINE: By KJ DELL'ANTONIA

 BODY:
Unbelievably, it is time to plan for summer.
For working parents, summer presents a logistical challenge, and often a significant expense. Last year, the American Express Spending and Saving Tracker estimated that average per-child summer spending on everything from travel to camp to child care hovered around $600, while affluent families spent $1,000 or more - and many Motherlode readers scoffed in disbelief, noting that their expenses for even the least glamorous of camps or day care for the 10 or more weeks of summer could easily run multiples of that.
Planning ahead can help mitigate both the stress and the cost. As difficult as it is to think about summer when ponds are just freezing over and snowy fields beckon kids and sleds, now is the time to take a hard look at who will do what when in June, July and August. 
Parents with children who want to return to particular camps may find that their camp offers a discount for returning campers. Many camps, from the long-established overnights to day camps of all kinds, offer early registration discounts. If you're able to pay up front, camps might offer an even larger discount.
Parents of long-time campers struggling with finances this year should certainly call camp staff. Many camps (again, overnight and day, from mountain biking to robotics) have scholarships available, and now is the time to ask or apply. Camps are often family-run small businesses, and could also be open to trading services for camp time. If you could update an online registration system, provide cords of wood for campfires, or resurface a tennis court, say so.
If it's too soon to register for your choices, you should mark your calendars with registration dates. E-mail science museums, theaters and town recreation departments to be put on their mailing lists. In our town, the most economical, working-parent-friendly camps for young children fill up fast, as do the most desirable or limited offerings. (Vermont's famous Cirkus Smirkus camps? Already full for 2013.) Camps and summer care for children younger than kindergarten are the most difficult to find.
Free camps are out there, too - last year, Pacific University in Oregon offered a free four-week long computer science camp for girls. New York City Public school students can apply to programs like G.O.A.L.S., a six-week-long program of academic enrichment for girls, or the co-ed Summer Arts Institute. Those programs are competitive; our local college runs week-long free robotics camps (some for girls, some co-ed) and admits children based on a lottery, but you need to know when to apply and, of course, you need a back-up plan. Apple's retail stores ran free "camps" in some locations last year, focused on movie making (on their products, of course). To find free camps in your area, I suggest multiple concentrated Web searches adding locations and interests, subjects and ages to the phrase "free summer camp."
"Unstructured" summer time can benefit from a little planning, too. Many parents with flexible schedules and fond summer memories of biking and roaming the neighborhood (myself included) don't choose a full summer of planned activity. Working parents whose children need supervision can reach out now to similarly situated friends to trade weeks of multifamily child care, or could agree now to hire one or two high school or college students to run an at-home "camp" for several families' worth of children. Similarly, now is the time to book grandparents for a care-giving visit.
If you can plan a week or more of unstructured time at home with your children, or a family vacation, you'll enjoy it more if everything else is in place to make the rest of your summer run smoothly. Many of us parents made some version of the same resolution this year: to be more present, to be more purposeful, to make decisions about what we want to do rather than drifting. Plan now, and you'll have a better chance of creating the summer you want to remember.
So: it's January. Do you know what your children will do this summer?

HEADLINE: Benefits of College Degree In Recession Are Outlined

BYLINE: By RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑA

 BODY:
Young adults have long faced a rough job market, but in the last recession and its aftermath, college graduates did not lose nearly as much ground as their less-educated peers, according to a new study. 
The study, published on Wednesday by the Pew Charitable Trusts, shows that among Americans age 21 to 24, the drop in employment and income was much steeper among people who lacked a college degree.
The findings come as many published articles and books have told the stories of young college graduates unable to find work, and questioned the conventional wisdom that a college education is a worthwhile investment and the key to opportunity and social mobility. The study did not take into account the cost of going to college.
''This shows that any amount of post-secondary education does improve the labor market outcomes for those recent graduates,'' said Diana Elliott, the research manager for Pew's Economic Mobility Project. ''This is not necessarily to discredit those individual stories.''
In fact, the study documents a serious decline in the job picture for young people.
Using data from the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey, Pew looked at employment, either full time or part time, among 21- to 24-year-olds, in the roughly two and a half years before the 2007-2009 recession, during it, and in the two and a half years after it.
Among those whose highest degree was a high school diploma, only 55 percent had jobs even before the downturn, and that fell to 47 percent after it. For young people with an associate's degree, the employment rate fell from 64 percent to 57 percent.
But those with a bachelor's degree started off in the strongest position and weathered the downturn best, with employment slipping from 69 percent to 65 percent. (The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics recorded a similar decline, about four percentage points, among all people over 20, at any education level.)
Similarly, in all three groups of young adults, wages fell for those who had work, but the decline was spread unevenly.
People with four-year college degrees saw a 5 percent drop in wages, compared with a 12 percent decrease for their peers with associate's degrees, and a 10 percent decline for high school graduates.
One surprise in the data, Ms. Elliott said, had to do with ''the prevailing speculation that people who couldn't find work were returning to school, enhancing their training.'' In fact, college enrollment over all rose sharply for several years, driven primarily by older students, before leveling off in 2011.
But Pew's study found that among people age 21 to 24, the rate of college enrollment actually declined slightly, during and after the recession.

HEADLINE: Taxes and the Decision to Invest

BYLINE: By ROBB MANDELBAUM

 BODY:
Beginning in November, just after the election - and a thorough debate over how higher taxes might affect small businesses - we started inviting readers to share the intimate details of their businesses' financial conditions. We are particularly interested in exploring the relationship between income taxes and investment.
Now, with a "fiscal cliff" deal in place that preserves tax rates for most Americans but raises them for the very wealthy, we present the first of what we hope will be a series of small-business tax profiles - posts that look at how tax policies affect specific businesses. Our first owner, Jed Horovitz, believes - contrary to the claim advanced by many small-business owners - that higher taxes encourage more investment. He made this point in a comment to our October examination of claims Mitt Romney made at the first presidential debate. (We have sought owners with differing view points through such organizations as the National Federation of Independent Business and the S Corporation Association, both of which strongly opposed any income tax increase.)
THE OWNER AND HIS COMPANY Mr. Horovitz, 62, is president and chief executive of Internet Video Archive, which supplies streaming film trailers to the Web sites of 85 clients (including, as it happens, The New York Times). The company employs 19 people and is based in Haddon Heights, N.J., near Philadelphia. 
THE FINANCIALS Mr. Horovitz estimates that the company will have $2 million in revenue in 2012. Its biggest expense - or investment - is employee salaries: about $1.1 million, he said, which does not include Mr. Horovitz's pay. (He said he took his own payment as a draw of profits from the company, which is organized as a limited liability corporation.) To do much of its work, the company uses cloud computing. Storing videos and delivering them to clients in 2012 cost about $200,000. Leased software and other Internet services costs came to $100,000. Given this reliance on Internet-based services, capital expenditures on hardware and owned software was just $50,000. Sales and marketing expenses were $150,000. Rent and other office expenses amounted to $100,000. Insurance and legal costs were $50,000.
Those expenses totaled about $1.75 million in 2012, leaving Internet Video Archive with a taxable income of about $250,000. However, Mr. Horovitz owns the company's building, so the rent it pays goes to him. And his wife draws a salary as the company's director of marketing and communications. All told, Mr. Horovitz expects his taxable income will reach $450,000 to $500,000.
THE TAX BITE For the past few years, Mr. Horovitz's household income has landed him in the top two tax brackets. "My effective rate has been 25 percent," he said. Using the Tax Policy Center's ever-useful Tax Calculator, we can estimate how much federal tax he would pay in 2013, assuming his (and his company's) financials do not change a lot. If the Horovitzes take a standard deduction off income of $450,000, then according to the Tax Policy Center calculator, they will pay $121,576 under the newly enacted American Taxpayer Relief Act, a few hundred dollars more than if the Bush tax cuts had remained in place. (Even though the tax rates remain the same for the Horovitzes, the new law phases out the personal exemptions for married couples making more than $267,200, which adds nearly $3,000 to the couple's regular income tax liability. However, with the Bush tax cuts still in place, they would also be subject to the alternative minimum tax, which nearly evens things out.)
If, on the other hand, his household income is $500,000 in 2013, he will pay $140,815, according to the calculator, almost $4,500 more than if the Bush tax cuts had remained in effect. "The marginal difference is not very much, especially as a percent of our expenses or income," Mr. Horovitz said. "Since my particular bracket is right on the edge of this divide, it isn't that big a push to make me spend or save. If a business is deeply impacted by a tax rate of a few percent, it has other, more pressing problems!" (In fact, the Horovitzes itemize their deductions, which further reduces their taxable income and would presumably result in lower taxes under either situation produced by the tax calculator.)
As far as tax breaks go, Mr. Horovitz said, "I take what's available." But, he added, "I don't devote too much time to it, in terms of planning ahead. My accountant once said to me, 'If you're making money and paying taxes, it's a good thing.' You don't want to waste your life figuring out how not to pay more taxes. Spend your time trying to make more money."
AND THE IMPACT ON INVESTMENT In Mr. Horovitz's view, small-business owners are being disingenuous when they claim that higher taxes would discourage further investment in their companies. "It's true if you wait until the end of the year, and you're talking about the money that's been taxed, then of course you have less after taxes. But if you spend it before it's taxed, it reduces the taxes you pay.
"They're not really thinking long term, and they're not thinking sustainably," he continued. "That's not a very aggressive way of running a business. It's a timid way of running a business. And I don't think it's what they really do - they're not timid."
Mr. Horovitz said that he is eager to expand Internet Video Archive because the company is finally able to take advantage of economies of scale. "We've just gotten to a tipping point in the last couple years," he said. "Because our expenses have really been the same, but our revenues were $1.5 million, or one-and-a-quarter million." Before 2012, when he drew up a budget, he estimated his pretax income would come to about $300,000. "We grew more than I expected," he said. "I wish that I had come up with more ways to invest in my company over the year. And as I'm doing the budget for next year, I'm planning on spending more."
In 2013, Mr. Horovitz plans to spend an additional $100,000 to $200,000. "We're spending more on marketing travel, to reach out and find new customers," he said. He plans to hire two additional people - "people who aren't necessary to service the business I've got, but to grow the business." And, he added, "I've given people raises because we grew more than expected and I think part of that is their productivity went up."
Mr. Horovitz said: "People say higher taxes are a disincentive to investment - yes, if this is your last year in business. But if it's not your last year in business, it's an incentive to investment."
If you're a business owner and an employer, and you're willing to talk openly about your finances, your taxes, and your investment plans, we'd like to hear from you. Please e-mail The Agenda and let us know you're interested.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: For Americans Under 50, Stark Findings on Health

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
Younger Americans die earlier and live in poorer health than their counterparts in other developed countries, with far higher rates of death from guns, car accidents and drug addiction, according to a new analysis of health and longevity in the United States.
Researchers have known for some time that the United States fares poorly in comparison with other rich countries, a trend established in the 1980s. But most studies have focused on older ages, when the majority of people die. 
The findings were stark. Deaths before age 50 accounted for about two-thirds of the difference in life expectancy between males in the United States and their counterparts in 16 other developed countries, and about one-third of the difference for females. The countries in the analysis included Canada, Japan, Australia, France, Germany and Spain.
The 378-page study by a panel of experts convened by the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council is the first to systematically compare death rates and health measures for people of all ages, including American youths. It went further than other studies in documenting the full range of causes of death, from diseases to accidents to violence. It was based on a broad review of mortality and health studies and statistics.
The panel called the pattern of higher rates of disease and shorter lives ''the U.S. health disadvantage,'' and said it was responsible for dragging the country to the bottom in terms of life expectancy over the past 30 years. American men ranked last in life expectancy among the 17 countries in the study, and American women ranked second to last.
''Something fundamental is going wrong,'' said Dr. Steven Woolf, chairman of the Department of Family Medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University, who led the panel. ''This is not the product of a particular administration or political party. Something at the core is causing the U.S. to slip behind these other high-income countries. And it's getting worse.''
Car accidents, gun violence and drug overdoses were major contributors to years of life lost by Americans before age 50.
The rate of firearm homicides was 20 times higher in the United States than in the other countries, according to the report, which cited a 2011 study of 23 countries. And though suicide rates were lower in the United States, firearm suicide rates were six times higher.
Sixty-nine percent of all American homicide deaths in 2007 involved firearms, compared with an average of 26 percent in other countries, the study said. ''The bottom line is that we are not preventing damaging health behaviors,'' said Samuel Preston, a demographer and sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania, who was on the panel. ''You can blame that on public health officials, or on the health care system. No one understands where responsibility lies.''
Panelists were surprised at just how consistently Americans ended up at the bottom of the rankings. The United States had the second-highest death rate from the most common form of heart disease, the kind that causes heart attacks, and the second-highest death rate from lung disease, a legacy of high smoking rates in past decades. American adults also have the highest diabetes rates.
Youths fared no better. The United States has the highest infant mortality rate among these countries, and its young people have the highest rates of sexually transmitted diseases, teen pregnancy and deaths from car crashes. Americans lose more years of life before age 50 to alcohol and drug abuse than people in any of the other countries.
Americans also had the lowest probability over all of surviving to the age of 50. The report's second chapter details health indicators for youths where the United States ranks near or at the bottom. There are so many that the list takes up four pages. Chronic diseases, including heart disease, also played a role for people under 50.
''We expected to see some bad news and some good news,'' Dr. Woolf said. ''But the U.S. ranked near and at the bottom in almost every heath indicator. That stunned us.''
There were bright spots. Death rates from cancers that can be detected with tests, like breast cancer, were lower in the United States. Adults had better control over their cholesterol and high blood pressure. And the very oldest Americans -- above 75 -- tended to outlive their counterparts.
The panel sought to explain the poor performance. It noted the United States has a highly fragmented health care system, with limited primary care resources and a large uninsured population. It has the highest rates of poverty among the countries studied.
Education also played a role. Americans who have not graduated from high school die from diabetes at three times the rate of those with some college, Dr. Woolf said. In the other countries, more generous social safety nets buffer families from the health consequences of poverty, the report said.
Still, even the people most likely to be healthy, like college-educated Americans and those with high incomes, fare worse on many health indicators.
The report also explored less conventional explanations. Could cultural factors like individualism and dislike of government interference play a role? Americans are less likely to wear seat belts and more likely to ride motorcycles without helmets.
The United States is a bigger, more heterogeneous society with greater levels of economic inequality, and comparing its health outcomes to those in countries like Sweden or France may seem lopsided. But the panelists point out that this country spends more on health care than any other in the survey. And as recently as the 1950s, Americans scored better in life expectancy and disease than many of the other countries in the current study.

HEADLINE: A Step Backward in Bank Regulations

 BODY:
A committee of central bankers and regulators from more than two dozen countries, including the United States, has disappointingly given in to lobbying by big banks and watered down important rules meant to strengthen the global financial system. The change will let banks include risky financial instruments like corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities as part of their liquid asset reserves, which are meant to cover up to 30 days of cash outflows during crises. And the banks have until 2019, not 2015, to comply fully with the easier standards. Each nation will decide when and how to implement the rules. 
The committee unanimously rolled back the so-called Basel III rules that were adopted in 2010 to make them ''more realistic,'' said Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England. The banks argued that requiring them to hold most of their liquid reserves as cash and government securities would restrict their ability to lend to small businesses and consumers because they would have less money to lend.
The problem is that the new assets defined as liquid are precisely those that banks found difficult to value and trade in 2008. Relying on them to provide liquidity during a crisis is a recipe for disaster, said Anat Admati, a professor of finance and economics at Stanford University.
But the banks want to be allowed to hold more such assets because they are more profitable than cash or government bonds, like 10-year Treasury notes, which were yielding just 1.86 percent a year on Wednesday. Big banks also know that in a crisis they would likely receive emergency loans and capital from central banks and their governments, so why tie up their reserves with assets that provide only modest returns?
Coming four years after the failure of Lehman Brothers, the dilution of liquidity standards suggests that banks are again dictating policy in ways that will put the world at greater risk of another crisis. Policy makers in Washington and other capitals need to ask banking regulators to hold the line on the very limited progress made so far.

HEADLINE: State Department Official Urges Britain Not to Loosen Ties With European Union

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE and ANDREW HIGGINS; Stephen Castle reported from London, and Andrew Higgins from Dublin.

 BODY:
LONDON -- The United States entered Britain's debate over its relationship with the European Union on Wednesday, when a senior diplomat implicitly warned the British government not to do anything that might endanger its membership in the 27-nation union.
The comments, made in London by Philip Gordon, the assistant secretary of state for Europe, echo sentiments expressed by a number of European officials. But they are likely to have a bigger impact in Britain because of the closeness of its ties to Washington, a point of pride in London. 
The timing of the rare public intervention is also significant, coming shortly before a long-awaited speech by Prime Minister David Cameron in which he intends to lay out plans for a redefinition of Britain's relationship with the European Union.
Mr. Gordon's remarks, in which he stressed the importance of Britain's role in the bloc, add Washington's voice to growing alarm in European capitals and in Brussels, the headquarters of the union's bureaucratic apparatus, over the possibility that Britain will distance itself from the union.
Speaking at a news conference in Dublin on Wednesday, Enda Kenny, the prime minister of Ireland, which took over the union's rotating presidency this month, said it would be ''disastrous for a country like Britain to leave the union.'' He pleaded with London to stay fully engaged with the bloc.
Mr. Cameron, whose Conservative Party faces a growing electoral challenge from a stridently anti-European Union group, the U.K. Independence Party, has said he wants Britain to stay in the union but to negotiate a looser relationship. He has indicated that he will seek the approval of British voters for such an arrangement. In Mr. Cameron's speech, expected before the end of the month, he may specifically promise a referendum.
In London, Mr. Gordon indicated that any British withdrawal from the union would be unwelcome and said that referendums held by other nations on European Union agreements ''have sometimes turned countries inward.''
''We have a growing relationship with the E.U. as an institution, which has an increasing voice in the world, and we want to see a strong British voice in that E.U.,'' he told British reporters, according to a transcript released by the United States Embassy in London. ''That is in the American interest. We welcome an outward-looking E.U. with Britain in it.'' He added: ''Britain is such a special partner of the United States -- that shares our values, shares our interests, has significant resources to bring to the table. More than most others, its voice within the European Union is essential and critical for the United States.''
Britain joined the European Economic Community, the predecessor of the union, 40 years ago this month. But the ideals of European unity have never been embraced by a majority of Britons, and the country tends to see its membership in more pragmatic terms than most continental nations do. Britain has ''opted out'' of several of the union's major integration initiatives, most notably the single euro currency, and the debt crisis in the euro zone has tended to sharpen public hostility to the union in Britain.
Responding by e-mail to Mr. Gordon's comments, the British Foreign Office said that ''the prime minister has been clear that he wants Britain to be at the heart of a reformed E.U. and that our approach is determined absolutely by the national interest.''
''We think there need to be changes in the E.U. to better meet the interests of all member states,'' the Foreign Office statement added. ''And we believe that the current debate about the changes the euro zone countries require to protect their national interests provides the opportunity for the U.K. to ask for changes too.''
The idea of Britain's quitting the bloc, once almost inconceivable, has gained ground in recent months, to the alarm of some business leaders, who have spoken in favor of continued membership. These include Roger Carr, president of the Confederation of British Industry, the country's most prominent business lobby.
It has also stirred deep unease in Ireland, which has developed close ties with Britain after years of mutual suspicion and is aghast at Mr. Cameron's policy toward Europe. The two countries have developed starkly different views on the merits of European integration. While Dublin credits the union with playing a key role in Ireland's economic and social development and in its weathering of a banking crisis in 2008, London tends to view the bloc's bureaucracy as meddlesome and an affront to national sovereignty.
Mr. Kenny, the Irish leader, said it was highly unlikely that the European Union would agree to rewrite treaty terms to allow for what Mr. Cameron called a ''new settlement,'' an arrangement that would let Britain retain access to the single market but exempt it from rules it did not like.
Revising treaty terms to suit Britain, Mr. Kenny said, would only ''open the floodgates'' to demands from other member states and undermine the union's foundations.

HEADLINE: Activists Convicted in Vietnam Crackdown on Dissent

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

 BODY:
BANGKOK -- A court in central Vietnam convicted 14 bloggers, writers and political and social activists on Wednesday of plotting to overthrow the government and sentenced them to prison terms ranging from 3 to 13 years in what human rights groups said was the largest subversion case to be brought in years.
The defendants were arrested in 2011 and accused of links to a banned pro-democracy group led from California. The government says the group -- Viet Tan, or Vietnam Reform Party -- seeks its overthrow. 
A number of the defendants are members of the Redemptorist group in the Roman Catholic Church, which has been engaged in community service and has taken up the causes of land seizures and corruption. Redemptorist activists have become increasingly assertive in Vietnamese movements for democracy and human rights, and some churches and parishes have become centers of dissent.
Nguyen Thi Hue, a defense lawyer, told The Associated Press in Vietnam that three defendants in the two-day trial in the city of Vinh, in Nghe An Province, had been sentenced to 13 years and that 11 others had received terms of three to eight years. One of the three-year terms was suspended.
The charges of ''activities aimed at overthrowing the people's administration,'' of ''undermining of national unity'' and of participating in ''propaganda against the Socialist Republic of Vietnam'' have often been brought against dissidents in a government crackdown that has waxed and waned over the years.
The United States Embassy in Hanoi said in a statement that it was ''deeply troubled'' by the convictions and called them ''part of a disturbing human rights trend in Vietnam.''
Phil Robertson, deputy director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch, said this was the largest group to be brought to trial together in recent times.
''This is part of an ongoing, deepening crackdown we've been seeing for the past year and a half or two years,'' Mr. Robertson said. ''These people are bloggers, land activists, have attended or tried to attend dissident trials, have been involved in dissident activities including supporting poor people and people with disabilities.''
He added, ''This is a message to other dissidents and bloggers that Vietnam means business.''
Mr. Robertson said the defendants had been charged after attending a training course in Bangkok held by Viet Tan. In the 1980s, the group led a resistance movement against the Vietnamese Communist government, but for the past few decades it has declared that it is committed to peaceful political reform, democracy and human rights in Vietnam.
Some defendants had also participated in peaceful protests in support of other dissidents who were on trial or in relation to China.
Protests have grown in recent years over China's claims to disputed territory in the South China Sea and over a major bauxite plant run by China in Vietnam's central highlands. The government has cracked down on demonstrations and Internet commentary for fear they could veer out of control and because of an antigovernment tone in many of them.
Five of the defendants had blogged in support of freedom of expression and of multiparty democracy, Human Rights Watch said. Before the trial, one of them, Dang Xuan Dieu, was quoted as saying, ''I have done nothing contrary to my conscience'' and that in punishing him, the government was ''trampling on the eternal good morals of the Vietnamese nation.''
The other 13 convicted, as listed by Human Rights Watch, are Dang Ngoc Minh, Ho Duc Hoa, Ho Van Oanh, Le Van Son, Nguyen Dang Minh Man, Nguyen Dang Vinh Phuc, Nguyen Dinh Cuong, Nguyen Van Duyet, Nguyen Van Oai, Nguyen Xuan Oanh, Nong Hung Anh, Thai Van Dung, and Tran Minh Nhat.
As the Vietnamese economy grows fitfully and its expanding middle class becomes more lively and engaged, the government has carried out vigorous campaigns to police the Internet and curb public demonstrations.
In a New Year's address that assessed the gains and shortcomings of Vietnam's leadership, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung restated the government's concern that conspirators continued to threaten to undermine it.
''We are regularly challenged by conspiracies to spark sociopolitical instability and violate our national sovereignty and territorial integrity,'' he said.
On Tuesday, for example, as the dissident trial was getting under way in central Vietnam, the daily Vietnam News reported that a woman had been sentenced in Ho Chi Minh City to 42 months in prison for ''activities against the state.''
The newspaper said the woman, Lo Thanh Thao, 36, had ''scattered propaganda leaflets'' and ''stuck them inside several buildings'' in Ho Chi Minh City. It did not report the content of the leaflets.
In the most high-profile recent conviction, a prominent Vietnamese legal scholar who had sued the prime minister and called for multiparty democracy was convicted in April 2011 of propaganda against the state and sentenced to seven years in prison and three more years under house arrest.
The conviction of the scholar, Cu Huy Ha Vu, then 53, the son of a Communist revolutionary and a well-known poet, was one of dozens involving Vietnamese lawyers and activists over recent years.
Last March, two Catholic activists were sentenced to five and three years in prison for distributing what the indictment called antigovernment leaflets.
In September, three prominent bloggers received long prison terms. Among them was Nguyen Van Hai, who wrote under the name Dieu Cay, who was sent to prison for 12 years.
He was among several detained journalists mentioned by President Obama in a speech on World Press Freedom Day last May. Mr. Obama said the blogger's first arrest, in 2008, had ''coincided with a mass crackdown on citizen journalism in Vietnam.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Consumer Watchdog to Issue Mortgage Rules

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Banks and other lenders will be prohibited from making home loans that offer deceptive teaser rates or require no documentation from borrowers, and will be required to take more steps to ensure that borrowers can repay, under new consumer protections to be announced on Thursday.
The rules, being laid out by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and taking effect next January, will also set some limits on interest-only packages or negative-amortization loans, where the balance due grows over time. Banks can make such loans, but the new rules would not protect them from potential borrower lawsuits if they do so. 
And mortgage originators will in most cases be restricted from charging excessive upfront points and fees, from making loans with balloon payments and from making loans that load a borrower with total payments exceeding 43 percent of income.
With the sweeping rules, financial regulators are trying to substantially overhaul the market for home mortgages by creating a legal distinction between ''qualified'' loans that follow the new rules and are immune from legal action, and ''unqualified'' mortgages that continue practices that regulators have frowned on. The new rules are also aimed at getting banks to lend again, something they have been slow to do since the financial crisis and since the Dodd-Frank Act required new limits on bank activities.
Gone, the regulators hope, will be the unbridled frenzy that encouraged lenders to ignore whether borrowers could repay as long as the lenders could sell the mortgages to third parties, usually investment firms that sliced them up and resold them as part of complex financial derivatives.
By following the new rules, banks will be given a ''safe harbor,'' which ensures that they cannot be successfully sued for reckless or abusive lending practices, federal officials said Wednesday. Lenders must document a borrower's ability to repay a loan; one way of doing that is to follow several guidelines issued Thursday that make a loan a ''qualified'' mortgage.
''When consumers sit down at the closing table, they shouldn't be set up to fail with mortgages they can't afford,'' said Richard Cordray, the director of the consumer bureau. ''Our ability-to-repay rule protects borrowers from the kinds of risky lending practices that resulted in so many families losing their homes.''
Mortgage bankers generally applauded the new regulations, saying that they clear up uncertainty that has hung over the home lending business since the financial crisis. In fact, most of the types of loans now being restricted, which were rampant during the inflation of the housing bubble, have been relatively rare in the last couple of years because many banks have tightened lending since the financial crisis.
''These rules offer protection for consumers and a clear, safe environment for banks to do business,'' David Stevens, chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association, said in an interview. ''Now everybody knows if you stay inside these lines, you are safe.''
He added that he believed the consumer bureau ''did a great job listening to stakeholders'' in shaping the rule.
The new rules will not necessarily lead to an immediate expansion of credit, Mr. Stevens said, because nearly all mortgage loans being made currently are being sold to government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Their underwriting standards are not affected by the new rules.
In certain circumstances, the new lending rules can be bypassed for up to seven years, regulators said. New loans can be considered to be a ''qualified loan'' even if the borrower has a payment-to-income ratio of more than 43 percent as long as the loan is eligible for purchase or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, for example, or by one of several executive branch agencies, like the Department of Veterans Affairs.
The consumer bureau said that the exception was created ''in light of the fragile state of the mortgage market as a result of the recent mortgage crisis.'' Without the exception, the bureau said, ''creditors might be reluctant to make loans that are not qualified mortgages, even if they are responsibly underwritten.''
Similarly, the new rules allow balloon payments in mortgages that are originated by and retained in the portfolio of small lenders that operate primarily in rural or underserved areas.
The legal protections offered to lenders by the qualified mortgage rule are not absolute. Lenders do not receive complete immunity from lawsuits in all circumstances. Some higher-priced loans, given to consumers with weak credit, can be challenged if the borrower can prove that he did not have sufficient income to pay the mortgage and other living expenses. And the rules do not affect the rights of consumers to challenge a lender for violating other federal consumer protection laws.
''We believe this rule does exactly what it is supposed to do,'' Mr. Cordray said in a statement prepared for delivery Thursday morning in Baltimore, where the rules are being announced. ''It protects consumers and helps strengthen the housing market by rooting out reckless and unsustainable lending, while enabling safer lending,'' he said.

HEADLINE: LGBTQIA

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHULMAN

 BODY:
STEPHEN IRA, a junior at Sarah Lawrence College, uploaded a video last March on We Happy Trans, a site that shares ''positive perspectives'' on being transgender.
In the breakneck six-and-a-half-minute monologue -- hair tousled, sitting in a wood-paneled dorm room -- Stephen exuberantly declared himself ''a queer, a nerd fighter, a writer, an artist and a guy who needs a haircut,'' and held forth on everything from his style icons (Truman Capote and ''any male-identified person who wears thigh-highs or garters'') to his toy zebra.
Because Stephen, who was born Kathlyn, is the 21-year-old child of Warren Beatty and Annette Bening, the video went viral, garnering nearly half a million views. But that was not the only reason for its appeal. With its adrenalized, freewheeling eloquence, the video seemed like a battle cry for a new generation of post-gay gender activists, for whom Stephen represents a rare public face.
Armed with the millennial generation's defining traits -- Web savvy, boundless confidence and social networks that extend online and off -- Stephen and his peers are forging a political identity all their own, often at odds with mainstream gay culture. 
If the gay-rights movement today seems to revolve around same-sex marriage, this generation is seeking something more radical: an upending of gender roles beyond the binary of male/female. The core question isn't whom they love, but who they are -- that is, identity as distinct from sexual orientation.
But what to call this movement? Whereas ''gay and lesbian'' was once used to lump together various sexual minorities -- and more recently ''L.G.B.T.'' to include bisexual and transgender -- the new vanguard wants a broader, more inclusive abbreviation. ''Youth today do not define themselves on the spectrum of L.G.B.T.,'' said Shane Windmeyer, a founder of Campus Pride, a national student advocacy group based in Charlotte, N.C.
Part of the solution has been to add more letters, and in recent years the post-post-post-gay-rights banner has gotten significantly longer, some might say unwieldy. The emerging rubric is ''L.G.B.T.Q.I.A.,'' which stands for different things, depending on whom you ask.
''Q'' can mean ''questioning'' or ''queer,'' an umbrella term itself, formerly derogatory before it was appropriated by gay activists in the 1990s. ''I'' is for ''intersex,'' someone whose anatomy is not exclusively male or female. And ''A'' stands for ''ally'' (a friend of the cause) or ''asexual,'' characterized by the absence of sexual attraction.
It may be a mouthful, but it's catching on, especially on liberal-arts campuses.
The University of Missouri, Kansas City, for example, has an L.G.B.T.Q.I.A. Resource Center that, among other things, helps student locate ''gender-neutral'' restrooms on campus. Vassar College offers an L.G.B.T.Q.I.A. Discussion Group on Thursday afternoons. Lehigh University will be hosting its second annual L.G.B.T.Q.I.A. Intercollegiate Conference next month, followed by a Queer Prom. Amherst College even has an L.G.B.T.Q.Q.I.A.A. center, where every group gets its own letter.
The term is also gaining traction on social media sites like Twitter and Tumblr, where posts tagged with ''lgbtqia'' suggest a younger, more progressive outlook than posts that are merely labeled ''lgbt.''
''There's a very different generation of people coming of age, with completely different conceptions of gender and sexuality,'' said Jack Halberstam (formerly Judith), a transgender professor at the University of Southern California and the author, most recently, of ''Gaga Feminism: Sex, Gender, and the End of Normal.''
''When you see terms like L.G.B.T.Q.I.A.,'' Professor Halberstam added, ''it's because people are seeing all the things that fall out of the binary, and demanding that a name come into being.''
And with a plethora of ever-expanding categories like ''genderqueer'' and ''androgyne'' to choose from, each with an online subculture, piecing together a gender identity can be as D.I.Y. as making a Pinterest board.
BUT sometimes L.G.B.T.Q.I.A. is not enough. At the University of Pennsylvania last fall, eight freshmen united in the frustration that no campus group represented them.
Sure, Penn already had some two dozen gay student groups, including Queer People of Color, Lambda Alliance and J-Bagel, which bills itself as the university's ''Jewish L.G.B.T.Q.I.A. Community.'' But none focused on gender identity (the closest, Trans Penn, mostly catered to faculty members and graduate students).
Richard Parsons, an 18-year-old transgender male, discovered that when he attended a student mixer called the Gay Affair, sponsored by Penn's L.G.B.T. Center. ''I left thoroughly disappointed,'' said Richard, a garrulous freshman with close-cropped hair, wire-framed glasses and preppy clothes, who added, ''This is the L.G.B.T. Center, and it's all gay guys.''
Through Facebook, Richard and others started a group called Penn Non-Cis, which is short for ''non-cisgender.'' For those not fluent in gender-studies speak, ''cis'' means ''on the same side as'' and ''cisgender'' denotes someone whose gender identity matches his or her biology, which describes most of the student body. The group seeks to represent everyone else. ''This is a freshman uprising,'' Richard said.
On a brisk Tuesday night in November, about 40 students crowded into the L.G.B.T. Center, a converted 19th-century carriage house, for the group's inaugural open mike. The organizers had lured students by handing out fliers on campus while barking: ''Free condoms! Free ChapStick!''
''There's a really vibrant L.G.B.T. scene,'' Kate Campbell, one of the M.C.'s, began. ''However, that mostly encompasses the L.G.B. and not too much of the T. So we're aiming to change that.''
Students read poems and diary entries, and sang guitar ballads. Then Britt Gilbert -- a punky-looking freshman with a blond bob, chunky glasses and a rock band T-shirt -- took the stage. She wanted to talk about the concept of ''bi-gender.''
''Does anyone want to share what they think it is?''
Silence.
She explained that being bi-gender is like manifesting both masculine and feminine personas, almost as if one had a ''detachable penis.'' ''Some days I wake up and think, 'Why am I in this body?' '' she said. ''Most days I wake up and think, 'What was I thinking yesterday?' ''
Britt's grunginess belies a warm matter-of-factness, at least when describing her journey. As she elaborated afterward, she first heard the term ''bi-gender'' from Kate, who found it on Tumblr. The two met at freshman orientation and bonded. In high school, Kate identified as ''agender'' and used the singular pronoun ''they''; she now sees her gender as an ''amorphous blob.''
By contrast, Britt's evolution was more linear. She grew up in suburban Pennsylvania and never took to gender norms. As a child, she worshiped Cher and thought boy bands were icky. Playing video games, she dreaded having to choose male or female avatars.
In middle school, she started calling herself bisexual and dated boys. By 10th grade, she had come out as a lesbian. Her parents thought it was a phase -- until she brought home a girlfriend, Ash. But she still wasn't settled.
''While I definitely knew that I liked girls, I didn't know that I was one,'' Britt said. Sometimes she would leave the house in a dress and feel uncomfortable, as if she were wearing a Halloween costume. Other days, she felt fine. She wasn't ''trapped in the wrong body,'' as the cliché has it -- she just didn't know which body she wanted.
When Kate told her about the term ''bi-gender,'' it clicked instantly. ''I knew what it was, before I knew what it was,'' Britt said, adding that it is more fluid than ''transgender'' but less vague than ''genderqueer'' -- a catchall term for nontraditional gender identities.
At first, the only person she told was Ash, who responded, ''It took you this long to figure it out?'' For others, the concept was not so easy to grasp. Coming out as a lesbian had been relatively simple, Britt said, ''since people know what that is.'' But when she got to Penn, she was relieved to find a small community of freshmen who had gone through similar awakenings.
Among them was Richard Parsons, the group's most politically lucid member. Raised female, Richard grew up in Orlando, Fla., and realized he was transgender in high school. One summer, he wanted to room with a transgender friend at camp, but his mother objected. ''She's like, 'Well, if you say that he's a guy, then I don't want you rooming with a guy,' '' he recalled. ''We were in a car and I basically blurted out, 'I think I might be a guy, too!' ''
After much door-slamming and tears, Richard and his mother reconciled. But when she asked what to call him, he had no idea. He chose ''Richard'' on a whim, and later added a middle name, Matthew, because it means ''gift of God.''
By the time he got to Penn, he had been binding his breasts for more than two years and had developed back pain. At the open mike, he told a harrowing story about visiting the university health center for numbness and having a panic attack when he was escorted into a women's changing room.
Nevertheless, he praised the university for offering gender-neutral housing. The college's medical program also covers sexual reassignment surgery, which, he added, ''has heavily influenced my decision to probably go under the Penn insurance plan next year.''
PENN has not always been so forward-thinking; a decade ago, the L.G.B.T. Center (nestled amid fraternity houses) was barely used. But in 2010, the university began reaching out to applicants whose essays raised gay themes. Last year, the gay newsmagazine The Advocate ranked Penn among the top 10 trans-friendly universities, alongside liberal standbys like New York University.
More and more colleges, mostly in the Northeast, are catering to gender-nonconforming students. According to a survey by Campus Pride, at least 203 campuses now allow transgender students to room with their preferred gender; 49 have a process to change one's name and gender in university records; and 57 cover hormone therapy. In December, the University of Iowa became the first to add a ''transgender'' checkbox to its college application.
''I wrote about an experience I had with a drag queen as my application essay for all the Ivy Leagues I applied to,'' said Santiago Cortes, one of the Penn students. ''And I got into a few of the Ivy Leagues -- Dartmouth, Columbia and Penn. Strangely not Brown.''
But even these measures cannot keep pace with the demands of incoming students, who are challenging the curriculum much as gay activists did in the '80s and '90s. Rather than protest the lack of gay studies classes, they are critiquing existing ones for being too narrow.
Several members of Penn Non-Cis had been complaining among themselves about a writing seminar they were taking called ''Beyond 'Will & Grace,' '' which examined gay characters on shows like ''Ellen,'' ''Glee'' and ''Modern Family.'' The professor, Gail Shister, who is a lesbian, had criticized several students for using ''L.G.B.T.Q.'' in their essays, saying it was clunky, and proposed using ''queer'' instead. Some students found the suggestion offensive, including Britt Gilbert, who described Ms. Shister as ''unaccepting of things that she doesn't understand.''
Ms. Shister, reached by phone, said the criticism was strictly grammatical. ''I am all about economy of expression,'' she said. ''L.G.B.T.Q. doesn't exactly flow off the tongue. So I tell the students, 'Don't put in an acronym with five or six letters.' ''
One thing is clear. Ms. Shister, who is 60 and in 1979 became The Philadelphia Inquirer's first female sportswriter, is of a different generation, a fact she acknowledges freely, even gratefully. ''Frankly, I'm both proud and envious that these young people are growing up in an age where they're free to love who they want,'' she said.
If history is any guide, the age gap won't be so easy to overcome. As liberated gay men in the 1970s once baffled their pre-Stonewall forebears, the new gender outlaws, to borrow a phrase from the transgender writer Kate Bornstein, may soon be running ideological circles around their elders.
Still, the alphabet soup of L.G.B.T.Q.I.A. may be difficult to sustain. ''In the next 10 or 20 years, the various categories heaped under the umbrella of L.G.B.T. will become quite quotidian,'' Professor Halberstam said.
Even at the open mike, as students picked at potato chips and pineapple slices, the bounds of identity politics were spilling over and becoming blurry.
At one point, Santiago, a curly-haired freshman from Colombia, stood before the crowd. He and a friend had been pondering the limits of what he calls ''L.G.B.T.Q. plus.''
''Why do only certain letters get to be in the full acronym?'' he asked.
Then he rattled off a list of gender identities, many culled from Wikipedia. ''We have our lesbians, our gays,'' he said, before adding, ''bisexual, transsexual, queer, homosexual, asexual.'' He took a breath and continued. ''Pansexual. Omnisexual. Trisexual. Agender. Bi-gender. Third gender. Transgender. Transvestite. Intersexual. Two-spirit. Hijra. Polyamorous.''
By now, the list had turned into free verse. He ended: ''Undecided. Questioning. Other. Human.''
The room burst into applause.

HEADLINE: The Semi-Detached Solution

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
GOOD design is often defined as an elegant solution (or a series of elegant solutions) to a complex equation whose variables include space, money, time and human behavior. Also personal biography, history, taste and municipal law.
In Boulder, Colo., an ecosystem still fizzy with tech and biotech start-ups, the five members of three households are cohabiting, sort of, in a nifty example of that principle, in three town houses built on a small lot west of Boulder's downtown area with startling views of the Flatirons, the nearby rock formation. This semicommune is a collaboration between Rich Sands, an industrial psychologist turned builder, and Arch11, a local architecture firm, in a historic district three or four blocks from the edge of town now officially known as West Pearl, though Mr. Sands jokingly refers to it as ''WeBo'' (for West Boulder).
In the last decade and a half, Mr. Sands and E. J. Meade, a principal at Arch11, have been deploying their particular brand of sometimes rustic, always clever modernism in nearly every neighborhood of the city, in 40-odd projects that range from modern farmhouses to suburban ''lofts,'' minimalist houses and one recent addition to a 19th-century mining cabin that was wrapped in black asphalt. 
The pair met cute when Mr. Sands and his wife, Janice, both now 68, moved to Colorado from California in the mid-1990s. Mr. Sands, who is simultaneously exacting and preternaturally mellow -- to employ a dated but useful term that might have been coined for the sole purpose of describing his laid-back style -- was looking to establish the reputation of his company, Hammerwell, with a few spec projects in Boulder. In town one day to interview architects, he wandered into an industrial building that appealed to him. There was a foreign-car repair business on one side and on the other, Mr. Meade's office.
''Hey, anyone want to design a few buildings?'' Mr. Sands remembered calling out. (Mr. Meade recalled the meeting slightly differently. ''I think he said, 'Hey, any architects in here?' '') In any case, Mr. Meade answered in the affirmative, Mr. Sands canceled all his appointments and they talked for hours, discovering in each other, as Mr. Sands put it, a similar kind of ''design idiocy.''
Their collaboration began with two side-by-side spec houses. While the first was still under construction, Bob Bush, a principal of a graphic design studio, and his wife, Dianne Bush, who worked in law offices and as an event planner, bought the second while it was still a hole in the ground, entering into a curious arrangement with Mr. Sands: he agreed to sell them the house, but they would have no say in the finishes -- though Mr. Sands promised to avoid any colors they didn't like.
''So they said, 'Blue,' and I did what I wanted, and it had no blue and they loved it,'' Mr. Sands said.
Why were the Bushes so relaxed about it?
The first spec house was a terrific calling card, Mr. Bush said.
''It was just really cool,'' he said. ''Rich was very upfront. He said, 'I'm a new builder in Boulder and I want to establish my reputation. I know what I want to do. If you don't want to give me that kind of freedom, then I wouldn't do this.' ''
That was the beginning of a long relationship in houses.
In 2004, about seven years into that relationship, the Bushes sold their first Hammerwell-Arch11 house and moved into a house Mr. Sands had taken in trade for one of his spec houses, and had been living in with his wife. Built in 1982, and untouched by Mr. Sands, ''it was cool in its own way,'' Mr. Bush said. The Bushes, who have two grown sons, were downsizing and wanted to put some money in the bank. (Their first Hammerwell-Arch11 house sold for under a million dollars, Mr. Bush recalled, and they bought Mr. Sands's house for about $465,000.)
By 2010, the couple, who are now 68 and 65 and retired, were planning to downsize yet again. (The Bushes have built five of the six houses they've lived in and clearly have an appetite for renewal. As Ms. Bush said, ''We are very D.I.Y.'' And he teased his wife, ''We move mostly because there is nothing more to decorate.'') That was when Mr. Sands approached them with a plan.
Mr. and Ms. Sands were also ready to downsize. Mr. Sands had found a 4,800-square-foot lot zoned for three units, an unusual zoning scenario in Boulder, which tends to support mostly single-family buildings. To find a lot that was not restricted, Mr. Sands said, was rare. He had been eyeing the lot for some time, watching its price drop as it changed hands. Eventually, a developer who had bought it in foreclosure agreed to turn it over to him for about $600,000.
Around the same time, Sue Heilbronner, a federal-prosecutor-turned-Internet-entrepreneur, moved to Boulder for a job as chief growth officer for PaySimple, a cloud-based platform for managing small businesses. She had fallen in love with the Hammerwell-Arch11 aesthetic, having seen their houses around town. There was one in particular, she said, ''that was the most magnificent house I'd ever seen, but it was too big, and too expensive. I just decided the day I met him that I was going to find some way for Rich to touch my home.''
Ms. Heilbronner, 46, knew about Mr. Sands's communal lot project, but he rebuffed her at first when she had asked to be a part of it. A few months later, though, he e-mailed her to say he had one slot left, and would she like it?
There were no drawings, there wasn't even a contract, but she agreed without hesitation.
''I wrote a check solely on the strength of my feelings about him,'' she said. ''Everyone I knew told me I was an idiot to yoke myself to four other people I barely knew. But to me it felt not remotely unusual or crazy. I get to work with a builder I admire -- who, by the way, gets to be my next-door neighbor -- and an architect who is totally cutting edge. We were totally aligned in what we were going to create, so it was perfect.''
Mr. Sands doesn't remember why he initially put Ms. Heilbronner off.
''She's a challenging lady, quite strong and opinionated,'' he said. ''I could have held her off at first just to make sure she truly was interested and that she was willing to live with what I came up with design-wise. I also might have been buying time to talk with the Bushes to discuss how Sue would fit into the mix.''
THE three houses have a Case Study House feel about them, with their flat roofs, open-plan living areas and glassy expanses. Since the 9,800-square-foot lot was zoned for a 50 percent floor-area ratio, Mr. Sands and Mr. Meade had 4,900-square-feet to divvy up among the three houses. They carved out space underneath the lot to create three two-car garages and room for storage and mechanical equipment, which, since they were underground, were not included in the floor-area calculus.
Each house would be two bedrooms with two-and-a-half bathrooms. The Sandses' unit is about 1,500 square feet and separated by a common garden from the Bushes', which is about 1,600 square feet, and Ms. Heilbronner's, which is slightly larger.
Instead of planting three townhouses in a row on the rectangular lot, Mr. Meade angled them to grab the Flatiron mountain views, giving each house a glass corner. The Sandses' house is aligned with the top of the rectangle -- the short bit -- at the north end. The Bushes' house and Ms. Heibronner's sit along the base, fitting one on top of the other like train cars in a rail yard. It's a clever and elegant land-use solution, spatially economical, practical and lovely.
Each house cost about $1 million, though Ms. Heilbronner's was slightly more. Mr. Sands, as is his habit, did the finishes for his and the Bushes' houses. Ms. Heilbronner asked Mr. Meade to design her interiors, and she chose features and flourishes (like a startling open staircase) that were more expensive.
The five cohabitants, as we might call them, moved in in late August. The Bushes were perhaps the most grateful for the end of construction: their house had sold 16 days after they put it on the market in the summer of 2011, and they had been living in a rental, and then in a room at a local inn for six or eight weeks.
Mr. Bush pointed out that in their last house they had downsized financially but not spatially. In this house, he said, ''we've upsized financially but decreased square footage.''
As for Ms. Bush, she said she worried that their taste was not edgy enough for Mr. Sands, and that he was disappointed when he came over.
Mr. Sands said, jokingly, that he always tells them: ''Your interiors should fit you. Pick what you like, and I'll tell you if you're screwing it up too much.''
And Ms. Heilbronner, who travels extensively for work, is happy to have a house that she doesn't have to fret about (thanks to her close neighbors) and one that is also visually arresting -- even autobiographical, as she put it.
''It feels,'' she said, ''just energetically perfect. I walk in and think, 'Really? I get to live here?' ''

HEADLINE: Khuzami, S.E.C. Enforcement Chief Who Reinvigorated Unit, to Step Down

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
After becoming the public face of Wall Street oversight and reining in firms like Goldman Sachs, Robert S. Khuzami is walking away from the spotlight.
Mr. Khuzami, 56, a former terrorism prosecutor who revamped the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement unit in the wake of the financial crisis, said Wednesday that he was stepping down from the agency after a four-year tenure.
His departure signals the end of an important chapter in the history of the agency, which has been praised for taking action against some of Wall Street's largest banks after the 2008 financial crisis, but has also drawn criticism for not doing enough to punish top executives at those same firms.
Mr. Khuzami inherited a demoralized unit in 2009. It was much maligned for missing years of warning signs of the credit bubble and Bernard L. Madoff's Ponzi scheme. 
An imposing presence with a piercing stare, Mr. Khuzami quickly reorganized the management ranks in the enforcement division, creating specialized units to track complex corners of Wall Street, and applied aggressive prosecutorial tactics to civil cases. Under him, the division has logged a record number of actions, many of them against companies at the center of the crisis.
"They know we're out there, and we're smarter and can cover more ground," Mr. Khuzami said in an interview.
His successor, who has not been named, will face significant challenges. For example, the enforcement unit must contend with the increasingly influential high-speed trading firms that, by some accounts, have destabilized the stock market.
The unit also faces lingering questions about its negotiating tactics. Some consumer advocates complain that the agency's headline-grabbing settlements hardly made a dent in the billions of dollars of profits earned on Wall Street. The enforcement division notably butted heads with a prominent federal judge in New York, Jed S. Rakoff, who in 2010 called the agency's $150 million settlement with Bank of America over lax public disclosures "half-baked justice at best."
Mr. Khuzami's departure in about two weeks will be part of a broader exodus from the S.E.C. after the resignation of its chairwoman, Mary L. Schapiro, in November. Among the other people departing are the agency's head of trading and markets and its director of corporation finance. Elisse B. Walter, Ms. Schapiro's replacement as chairwoman, has named interim officials to those positions.
But officials say the enforcement division could struggle under a provisional leader. The chief of the unit, they note, is the top cop on Wall Street, effectively setting the tone for financial oversight.
Ms. Walter is weighing a short list of candidates to replace Mr. Khuzami, people briefed on the matter said. The list includes the enforcement division's chief litigation counsel, Matthew T. Martens, and Mr. Khuzami's current deputy, George S. Canellos.
As for Mr. Khuzami, described alternately as harsh or playful with his employees, he is positioned for a lucrative job at a white-shoe law firm.
"I don't know what I'm doing next, but I loved the last four years and I'm sad it's ending," he said.
Mr. Khuzami, a native of Rochester, N.Y., had a bohemian upbringing that hardly hinted at a path to the S.E.C. His parents were ballroom dancers, his sister a muralist and his brother a drummer. They jokingly refer to Mr. Khuzami as "the white sheep" of the family.
He put himself through school by working odd jobs as a dishwasher, bartender and overnight dockworker. He was hired out of law school as a junior lawyer at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft in New York.
Mr. Khuzami then tried out for the United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York under Rudolph W. Giuliani, but missed the cut. When the office hired him in the early 1990s, he was assigned to terrorism prosecutions. The move led to a career-defining case: the conviction of Omar Abdel-Rahman, the so-called Blind Sheik tied to the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. He later ran a securities task force for the United States attorney's office.
After more than a decade as a prosecutor, he departed for Deutsche Bank, where he eventually became general counsel for the firm's American arm.
In 2009, he caught Ms. Schapiro's attention. She was searching for an aggressive personality to shake up the S.E.C.'s enforcement team.
"It had to be someone who was a great prosecutor," Ms. Schapiro said in an interview.
Mr. Khuzami soon hatched a plan for overhauling - some officials called it dismantling - the enforcement division.
He arrived in Washington with strategies straight from the playbook of the United States attorney's office. He pushed the S.E.C. to offer leniency for cooperating witnesses and to strike deferred prosecution agreements with companies that promised to behave.
He poached former prosecutors for his staff, including Lorin L. Reisner. He plucked other hires from Wall Street, including traders and compliance officers. Adam Storch, then a 29-year-old Goldman Sachs vice president, became the unit's first chief operating officer.
Under Mr. Khuzami's direction, the enforcement team eliminated a layer of management, moving senior lawyers onto the front lines of investigations. He mandated that all enforcement employees carry a BlackBerry, holding them accountable beyond the 9-to-5 workday.
Mr. Khuzami created the Office of Market Intelligence to analyze tips and complaints from investors. He also opened five units to track some of the darkest corners of finance, focusing on structured products like derivatives, market abuse and the secretive world of hedge fund returns.
"The changes were necessary and dramatic," Ms. Schapiro said.
Mr. Khuzami introduced the broad outlines of reform in spring 2009 at a retreat in Solomons Island, Md., an annual gathering of nearly 200 senior enforcement officials. "It's time to get serious about change," he told the packed Holiday Inn conference room, according to attendees.
But his message worried enforcement lawyers, who lined up at the microphones to question new procedures and to raise concerns about potential violations of their contracts. A few top officials, some of whom were widely respected, were about to be left on the sideline.
"Everyone in the office was scared, but we also started working harder," said Thomas A. Sporkin, who ran the Office of Market Intelligence until last year, when he left the agency.
The group faced growing pains. Mr. Khuzami had a knack for grilling lawyers about the details of enforcement cases, according to staff members. And he urged his employees to ask each night, "How did I add value today?" - a line he repeated in an e-mail to staff on Wednesday.
Employees also recalled a softer side. As a motivational tool, they said, Mr. Khuzami would publicly perform for his staff. At a swearing-in ceremony for new members, he quoted poetry by Gwendolyn Brooks. Once, he donned a red wig at an awards ceremony to sing a version of the "Annie" theme song, "Tomorrow," with the lyrics twisted to fit the S.E.C.
"Even though he scares the hell out of people," one employee said, "you like him because he's genuine."
His tactics appeared to bear fruit. During his tenure, the enforcement unit leveled more charges than in any comparable four-year period, including a record number of cases in 2011.
Mr. Khuzami emphasized that the unit was also tracking bigger game. It took aim at billionaire hedge fund managers, including Philip Falcone, and filed cases involving collateralized debt obligations, a crackdown that ensnared prominent names on Wall Street. At the urging of Mr. Khuzami and Mr. Reisner, the S.E.C. brought a landmark case against Goldman Sachs, netting a record settlement of $550 million in 2010.
"He's really broadened the net," said Mary Jo White, a white-collar-criminal defense lawyer at Debevoise & Plimpton, who was Mr. Khuzami's boss when she was the United States attorney in Manhattan.
Some consumer advocates say the enforcement unit remains too timid. They complain that it opted not to charge Lehman Brothers executives and was soft on firms like Bank of America and Citigroup. In 2011, Judge Rakoff refused to bless a $285 million deal with Citigroup in a case involving a collateralized debt obligation, calling it "pocket change."
Critics also question why the agency sued only a handful of top executives who ran companies at the center of the credit crisis.
"If you're rich and connected on Wall Street, then don't worry about the S.E.C.," said Dennis M. Kelleher, chief executive of Better Markets, a nonprofit advocacy group critical of the financial industry.
Mr. Khuzami dismissed the grumbling, noting that his unit sued 65 senior executives involved in the crisis, including the leaders of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and most of the major mortgage companies that caused the housing bubble. In the cases involving big banks, he said, there was not enough evidence to implicate chief executives.
Despite their differences, Judge Rakoff credited Mr. Khuzami with a rapid turnaround of the enforcement division.
"Although, from our different perspectives, Rob Khuzami and I sharply disagree about some matters, over all I think he has done a terrific job," he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Solis Stepping Down as Labor Secretary

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis announced on Wednesday that she was stepping down, becoming the latest woman to leave President Obama's cabinet at a time when his personnel choices are drawing scrutiny for their lack of female candidates. 
Ms. Solis, a former congresswoman from California, told colleagues in an e-mail that she had submitted her resignation letter to Mr. Obama Wednesday afternoon.
She said she had decided to step down after consulting family members and friends. Associates of Ms. Solis, who is 55 and was born in Los Angeles, said she was likely to run for a seat on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.
In a statement, Mr. Obama said, ''Secretary Solis has been a critical member of my economic team as we have worked to recover from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression and strengthen the economy for the middle class.''
Ms. Solis was praised by labor unions for working to enforce workplace regulations and occasionally criticized for not being responsive to business interests. Among her biggest campaigns was cracking down on farmers who employ children or underpaid workers.
Ms. Solis, who was never viewed as part of Mr. Obama's inner core of advisers, prided herself on going to bat for the nation's recession-battered workers, especially those on the lower end. Many Hispanic workers looked to her as their champion -- she focused, for instance, on the high fatality rate for Hispanic workers.
She made the department more aggressive in ferreting out rules violations involving the minimum wage, overtime and other issues. Last year the Labor Department collected more back pay for wage violations than in any previous year, more than $280 million on behalf of 300,000 workers.
Under her, the Labor Department incurred the coal industry's wrath by focusing on mine safety violations after the Upper Big Branch disaster, a West Virginia coal mine explosion in 2010 that killed 29 workers.
She is one of two Hispanic members of the cabinet, with Ken Salazar, the interior secretary, and was one of a handful of women, along with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton; Lisa P. Jackson, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security; Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services; and Susan E. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations, who has cabinet status.
Ms. Jackson has announced her resignation, and Mrs. Clinton is to be succeeded by Senator John Kerry.

HEADLINE: Treasury Nominee Is Wall St. Outsider

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Annie Lowrey contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With his choice of Jacob J. Lew to be the secretary of Treasury, President Obama on Thursday will complete the transformation of his economic team from the big-name economists and financial firefighters hired four years ago to budget negotiators ready for the next fiscal fights in Congress.
If confirmed by the Senate, the 57-year-old Mr. Lew -- Mr. Obama's current chief of staff and former budget director -- would become the president's second Treasury secretary, succeeding Timothy F. Geithner, who was the last remaining principal from the original economic team that took office at the height of the global crisis in January 2009. 
While the team is changing, so far it is made up entirely of men who have been part of the administration since its first months. Gene B. Sperling, like Mr. Lew a veteran of the Clinton administration, is expected to remain as director of the White House National Economic Council. Alan B. Krueger, a former Treasury economist, continues as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and Jeffrey D. Zients, a former business executive, as acting director of the Office of Management and Budget.
That composition gives Mr. Obama a high degree of comfort with his economic advisers, who have experience in the budget struggles that have occupied the administration since Republicans took control of the House two years ago. Those struggles will resume later this month. Yet the continuity also plays into criticism that the president is too insular and insufficiently open to outside voices and fresh eyes in the White House.
Adding to a scarcity of female advisers among Mr. Obama's top aides, Hilda L. Solis, the secretary of labor for four years, announced on Wednesday that she would be resigning, following the most prominent female Cabinet member, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, out of the administration.
Separately, administration officials let it be known on Wednesday that several Cabinet members will remain in their jobs: Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, who is expected to stay through the full adoption of the 2010 health care law in 2014; Eric H. Holder Jr., the attorney general; and Eric K. Shinseki, the secretary of veterans affairs.
If Mr. Lew is confirmed in time, his first test as Treasury secretary could come as soon as next month, when the administration and Congressional Republicans are expected to face off over increasing the nation's debt ceiling, which is the legal limit on the amount that the government can borrow. Mr. Obama has said he will not negotiate over raising that limit, which was often lifted routinely in the past, but Republican leaders have said they will refuse to support an increase unless he agrees to an equal amount of spending cuts, particularly to entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security.
Mr. Lew was passed over for Mr. Obama's economic team four years ago, when Mr. Obama instead chose Lawrence H. Summers, a former Harvard University president and Treasury secretary, as director of the National Economic Council. Mrs. Clinton then hired Mr. Lew at the State Department, and in late 2010 -- over the objections of Mrs. Clinton, who had come to rely on Mr. Lew -- Mr. Obama made him budget director, the same post Mr. Lew had held late in the Clinton administration.
Mr. Lew in the 1980s was a Democratic adviser to the House speaker then, Thomas P. O'Neill, participating in fiscal talks with the Reagan administration. Mr. Lew is known for his low-key style and organizational skills.
While Mr. Lew has much less experience than Mr. Geithner in international economics and financial markets, he would come to the job with far more expertise in fiscal policy than Mr. Geithner did. That shift in skills reflects the changed times, when emphasis has shifted from a global financial crisis to the budget fights with Republicans in Congress.
The partisan tension suggests that Mr. Lew will be questioned closely by Senate Republicans in confirmation hearings.
But, Republicans have not signaled the kind of opposition they put up to some of Mr. Obama's other potential nominations.
Mr. Lew's departure as chief of staff would create a vacancy for what would be Mr. Obama's fifth White House chief of staff, a turnover rate that is in contrast with the stability atop Treasury the last four years with Mr. Geithner. The leading candidates are said to be Denis McDonough, currently the deputy national security adviser in the White House, and Ronald A. Klain, a former chief of staff to two vice presidents, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Al Gore.
Before joining the Obama administration, Mr. Lew spent a brief period in the financial sector, at Citigroup, first as managing director of Citi Global Wealth Management and then as chief operating officer of Citigroup Alternative Investments.
By contrast, Mr. Geithner had been president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, which includes overseeing Wall Street. For the financial industry, Mr. Lew is a largely a blank slate.
''While he can undoubtedly learn the material on the job, we question whether he has sufficient relationships with the banking industry in the U.S. and abroad, which can be critical during a financial crisis,'' Brian Gardner, head of Washington research for the investment banking firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote to clients on Wednesday.
But Michael Schein, who worked with Mr. Lew at Citigroup and is now head of a nonprofit financial services organization, Accion, countered: ''People in the business community like to deal with people in Washington who they can trust. I think Jack already does, and will do, very well with Wall Street and with business leaders because he is a very, very straight shooter.''
Mr. Lew has a reputation as a fiscal progressive who, like Mr. Obama, is eager to protect Medicaid and other antipoverty programs from deep cuts. But advocates for tighter financial regulation of Wall Street question whether he is too conservative.
The question is relevant because major regulations under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law remain to be put into effect in Mr. Obama's second term.
''He appears to share a Wall Street mentality, particularly when it comes to financial reform,'' said Dennis M. Kelleher, the president of Better Markets, a Washington-based nonprofit. ''Financial reform is all about making the banking system safer and preventing more taxpayer bailouts.''

HEADLINE: Public Goals, Private Interests in Debt Campaign

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE; Nelson D. Schwartz contributed reporting.

 BODY:
When Jim McCrery, a former Louisiana congressman, urged lawmakers last month to pursue entitlement cuts and tax reform, he was introduced on television as a leader of Fix the Debt, a group of business executives and onetime legislators who have become Washington's most visible and best-financed advocates for reining in the federal deficit.
Mr. McCrery did not mention his day job: a lobbyist with Capitol Counsel L.L.C. His clients have included the Alliance for Savings and Investment, a group of large companies pushing to maintain low tax rates on dividend income, and the Win America Campaign, a coalition of multinational corporations that lobbied for a one-time ''repatriation holiday'' allowing them to move offshore profits back home without paying taxes.
In Washington's running battles over taxes and spending, Mr. McCrery and his colleagues at Fix the Debt have lent a public-spirited, elder-statesman sheen to the cause of deficit reduction. Leading up to the fiscal negotiations, they set up grass-roots chapters around the country, met with President Obama and his aides, and hosted private breakfasts for lawmakers on Capitol Hill. In recent days, Fix the Debt has redoubled its efforts, starting a new national advertising campaign and calling on Mr. Obama and Congress to revise the tax code and reduce long-term spending on entitlement programs. 
But in the weeks ahead, many of the campaign's members will be juggling their private interests with their public goals: they are also lobbyists, board members or executives for corporations that have worked aggressively to shape the contours of federal spending and taxes, including many of the tax breaks that would be at the heart of any broad overhaul. While Fix the Debt criticized the recent fiscal deal between Mr. Obama and lawmakers, saying it did not do enough to cut spending or close tax loopholes, companies and industries linked to the organization emerged with significant victories on taxes and other policies.
''Some of these folks who are trying to be part of the solution have also been part of the problem,'' said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning advocacy group, and a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ''They've often fought hard against the kind of balance that we need on the revenue side. Many of the people we're talking about are associated with policies that would make it a lot harder to fix the debt.''
Sam Nunn, a former Democratic senator from Georgia who is a member of Fix the Debt's steering committee, received more than $300,000 in compensation in 2011 as a board member of General Electric. The company is among the most aggressive in the country at minimizing its tax obligations. Mr. McCrery, the Louisiana Republican, is also among G.E.'s lobbyists, according to the most recent federal disclosures, monitoring federal budget negotiations for the company.
Other board members and steering committee members have deep ties to the financial industry, including private equity, whose executives have aggressively fought efforts to alter a tax provision, known as the carried interest exception, that significantly reduces their personal income taxes.
Erskine B. Bowles, a co-founder of Fix the Debt, was paid $345,000 in stock and cash in 2011 as a board member at Morgan Stanley, while Judd Gregg, a former Republican senator from New Hampshire and a co-chairman of Fix the Debt, is a paid adviser to Goldman Sachs. Both companies have engaged in lobbying on international tax rules.
Mr. Gregg also sits on the boards of Honeywell and IntercontinentalExchange, a company that has warned investors that a tax on financial transactions would lower trading volume and curtail its profits. The two companies paid Mr. Gregg almost $750,000 in cash and stock in 2011.
In all, close to half of the members of Fix the Debt's board and steering committee have ties to companies that have engaged in lobbying on taxes and spending, often to preserve tax breaks and other special treatment.
Fix the Debt does not endorse specific tax proposals. Instead, it advocates broad principles for debt reduction, including ''comprehensive and pro-growth tax reform, which broadens the base, lowers rates, raises revenues and reduces the deficit.'' A spokesman, Jon Romano, said that the executives involved with the campaign were committed to tax reform, even if it closed loopholes that benefited their companies.
''All the people involved in this campaign have said from the beginning that everything has to be on the table,'' Mr. Romano said. ''Our C.E.O.'s, our state chapters, our small-business leaders -- they are all willing to give something up for the sake of the country.''
Those involved with the campaign say they have tried to separate their advocacy for Fix the Debt and their private work for clients. Vic Fazio, a former Democratic congressman from California who is on the campaign's steering committee, is a lobbyist at Akin Gump, a firm whose clients include KKR, a leading private equity shop, and the Private Equity Growth Capital Council, an industry trade group.
Mr. Fazio said that he and other people involved with the campaign had tried to set aside their parochial interests and had assumed that any grand bargain between Mr. Obama and Congress would include some elements they did not like.
''The people who have signed up to work with Fix the Debt are people with lots of tax preferences that are important to their business model,'' Mr. Fazio said. ''But they go along with it because they think there is an overriding benefit to their companies and to the country.''
But so far, at least, the companies and industries most closely linked to Fix the Debt have been aggressive in defending their narrower legislative interests.
The fiscal deal preserved the carried interest loophole, eliminated most of a large prospective increase in dividends taxes and preserved a tax break, known as the active financing exception, that allows G.E. and other multinational companies to avoid paying United States taxes on overseas profits.
The deal also forestalled large automatic cuts in military spending, a boon to contractors like Honeywell. The company's chief executive, David M. Cote, is a co-founder of Fix the Debt; the group's ''core principles,'' which call for retrenchment in entitlement programs like Social Security, make no mention of military spending, which constitutes about a fifth of the federal budget.
''It's easier to get face time in Washington as a deficit hawk than as a corporate hack,'' said Kevin Connor, the director of the Public Accountability Initiative, a watchdog group. ''They are spending millions, but they are protecting billions in defense contracts and tax giveaways that would otherwise be on the chopping block.''
Yet after an election in which many industries, including Wall Street, bet heavily against Mr. Obama, Fix the Debt has also had more credibility among Democrats than some traditional business groups like the United States Chamber of Commerce. The chamber, by far the largest business advocacy group in Washington, staunchly opposed proposals to raise taxes before the fiscal deal.
At a news conference in New York on Tuesday, Mr. Bowles suggested that Fix the Debt was just getting started.
''I'm not a quitter,'' he said at the event, which was sponsored by Nasdaq, the country's second-largest stock exchange. ''We're going to stay until we get the job done.''

HEADLINE: Where Modernity Frames Tradition

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
LONDON -- The other day I caught up with New Court, the London headquarters for Rothschild Bank, designed by Ellen van Loon and Rem Koolhaas of OMA. Opulent, context friendly, almost stealthy, it's an ''adult building,'' as one of the architects who worked on the project half-jokingly put it.
Meaning that it's not what you might expect from Mr. Koolhaas, who has been heard recently lamenting ''the rat race of extravagance'' driving trophy architecture before the market tanked, when he was such an emblematic and influential figure. As it happens, New Court was commissioned before the crash but took years to be finished. So like Mr. Koolhaas's mantra, it's neatly tailored for a changed climate. 
London has a case of what the late critic Ada Louise Huxtable once called Skyscrapers Gone Wild. She was talking about the ''supersized, contorted, totally out of context'' towers, resulting from a cocktail of new technology and mad money, competing for height and attention, from which this city had once proudly abstained. I looked around town with Ricky Burdett, who teaches urban studies at the London School of Economics. He showed me 122 Leadenhall Street, nicknamed the Cheese Grater, an office building by Richard Rogers going up not far from New Court in the heart of the London financial district. I wondered aloud what Rafael Viñoly could possibly have been thinking when he came up with the top-heavy design for the building that has been nicknamed the Walkie-Talkie, close by.
Across the river, atop London Bridge Station, the nearly completed Shard by Renzo Piano -- London's tallest building -- loomed over the skyline.
Neighborhoods are changing too. The master plan for the Olympic Games last summer entailed creating what's meant to be a prosperous new center in the historically downtrodden East End. Olympic Village is being turned into mixed-income housing and parkland. (James Corner, of Field Operations, who worked on the High Line in New York, is designing part of the park.) As with the Shard, we'll have to wait to see how it works after it's finished.
David Cameron, the British prime minister, and Boris Johnson, London's flamboyant mayor, announced with some fanfare last month a plan to invest $80 million in the construction of a civic center for Tech City, as the blocks of East London near the Old Street Roundabout have come to be called. ''There goes the neighborhood,'' was the lament of some die-hards in that scrappy start-up community, who feared the area had lost its cachet if government planners wanted to horn in on what has been a bottom-up development.
Their real cause for concern ought to have been the suburban office-park-style building in the drawing that the prime minister and mayor unveiled. A better plan, to upgrade the grievous roundabout itself, should emerge as the project evolves.
The most dramatic transformation is to Kings Cross, long a crime-ridden, impoverished district where the St. Pancras and Kings Cross railway stations converge. Across 20 years or so the area has been changed almost beyond recognition. To complement the renovation of St. Pancras a few years ago the main concourse of the Kings Cross terminal has recently been refurbished with a swooping, pseudo-Gothic ceiling designed by John McAslan. Google plans to put its London headquarters next door. Luxury and subsidized housing have arrived or are arriving nearby, along with commercial development.
The Argent Group, a British developer, is behind this multibillion-dollar makeover. It has stuck to good urban strategies: mixed use, slow growth, pedestrian-friendly streets, sensible restoration alongside new construction, and an emphasis on active and ample public space. A spanking new granite plaza with fountains opened last month outside the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, which in 2011 moved into a six-story, 19th-century granary, ingeniously retrofitted by Stanton Williams, the London architects. The design navigates strict conservation guidelines to devise a spare, sleek, soaring interior that doubles as school and new public square.
The development around King's Cross is gentrifying a former brownfield, which is what some of the Shard's old-time neighbors fear. That building, a mountain among the pubs and housing blocks, will change the real estate picture in the area. It's hulking and unimpressive at street level. But adding density at a rail hub makes sense. The prospective mix of offices, apartments, restaurants and a viewing platform in the building, to rival the London Eye, should add jobs and revenue to the area; and the station, which serves 300,000 commuters a day, has been cleaned up and attractively refurbished as part of the project.
And from afar the vertical faceting of the Shard's facade reduces the impression of bulk. The crystalline effect is subtler than many Londoners feared. The building almost evaporates in certain soft light, its crown dissolving into a mesh of attached screens -- a move Mr. Piano tried unsuccessfully at The New York Times building, where the clunky flat roof looks unfinished. Here, by extending the tower so that it tapers to a sharp point, the screens serve the desired purpose.
More than 30 new skyscrapers are rising or soon will in this city. For centuries the dome of St. Paul's was the highest monument on the skyline, until the National Westminster Tower in 1980. Then came Norman Foster's Gherkin. Now the race is on.
This is partly the consequence of a vigorous policy by Ken Livingstone, the former mayor, pursued under Mr. Johnson, promoting high-rise growth, focused around mass transit. The policy has brought international architects to the city for the first time in a big way. But many of the projects have been waved through the approval process by a complacent planning system, Rowan Moore, the architecture critic for The Observer, wrote recently.
''Is there anything special about their detail?'' he asked. ''Is there consistency or integrity in their overall concept? Do they create handsome new public spaces at their base?''
Which gets back to New Court, OMA's 226,000-square-foot headquarters for Rothschild. At 15 stories, it's no skyscraper, but it is taller than the buildings immediately around it, the tower cutting a profile far more distinguished than, say, the Walkie-Talkie.
The Rothschild family has occupied this same site on St. Swithin's Lane, an ancient alleyway not 10 feet wide, since 1809. New Court replaces a smaller headquarters from the 1960s, which replaced a Victorian one. Behind the building St. Stephen Walbrook church, by Christopher Wren, an architectural landmark from 1680, had been obscured from view by successive Rothschild offices for nearly 200 years.
OMA's big idea: cut a passage through the middle of the site, raising the new building off the ground to reveal the church, with a quasipublic plaza that links the covered forecourt of the bank with St. Stephen's graveyard.
The plan is ingenious, elegant. Now a glass and aluminum colonnade defines the street edge, with a broad portico and pedestrian passage behind, framing the church view. The plan brings transparency, surprise and civic grandeur to a narrow lane; and by revealing Wren's building, it invents a pas de deux, the Rothschild tower nodding to the tower of St. Stephen.
Among the luxury details: bespoke textiles in private meeting rooms, a timber desk and ornamented curtain in the lofted lobby, and a ground-floor annex for the Rothschild family archive, with hand-carved oak cabinets and old master art. There's none of the rough and tumble associated with OMA. Everything's smooth, sleek, a poetry of linked volumes.
I said quasipublic earlier only because while you can now see St. Stephen from St. Swithin's Lane, you can't get to it. A gate between forecourt and churchyard is locked; bank guards discourage the curious. So, unfortunately, an architecture of openness meets the architecture of paranoia that has reshaped cities like London and New York for more than a decade.
Here's one vote for openness.

HEADLINE: Betrayed by Basel

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Faced with international regulations that go easy on the big banks, the United States should develop its own tighter rules and be prepared to implement them alone, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
The fundamental assumption of modern bank regulation is that nations need to coordinate, and they negotiate the relevant international standards in the Swiss city of Basel, home to the Bank for International Settlements, under whose auspices such negotiations are held. The United States has an important seat at the table, but so do the Europeans and others. These negotiations are shaped by three main forces: the United States, Britain and the euro zone, with Japan often siding with the euro zone. (It's one country, one vote, so this can easily go against the United States.) 
This week the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, as it is known, let us down - once again. Faced with renewed pressure from the international banking lobby, these officials caved in, as they did so many times in the period leading to the crisis of 2007-8. As a result, our financial system took a major step toward becoming more dangerous. (A visual representation of the Basel Committee's centrality to all key regulatory matters is clear on this organizational chart, as well as in its charter.)
Why did this happen? Must Basel always let us down? And is there any alternative?

You will no doubt have noticed that very large banks with a global span have an unusual degree of political influence. In particular, they have the ability to threaten the economic recovery. Their line is: if you don't give us what we want, credit will not flow and jobs will not come back.
Policy makers in Washington are often impressed by this line, although less frequently than they used to be. More and more, managers have begun to understand that the people who run large banks have distorted incentives. Because they receive downside protection from the public sector - the too-big-to-fail phenomenon - bank executives want to take a great deal of risk. When things go well, they get the upside; when things go badly, that is largely someone else's problem.
How does that desire for risk manifest itself? The banks lobby for the ability to fund themselves with more debt and less equity, and they also want to be less safe on other dimensions, including holding fewer liquid assets.
The Basel Committee this week agreed to water down its liquidity requirements. Felix Salmon of Reuters has a good explanation of why this is a bad idea. Writing in The Atlantic, Jesse Eisinger and Frank Partnoy have a very nice article about continued fragility of banking, because investors think the banks are hiding trouble in the published balance sheets. Confidence in the system is not restored by relaxing regulation.
The deeper problem with the Basel Committee is it overrepresents the euro-zone Europeans. Not only is the euro zone in great difficulty because of economic mismanagement, but its leaders are hoping to get out of their current predicament in part by relaxing bank regulation.
The idea that the Basel process is all about expertise - or smart people working out the right answers - is exploded by Sheila Bair's book, "Bull by the Horns." Read Chapter 3, in which she describes in convincing detail the fight over the Basel II agreement during the mid-2000s (and Chapter 4, which is more about how some United States agencies play against in each and on behalf their clients, the big banks).
What we saw before 2007 and what we see now is not officials applying some sort of optimization procedure or sensible independent thinking. Rather, this is about an industry that wants to take more risk because that is how it gets larger subsidies. And this industry is expert at playing the regulators off against each other, including across borders. The Europeans are again the patsy.
Unfortunately, some United States officials are so captured or captivated by the ideology of modern banking that they want to play along. For example, as Ms. Bair mentions, the most dangerous "advanced approaches" of Basel II were developed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York - not surprising, given how close many people at that institution are to Wall Street. Those advanced approaches let the banks set their own risk-weights on assets, essentially using complex math to determine what was risky and what was relatively safe. Of course, they were almost completely wrong, and Basel II was a dismal failure.
Thank goodness Ms. Bair and her colleagues at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation resisted the full implementation of Basel II. Their insistence on simpler safeguards, including a tough cap on debt relative to bank size, helped make our financial crisis less severe than it would otherwise have been. The Europeans drank the Basel II Kool-Aid, and their banks loaded up on poorly understood risks. They will lose a decade of growth partly for this reason.
Now we have moved on to what is known as Basel III, and again the Europeans want to double down by letting the banks do want they want. The stock price of European banks jumped on the news of the latest Basel Committee relaxation of the rules - you should interpret that as a larger expected transfer from taxpayers to bank insiders and (perhaps) stockholders.
The United States must go it alone. Basel agreements should be a floor on our bank regulation (including bank capital, leverage and liquidity), not a ceiling. If our tighter rules induce dangerous banking activities to leave the United States, that is fine. In fact, we should offer to help them pack.
We need a financial sector that works for the real economy - not a continuation of the dangerous, nontransparent government subsidy schemes that have brought the Europeans to their knees.

HEADLINE: Battle Lines Drawn Over Herbalife

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: William A. Ackman and Daniel S. Loeb became business rivals on Wednesday, with hundreds of millions of dollars in play over Herbalife. | Diminished profits have forced Morgan Stanley to cut back its trading desk, raising questions about the firm. | Jacob J. Lew, President Obama's chief of staff and former budget director, has been tapped to be the secretary of the Treasury. | Amid criticism, the board of the American International Group decided not to join a lawsuit against the federal government. 

 BODY:
BATTLE LINES DRAWN OVER HERBALIFE | The clash of the hedge fund titans has been set, and the financial world is eagerly watching. William A. Ackman and Daniel S. Loeb, two of the most prominent hedge fund managers in Manhattan, became business rivals on Wednesday, with hundreds of millions of dollars in play over Herbalife, a nutritional supplements company.
Betting that Herbalife would thrive, Mr. Loeb disclosed on Wednesday that his firm Third Point had bought nearly nine million shares of the company, a position now worth more than $350 million, DealBook reports. That amounted to a direct challenge to Mr. Ackman, who weeks earlier had called the company a pyramid scheme, wagering $1 billion that the stock would fall. Herbalife, whose shares have been on a roller-coaster ride, will tell its side of the story on Thursday, in a meeting with analysts at 9 a.m. in New York. DealBook will be providing live updates of the conference.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is adding to the scrutiny, as the agency's enforcement unit has opened an investigation into Herbalife, a person briefed on the matter tells DealBook. The inquiry is likely to examine the way the company sells products, using a network of independent distributors who are incentivized to recruit others. 
Mr. Loeb, whose bet surprised many, explained his reasoning in a letter to investors. "The short thesis rests on the notion that the F.T.C. has been asleep at the switch, missed a massive fraud for over three decades, and will shortly awaken (at the behest of hedge fund short seller) to shut down the company," he wrote in the letter. "We find this thesis to be preposterous."
CUTS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT MORGAN STANLEY'S FUTURE | 
Morgan Stanley's trading desk was once legendary on Wall Street, rivaled only by firms like Goldman Sachs. But diminished profits have forced the firm to cut back. The latest cuts involve 1,600 jobs, accounting for 6 percent of the support work force, and 6 percent of institutional securities, which includes the trading business, DealBook's Susanne Craig reports. The cuts are "raising questions among some on Wall Street about whether it should spin off or ditch much of its trading business as its Swiss rival UBS has, a suggestion the firm eschews."
"Whether the company can avoid shrinking further - and a number of analysts say that additional cuts will be needed - and revive the fixed-income trading business will have significant ripple effects in the financial world." The firm's retreat means that the fixed-income trading business is increasingly being dominated by JPMorgan Chase and Goldman, in addition to a number of investment firms. For Morgan Stanley in recent years, "the fixed-income department has not been able to make enough money to cover the cost to Morgan Stanley of this capital, according to people briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak on the record."
The board has discussed closing the fixed-income department, Ms. Craig reports. But the firm is shrinking it instead. "We are not going to pull a UBS," a senior executive, Colm Kelleher, told a private dinner of Morgan Stanley shareholders at Oceana restaurant in Midtown Manhattan. On Wednesday, Morgan Stanley got a vote of confidence from Mr. Loeb's hedge fund, which told investors it was taking a stake in the firm and said Morgan Stanley was "in the early innings of a turnaround."
OBAMA'S CHIEF OF STAFF SAID TO BE TAPPED FOR TREASURY | President Obama will announce on Thursday that Jacob J. Lew, his chief of staff and former budget director, is his pick to be the secretary of the Treasury, The New York Times reports. In doing so, Mr. Obama will "complete the transformation of his economic team from the big-name economists and financial firefighters hired four years ago to budget negotiators ready for the next fiscal fights in Congress." Mr. Lew would face a confirmation by the Senate.
The blogosphere wasn't buzzing about Mr. Lew's qualifications, but rather his ridiculous signature. On Wednesday, many wondered whether his Slinky-like signature might soon decorate newly printed dollar bills. Still, Mr. Lew could possibly decide to alter his signature to make it more legible, as the current Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, once did.
A.I.G. NOT JOINING LAWSUIT AGAINST GOVERNMENT | Amid criticism, the board of the American International Group decided not to join a lawsuit against the federal government over its $182 billion bailout in the financial crisis. The announcement followed a DealBook report that the company was considering whether to join the legal challenge by its former chief executive, Maurice R. Greenberg, on behalf of fellow shareholders. "The suit itself is regarded by many as ridiculous on its face," Stephen J. Lubben writes in his column, In Debt. "Shareholders are always subject to dilution."
After the board meeting on Wednesday, "which lasted all morning, the board voted unanimously to steer clear of the case. It also decided to ask Mr. Greenberg to forgo legal claims in the company's name," DealBook reports. Robert H. Benmosche, A.I.G.'s chief executive and a director, wrote in an internal memorandum to employees: "The board's decision today was about continuing to move this company forward, not backward."
ON THE AGENDA | 
The European Central Bank and the Bank of England are issuing decisions about interest rates. Des Walsh, the president of Herbalife, is on CNBC at 7:30 a.m., and the company's chief executive, Michael Johnson, is on CNBC at 11:45 a.m. Mike Mayo of CLSA is on Bloomberg TV at 9:14 a.m. Robert Pittman, chief executive of Clear Channel, is on Bloomberg TV at 12 p.m.
BALLMER'S BASKETBALL AMBITIONS | 
Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, is joining the hedge fund manager Chris Hansen in an effort to buy the Sacramento Kings basketball team for about $500 million from the Maloof family, according to Yahoo Sports. The prospective buyers are looking to move the franchise to Seattle for the 2013-14 season.

HEADLINE: In the Spirit of Ada Louise Huxtable, a Times Critic Reinvents His Role

BYLINE: MARGARET SULLIVAN


HIGHLIGHT: Michael Kimmelman views architecture in terms of public policy as well as aesthetics. 

 BODY:
Michael Kimmelman's piece on Ada Louise Huxtable, who died this week at age 91, in Tuesday's Arts section is tagged "An Appraisal," but it could easily have been called something more enthusiastic: an appreciation. For by his own eager admission, Mr. Kimmelman - who took over as architecture critic in September 2011 -- owes much to Ms. Huxtable, whom he calls a role model.
If Ms. Huxtable invented the role of newspaper architecture critic in the 1960s and 1970s, then Mr. Kimmelman has spent the last year or so inventing it anew - with more than a nod to the woman whose work he grew up reading and admiring. 
"She's been a role model and an inspiration," Mr. Kimmelman told me Tuesday. "I exist in her shadow as somebody who aspires to see both the art and the social and political role of the built environment, and to treat this job as a bully pulpit for making better places to live."
Unlike many of the other culture critics at The Times, the architecture critic has considerable freedom to choose his own assignments and areas of interest - not bound, as others are, by the equivalent of the blockbuster movie, the big Broadway premiere, or the major exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The role is "an outlier among the critics," he said.
In his first 16 months on the job, Mr. Kimmelman, by design, has taken on architecture (broadly defined) in all of New York City's five boroughs, as well as farther afield - going to Medellín, Colombia, to write about urban planning, to Louisville, Ky., to write about highways, and to Oakland, Calif., to write about housing projects.
Rather than lavishing attention on the world of "starchitects" and what he calls "buildings as baubles," he has defined his role more broadly: writing, for example, about the importance of place to the Occupy Wall Street movement, and about the implications of Hurricane Sandy.
"Why is it intrinsically more interesting to write about a museum wing instead of a library or a hospital?" he asked.
He has also shown himself more than willing to take a big swing at a fat pitch, as he did in his Christmas Eve takedown of the new Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. (The piece qualifies as one of those "all guns blazing" reviews I wrote about in a recent Sunday column.) It begins:
Offhand I can't recall seeing a more ridiculous looking building than the new Stedelijk Museum, which recently opened here. Shaped like a bathtub, of all things, it arrives years behind schedule at the tail end of the money-fueled, headline-hungry, erratically ingenious era of indulgent museum design that began to peter out with the global economy.
Later: "Entering an oversize plumbing fixture to commune with classic modern art is like hearing Bach played by a man wearing a clown suit."
Like Ms. Huxtable, Mr. Kimmelman is attuned to "the democracy of this art form." In that context, he told me that he admired her "ability to speak truth to power" and to express - and stand by - an unpopular point of view as she did when she wrote approvingly of Boston's new and widely deplored city hall in 1969.
"Maybe that came partly from being a woman, having a distance from the traditional seats of power," he said, calling her "incorruptible."
In his appraisal, Mr. Kimmelman wrote that Ms. Huxtable "had that rare journalistic opportunity to pioneer something of her own, to fill a yawning gap in the public discourse, to carve a path with moral dimensions..."
It's heartening to see him honor his role model by bringing that same mission into The Times again, reinvented for the 21st century.

HEADLINE: Thinking About the Brink

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Is the coin solution a bad idea precisely because it will work? 

 BODY:
The platinum coin discussion has moved with startling speed, from an idea nobody took seriously (and which, as I've mentioned, senior officials were unaware of just last month), to assertions that it's ridiculous and illegal, to grudging acknowledgment that it's almost surely legal coupled with strained attempts to dismiss it as an option nonetheless. 
Ezra Klein has now opened up a new front, which I would consider a sort of progressive version of the shock doctrine: we shouldn't invoke the coin option, he says, precisely because it would work too well, and therefore let us sidestep the real issues: 
The argument against minting the platinum coin is simply this: It makes it harder to solve the actual problem facing our country. That problem is not the debt ceiling, per se, though it manifests itself most dangerously through the debt ceiling. It's a Republican Party that has grown extreme enough to persuade itself that stratagems like threatening default are reasonable. It's that our two-party political system breaks down when one of the two parties comes unmoored. Minting the coin doesn't so much solve that problem as surrender to it.
The platinum coin is an attempt to delay a reckoning that we unfortunately need to have. It takes a debate that will properly focus on the GOP's reckless threat to force the United States into default and refocuses it on a seemingly absurd power grab by the executive branch. It is of no solace that many of the intuitive arguments against the platinum coin can be calmly rebutted. It's the wrong debate to be having.
This isn't a stupid argument. We really do need to come to grips with Republican extremism. The question is whether refusing to use this escape hatch is the place and time to do that.
My own view is that I was willing to go over the brink on the fiscal cliff, but not here, for three reasons.
First, this is seriously risky business. The fiscal cliff would have been a known quantity: basically, a negative Keynesian shock to the economy, which is something we understand quite well, and furthermore something that would have built only gradually over time. The risks, in short, were somewhat contained.
By contrast, nobody really knows what happens if America defaults, even briefly. The whole structure of world financial markets is built around the use of Treasury bills as the ultimate safe asset; what happens if they lose that status? It would certainly be an interesting experiment, but one best carried out if you have plenty of bottled water and spare ammunition in your basement.
Second, if you're going to have an epic political confrontation of this particular kind -- that is, one that can inflict vast damage until somebody blinks -- having it just a few weeks into a new Congress doesn't seem optimal. Even if the confrontation causes voters to recognize GOP extremists for what they are, and a tidal wave of revulsion builds, it will be almost 2 years before we can change the cast of characters -- and also 2 years for the crazies to try to spin the story differently.
Third, and relatedly, the idea that we can have the decisive confrontation and get the message across depends in large part on good reporting. If news media report this in he-said-she-said fashion: "Some Democrats say that Republicans are holding the country hostage, but Republicans say that it's the other way around" -- we are not going to get the kind of clarity Ezra wants. And to paraphrase his own depiction of the state of affairs, does the picture of clear, courageous news media that reject the spinners and give voters the straight story sound like the news environment we actually live in?
I like epic confrontation as much as the next guy, and probably more so. And if I were Treasury secretary -- which mercifully is not going to happen -- I'd be very cagey about the coin, the coupons, and all that until the day is really upon us, without ruling them out. But we need a strategy to deal with the crazies if they really do prove irredeemably crazy, which seems all too possible.

HEADLINE: What's at the Center of the Debate Over Herbalife

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: There are no easy answers here, and that probably means that the hedge fund combatants William Ackman and Daniel Loeb -- and Herbalife -- will be duking it out for some time. 

 BODY:
In the wake of the bombshell announcement that Daniel S. Loeb's Third Point has taken an 8.9 percent stake in Herbalife after the company's shares were shorted by William A. Ackman of Pershing Square, the question is: Which very rich hedge fund manager is right?
Is Herbalife a pyramid scheme as Mr. Ackman alleges and the nutritional supplements company heatedly denies, or is it a growth business model as Mr. Loeb seems to be betting?
It's not an easy answer as you would think. Part of this is because Wall Street runs on fear, and the taint of allegations by such a prominent investor is hard to escape. And now it will run on bullish spirits spurred by Mr. Loeb. 
But the uncertainty is also because, although Mr. Ackman's arguments were impressive in length and thoroughness, it is sometimes hard to understand what he is trying to do with them. This is in part because they was no doubt vetted and vetted again by Pershing Square's lawyers in order to protect Mr. Ackman and his firm from any defamation claim. (Herbalife may still sue anyway, if for nothing else than to show that it can play offense as well as defense and gain back further momentum - after all, what does it have to lose?) But it is also because Mr. Ackman is not just trying to get the market to believe his presentation, which was first offered in December and has now supplemented with a shorter executive summary version.
More fundamentally, Mr. Ackman is hoping regulators, namely the Federal Trade Commission, will step in and declare Herbalife to be a pyramid scheme under the law). If they do so, then they will shut down Herbalife's business in the United States and send the stock price to zero. In other words, this may be the most aggressive and largest short of all time.
And that is why there was a lot of legal talk in Mr. Ackman's presentation. He is not just betting that the market will turn against Herbalife; he is going for the regulatory takedown. And so, his presentation was really just a brief for regulators, designed to be so impressive that they will have to act.
Whether the regulators do anything depends on these central questions: Is Herbalife selling its product to people outside its network or to its own distributors? And are those distributors making more money by pushing product than actual sales?
The reason is based on a decision from the 1970s by the F.T.C. that rejected claims that Amway was a pyramid scheme. Multilevel marketing models like Herbalife and Amway sell their goods through distributor networks. People make money not only from sales, but by recruiting people to make sales and recruit further salespeople. The recruiters earn a commission on any sales made by people they recruit or people who their recruits recruit, and so on. The problem is that when the money made is all on commissions and not on sales to outsiders, the model becomes a pyramid scheme that will eventually collapse when new people stop entering at a sufficient rate and sales are only made to people buying the goods to earn commissions.
The regulator based its decision that Amway was not a pyramid scheme in part because of Amway's rule that distributors had to sell to 10 customers a month and also sell 70 percent of their product each month to others. Since that time the "70 percent rule" and "10 customer rule" have been rough metrics by which the F.T.C. partly assesses other multilevel marketing programs to decide whether they are pyramid schemes.
So is Herbalife a legitimate sales operation selling to outsiders? Or are all of its sales to distributors who purchase the product to make commissions from themselves and sales people beneath them in the marketing scheme?
For Herbalife, providing an answer is harder than you might think. While Herbalife has rules to bring it in compliance with the F.T.C. guidelines, including the 70 percent and 10 customer rule, it does not directly track sales to distributors outside its network and has not disclosed this information in the past.
When David Einhorn asked a few questions on an analyst call focusing on this question in May, Herbalife's stock tumbled. The company then engaged Lieberman Worldwide Research. The market research firm found that in a 90-day period, 5.6 million American households stated that they had purchased Herbalife products, and that 90 percent of these households were outside the Herbalife distributor network.
It's a bit odd that Herbalife would have to determine its outside sales through a research firm, but still the company also states that 20 percent of its volume is shipped directly to consumers outside its network instead of through distributors, further supporting this finding (the rest, the company asserts, is sold directly by distributors to outsiders). The 90 percent number, by the way, was repeated by Herbalife's chief executive, Michael Johnson, on CNBC shortly after the Ackman presentation.
So, how does Mr. Ackman make his case that Herbalife is a pyramid scheme and sales primarily occur in network to earn commissions? From my reading, he does it in two stages. First, he asserts that Herbalife products are commodities and available on eBay at significant discount to the suggested retail price. This is an easily verifiable claim, one that anyone can check.
But Mr. Ackman then asserts that if that is the case, no rational person outside the distribution network would ever purchase product at the full retail price. He goes on to assert that if this is true, the only real way to make money from Herbalife is not by retail sales but by recruiting sales people and earning commissions.
A number of other claims come from this: that Herbalife does not adequately enforce its rules discouraging pyramid schemes, that Herbalife's accounting does not adequately disclose in-network sales, that Herbalife's distributor network has high rates of churn, and that the company charges excessive rates of shipping and handling to further earn profits from its network. Again, Herbalife heatedly denies these claims, but they are really all a sideshow to the main one about the price at which a distributor can sell Herbalife.
Assuming the company agrees with what is apparent, that Herbalife can be bought online well below the suggested retail price, this does not mean all is over for Herbalife.
The company gave its presentation Thursday, and it will have some momentum with the disclosure of Mr. Loeb's stake.
Reading through Herbalife's copious promotional materials, I assume Herbalife could assert that people pay more than the eBay price because of the outstanding salesmanship of its distributors. That distributors become a customer's life coach - helping get the customer in shape and lose weight. These are the claims that health companies typically make. And the customer gladly pays the extra amount to obtain these services. And that is why Herbalife has a $2 billion brand without advertising.
This is the squirmy part of multilevel marketing - your friends and families become sellers and the inherent trust in these relationships drives sales. And because these types of programs are not prevalent among people of higher economic class, this is largely a game that most Wall Street executives have no contact with in their daily lives.
Yet, Amway shows that these networks can succeed and do so based on this type of salesmanship. The real question Mr. Ackman is raising is whether this network is also a success at Herbalife.
(On Herbalife's call with analysts and investors on Thursday, Des Walsh, the president, said that eBay prices were not a proxy for market prices. "Most people I know use eBay to buy branded products at a discount price," he said. "A small, small fraction of Herbalife products are actually sold on eBay.")
All told, it shows how hard truth can be to discern on Wall Street when the information is spread through conferences and presentations and not in the field.
It means that there is likely to be no knockout punch here until people actually go and do some real field research. So Herbalife and Mr. Ackman and now Mr. Loeb will be duking it out for a long time.

HEADLINE: Cigarette Taxes vs. Cigarette Smuggling

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Three of every five cigarettes consumed in New York State were smuggled in from lower-tax states in 2011, according to new estimates. 

 BODY:
Three of every five cigarettes consumed in New York State were smuggled in from lower-tax states in 2011, according to new estimates from the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a free-market research organization in Michigan. That is the highest smuggling rate in the country. 
Perhaps not coincidentally, New York State also has the highest cigarette tax rate - $4.35 per pack, not counting the additional $1.50 per pack levied in New York City.
New Hampshire had the highest share of its cigarettes - 26.8 percent - smuggled out of the state. The state cut its tax rate in 2011 by 10 cents to $1.68, still slightly higher than the national average. But it is surrounded by states with much higher tax rates. In Massachusetts, for example, the tax was $2.51 per pack.
Below you can see maps showing where the most smuggling occurs and what the relative tax rates are. 
In the top map, which shows percentages for smuggling rates, positive numbers mean that there was a net inflow of cigarettes (i.e., more cigarettes were smuggled in than out), and negative numbers indicate that there was a net outflow. The bottom map shows the state tax per cigarette pack, in dollars. 
The Mackinac Center also has data comparing tax and smuggling rates from 2006 to 2011, by which time most states had raised their cigarette taxes in an attempt to collect more revenue. New York State almost tripled its tax rates during that time, but smokers appeared to respond by buying more of their cigarettes across state lines.
It's not clear that New Hampshire's decision to cut its tax rate to capture more out-of-state customers, on the other hand, was any more profitable. That's partly because within 24 hours of the state's 10-cent cigarette tax cut, cigarette manufacturers raised their own prices by 10 cents.
(These data were reformatted, I should add, by the Tax Foundation, a conservative-leaning research organization in Washington.)

HEADLINE: A Bit of Relief on Food Prices

BYLINE: JUSTIN GILLIS


HIGHLIGHT: For 2012 as a whole, prices were 7 percent lower than in 2011. 

 BODY:
World food prices ended the year with a slight decline, and for 2012 as a whole they were 7 percent below prices of 2011, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations reported on Thursday. 
Food prices have been one of the most troubling aspects of the international economic situation for several years now, so this is a spot of good news. But prices, driven by rising demand in developing countries and supply constraints that include climate change, remain well above levels of the 1990s. The price run-ups in recent years, particularly in 2008 and 2011, have led to the biggest increases in world hunger in decades.
The 2012 declines reported by the F.A.O. were concentrated among some of the higher-value commodities like sugar, oils and dairy products. The most important and politically sensitive prices, for the grains that supply most human calories, were down only 2.4 percent in 2012 from the previous year.

Grain prices soared in the summer, in large measure because of a drought in the United States that cut farm output, then declined modestly toward the end of the year as the overall global supply situation became somewhat clearer.
It's early in the year, of course, but prospects for 2013 are murky at best. The extraordinary heat in Australia, which is in the heart of its growing season now, is not going to help, and a continuing widespread droughtin the United States could spell trouble when planting starts this spring.

HEADLINE: Ben Horowitz on the Impact of Software Everywhere

BYLINE: QUENTIN HARDY


HIGHLIGHT: Ben Horowitz, the co-founder of the Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm, talks about the implications of his firm's thesis that "software is eating the world." Getting a job may be tougher. Governments will have a harder time paying their bills. Opportunities have never been greater. With this many contradictions, something big is going on. 

 BODY:
Ben Horowitz may have the skeleton key to the decimation - sorry, transformation - of our economic and political lives. What he doesn't have is a good sense of what we will look like when we get to the other side.
As he says in this video interview, "Do we think enough about the implications and how it's going to change society? Probably not as much as we should." 
Mr. Horowitz is an unusually thoughtful person, but thinking about social implications is not his job. As co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, one of Silicon Valley's newest, largest and most high-profile venture capital firms, he and co-founder Marc Andreesseen base many of their investments off a thesis they call "Software is Eating the World."
The idea has enabled the firm to raise $2.7 billion in just three and a half years, and participate in lucrative sales of companies like Skype and Nicira. 
In a nutshell, Mr. Horowitz believes that technology developments are now upending entire industries, and will do so at an increasingly larger and more rapid rate. The factors behind the change include the inexorable march of Moore's Law, which holds that the chip industry doubles the number of transistors it can build on a single chip at routine intervals of about two years. That has been happening for decades, but more recently capacities for bandwidth and storage have grown as computer server virtualization and cloud computing have dropped costs. These things give people in all sorts of locations vastly more computing power for less money. 
New software languages and different ways of collaborating internally have enabled quicker execution of bigger projects, he believes. Lastly, cheap mobile devices and the transformation of media into digital information make it easy to reach a global customer base, for fast growth.
"Software and computing had evolved to a point where software was getting powerful enough that it could literally take over other industries," he says.
There are lots of examples to recommend Mr. Horowitz's thesis. Amazon.com has turned bookselling largely into a software business. First Amazon sold books over the Web, which replaced stores, and later it digitized books themselves, so they may be downloaded into a Kindle reader. Apple capitalized on the transformation of music into software with iTunes. 
More recently, Airbnb is attempting to change the hotel business by using software to match overnight guests with people's empty rooms. Uber uses software to make temporarily empty limousines into taxis. Skype's software eliminated the need for the traditional switches of the phone business, and Nicira's software takes away many of the custom-built hardware in traditional computer networking.
Many more industries - education, board games, even kennels - are being transformed by software. 
While this is a lucrative business, the deeper impact of this software-driven transformation gets little attention. These new software companies need far fewer employees than the companies they aim to destroy. Unless you are among the lucky few who are bringing on the change, what will employment look like? 
In one view, if you are not creating an industry-eating software business, you're out of luck. "You're either on the side of the lever where you're getting leveraged away," he says, "or you're providing the software in which you're going to be insanely rich."
More optimistically, you may be able to find work via companies like ODesk, Elance, or LinkedIn. These are among the software companies that intend to supplant traditional employment centers like Manpower, Robert Half, and what's left of the "Help Wanted" section of local newspapers.
You might even get better prices for your labor, particularly if you live in a low-wage country, like Cambodia, and can reach buyers in the United States.
Most of the new jobs are short term, however, and maximize flexibility as employers cope with radical change. An equally troubling question, if all work becomes freelance and short term, is how a government will finance programs that depend largely on a steady flow of money from payroll taxes.
"There are extremely positive things going on," he says, "but the way we live and interact with each other is definitely changing in ways that we don't understand."
One certainty for Mr. Horowitz is that his industry isn't moving away from eating everything else. As he points out in the video: "It's unrealistic and impractical to think, 'O.K., we shouldn't build something,' because it is going to get built." 
While no one is paying him or other venture capitalists to put this issue before policy makers, it does seem like something government should think about.
That is, unless software is eating government, too.

HEADLINE: A Persistent Foreign Predator, Dangerous but Delicious

BYLINE: LUIZ ROCHA


HIGHLIGHT: The invasive lionfish is flourishing in the waters off of Belize, posing a threat to the endangered social wrasse. Controlling it could be a difficult, but potentially tasty, job. 

 BODY:
Luiz Rocha, the curator of ichthyology at the California Academy of Sciences, writes from Belize, where he conducts research on the social wrasse, one of the world's most endangered fish. 
 Saturday, Dec. 22 
Despite the occasional swollen, painful sting, we have had little problem putting our hands on the invasive lionfish here in Belize. During our last day of diving we collected another 17. We would have collected many more if we had additional divers.
They are everywhere, and in much greater numbers than their native range in the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific. We think that two factors are influencing their numbers in the Caribbean: they are released from competition and the Caribbean prey is "naïve." 
They are not the first invasive species to encounter a lack of natural predators and competition combined with easy prey. A similar pattern was observed in the brown tree snake, which was accidentally introduced to the island of Guam shortly after World War II. The invader found a forest free of predators, and stocked with plenty of unwitting prey (native forest vertebrate species). They reached such high numbers that many native species were driven to near extinction. They also tended to climb utility poles, shorting circuits and causing power outages.
In its natural range, the brown tree snake was never able to dominate so completely. There, young snakes faced a shortage of juvenile lizards, their primary food source.
Diversity plays a natural role in controlling lionfish numbers in its native habitat. Sometimes four different lionfish species coexist in a single dive area. These species have similar diets, so they compete for the same resources with one another, and also with other ambush predators. And some of these ambush predators, like large groupers and sharks, eat lionfish in their native range. But these threats are absent in the Caribbean. There, the Red Lionfish (Pterois volitans) dominates, and has few competitors and would-be attackers.
Also, like the bird with no natural fear of the brown tree snake, the social wrasse seems unaware of the threat a lionfish poses -- often straying dangerously close to them.
Our last morning in the field was dedicated to carefully preserving and packing the stomach contents of 51 lionfish - the partially digested bounty of our trip. Among those contents, we found at least 20 critically endangered social wrasses. That number makes the social wrasse the most common prey item found inside lionfish in the area.
As I prepare to leave the Carrie Bow Key field station, my mind turns to the question of what to do about this invasion in progress. And a lot of readers asked about potential solutions. One might be gastronomical.
These are tasty fish. Since we only needed their stomachs for the research, we also carried out a little experiment for the palate: we had lionfish ceviche, fried lionfish and lionfish sashimi with a bit of soy sauce and wasabi. It was simply delicious in every preparation. The consistency of the meat is excellent, especially for sashimi, and its very mild taste reminds me of pricey red snapper and rockfish.
A large-scale commercial catch would potentially mitigate population growth. But there are complications. First, these fish are small, and economic viability would require catching them in high numbers. This might seem like a good thing, given that the objective is to keep their numbers down. But their poisonous spines make these fish very hard to handle even when they are being cleaned. (I've got some first hand experience with that issue.)
Capturing them also poses another problem. While they are extremely easy to catch with a spear, they only eat live fish. So hook and line will not work. You've got to get in the water, up close and personal. But even with all of those limitations, demand will certainly move things the right way, so I encourage everyone to ask for lionfish in Caribbean sea food restaurants.
Some readers also mentioned the practice of feeding them to groupers and sharks. While this seems like a nice option at first, the groupers and sharks in many areas are learning to seek divers for a free food handout rather than acquiring a taste for the lionfish. Most locations of the Caribbean are so overfished that it is hard to find large fish to offer dead lionfish to in the first place.
One reader made another very important point. This invasion likely started with an aquarium release, and the lionfish is not the only invasive aquarium fish present in tropical waters. There are dozens more, including tropical Indo-Pacific angelfish, butterflyfish and surgeonfish. I know aquarium owners do get attached to their fish. They might think that the most humane thing to do when a fish grows too large for its tank is to release it in the nearest large body of water. But doing that will only contribute to the invasive species problem. So here is my suggestion if you have an aquarium fish that is becoming a problem for any reason, just take it back to the aquarium store where you bought it. Store owners will gladly take the fish back most of the time as they can try to resell it to someone with a larger tank.
Regardless of what we do, one thing is certain: the lionfish (as is the case with many other invasive species) is here to stay. They have such a broad habitat and depth range that specialists now agree that it is impossible to eradicate them. All we can do is try to control their numbers. We are confident that the ecosystem in Belize will adjust and nature will find a way. The better question is: how long will this take and just how much will the Caribbean fauna-particularly, the social wrasse-suffer while it does?

HEADLINE: Pound for Pound

BYLINE: ISSANDR EL AMRANI


HIGHLIGHT: In handling Egypt's currency crisis, Mohamed Morsi is resorting to tactics much like Hosni Mubarak's. 

 BODY:
CAIRO - The crisis over the rushed adoption of Egypt's new Constitution is costing President Mohamed Morsi. His popularity is down, and the country is more polarized than ever. Yet he should be even more worried about another crisis, largely of his own making: the recent run on the Egyptian pound, which is rapidly degrading an already precarious economic situation.
The Egyptian pound has fallen from around 6.1 to the U.S. dollar in November to nearly 6.5 today, and it is said to command as much as 7 to the dollar on the black market. Egypt's central bank has imposed new currency controls: Travelers are prohibited to leave the country with more than $10,000 in cash, and transfers abroad have become more difficult. Some banks are restricting withdrawals of hard currency. 
Economists worry about the increased dollarization of the Egyptian economy - that companies and households will hoard dollars and other hard currencies to secure against the devaluation of the pound. In a nightmare scenario, Egyptians would convert their pounds in droves, driving the currency into an uncontrollable downward spiral and forcing the central bank to spend its dwindling reserves.
Pressure on the pound, as well as being bad news for Egypt's economy generally, has been relentless since the uprising that overthrew Hosni Mubarak in February 2011. Under both the transitional military government and Morsi, the authorities have tried to prevent the currency's value from dropping. While a small slide has been allowed - "a managed float," the central bank calls it - there had been no sudden change until now.
The political battles over the Constitution between Islamists and secularists did not help, but the real trigger for the current pressure on the currency was Morsi's panicked behavior. A month ago, just one day after his government announced tax increases - a key condition for receiving some $4.8 billion from the International Monetary Fund - Morsi canceled them, claiming that more "social dialogue" on economic reforms was needed first. It seems he was acting under pressure from the Muslim Brotherhood, which wanted to avoid any unpopular measures before the referendum on the Constitution in mid-December.
Whatever the reason, Morsi's announcement forced the government to postpone finalizing the I.M.F. deal. The impact on market confidence in Egypt was immediate: Ratings agencies downgraded Egyptian banks, the local stock market plummeted, and pressure on the pound began to build up. To deflect political blame, Morsi's Freedom and Justice Party pointed the finger at the central bank and the government.
Negotiations with the I.M.F. have resumed since the new Constitution was adopted. An I.M.F. delegation visited Cairo recently, and the Egyptian government now appears eager to conclude the deal and go ahead with at least some tax increases. And it all may happen without the social dialogue Morsi had called for; the I.M.F. is getting impatient. "The I.M.F. needs to have the commitment of the political authorities that can actually endorse the program, own it and propose it to the population as theirs," Christine Lagarde, managing director of the I.M.F., told Reuters on Tuesday. 
The deal still has opponents, mostly people who fear the social costs of economic reform, especially for the poor. But clearly it is necessary for Egypt's economic recovery: Most international aid pledges to Egypt are contingent on I.M.F.-backed reforms taking place. The funds needed over the next few years to get the Egyptian economy back to pre-uprising growth levels of 7 percent and more exceed what even oil-rich Gulf states like Qatar have been giving to Cairo recently.
Morsi seems to have been dragging his feet on the I.M.F. deal less because of any principled opposition to it than for fear of an electoral backlash in forthcoming parliamentary elections. Meanwhile, he is trying to take advantage of concerns about economic and political instability in Egypt to secure concessions on the terms of the agreement. It's a gambit eerily reminiscent of Mubarak's ways.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Fight Prep

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times: 
As Congress girds for the fiscal battles of the coming months, the cadre of business executives and former lawmakers at Fix the Debt have proved to be "the most visible and well-financed advocates for reining in the federal deficit." But Nicholas Confessore writes that their private interests threaten to clash with their public goals, as many of them have deep ties to the financial industry or are lobbyists or executives for major companies acting aggressively to steer the tax code to favor their balance sheets. 
President Obama is expected to nominate his chief of staff,, Jacob J. Lew, to replace the departing Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner. Jackie Calmes notes that the selection of yet another budget negotiator for the financial team completes a shift from emphasis on a global financial crisis to the continuing budget fights with Republicans in Congress. However, when combined with the departures of Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, it also highlights a dearth of female advisers surrounding Mr. Obama as he enters his second term.
Would the president use a penny-size platinum coin minted with "In God We Trust" and a 1 with 12 zeros behind it to avoid a debt-ceiling standoff with Congressional Republicans? Probably not, Annie Lowrey writes, but Washington is having a field day imagining that Mr. Geithner would trot out the trillion-dollar coin to wipe out a chunk of the country's debt obligations as one of his final acts in office.
In the unlikely absence of a standoff, maybe Congress could get around to revising the tax code. The ombudsman of the Internal Revenue Service is calling for Congress to simplify the behemoth system of rules, blaming it for lost revenues and unneeded stress to taxpayers, Catherine Rampell reports.
 Happening in Washington: 
Economic reports scheduled for release Thursday include weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m., followed at 10 by weekly mortgage rates, wholesale trade for November, and job openings and labor turnover for November.
At 9, Thomas J. Donohue, the chief executive of the United States Chamber of Commerce, will deliver his annual speech on the state of American business.
At 5 p.m., Mrs. Clinton and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan will meet and have a working dinner.
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will meet with hunters, gun owners and entertainment executives in a second day of meetings on gun control.

HEADLINE: More On a Quest for Common Ground on Climate Change

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: An animated view of the common ground that's possible on climate change between people with different politics. 

 BODY:
In 2011, I wrote about efforts by two scientists with different political orientations to identify common ground in weighing risks posed by global warming driven by greenhouse gases. The scientists were Peter C. Frumhoff, an ecologist who directs science and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, and Kerry Emanuel, a veteran climate and hurricane researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (Emanuel has a new edition of his short everyman's guide to global warming, by the way.)
Now, with the help of the artist Nathan Shields (his company is draw4.us), they've translated their thoughts into a whiteboard animation titled "It's Time to Find Common Ground for Our Common Atmosphere": 
Watch on Youtube.
Aaron Huertas, the lead spokesman for the scientists' group, told me the video was inspired by my 2011 post, which was titled, "Scientists With Different Politics Speak With One Voice on Climate."
Just to be clear, while Emanuel was long a registered Republican (he switched to independent status last spring, he told me) and Frumhoff is straight from Central Casting if you're seeking a scientist who's also a liberal Democrat, they have both long been calling for action to curb emissions of greenhouse gases. So this video hardly represents some "Hannity and Colmes" style collaboration (that one didn't do too well, I recall).
But I still think their message is well worth conveying in this new medium. There's nothing more conservative than the conservation of finite resources. 
Their notion that the atmosphere is the ultimate global commons echoes Matthew Fontaine Maury, the American oceanographer who once wrote this line, which I cited in my 1992 global warming book and many times since: 
It is only the girdling encircling air, that flows above and around all, that makes the whole world kin.
Just to be clear, I think it'll be far easier to find common ground on climate-smart energy choices by focusing directly on energy steps that make sense for both environmental and economic reasons and that have been shown to have incredibly wide support. That's the most important message I've taken from the continuing "Six Americas" surveys done by researchers at Yale University and George Mason University. Click through the three slides below -- which I titled "Energy Agreement Hidden by Climate Disputes" -- to see what I mean:
 Energy Agreement Hidden by Climate Disputes from Andrew Revkin
For those who prefer text to video, here's the Union of Concerned Scientists transcript of the statements by Emanuel and Frumhoff:
 Common Ground, Common Atmosphere 
KERRY: One of us has usually voted for Republicans.
PETER: The other, for Democrats.
KERRY: But as scientists, we share a deep conviction that leaders of both parties must speak to the reality and the risks of human-caused climate change, and commit themselves to finding bipartisan solutions.
PETER: Scientists have known for more than 100 years that the carbon dioxide in our atmosphere traps heat. And today we know that the excess carbon dioxide accumulating in the atmosphere from human activity -- like burning coal and oil and clearing forests -- is altering our climate.
KERRY: It's a conclusion based on established physics and on evidence gathered from satellite data, ancient ice cores, temperature stations, and fossilized trees and corals.
PETER: And it's a conclusion affirmed by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, which was established by President Abraham Lincoln to advise our nation's leaders on matters of science.
KERRY: Unfortunately, as the scientific understanding of climate change has advanced, our nation hasn't risen to the challenge.
PETER: Science tells us that the extent and severity of climate change faced by our children's generation depends on the hard choices we must make today. Political leadership is about ensuring that we adults face up to this task.
KERRY: President Obama leads a nation increasingly affected by climate change. He commands a Pentagon that calls climate change a national security threat and presides over federal scientists already working to help states and cities prepare.
PETER: Leaders of both parties need to take seriously what science tells us.
KERRY: Please pass this video along to friends and family and to at least one person who might have a political view different from your own.
PETER: Then call on your Members of Congress to get to work building bipartisan solutions to climate change.
KERRY: For the sake of our common atmosphere
PETER: It's time to find common ground.

PETER: And it's a conclusion affirmed by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, which was established by President Abraham Lincoln to advise our nation's leaders on matters of science.
KERRY: Unfortunately, as the scientific understanding of climate change has advanced, our nation hasn't risen to the challenge.
PETER: Science tells us that the extent and severity of climate change faced by our children's generation depends on the hard choices we must make today. Political leadership is about ensuring that we adults face up to this task.
KERRY: President Obama leads a nation increasingly affected by climate change. He commands a Pentagon that calls climate change a national security threat and presides over federal scientists already working to help states and cities prepare.
PETER: Leaders of both parties need to take seriously what science tells us.
KERRY: Please pass this video along to friends and family and to at least one person who might have a political view different from your own.
PETER: Then call on your Members of Congress to get to work building bipartisan solutions to climate change.
KERRY: For the sake of our common atmosphere
PETER: It's time to find common ground.

Museums
Asia Society and Museum: 'Bound Unbound: Lin Tianmiao' (through Jan. 27) Lin Tianmiao is one of a rare kind in China, where she lives: a nationally and internationally renowned female artist. This museumwide show presents installations that have not been widely seen. Influenced by American artists like Kiki Smith, Louise Bourgeois and Ann Hamilton -- who made the female body and traditional women's occupations hot topics during the 1990s when Ms. Lin was living in New York -- these productions are not particularly original. But they are striking for their surrealistic theatricality and labor intensive craft. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Ken Johnson) 
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Mickalene Thomas: Origin of the Universe' (through Jan. 20) This invigorating exhibition is dominated by big, brash collage-like paintings, thick with color and studded with rhinestones that depict cacophonous landscapes, spatially skewed interiors and, best of all, images of imperious black women among swaths of brightly patterned fabrics. Building on Conceptual identity art, borrowing from art history and 1970s blaxploitation extravagance, they subvert prevailing notions of beauty and taste and subvert the male gaze while offering resounding proof that the political, not only the personal, can also be stunningly pictorial. Bravo. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
Brooklyn Museum: 'Go: a community-curated open studio project' (through Feb. 24) Inspired by ArtPrize, an art competition in Grand Rapids, Mich., that awards money to artists based on votes by the public, and by local open-studios programs, the Brooklyn Museum created a contest in which the award was a spot in this exhibition. More than 1,800 artists registered with the museum; visitors went out to their studios and voted; and the Top 10 artists were whittled down to 5 by Brooklyn Museum curators. The results are less than stellar. ''Go'' has not unearthed any hidden masters of the borough, but it does raise questions about who should choose what appears in museums and what constitutes ''great'' art. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Materializing ''Six Years'': Lucy R. Lippard and the Emergence of Conceptual Art' (through Feb. 17) This big, intellectually enthralling exhibition of Conceptual works from the 1960s and early '70s is not a conventional museum period survey. Rather, it approximates how the rise of Conceptualism was seen while it was happening by one person: the curator, critic and writer Lucy R. Lippard, who was an extraordinarily energetic participant in and promoter of a trend that brought us the triumph of mind over matter in art. Anyone who wants art to be radically defiant of the market-driven system must see it. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Frick Collection: 'Mantegna to Matisse: Master Drawings From the Courtauld Gallery' (through Jan. 27) This show of 58 drawings from a London museum and institute of art history covers a lot of ground -- namely, the Renaissance, Baroque and Modern periods. The installation, which spills over from the lower-level galleries into the Cabinet Room off the lobby, encourages much back-and-forth between works of similar subject or virtuosity; Pontormo is paired with Michelangelo, Rubens with Rembrandt, and Goya with Daumier. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Frick Collection: 'Vincent van Gogh's Portrait of a Peasant (Patience Escalier)' (through Jan. 20) ''You'll shortly make the acquaintance of Mr. Patience Escalier -- a sort of man with a hoe, an old Camargue oxherd,'' Vincent van Gogh wrote to his brother, Theo, from the Provençal city of Arles in 1888. His bracingly vivid portrait the same year of this local character, with his grizzled beard and steely blue eyes offset by a ruddy complexion and bright yellow hat, normally resides at the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, Calif. But for the next few months it can be seen at the Frick as part of an exchange program between the two museums. Installed on a temporary wall in the Oval Room, it shocks the neighboring Whistler portraits with its feral gaze and forthright celebration of hard labor. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'Picasso Black and White' (through Jan. 23) Billed as the first monochromatic look at Picasso's whole career, this exhibition is as eye-opening as it is elegant. That's especially true among the later works on the upper ramps, which push well past the obligatory Neo-Classicism and Analytic Cubism into bracingly sensual explorations of the figure, strident political cries de coeur à la Guernica, and winking homages to Delacroix and Velázquez. Also notable: Thirty eight of the show's 118 works have never been exhibited in this country, and 5, among them the sharply angular ''Bust of a Woman With a Hat'' (1939), have never been on view publicly. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'African Art, New York, and the Avant-Garde' (through April 14) Timed to the centennial of the Armory Show of 1913, this exhibition tells the story of African art's debut in cutting-edge New York museums and galleries with exceptional candor. It makes clear that early-20th-century Americans received Modern art and African art as a single import, derived from French and Belgian colonies, distilled in Paris and presented on these shores by a few tastemaking dealers and collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'George Bellows' (through Feb. 18) Organized by the National Gallery in Washington, this exhibition starts strong with the lush early paintings of New York City and its residents for which Bellows is justifiably well known. It then devotes more than half its space to a disorganized reprise of his restless but steady artistic decline, which ended with his death in 1925 at 42 from a ruptured appendix. It does little to clarify his achievement, partly because of the short shrift given to his plein air oil studies and late landscape paintings. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Extravagant Inventions: The Princely Furniture of the Roentgens' (through Jan. 27) The first in-depth survey of the brilliant artistry and engineering of Abraham and David Roentgen, a father-and-son team of genius German cabinetmakers, features roll-top desks, writing tables, chairs and clocks. Rife with intricate inlay and marquetry, gilded mounts and hidden compartments revealed by the touch of a button, these objects were among the supreme status symbols of late-18th-century Europe. Video animations show seven of the desks in action. The show is, over all, a stealth blockbuster. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Faking It: Manipulated Photography Before Photoshop' (through Jan. 27) This absorbing, often amusing exhibition offers abundant evidence that photographers have been cheating since shortly after the medium's invention almost two centuries ago. It features prints dating from 1846 to the early '90s made from altered negatives; seemingly realistic images made by piecing together two or more negatives; hand-colored black-and-white prints; Surrealistic montages; and conceptual confections contesting the ideal of photographic truth. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Matisse: In Search of True Painting' (through March 17) This stunning exhibition skims across the great French modernist's long, productive career with a mere 49 stellar, often pivotal paintings arranged in pairs or groups according to subject. Examining his penchant for working in series and copying his own canvases, they shed new light on the arduous evolution of Matisse's seemingly effortless art, forming one of the most thrillingly instructive exhibitions about the artist, or painting in general, that you may ever see. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; MoMA PS1: 'Huma Bhabha: Unnatural Histories' (through April 1) In this midcareer survey, long-enduring forms from the ancient world lend some gravity to the throwaway materials that are now commonplace in contemporary sculpture. You could also say that the precariousness of recent assemblage and installation art haunts Ms. Bhabha's monstrous, totemic figures, which are typically made of Styrofoam, clay, rubber, wood scraps and wire mesh; either way, the juxtaposition is arresting. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; MoMA PS1: 'Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt: Tender Love Among the Junk' (through April 1) Mr. Lanigan-Schmidt makes luminous art out of trash: candy wrappers, cling wrap, reflective plastics, aluminum foil, plastic bottles, beer cans and too many other kinds of cheap refuse to list. As this four-decade retrospective reveals, his devotion to his materials and hobbylike processes has yielded an oeuvre of transcending beauty, eroticized religiosity and poignant autobiography. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Johnson)
MoMA PS1: 'Now Dig This! Art & Black Los Angeles 1960-1980' (through March 11) This exhibition of works by black artists who lived and worked in Los Angeles during a time of revolutionary changes happening in art and society had its debut at the Hammer Museum last year as part of the citywide extravaganza ''Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980.'' Focusing mainly on assemblage, the show includes pieces by Melvin Edwards, Betye Saar, David Hammons and nearly 30 others. It contributes a valuable chapter to the American art history of the last 50 years. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
Morgan Library & Museum: 'Fantasy and Invention: Rosso Fiorentino and Sixteenth-Century Florentine Drawing' (through Feb. 3) With just under 30 works, including an unfinished Rosso painting on loan from the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, a Rosso drawing from the Metropolitan Museum and a smattering of drawings and letters by other Italian masters in the Morgan's collection, this small exhibition is a fine little introduction to the eccentricities of Florentine Mannerism and to one of the style's quirkiest practitioners, who was lauded by Vasari as ''bold and well grounded in draftsmanship, graceful in manner, sublime in the highest flights of the imagination.'' 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Museum of Arts and Design: 'Doris Duke's Shangri-La: Architecture, Landscape and Islamic Art' (through Feb. 17) The Honolulu estate known as Shangri La is a masterpiece of refined eclecticism. Doris Duke, the owner, referred to it as a ''Spanish-Moorish-Persian-Indian complex.'' Whatever you call it, it looks magnificent in this show and the accompanying book. Both combine sparkling new color shots of the home and gardens taken by Tim Street-Porter; architectural documents and vintage photographs; pieces of the collection; and projects by contemporary artists who had residencies at Shangri La (which has served, since Duke's death in 1993, as the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art). 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Artist's Choice: Trisha Donnelly' (through April 8) The 10th artist invited to select an exhibition from the Modern's collection does the series proud. Installed in three far-flung galleries within the museum's vaunted painting and sculpture collection, her effort disturbs the march of masterworks by concentrating on photographs, drawings and other works on paper as well as several kinds of design. At every turn it asks what is art, who is an artist and what makes for greatness? (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Born Out of Necessity' (through Jan. 28) The title may or may not have an extra preposition, but the show itself is a fascinating array of recent acquisitions that have a fairly direct bearing on quality of life or actual survival. They range from classic (the 1908 Dixie cup) to cutting edge; cover both analog and digital; and include the tiny (the latest in earplugs) and the quite large (the 1952 United States Army Jeep). Whether born ''of'' or ''out of'' necessity, the displays attest to human ingenuity responding to human need. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Inventing Abstraction: 1910-1925' (through April 15) This dizzying yet magisterial cornucopia covers a period when abstraction was the holy grail of modern art, feverishly pursued in numerous new styles and all mediums by creative types in Europe, Russia and elsewhere. Displaying some 350 artworks by 84 artists, including works of poetry, music and dance, it portrays with new accuracy the advent of western abstraction as a grand enterprise carried out by a heady, sometimes volatile mix of personalities, ideas and mediums. Bravi. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Inventing Abstraction: 1910-1925' (through April 15) The pursuit of the holy grail of early modernism at its most feverish is presented as a multiple-medium, multinational effort in this dizzying, magisterial cornucopia. The 350-plus works by 84 artists encompass painting, sculpture, music, poetry, dance, film and photography; alternate between the tentative and the prescient; and capture something of both the terrors and thrills of the project, with clusters of paintings by Kazimir Malevich and Piet Mondrian among the high points. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Edvard Munch: The Scream' (through April 29) A version of Edvard Munch's ''Scream'' is on view at this museum for the next six months, having come almost straight from the auction block. Protected by a Plexiglas box, like the Mona Lisa, it has been given a prominent perch opposite van Gogh's ''Starry Night'' in the fifth-floor painting and sculpture galleries. There is talk of timed tickets. But if you can put up with all the pageantry, you'll have a rare chance to get acquainted with ''The Scream'' in person and in context. The museum has built a mini-exhibition around the work, surrounding it with Munch paintings and prints that amplify its motifs and mood. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'New Photography 2012' (through Feb. 4) In her pellucid photographs, Anne Collier contemplates old record album covers and an Edward Weston photograph in an old MoMA date book. In montages by Michele Abeles we see the bodies of naked men through spaces between grids and stripes cut from other printed materials. Shirana Shahbazi's abstractions picture alluring colors and light of photography itself. Zoe Crosher recycles amateur snapshots by a woman who worked as an escort in the 1960s, '70s and '80s. The two members of a team known as Birdhead use nondigital cameras and black-and-white film to shoot scenes in their hometown, Shanghai. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Alina Szapocznikow: Sculpture Undone, 1955-1972' (through Jan. 28) This small but intense exhibition is the museum's second show of an Eastern European female artist in less than a year, following the Conceptual performance and photography of ''Sanja Ivekovic: Sweet Violence.'' For many Americans it will be their first look at Ms. Szapocznikow's precocious Pop-Surrealist sculpture, much of which parallels work made on these shores by Lynda Benglis, Eva Hesse and Hannah Wilke. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Tokyo 1955-1970: A New Avant-Garde' (through Feb. 25) Modernist art, insurgent and utopian, ignited like a firecracker cluster in cities across the globe in the early 20th century, and Tokyo was one of them. Rising from the ashes after World War II, it produced huge amounts of new art, feisty, fantastic, often politically subversive. And a wave of it comes surging out at you like a blast of sound -- half noise, half music -- in this surprising exhibition made up of loans from Japan and little-seen material from MoMA's collection. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Holland Cotter)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Performing Histories (1)' (through March 11) An awareness of the uprisings, protests, occupations and revolutions erupting around the globe is present in ''Performing Histories (1),'' a show of video, film and photographic work recently acquired by MoMA. Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu's film ''Dialogue With Ceausescu'' (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler's ''She Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day'' (1976) and Sharon Hayes's four-channel video ''The Interpreter Project'' (2001). Andrea Fraser's two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Schwendener)
New Museum: 'Judith Bernstein: ''HARD'' ' (through Jan. 20) Ms. Bernstein is well-known for the giant drawings of phallic screws that she began making in the late 1960s. Two from the '70s are the main attractions in this much-abbreviated, 40-year retrospective, her first show in a museum. In these bravura performances of draftsmanship on vast sheets of paper, the screws extend horizontally as if they were drilling tunnels through mountains. Rendered by sweeping strokes of charcoal, they appear wildly hairy and scarily purposeful: biomechanical monstrosities of testosterone-fueled fury. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; New Museum: 'Rosemarie Trockel: A Cosmos' (through Jan. 20) This elegant, mind-expanding exhibition sidesteps the standard retrospective format and a linear, canonical version of art history. Ms. Trockel emphasizes her recent work in numerous mediums -- most impressively ceramics, photography and drawing, sharing the spotlight with outsider artists, botanical illustrations and zoological models and even natural specimens. The result is completely entrancing, a celebration of nature and also of human nature -- its curiosity, ingenuity and yearning for expression -- encapsulated by the artist's magnanimous vision. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)
New-York Historical Society: 'John Rogers: American Stories' (through Feb. 18) The sculptor John Rogers (1829-1904) was the Norman Rockwell of his time. For a few decades following the Civil War, his lively, anecdotal, figurative tableaus known as Rogers Groups sold by the tens of thousands to middle- and upper-middle-class folks for about $15 apiece. Including examples of the technically impressive bronze masters from which the multiples were cast in plaster, this exhibition showcases an artist who was as remarkable for his entrepreneurial savvy as for his idealistic vision of life in America. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Rubin Museum of Art: 'Radical Terrain' (through April 29) The third and last of three beautifully produced, back-to-back mini-surveys in the series Modernist Art From India, this exhibition combines landscape painting done in India in the years following independence in 1947 with recent work by young artists -- some South Asian, most not -- that corresponds to or comments on the older art. Small in size and unfamiliar in content, the show is large with history. Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; South Street Seaport Museum: 'Compass: Folk Art in Four Directions' (through Feb. 3) The American Folk Art Museum presents some 200 works from its unparalleled collection in this beautifully orchestrated exhibition. Paintings, sculpture, textiles, scrimshaw, painted furniture and much, much more are arrayed along themes that reflect the history of Lower Manhattan -- seafaring, commerce, social life and that all-important factor, the weather -- but not too tightly. Poetic license is taken, yielding an intricate constellation of connected artworks, histories and concerns that highlights one of the city's great treasures. 12 Fulton Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 748-8600, southstreetseaportmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Fore' (through March 10) In 2001 the Studio Museum in Harlem opened a dynamite group exhibition called ''Freestyle,'' which turned out to be the first in a series of shows introducing emerging artists of African-American descent. In the latest edition, ''Fore,'' organized by three young staff curators, Lauren Haynes, Naima J. Keith and Thomas J. Lax, covers the waterfront in terms of media, which it samples and mixes with turntablist flair, and in its contents, ranging from abstract to personal to political, sometimes combining all three. Firelei Báez, Sadie Barnette, Crystal Z. Campbell, Zachary Fabri, Yashua Klos, Akosua Adoma Owusu, Valerie Piraino and Nikki Pressley are some of the names to look for. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Richard Artschwager!' (through Feb. 3) Mr. Artschwager had his first career retrospective at the Whitney Museum in 1988, and now, at 88, he is having his second. Much of the work -- the furniturelike sculptures covered with wood-grain Formica and the paintings that appeared to be done with smudged soot -- is familiar. His recent portraits of George W. Bush and Osama bin Laden, and his high-color landscapes of the American Southwest are not. An installation of his famous ''blps'' (pronounced blips), abstract lozenge forms, usually black and shaped like the uprights in an exclamation point, is in place on and around the High Line near the site of the Whitney's future home at Gansevoort and Washington Streets. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Trisha Baga: Plymouth Rock 2' (through Jan. 27) ''Plymouth Rock 2,'' a single-room installation by a young up-and-comer consists of seemingly random video scenes projected on one wall and banal, shadow-casting objects on the floor. Images of heaving ocean swells shot from a swimmer's point of view and of a beachcomber with a metal detector imply some kind of quest like a search for the Holy Grail, which turns out to be Plymouth Rock, the boulder whereon, legend has it, the Pilgrims first alighted in the New World, now a sadly nondescript tourist attraction. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Sinister Pop' and 'Dark and Deadpan: Pop in TV and the Movies' (through March 31) The dark and truculent mood of this collection show is conversant with recent presentations of Warhol's death-and-disaster paintings, but the curators make plenty of room for other artists (including photographers). The point is not to cast a pall over Pop as we know it; it's to find common ground between the winking consumerism of early-1960s art and the antiwar, anti-corporate sentiment of work made later in the decade and into the 1970s. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)
Galleries: Uptown
&#x2605; 'Calder: The Complete Bronzes' (through Feb. 9) The ingenious master of spare, levitating modern sculpture in wire, wood and sheet metal turns out to have been almost as adept with the ancient dead-weight staple of bronze, as demonstrated by 35 examples and some dozen plaster models in this eye-opening show. They run the gamut from figurative to abstract; dabble in Surrealism; achieve their own kind of levitation; and delve into art history while enabling the artist to use his hands and amazing tactile sense in a different way. L&M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020, lmgallery.com. (Smith)
Galleries: Chelsea
'Cellblock I' and 'Cellblock II' (through Feb. 2) This pair of strenuously cerebral group shows, both organized by the scholar Robert Hobbs, envision the artwork as a kind of prison (formalist and otherwise). ''Cellblock I,'' in the main gallery, includes large paintings by Peter Halley, plans for underground mazes by Alice Aycock, works from Robert Motherwell's ''Open'' series and Kelley Walker's canvases printed with images of brick walls. The livelier ''Cellblock II,'' in the gallery's new project space down the street, gathers smaller works by some of the same artists in ''Cellblock I,'' along with others like Robert Morris, Bruce Nauman and Nancy Holt. Andrea Rosen, 525 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-6000, andrearosengallery.com. (Rosenberg)
Agnes Denes: 'Sculptures of the Mind: 1968 to Now' (through Jan. 19) By the end of the 1960s, art's final frontier was mind itself, and Agnes Denes has been one of its brainiest and far-ranging explorers. This much abridged retrospective includes a miniature tableau of skeletons in philosophical conversation, diagrams of a system of symbolic logic that Ms. Denes thought up, and photographs of outdoor works like the wheat field she planted on a parcel of landfill near the World Trade Center in 1982. Leslie Tonkonow, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-8450, tonkonow.com. (Johnson)
&#x2605; 'Carroll Dunham' (through Jan. 19) All nine of Mr. Dunhams big, comical and exhilarating paintings represent landscapes resembling a South Pacific paradise, with chunky, fat-leafed trees and colorful, spongy flowers. Six feature the figure of a naked woman of heroic proportions with chalk-white skin and untamed black hair drawn in thick black lines, bathing, swimming and cavorting in this Edenic setting. She might be the artist's own inner wild woman. Gladstone, 515 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9300, gladstonegallery.com. (Johnson)
Chris McCaw: 'Marking Time' (through Jan. 19) In Chris McCaw's haunting yet matter-of-fact photographs, the sun has burned crispy-edged lines across the skies of spectral land- and seascapes. Mr. McCaw constructs his own large-format cameras, which he equips with military surveillance lenses. Traveling to remote places, he exposes sheets of photo paper for durations from 15 minutes to 24 hours. The lens concentrates the sun into an inflammatory dot, which cuts through the paper like a welder's torch slicing through steel.

John A. Parks: 'Paint and Memory' (through Jan. 19) The strange, seemingly innocent paintings that dominate this show are small, based on the artist's childhood memories and painted with his fingers. The loosely Pointillist, somewhat Vuillardian hazes of color, light and form that result demarcate trees, gardens, brick buildings, puffy clouds and, above all, scrambling children, whose feral energy and natural subversiveness are vividly conveyed. The distinction between illustration and painting is rendered moot by the teeming quality of both surface and subject. 532 Gallery Thomas Jaeckel, 532 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (917) 701-3338, 532gallery.com.

'The Islands of Benoît Mandelbrot: Fractals, Chaos, and the Materiality of Thinking' (through Jan. 27) This heady, compact exhibition presents efforts from the 1960s and '70s to visualize a species of mathematical formulas known as fractals, a term coined by the mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot (1924-2012). The visual impact of the computer printouts, short films, 3-D models, letters, sketches and Polaroids on display is low, but the philosophical import is great considering the enormous advances in scientific imaging technology that have happened since those early days. Bard Graduate Center, 18 West 86th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3023, bgc.bard.edu. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info.

&#x2605; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden: 'Ai Weiwei: According to What?' (through Feb. 24) As seen in its first American survey, the work of the lionhearted Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, is no match for his prominent role as a human rights advocate. The sculptures and installation pieces too often adhere to the fashionable international genre of handsome, Conceptually generated artworks. Explanatory labels do much of the heavy lifting, along with historically-charged materials and objects, like Chinese antique furniture and wood from destroyed Qing dynasty temples. The artist's photographs and videos suggest that his documentary work may be best.

&#x2605; Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art: 'Oh, Canada' (through April 8) Seesawing between bigness and intimacy, the personal and the communal, this 62-artist survey of contemporary art in the Great White North may tell you more about Canada's identity crisis than it does about Canadian art. A sense of place, if not nationhood, does emerge in stark photographs of Newfoundland by Ned Pratt and Kim Morgan's hanging latex cast of a lighthouse on Prince Edward Island. Elsewhere, cartoonlike pencil drawings by Annie Pootoogook and Shuvinai Ashoona depict contemporary Inuit life and the artist Amalie Atkins stars in a prairie fairy tale involving musical wolves and bears with golden teeth. 87 Marshall Street, North Adams, (413) 662-2111, massmoca.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Dancing Around the Bride: Cage, Cunningham, Johns, Rauschenberg and Duchamp' (through Jan. 21) The Philadelphia show, an ensemble performance composed of entirely stars, with an elusive sun, Marcel Duchamp, at the center, focuses on a transformative moment in American modernism when a heroic view of art ended, and another view, cool, wry and brainy, began. In Manhattan, the most radical of all those stars, John Cage, gets a solo show of his lambent late watercolors in honor of his 2012 centenary year. (That Manhattan show, ''John Cage: The Sight of Silence'' at the National Academy Museum, runs through Jan. 13.) Benjamin Franklin Parkway at 26th Street, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; The Walters Art Museum: 'Revealing the African Presence in Renaissance Europe' (through Jan. 21) This history-rattling exhibition is a visual gift, with marvelous things by artists familiar and revered -- Durer, Rubens, Veronese -- along with images most of us never knew existed. Together, they map a history of art, politics and race that few museums have addressed in full-dress style. Like the best scholarship, the Walters show, organized by Joaneath Spicer, the museum's curator of Renaissance and Baroque art, is as much about questions as answers. It takes a prized piece of art history, one polished to a glow by generations of attention, and turns it in an unexpected direction, so it catches the searching, scouring rays of new investigative light. (From Feb. 16 to June 9 it will be at the Princeton University Art Museum in Princeton, N.J.) 600 North Charles Street, Baltimore, (410) 547-9000, thewalters.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Yale University Art Gallery (continuing) In a museum era dominated by vying forces of bad economics and compulsive building, it's a miracle when something comes out right, which makes the opening of the splendidly renovated and expanded Yale University Art Gallery a happy event. The angels of art, design and budgetary planning were on duty. Everything worked. The country's oldest university art museum has arrived at a kind institutional ideal of opposites in balance: an encyclopedic teaching museum, big enough to get lost in, small enough for intimate art encounters. New galleries of Indo-Pacific art are a particular attraction, but so are other collections, including one of the countries premier holdings in American art and a small, matchless display of very early Italian Renaissance painting. A special exhibition, ''Societe Anonyme: Modernism for America,'' made up of Yale-owned material, is on view through July 14. 1111 Chapel Street, New Haven, (203) 432-0600, artgallery.yale.edu.

Last Chance
American Folk Art Museum: 'Foiled: Tinsel Painting in America' (closes on Sunday) Might tinsel painting, a decorative and resourceful form of picture making that was all the rage during the second half of the 19th century, be due for a comeback? Possibly, to judge from this cluttered but charming show, which seems tailor-made for the Etsy set. It includes some 150 works made by placing crinkly metallic foil under a protective surface of reverse-painted glass, most of them by unidentified artists. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Trisha Baga: 'The Biggest Circle' (closes on Saturday) Trisha Baga creates transporting, frowzy installations of video projections, paintings, sculptures and scattered objects. For one, you don 3-D glasses and headphones, through which you hear the popular art historian Sister Wendy lecturing on canonical painters while shifting configurations of vividly dimensional abstract shapes play on the wall. ''Bag's Circle'' centers on a floor-to-ceiling projection of the revolving, circular mouth of a much-used paper bag, a symbol, perhaps, of a wide-open mind. Greene Naftali, 508 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 463-7770, greenenaftaligallery.com. (Johnson)
Bob Dylan: 'Revisionist Art' (closes on Saturday) Bob Dylan may be a genius but he's no polymath. His music is great. His attempts at visual art have gone from bad to worse. From paintings based on photographs, he has turned to full-on appropriation with silk-screened works that rejigger the words and pictures on the covers of magazines like Time, Life, Playboy and Rolling Stone. Alternately obscure or obvious, these attempts at social satire suggest that the line between naïveté and cynicism is sometimes very thin. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313, gagosian.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; 'Keltie Ferris' (closes on Saturday) Keltie Ferris's big, scintillating paintings feel fresh, direct and very much of this moment. That's partly because they seem to picture a kind of visual experience that did not exist before the advent of digital forms of visualization. Made with lively immediacy on canvases up to nearly nine feet in their longest dimensions, they give the impression of computer-screen imagery breaking up into pixels and blurs. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 744-7400, miandn.com. (Johnson)
Guggenheim Museum: 'Gabriel Orozco: Asterisms' (closes on Sunday) For one-half of this two-part exhibition, Mr. Orozco and his team collected about 1,200 pieces of flotsam and jetsam that washed up on the beach of a nature preserve in Mexico. All are displayed by type in a color-coordinated rectangle on the floor along with framed grids of photographs of each item. A playing field on Pier 40 in Manhattan was similarly combed for detritus. The two presentations resemble exhibitions in a natural history museum. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Johnson)
Alicja Kwade: 'The Heavy Weight of Light' (closes on Saturday) Elegantly understated works by this Berlin artist are as much thought experiments as sculptures. A folding screen of clear glass panels with electric globe lights on the floor on either side becomes a puzzle about perceptions and reflections. Clocks on the walls run faster and slower than normal. Pieces of pipe and lumber apparently have become rubberized. It gives pause to consider a world so arbitrarily variable. Harris Lieberman, 508 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-1290, harrislieberman.com. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Designing Nature: The Rinpa Aesthetic in Japanese Art' (closes on Sunday) Have any artists ever, anywhere, caught the hello-ness of spring and the farewell-ness of autumn more sweetly and sharply than the Rimpa painters of Japan? Two shimmering fall exhibitions -- this show is running in conjunction with ''Silver Wind: The Arts of Sakai Hoitsu (1761-1828)'' at Japan Society -- argue persuasively, that no, no artists ever have. Together the exhibitions add up to one of the largest Rimpa displays seen outside of Japan in years, with the Met's show giving us a broader view of the style. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; National Academy Museum: 'John Cage: the Sight of Silence' (closes on Sunday) This solo show of John Cage's lambent late watercolors, produced in the decade or so before his death in 1992, is a superb, late addition to the 2012 Cage centenary year. It's a sort of companion to the Philadelphia Museum of Art's ''Dancing Around the Bride: Cage, Cunningham, Johns, Rauschenberg and Duchamp,'' which focuses on a transformative moment in American modernism when a heroic view of art ended, and another view, cool, wry and brainy, began. (The Philadelphia show runs through Jan. 21.) 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Cotter)
National Gallery of Art: 'Roy Lichtenstein: A Retrospective' (closes on Sunday) The first major survey of this Pop artist's career work since his death, at 73, in 1997, is a big show and has some slow spots, but on the whole it moves right along. As always, Lichtenstein's large-featured images, with their Ben-Day dot patterns; thick, black contours; and flat, bright colors are almost ergonomically comfortable to the eye. On the National Mall, between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Cotter)
&#x2605; 'Charles Ray' (closes on Saturday) This striking show features the sculptor's latest forays into post-Conceptual realism, namely two male nudes -- one standing and one crouching -- and a clothed, homeless woman sleeping on a bench. Oddly luminous, finely detailed, 10 percent larger than life and carved by computer-driven machines in solid stainless steel, they form a beautifully spare arrangement and a cat's cradle of ricocheting ideas that both update and disrupt longstanding sculptural motifs, techniques and traditions. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Rubin Museum of Art: 'Candid: The Lens and Life of Homai Vyarawalla' (closes on Monday) The Indian photojournalist Homai Vyarawalla (1913-2012) was on the spot time and again to record the history of modern South Asia being made. This small, evocative, event-filled retrospective catches highlights of her career, including her coverage of Mohandas Gandhi's funeral; important events in the career of the charismatic Jawaharlal Nehru; and visits from Nikita Khrushchev, Ho Chi Minh and Jacqueline Kennedy. As one of the few female photographers in the Indian press corps in her day, Ms. Vyarawalla was a pioneer; in 1970 she abruptly put down her camera and disappeared until her recent rediscovery by younger peers. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; 'Ed Ruscha' (closes on Saturday) Derived from a larger exhibition that appeared at the Kunsthaus Bregenz in Austria in the fall, this reading-themed show includes three marvelous new ''vanitas'' paintings that subject a blank, open book to the ravages of time. Also here are found-object works made by scratching and bleaching books, and painted works that foil or assault would-be readers with meaningless palindromes, redacted texts and profane titles. Mr. Ruscha, unlike other artists of his generation, does not seem inclined to brood over the death of print; if anything, he is cracking wise at its funeral. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1111, gagosian.com. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; 'Where is Jack Goldstein?' (closes on Tuesday) Jack Goldstein, who killed himself in 2003 when he was 57, was one of contemporary art's mystery men. He made his mark in New York in the late 1970s and 1980s as one of group of artists working with media-inspired imagery. Then in the 1990s, he more or less disappeared, personally and professionally. This show of 13 paintings -- with images lifted from photographs of lightning strikes, unexplained explosions and aerial bombardments -- makes a strong case for a continued interest. Venus Over Manhattan, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 980-0700, venusovermanhattan.com. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Wade Guyton: OS' (closes on Sunday) Something of a rarity this fall season, a beautiful, thoughtfully staged show makes a cogent case for a young painter with no overt political ax to grind working in New York. Made entirely with computer, scanner and printer -- the OS refers to computer operating systems -- his works methodically explore the possibilities of technology as just another if especially up-to-date paintbrush. The results are full of glitches and irregularities that provide their own pictorial life, full of the ghosts of painting past and strikingly original. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)

HEADLINE: Back From the Fiscal Abyss, California Balances Its Budget and Aims for a Surplus

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
SACRAMENTO -- California has been Exhibit A for the fiscal upheaval that has rocked states throughout the recession. Year after year, California officials reported bigger and bigger deficits and sought to respond with spending cuts that left the state reeling.
So it was something of a moment when a jaunty Gov. Jerry Brown strode before cameras here on Thursday to present his budget for 2013-14. 
''The deficit is gone,'' Mr. Brown proclaimed, standing in front of an array of that-was-then and this-is-now charts that illustrated what he said were dramatic changes in California's fortunes.
''For the next four years we are talking about a balanced budget,'' he said. ''We are talking about living within our means. This is new. This is a breakthrough.''
Mr. Brown was not just talking about a balanced budget. He projected that the state would begin posting surpluses starting next year, leading to a projected surplus of $21.5 million by 2014, a dramatic turnaround from the deficit of $26 billion -- billion, not million -- he faced when he was elected in 2010.
The governor said California's finances were strong enough that he wanted to put aside a $1 billion reserve fund to guard against future downturns, and included in the budget sharp increases in aid to public schools and the state university system, both targets of big spending cutbacks.
The change in fortunes reflected cuts that were imposed over the past two years, a temporary tax surcharge approved by voters in November that expires in seven years, and a general improvement in the state's economy.
Mr. Brown's balanced budget projection was more optimistic than one put out by an independent legislative watchdog in November, and he pointed to a series of factors, including severe cuts in federal assistance, that could push California back into difficulty.
Yet it was the latest indication that the state appeared to be turning around. Even the less upbeat report by the watchdog group, the Legislative Analyst's Office, said the state was facing a deficit of just $1.9 billion, which seems almost pocket change after the $26 billion projected deficit the state once confronted.
Mr. Brown's news was hailed on both sides of the political aisle. ''This is a proposal that clearly shows California has turned the corner,'' said John A. Pérez, a Democrat who is the State Assembly's speaker.
Connie Conway, the Assembly's Republican leader, said it was ''good news for taxpayers that the state has made progress in getting our financial house in order.''
''But we haven't fully solved our budget problems just yet,'' she said.
The budgetary distress has meant that, for years, the Legislature has battled over what to cut or, in some cases, what kind of maneuvers might be appropriate to avoid cuts. Good news or not, the announcement means that more, albeit different, kinds of battles were in the offing, lawmakers and Mr. Brown said.
Democrats now control two-thirds of the Assembly and Senate, and some of them have talked about restoring at least some of the social service cuts, like dental care for the poor, that were imposed to bring the state to this point, Mr. Brown said he understood the impulse to repair broken social services, but he warned against returning to a boom-and-bust pattern of spending during the good years, only to later struggle through debt.
''We have to live within the means we have; otherwise we get to that situation where you get red ink and you go back to cuts,'' he said. ''I want to avoid the booms and the bust, the borrow and the spend, where we make the promise and then we take back.''
Mr. Brown, who has always presented himself as something of a moderate in his party, suggested that in the months ahead, he would be an enforcer.
''It's very hard to say no,'' Mr. Brown said. ''And that basically is going to be my job.''
On that point, Mr. Brown found an unlikely ally in Ms. Conway. ''Now is not the time to enact massive spending increases that will reverse the progress we've made in reducing the deficit,'' she said.
On another contentious front, while Mr. Brown proposed a significant increase in school spending -- $2.6 billion -- he said he wanted a financing formula that would direct more money to poor students. Lawmakers said that could set off a fight between wealthier and poorer districts.
Mr. Brown, in presenting his budget, suggested that the turnaround should be a rebuke to ''a couple of characters'' who have ''written off California as a failed state,'' a reference to conservative commentators who have, for a year, questioned the state's economic policies and its very future.
Now, Mr. Brown said, he wanted the nation to look to California, and to his example. He promised a combination of ''fiscal discipline and imaginative investment'' to complete the state's restoration.
''I would like to do something that would make California a leader and an example of what America has to do,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Governor of Colorado Calls for Stricter Controls on Gun Sales

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
DENVER -- Nearly six months after a mass shooting in a Colorado movie theater stirred cries for action on gun violence and mental illness, and with last month's killings at Connecticut's Sandy Hook Elementary School still fresh in people's minds, Gov. John W. Hickenlooper of Colorado called Thursday for universal background checks on all gun sales in the state.
''We can learn from tragedy and make changes,'' Mr. Hickenlooper, a Democrat, said in his annual State of the State address at the gold-domed Capitol here. 
After the massacre at Columbine High School in a Denver suburb in 1999, Colorado voters passed regulations requiring background checks at gun shows, which were already required for sales at retail gun stores. But background checks are still not required for individual, private sales of firearms -- estimated by some lawmakers to make up 40 percent of gun sales in the state.
Democrats, who now control both houses of Colorado's Legislature, rose to their feet and applauded the governor's proposal while Republicans sat silently -- an illustration of the divisions in a state that tipped to Democrats in the last two presidential elections, but that still values hunting, sport-shooting and the frontier values wrapped up in gun ownership.
''It is an infringement on our Second Amendment rights,'' said Scott Renfroe, a Republican state senator from Greeley, in northern Colorado. ''You can't make enough laws to stop the criminals. Criminals never obey the law. All you're doing is making it harder for citizens to enjoy the rights they have in this country.''
Mr. Hickenlooper, a former mayor of Denver, geologist and brewpub owner, also reiterated calls for the Legislature to pass civil union legislation for same-sex couples -- a near certainty given the new Democratic majorities in both houses. Last May, Republicans, who then controlled the State House of Representatives, defeated a civil unions bill.
He said that Colorado's economy was back from the depths of the recession, though the state unemployment rate is still 7.7 percent, on par with the national level, according to the most recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. He also said that regulators were working to determine the legal and policy effects of a voter-approved measure that legalized small amounts of marijuana and called for new laws to guard against people who drive while impaired.
In large part, the governor's speech was shaped by a year tainted by tragedy.
He led a moment of silence for the 12 people killed and scores wounded in the Aurora theater shooting in July. He discussed a drought that destroyed fields and crops, and summertime wildfires that charred hundreds of homes and forced thousands of people to flee.
Over the last several months, Mr. Hickenlooper has slowly waded into the emotionally charged debate over gun control.
Immediately after the July 20 shootings, he said the time was not right to talk about passing new gun restrictions, saying in an appearance on ''Meet the Press'' that tougher laws would not have prevented the gunman from carrying out his rampage.
In recent weeks, the governor has proposed significant changes to the state's mental health system, including new mental health centers, a new statewide crisis line and a plan to make mental health records easily available for background checks of potential gun owners. He has also implored lawmakers to begin tackling the debate over gun control.
The governor's call for universal background checks reflects similar ideas put forth by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. after the Connecticut shootings. Mr. Hickenlooper, however, stopped short of proposing a ban on assault weapons or outlawing high-capacity ammunition magazines, which are being pursued in New York.

HEADLINE: Evan Connell, 88, Novelist Of Many Genres, Is Dead

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
Evan S. Connell, a versatile writer praised for his spare portrayal of the frost and repression within a fictional upper-class Midwestern family as well as for his account of the very real and bloody battle that was Custer's Last Stand, was found dead early Thursday in an assisted-living facility in Santa Fe, N.M. He was 88.
Mike Waller, a nephew by marriage, confirmed the death. Mr. Connell, the only son of a physician, grew up in Kansas City, Mo., and moved West as a young man. His interests also traveled. 
His acclaimed and best-selling first novel, ''Mrs. Bridge,'' published in 1959, captured the emotional remoteness of a Kansas City family that was much like the one in which Mr. Connell had been raised.
The novel tells of a young woman named India -- ''it seemed to her her parents must have been thinking of someone else when they named her'' -- who marries a young lawyer named Walter Bridge, who is ''very tall and dignified'' and ''rather stoop-shouldered so that even when he stood erect his coat hung lower in the front than in the back.''
Not long after their marriage, after they are settled into their routines and he has begun sleeping through the night, she frequently awakes and looks at him and ''wonders about the nature of men, doubtful of the future,'' until ''at last there came a night when she shook her husband awake and spoke of her own desire.''
''Affably he placed one of his long white arms around her waist; she turned to him then, contentedly, expectantly, and secure. However nothing else occurred, and in a few minutes he had gone back to sleep.
''This was the night Mrs. Bridge concluded that while marriage might be an equitable affair, love itself was not.''
A decade later Mr. Connell wrote a sequel, ''Mr. Bridge,'' and the two united many years later in ''Mr. and Mrs. Bridge,'' the 1990 Merchant Ivory film starring Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward.
By the time his Kansas City made it to the screen, Mr. Connell had long since become a Westerner. He spent many years in the San Francisco area, where he started writing an essay about Gen. George Armstrong Custer and could not stop. Soon he had a book, or what he thought should be one. It was called ''Son of the Morning Star,'' and initially no publisher would take it. One, North Point Press, which had published ''Mrs. Bridge,'' eventually did, releasing it in 1984, and the book became a surprise best seller.
ABC made a television movie based on the book in 1991.
In 2010, in a review of another author's book on Custer's Last Stand, Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times recalled ''Son of the Morning Star'' as having ''lasting visceral resonance'' and described it as a ''masterpiece.''
In 1985, as ''Son of the Morning Star'' was having a long ride on the best-seller list, Mr. Connell told The Times: ''' There are two explanations for writing the book. Just about all the kids in this country grew up on cowboys and Indians. Maybe now it's 'Star Wars,' but when I grew up in Kansas City, you could send in box tops -- from Quaker Oats, I think -- and get something like a color picture of Sitting Bull.
''As far as this project goes,'' he continued, ''a few years ago I was sitting in a saloon wondering what to write next. I didn't have any ideas for a novel, and for years whenever I couldn't manufacture something successful, I simply worked on a subject that interested me. And the Old West came to mind.''
The subjects that interested him ranged widely, frequently consumed him and rarely rewarded him financially. Until the success of ''Morning Star'' when he was 60, he lived modestly, working at whatever job he could find -- reading meters, delivering packages, accepting résumés at an unemployment office -- so that he could devote himself to writing. He never married and had no children. He spent nearly every day writing or researching his often dense subjects.
He wrote at least 18 books, including collections of poetry and short stories. In ''The Patriot,'' a novel published in 1960, he wrote about a naval aviation student's fears of failure -- including fear of failing his father. Forty years later, in his novel ''Deus Lo Volt!'' he wrote about the brutality of the Christian crusades in the Middle East. Four years after that, in 2004, he published a biography of the Spanish painter Francisco Goya.
Some supporters said the diversity of Mr. Connell's work attested to his skill. Others said his refusal to hew to a few themes or formats -- or perhaps master them -- suggested an incomplete talent.
Reviewing Mr. Connell's last book, the story collection ''Lost in Uttar Pradesh,'' published in 2008, David L. Ulin wrote in The Los Angeles Times that it offered ''an unsettled glimpse of its author, with whom we can't quite come to terms.''
''Brilliant in places, frustrating in others, enigmatic in both content and conception,'' he added, ''it's a vivid metaphor for Connell's career.''
Evan Shelby Connell was born on Aug. 17, 1924, in Kansas City. He graduated from the University of Kansas in 1947. He is survived by a sister, Barbara Zimmerman, two nieces and a nephew.
Asked about his writing in various genres, he told The Kansas City Star in 2010: ''If I find a subject that interests me, then I try to decide how best to write about it. Some things seem better suited for nonfiction, and others seem to be fiction in content or nature. A friend of mine once asked me how I could switch from one to another. I don't regard it as switching; it's just whatever subject happens to interest me, and then I decide how I can best tell the story.''

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Rise Slightly

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week, the Labor Department said on Thursday, but details of the report suggested that the jobs market was continuing to grow at a moderate pace. 
Other data suggested that the economy remained on a steady growth path, with sales at wholesalers rising by the most in more than 18 months in November, keeping inventories balanced.
Initial claims for state jobless benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 371,000. The prior week's figure was revised to show 5,000 fewer applications than previously reported.
''Jobless claims data continue to suggest steady but modest U.S. employment gains,'' said Robert Kavcic, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.
The four-week moving average for new claims, a better measure of labor market trends, increased 6,750 to 365,750, still at a level consistent with steady job gains.
The labor market has been gradually improving, with job gains last year averaging 153,000 a month, little changed from 2011. The unemployment rate ended the year at 7.8 percent.
A separate report from the Commerce Department showed that sales at wholesalers rebounded 2.3 percent in November, the largest gain since March 2011, after falling 0.9 percent in October.
Wholesale inventories rose 0.6 percent after advancing 0.3 percent in October.

HEADLINE: Financial Crisis in the West Bank

 BODY:
The Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the West Bank not under Israeli control, is in financial crisis. Its leaders are finding it increasingly difficult to pay 180,000 government employees, including security forces as well as other civil servants. 
This is not a problem that can be swept under the rug. Whatever the criticisms of the Palestinian Authority, and there are many, Israel has increasingly depended on it to manage and keep the peace in a strategically critical swath of territory. If there is ever to be a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, there has to be a competent government to run a Palestinian state and leaders with whom to make a deal.
The authority, established under the 1993 Oslo Accords that were to lead to a permanent peace agreement, was supposed to be that vehicle. But it is in danger of being so weakened that it would be unable to carry out those responsibilities. Its financial woes are not new. A World Bank report in September said a ''persistent shortfall in donor funding has exacerbated the P.A.'s increasingly difficult fiscal situation, leaving a financing gap of almost $400 million.'' And, in an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday, the Palestinian prime minister, Salam Fayyad, the official in charge of the government bureaucracy, said the problems are worsening and the authority is on the ''verge of being completely incapacitated.''
There are many causes. After Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, won an upgrade for the status of Palestine as a nonmember observer state at the United Nations General Assembly last fall, Israel retaliated by withholding the $100 million in monthly tax revenues it collects on behalf of the Palestinians. Congress, meanwhile, has been withholding more than $450 million in American aid. Last year, Mr. Fayyad said he hoped to improve the authority's financial condition by cutting spending and raising taxes on wealthier Palestinians. The tax plan ran into strong protest and the West Bank's modest economic growth has slowed.
In the recent interview Mr. Fayyad put most of the blame for the authority's financial distress on Arab donors who are ''not fulfilling their pledge of support'' made in Arab League resolutions to make up the money Israel is withholding. This should come as little surprise. Arab leaders have often promised political and economic support for the Palestinians and failed to deliver. Arab foreign ministers are expected to meet Sunday in Cairo to discuss Palestinian issues, including the promised aid. They should affirm their commitment to assist the Palestinian Authority and get the funds flowing.
There are many threats to a two-state solution, including an Israeli government that could become even more hard-line after the Jan. 22 election. But, as the World Bank has said, Mr. Fayyad has made progress in building a functioning government. Israel, the Palestinians, Arab states and the international community all have a stake in making sure that is preserved and strengthened.

HEADLINE: Economists, Consensus and Healthy Debates

BYLINE: By CHRYSTIA FREELAND | REUTERS

 BODY:
SAN DIEGO -- This is a tough time for experts. Empowered by the Internet and embittered by the sour economy, many people doubt the wisdom of expert elites. Journalism sometimes casts further doubt by seeking polarized positions that can draw an attention-grabbing debate, or by taking refuge in he-said-she-said accounts to avoid the harder job of figuring out who's right.
Now one tribe of specialists -- economists -- is striking back. Concerned that the great unwashed have come to see all economic proposals as being equally valid, the University of Chicago Booth School of Business has led an effort to figure out what economists agree on, where they diverge and how certain they are about their views. 
To do that, the Booth school called on reputable economists to join its panel of experts. Each week, the panelists are asked whether they agree or disagree with a particular economic idea.
''Among practicing economists, it is understood that the media and the political process paints economists as more divided than they are,'' Anil K. Kashyap, a professor of economics and finance at the University of Chicago and a leader of the project, explained. ''It is more sensational and maybe makes for better reading to have point-counterpoint. It seemed reasonable to provide some context. There's a lot more settled issues than most people have a sense of.''
Dr. Kashyap cited as an example the gold standard, the monetary system in which the standard economic unit of account is a fixed weight of gold. ''The gold standard is an insane idea,'' he said. ''I don't know of any reputable economist who thinks it is a wise idea, but it got a lot of real political traction.''
Of the Booth panelists, 93 percent disagreed that the gold standard could improve price stability or employment.
But that is an extreme example. A paper presented this week at the annual gathering of the American Economic Association investigated the survey results in greater detail. ''Based on our analysis, we conclude that there is close to full consensus among these panel members when the past economic literature on the question is large,'' the authors of the paper, Roger Gordon and Gordon B. Dahl of the University of California, San Diego, wrote. ''When past evidence is less extensive, differences in opinions do show up.''
But the authors did not find an ideological bias in those disagreements: ''There are certainly some idiosyncratic views expressed, but we found no evidence of different camps.''
Economists, these results suggest, seek to objectively establish the truth and have a widely agreed on body of knowledge about how the economy works. In an age when it can be hard to write the word ''facts'' without reflexively reaching for quotation marks, that is of some comfort. But this picture of consensus among experts comes with a few caveats.
One was articulated by Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize laureate and New York Times columnist who was at the American Economic Association meeting. Mr. Krugman accepted the idea that economists share a wide body of agreed, objective and nonideological knowledge. But he argued that when it comes to one subset of issues -- business-cycle macroeconomics, or how policy should respond to booms and busts -- economists are both divided and biased. That matters, Mr. Krugman rightly pointed out, because outside the academy these are among the economic issues ordinary mortals care about, and fight about, the most.
The second caveat is that consensus may be more fleeting, and therefore less valuable, than the economic high priesthood might like to think. To his credit, Dr. Kashyap revealed two issues on which the economic conventional wisdom, and his own views, have changed since the financial crisis of 2008.
One is currency controls: ''Having watched all this hot money flow into these markets, I am much more sympathetic to the desire to slow things down,'' he said.
The second is whether central bankers should try to pop asset bubbles, an idea toward which Dr. Kashyap has softened. ''I don't think the conventional wisdom was very good on this and I was firmly in the consensus,'' he said.
These shifts suggest that it is worth looking more closely at one clear subgroup among the economists in the University of California study. Dr. Gordon and Dr. Dahl searched for, and failed to detect, ideological bias or even the subtler influence of the very distinct intellectual traditions of top U.S. universities.
But they did pick up a clear difference between men and women. ''Women,'' they write, ''tend to be more cautious in taking a stance.'' For women making their way in the 21st-century world of work, that reticence is mostly a handicap -- a willingness to admit to uncertainty is one reason women are paid less and can find it difficult to break through the glass ceiling.
For the benefit of the community as a whole, though, more female economists may be needed. The quest for objective economic knowledge is surely a good thing, as is the Booth effort to map what economists agree on and where they diverge. But given how profoundly and unexpectedly the world economy collapsed in 2008, maybe a little more womanly humility about that conventional wisdom would be a good thing, too.

HEADLINE: Signs of a Rift in U.K. Coalition

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
LONDON -- A blunt warning from the United States to Prime Minister David Cameron over his plans to loosen ties with the European Union was echoed by Mr. Cameron's coalition partner Thursday, opening new fissures here over Britain's ambivalent attitude toward the 27-nation bloc.
Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister and leader of the Liberal Democrats, said risking Britain's membership in the union was perilous, and he mocked a long-awaited speech on E.U. policy that Mr. Cameron is expected to make in the Netherlands before the end of the month. 
Mr. Clegg, who is a Dutch speaker and whose party supports the European Union, joked that he would be on hand to translate Mr. Cameron's speech ''from double-Dutch to just Dutch.''
Mr. Cameron, whose Conservative lawmakers are increasingly critical of the European Union, has said he wants to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the bloc and seek consent from voters for the outcome of those talks.
Many observers expect him to make an explicit promise of a referendum in his upcoming speech -- in part because Mr. Cameron's party risks losing support to the Independence Party, which wants Britain to leave the union.
The political temperature rose following an unusual, on-the-record intervention on Wednesday, in which a senior United States official argued that Britain was a more useful ally if it remained fully engaged in the European Union. Speaking in London, Philip Gordon, the assistant secretary of state for Europe, added that referendums held by other nations on E.U. agreements ''have sometimes turned countries inward.''
Britons pride themselves on their ''special relationship'' with Washington, and the possibility that it would be weakened by a movement away from the European Union is problematic for Mr. Cameron.
Addressing parliamentary journalists in London, Mr. Clegg -- who has been increasingly willing to take a different stand from Mr. Cameron on a range of issues -- outlined a vision on Europe starkly at odds with that of the prime minister while asserting that such divisions need not affect the overall coherence of the coalition.
That seems plausible, because practical decisions over E.U. relations will probably be delayed until after the next elections, scheduled for 2015.
''When you have got one in 10 jobs in this country, three million people whose jobs are dependent in one way or another on our position as a full and leading member of the world's largest single market,'' said Mr. Clegg, ''you play with that status at your peril.''
''Do we lead or do we hang back in a subsidiary status?'' Mr. Clegg asked. ''Obviously, the Americans and others, quite understandably, say, 'Right, you are a big nation, you've got big horizons, you've got big ambitions, you've got a big history -- act big, don't act small.' That's my attitude.''
One argument in London is that the euro zone -- which Britain never joined -- will seek to integrate further and that this will require a new E.U. treaty. Many of Mr. Cameron's supporters believe that in exchange for agreeing to that, he can wrest back some powers from Brussels, allowing him a new settlement that could be put to voters in a referendum.
But Mr. Clegg said a new treaty might not arise and advised against promising a referendum before it was clear what the future held.
''Why would you provoke a great national debate about nothing very much in particular in response to a document that hasn't materialized yet and might never materialize?'' he said.
In a separate development, Gunther Krichbaum, chairman of the European affairs committee in Germany's Parliament, said a referendum ''could paralyze efforts for a better Europe and deeper integration.''
''Britain would risk being isolated,'' he was quoted as saying in The Guardian. ''That cannot be in Britain's interests.''
Mr. Cameron's official spokesman played down the controversy.
''The prime minister's view is that it is in the British national interest to be in the E.U., but he wants to change that relationship with the E.U. and to seek fresh consent for it,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Unexpected Sharp Rise in Exports From China

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Exports from China grew at their fastest clip in more than half a year in December, underpinning hopes that global trade may be stabilizing, and offering some good news for the Chinese economy as it struggles to regain momentum. 
Trade data can be volatile and subject to seasonal factors that skew numbers from one month to the next, analysts cautioned, but last month's 14.1 percent jump in exports from a year earlier topped expectations by a very wide margin, and was a clear positive for the Chinese economy, the world's second-largest after the United States.
''The numbers were a very pleasant surprise,'' Yao Wei, a China economist at Société Générale in Hong Kong, said after the data were released on Thursday. She added that the export performance over the past three months as a whole, while not excellent, showed that external demand was ''on an upward trend.''
December's jump in exports was the fastest expansion since May last year. Exports had edged up just 2.9 percent in November, and climbed 11.6 percent in October, according to official data.
''Put in perspective with the four previous export downturns, 2012 looks to have done quite well,'' Xianfang Ren and Alistair Thornton, economists at IHS Global Insight in Beijing, wrote in a research note, referring to the country's export performance.
Taken together with recent trade data from Taiwan and South Korea, Ms. Yao said, the December data from China showed that demand from the United States was fairly stable. Demand from beleaguered Europe, she said, was ''not great, but not bad,'' while demand from emerging markets -- which have generally enjoyed far faster growth than developed nations in recent years -- remained firm.
At the same time, however, the economic and budget travails of the United States and Europe continue to overshadow the global outlook, and are likely to curtail future growth, economists have long cautioned.
''With our projection for continued contraction in the euro zone and continued slowdown in the US economy,'' the economists at IHS commented Thursday, ''we believe China's export sector will face another uphill battle this year -- an even tougher one than 2012.''

HEADLINE: Coins Against Crazies

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
So, have you heard the one about the trillion-dollar coin? It may sound like a joke. But if we aren't ready to mint that coin or take some equivalent action, the joke will be on us -- and a very sick joke it will be, too.
Let's talk for a minute about the vile absurdity of the debt-ceiling confrontation. 
Under the Constitution, fiscal decisions rest with Congress, which passes laws specifying tax rates and establishing spending programs. If the revenue brought in by those legally established tax rates falls short of the costs of those legally established programs, the Treasury Department normally borrows the difference.
Lately, revenue has fallen far short of spending, mainly because of the depressed state of the economy. If you don't like this, there's a simple remedy: demand that Congress raise taxes or cut back on spending. And if you're frustrated by Congress's failure to act, well, democracy means that you can't always get what you want.
Where does the debt ceiling fit into all this? Actually, it doesn't. Since Congress already determines revenue and spending, and hence the amount the Treasury needs to borrow, we shouldn't need another vote empowering that borrowing. But for historical reasons any increase in federal debt must be approved by yet another vote. And now Republicans in the House are threatening to deny that approval unless President Obama makes major policy concessions.
It's crucial to understand three things about this situation. First, raising the debt ceiling wouldn't grant the president any new powers; every dollar he spent would still have to be approved by Congress. Second, if the debt ceiling isn't raised, the president will be forced to break the law, one way or another; either he borrows funds in defiance of Congress, or he fails to spend money Congress has told him to spend.
Finally, just consider the vileness of that G.O.P. threat. If we were to hit the debt ceiling, the U.S. government would end up defaulting on many of its obligations. This would have disastrous effects on financial markets, the economy, and our standing in the world. Yet Republicans are threatening to trigger this disaster unless they get spending cuts that they weren't able to enact through normal, Constitutional means.
Republicans go wild at this analogy, but it's unavoidable. This is exactly like someone walking into a crowded room, announcing that he has a bomb strapped to his chest, and threatening to set that bomb off unless his demands are met.
Which brings us to the coin.
As it happens, an obscure legal clause grants the secretary of the Treasury the right to mint and issue platinum coins in any quantity or denomination he chooses. Such coins were, of course, intended to be collectors' items, struck to commemorate special occasions. But the law is the law -- and it offers a simple if strange way out of the crisis.
Here's how it would work: The Treasury would mint a platinum coin with a face value of $1 trillion (or many coins with smaller values; it doesn't really matter). This coin would immediately be deposited at the Federal Reserve, which would credit the sum to the government's account. And the government could then write checks against that account, continuing normal operations without issuing new debt.
In case you're wondering, no, this wouldn't be an inflationary exercise in printing money. Aside from the fact that printing money isn't inflationary under current conditions, the Fed could and would offset the Treasury's cash withdrawals by selling other assets or borrowing more from banks, so that in reality the U.S. government as a whole (which includes the Fed) would continue to engage in normal borrowing. Basically, this would just be an accounting trick, but that's a good thing. The debt ceiling is a case of accounting nonsense gone malignant; using an accounting trick to negate it is entirely appropriate.
But wouldn't the coin trick be undignified? Yes, it would -- but better to look slightly silly than to let a financial and Constitutional crisis explode.
Now, the platinum coin may not be the only option. Maybe the president can simply declare that as he understands the Constitution, his duty to carry out Congressional mandates on taxes and spending takes priority over the debt ceiling. Or he might be able to finance government operations by issuing coupons that look like debt and act like debt but that, he insists, aren't debt and, therefore, don't count against the ceiling.
Or, best of all, there might be enough sane Republicans that the party will blink and stop making destructive threats.
Unless this last possibility materializes, however, it's the president's duty to do whatever it takes, no matter how offbeat or silly it may sound, to defuse this hostage situation. Mint that coin!

HEADLINE: S.&P. 500 Hits a Five-Year High

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index set a five-year high on Thursday as stronger-than-expected exports from China spurred optimism about global growth prospects. 
''Historically, January is a positive month for the market, and you're seeing that play out,'' said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at the RDM Financial Group in Westport, Conn.
Financial companies, up 1.4 percent, and energy stocks, with a gain of 1 percent, were the day's top gaining sectors.
Analysts cited economic data from China as the day's catalyst. A report showed the country's export growth rebounded to a seven-month high in December, a strong finish to the year after seven straight quarters of slowdown.
''It is being interpreted positively that they've stopped the downturn,'' Kurt Brunner, portfolio manager at the Swarthmore Group in Philadelphia, said. ''If they continue to produce good growth, that's going to be supportive for our global manufacturers.''
Wall Street's fear gauge, the Chicago Board Options Exchange volatility index, or VIX, suggested markets were relatively calm. The index was down 2.3 percent at 13.49.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 11.10 points, or 0.76 percent, to 1,472.12 on Thursday, which was 6 percent below the all-time closing high of 1,565.15 it hit on Oct. 9, 2007.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 80.71 points, or 0.60 percent, to 13,471.22.
The Nasdaq composite index added 15.95 points, or 0.51 percent, to 3,121.76.
Financials benefited from events this week that helped clarify mortgage rules and banks' potential exposure to the housing market. The consumer finance watchdog announced mortgage rules on Thursday that will force banks to use new criteria to determine whether a borrower can qualify for a home loan.
Earlier this week, several big mortgage lenders reached a deal with regulators to end a review of foreclosures mandated by the government.
Bank of America gained 3.06 percent, to $11.78, while Morgan Stanley was up 3.67 percent at $20.34, one day after sources said the bank planned to cut jobs.
Shares of the upscale jeweler Tiffany dropped 4.52 percent, to $60.40, after it said sales were flat during the holidays.
Herbalife stepped up its defense against the activist investor William A. Ackman, stressing it was a legitimate company with a mission to improve nutrition and help public health. The stock ended down 1.78 percent, to $39.24.
After the closing bell, American Express said it would cut about 5,400 jobs, and take about $600 million in after-tax charges in the fourth quarter.
Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 11/32, to 97 18/32, and the yield rose to 1.90 percent from 1.86 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Advocate for the Homeless Announces a Mayoral Run

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
George T. McDonald said he spent 700 consecutive nights in Grand Central Terminal during the grittier days of 1980s New York, offering food and help to homeless people, in an effort that he later developed into a nonprofit organization, the Doe Fund, which helps find jobs for the indigent. 
On Thursday, Mr. McDonald returned to the train station to announce a new endeavor: his candidacy for mayor of New York City. Whether this venture will be as successful as the last remains an open question.
A longtime Democrat who sought his party's nomination for Congress in the 1980s, Mr. McDonald recently registered as a Republican to take advantage of that party's relatively unsettled mayoral primary. At that time, the Republican contest was expected to be less competitive than the Democratic primary.
Mr. McDonald's remarks on Thursday mostly eschewed ideology in favor of a subject he is intimately familiar with: unemployment and how to address it.
''I am running for mayor because I understand the power of a job,'' Mr. McDonald said, surrounded by a small group of supporters in a crowded passageway of the Beaux-Arts rail terminal. Jobs, Mr. McDonald reasoned, were linked with nearly every issue in the mayoral race, including public safety and quality-of-life concerns. ''The central premise of a McDonald administration is simple: we must set as a goal the full employment of every resident of our great city,'' he said.
But asked about other thorny topics, like government subsidies for businesses, Mr. McDonald demurred, saying there would be time for more detailed discussions during the campaign.
And while he implied that some of his mayoral opponents would ''turn our city over to unions and special interests,'' he would not specify, when asked, whom he was talking about.
Mr. McDonald is not a household name in New York, but his biggest challenge may be convincing the city's political establishment that his candidacy is viable. The Republican primary field has expanded since Mr. McDonald began exploring a run; he will now likely have to face Joseph J. Lhota, a former deputy mayor in the Giuliani administration who is well liked by business interests. Beside Mr. Lhota, the probable Republican contenders include Tom Allon, a community newspaper publisher, and Adolfo Carrión Jr., a former Bronx borough president, both of whom recently switched their party affiliations.

HEADLINE: Clouds Seen In Regulators' Crystal Ball For Banks

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
Five years ago, the financial regulators of the United States -- and more broadly the world -- didn't see the storm coming.
Would they if a new one were brewing now?
The answer to that is far from clear. The regulators have more information now, and they have applied the tools they have to measure risk with more vigor.
But a new assessment from a little-known agency created by the Dodd-Frank law argues that the models used by regulators to assess risk need to be fundamentally changed, and that until they are they are likely to be useful during normal times, but not when they matter the most.
''A crisis comes from the unleashing of a dynamic that is not reflected in the day-to-day variations of precrisis time,'' wrote Richard Bookstaber, a research principal at the agency, the Office of Financial Research, in a working paper. ''The effect of a shock on a vulnerability in the financial system -- such as excessive leverage, funding fragility or limited liquidity -- creates a radical shift in the markets.'' 
Mr. Bookstaber argues that conventional ways to measure risk -- known as ''value at risk'' and stress models -- fail to take into account interactions and feedback effects that can magnify a crisis and turn it into something that has effects far beyond the original development.
''What happens now when people do stress tests,'' he said in an interview, ''is they look at each bank and say, 'Tell me what will happen to your capital if interest rates go up by one percentage point.' The bank says that will mean a loss of $1 billion. That is static. That is it.''
But, he added, ''What you want to know is what happens next.'' Perhaps the banks will reduce loans to hedge funds, which might start selling some assets, causing prices to drop and perhaps having additional negative effects on capital. ''So the first shock leads to a second shock, and you also get the contagion.''
The working paper explains why the Office of Financial Research, which is part of the Treasury Department, has begun research into what is called ''agent-based modeling,'' which tries to analyze what each agent -- in this case each bank or hedge fund -- will do as a situation develops and worsens. That effort is being run by Mr. Bookstaber, a former hedge fund manager and Wall Street risk manager and the author of an influential 2007 book, ''A Demon of Our Own Design,'' that warned of the problems being created on Wall Street.
He said the first work was being done with the help of Mitre, a research organization that came out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, on the interactions between banks and leveraged asset managers, with particular attention on how so-called fire sales develop as asset values plunge. Additional work is being done by central banks in Europe, including the Bank of England.
''Agent-based modeling'' has been used in a variety of nonfinancial areas, including traffic congestion and crowd dynamics (it turns out that putting a post in front of an emergency exit can actually improve the flow of people fleeing an emergency and thus save lives). But the modeling has received little attention from economists.
Richard Berner, the director of the Office of Financial Research, said in an interview that his agency was trying to gather information in many areas, understanding that ''all three of those things -- the origination, the transmission and the amplification of a threat -- are important.'' The agency is supposed to provide information that regulators can use.
Mr. Bookstaber said that he hoped that information from such models, coupled with the additional detailed data the government is now collecting on markets and trading positions, could help regulators spot potential trouble before it happens, as leverage builds up in a particular part of the markets. Perhaps regulators could then take steps to raise the cost of borrowing in that particular area, rather than use the blunt tool of raising rates throughout the market.
Any benefits from such research is at least a few years away, however, and for now bank regulators are placing renewed emphasis on stress tests, which under the Dodd-Frank law must be conducted annually on the largest banks in the country. This year's version, due out in March, will release more information than those in previous years.
Stress tests take a negative set of economic assumptions and ask how each bank would fare in those circumstances. As such, their usefulness is constrained by how well the assumptions reflect something that might actually happen. If it has never happened before, there is at least some chance that a stress test would not even consider what could be a severe problem.
The usefulness could also be limited by secondary effects not foreseen by those who designed the test. In 1998, the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund had little exposure to Russian bonds, and probably would have easily passed a stress test based on a possible Russian default. But when Russia did default, others that owned Russian bonds were forced to sell assets that the L.T.C.M. fund did own, driving down prices of those assets and setting off the events that caused the heavily leveraged fund to come close to collapse.
The Bookstaber paper pointed to a 2008 International Monetary Fund report on Iceland, issued shortly before that country's financial collapse. ''The banking system's reported financial indicators are above minimum regulatory requirements and stress tests suggest that the system is resilient,'' the monetary fund concluded.
This week, the 19 largest bank holding companies in the United States submitted to the Federal Reserve Board their assessment of how they would fare under various cases put together by the Fed.
The principal difference between this year's ''severely adverse'' case and last year's is that this year's version requires the banks to assume ''a much more substantial slowdown'' in China and India along with a new, severe recession in the United States, characterized by an unemployment rate that approaches 12 percent, by a stock market that loses half of its value and by real estate prices falling 20 percent from current levels. There would also be severe recessions in Britain, the euro zone and Japan.
It may be notable that even in the most negative case the Fed could dream up, China's economy continues to grow.
What is new this year is that the public will get to see two views -- views that could be significantly different -- of how each bank would fare under that worst case, as well as under less horrible conditions. Each bank's own assessment will be released in March, along with the Fed's view of how that bank would do. Officials say the Fed staff members working on the stress tests will not see, and therefore not be influenced by, the bank's views.
If there are substantial differences in the results for any bank, that will serve as a reminder that the models the banks use to estimate their exposures can vary significantly from bank to bank and between the banks and the regulators.
The immediate impact of the stress tests will show up in whether the Fed approves each bank's capital plan -- its plan for how much it will pay out to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. The Fed will approve what a bank proposes only if it thinks that minimum levels of bank capital would be preserved under the severe stress test.
A year ago, Citigroup suffered the embarrassment of having the Fed publicly reject its capital plan. It may not be unrelated that the bank's board has since ousted the chief executive responsible for preparing that plan.
For now, the Fed's view of what is necessary will prevail. But does the Fed have enough information to really know how the banks would fare if a new recession arrived? If Mr. Bookstaber is right, the answer may be that it does not.

Previews and Openings
'Bethany' (previews start on Friday; opens on Jan. 20) Playing a resident of a depressed American exurb blighted by foreclosures, America Ferrera leaves behind the glitzy fashion and media world she inhabited on ''Ugly Betty'' in this dark comedy by Laura Marks. Gaye Taylor Upchurch directs the world premiere, which kicks off the 35th season of the Women's Project in its new Midtown home. City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (David Rooney) 
'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' (in previews; opens on Thursday) Break out the bourbon. Since Barbara Bel Geddes first prowled the Pollitt family's Mississippi Delta plantation home in 1955, Tennessee Williams's sultry drama of Southern decadence, greed and mendacity has returned to Broadway in five major productions -- this one being its third in a decade. The latest actress to don Maggie the Cat's figure-hugging slip and indomitable determination is Scarlett Johansson, who won a Tony Award in 2010 for her Broadway debut in ''A View From the Bridge.'' Appearing alongside her in this Rob Ashford production is Benjamin Walker (''Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson'') as Maggie's boozing, depressed husband, Brick, with Ciaran Hinds as Big Daddy and Debra Monk as Big Mama. Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Rooney)
'Clive' (previews start on Thursday; opens on Feb. 7) After directing Jonathan Marc Sherman's ''Things We Want'' for the New Group, Ethan Hawke reunites with that playwright and company to stage this world premiere inspired by Bertolt Brecht's ''Baal.'' Mr. Hawke also plays the title character in this modern update, which traces the slide from success to self-destruction of a songwriter in 1990s New York. Brooks Ashmanskas, Vincent D'Onofrio and Zoe Kazan also star in the production, which features live performances of classic American songs. Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Collision' (in previews; opens on Jan. 22) The prolific no-rules New York theater troupe the Amoralists return with this drama written by Lyle Kessler and directed by David Fofi. An incongruous bunch of intellectuals meet in a heartland college dormitory and embark on a dangerous quest to create order out of chaos. Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, between Perry and West 11th Streets, Greenwich Village, (866) 811-4111, collisiontheplay.com. (Rooney)
'Hamlet in Bed' (previews start on Thursday; opens on Feb. 3) Michael Laurence had a hit at SoHo Playhouse in 2009 with his solo show ''Krapp, 39.'' Scaling up to a two-hander with this darkly comic reflection on mothers and sons, he appears as an actor gripped by the parallel obsessions of finding his birth mother and tackling Shakespeare's despondent Dane. Lisa Emery plays the woman he enlists to fill the roles of parent and queen in this production from the Obie winner Lisa Peterson (''An Iliad''). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (866) 811-4111, sohoplayhouse.com. (Rooney)
'In Acting Shakespeare' (in previews; opens on Sunday) James DeVita wrote and performs this personalized adaptation of a 1987 one-man show by Ian McKellen that planted his desire to become an actor. Dipping into Shakespeare's life and poetry, the solo piece reflects on Mr. DeVita's journey from being a directionless Long Island fisherman to a classical actor, serving for the past 17 years as a core company member and literary manager of American Players Theater in Spring Green, Wis. Pearl Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 563-9261, pearltheatre.org. (Rooney)
'The Jammer' (in previews; opens on Jan. 22) Fresh out of the Yale School of Drama, Rolin Jones turned heads at the Atlantic in 2005 with his play ''The Intelligent Design of Jenny Chow.'' After several years devoted to his busy television writing career (''Weeds,'' ''Friday Night Lights,'' ''Boardwalk Empire''), Mr. Jones returns to the stage with this contemporary urban fable set in the hard-boiled world of professional roller derby in 1950s New York. Jackson Gay directs a nine-member cast led by Patch Darragh. Atlantic Stage 2, 330 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Rooney)
'Life and Times: Episodes 1-4' (opens on Wednesday) Theatergoers looking to settle in for a full day's experience will gravitate toward this Soho Rep production of Nature Theater of Oklahoma's latest experiment, which continues its run at the Public after making its debut as part of the Under the Radar Festival and can be seen in installments or back to back. ''Epic stories need epic forms.'' That company statement encapsulates the thinking behind this 11-hour journey from earliest memory through adolescence. Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org, undertheradarfestival.com. (Rooney)
'Midsummer (A Play With Songs)' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) This lo-fi musical romantic comedy, written and directed by David Greig with songs by Gordon McIntyre, comes from the Traverse Theater, one of Scotland's most fertile incubators of original stage work. Winner of the 2012 Best of Edinburgh Award, the show follows the mismatched lovers Bob and Helena through an eventful lost weekend that prompted a critic for the Guardian to write, ''You float out laughing as if you've just swallowed sunshine on a spoon.'' Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Not by Bread Alone' (opens on Wednesday) The famed Nalaga'at Center of Tel Aviv houses the world's only professional deaf-blind acting company, as well as the BlackOut Restaurant, which operates in darkness with a blind wait staff, and Café Kapish, a sign language-only eatery with deaf servers. That environment is recreated in this immersive theater experience, which invites the audience to navigate the world exclusively through touch, taste and smell. Lest that prospect sound unappetizing, the menu is being conceived and prepared by Danny Meyer's Union Square Events. NYU Skirball Center, 566 La Guardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, nyuskirball.org. (Rooney)
'Opus No. 7' (in previews; opens on Sunday) Famed for his groundbreaking non-narrative ''theater of painters'' spectacles, the Russian designer-director Dimitry Krymov stages these two one-acts that pay tribute to the victims of totalitarianism. Playing for eight performances only, the production features a multigenre original score performed live onstage, with larger-than-life puppets, dancing pianos, acrobats and a ''living wall'' that erupts with imagery. St. Ann's Warehouse, 29 Jay Street, at Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Rooney)
'Picnic' (in previews; opens on Sunday) Despite being a Pulitzer Prize winner (in 1954) and possibly William Inge's best-known play, ''Picnic'' has only been revived one other time on Broadway, when the Roundabout presented Kyle Chandler and Ashley Judd as the young lovers in 1994. The Roundabout is once again revisiting it; this time the ubiquitous director Sam Gold (''Seminar,'' ''Circle Mirror Transformation'') has surrounded his young leads, Maggie Grace and Sebastian Stan, with a canny blend of theater mainstays (Reed Birney, Elizabeth Marvel) and Hollywood royalty (Ellen Burstyn). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Eric Grode)
'The Suit' (opens on Thursday) Returning to the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Peter Brook teams with his regular collaborator, Marie-Hélène Estienne, and the composer Franck Krawczyk on this version of Can Themba's tale of adultery, retribution and tragedy in 1950s South Africa under apartheid. Retold using Mr. Brook's trademark minimalist aesthetic, the work was adapted for the stage by Mothobi Mutloatse and Barney Simon. Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (Rooney)
'When It Rains' (in previews; opens on Friday) From the 2b Theater Company of Halifax, Nova Scotia, comes this live-action existential graphic novel written and directed by Anthony Black, whose work ''Invisible Atom'' was seen in the 2010 Under the Radar Festival. This experiment in theatrical storytelling starts with a reflection on the biblical tale of Job, branching out to ponder questions of happiness and unhappiness by considering to what extent we are responsible for our own misfortunes. La MaMa Ellen Stewart Theater, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org. (Rooney)
'Working on a Special Day' (in previews; opens on Wednesday) The Play Company presents this piece inspired by Ettore Scola's 1977 Italian film, ''Una Giornata Particolare,'' which starred Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. Developed in collaboration with Por Piedad Teatro of Mexico, the play uses minimal props to chronicle the instant bond that develops between a Roman housewife and her homosexual radio broadcaster neighbor on the day in 1938 of Hitler's visit to Mussolini's Italy. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org, playco.org. (Rooney)
Broadway
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Katie Finneran and Anthony Warlow (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Evita' This just in: Eva Perón is still dead. That, anyway, is on the evidence of Michael Grandage's unsmiling revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's 1978 bio-musical, which feels about as warm-blooded as a gilded mummy. Elena Roger, Michael Cerveris and Ricky Martin are the stars of this earnest combination of requiem mass and history pageant (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, Manhattan, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Glengarry Glen Ross' The fight has gone out of the boys from David Mamet's 1984 Pulitzer Prize-winning drama of sharks in a small pond. In Daniel Sullivan's deflated production, which stars an extravagantly gesturing Al Pacino, it's as if all the competitive fierceness has been sucked from them by some cosmic super-vacuum cleaner. It also stars Bobby Cannavale as the hotshot Ricky Roma (1:40). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Golden Boy' Bartlett Sher directs a superbly cast revival of Clifford Odets's 1937 drama about a young man (Seth Numrich) torn between a career as a boxer and his first love, the violin. It's a richly atmospheric production that cuts to the emotional quick of Odets's still-vital play (2:45). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'The Heiress' Masterpiece Theater on Broadway. Moisés Kaufman's revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz's sturdy war horse, starring a one-note Jessica Chastain, is lovely to look at, easy to follow -- and aside from a vivid supporting performance from Judith Ivey -- about as full of real life as an Olde New York Christmas window in a department store (2:45). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Mystery of Edwin Drood' A boisterous, well-cast revival of Rupert Holmes's Tony-winning 1986 musical, which gives the audience the chance to choose the identity of the killer of the titular hero. Chita Rivera lends an air of authentic glamour, Jim Norton is a cutup as the music-hall proprietor, and the young cast sings the lovely score with great skill (2:35). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Newsies' This Disney musical -- adapted from the 1992 movie and inspired by the newsboy strike of 1899 -- markets Urchin Appeal with extra! extra! enthusiasm. Jeff Calhoun directs a cast of comely, if overgrown, ragamuffins. The largely interchangeable songs are by Alan Menken and Jack Feldman (2:20). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (866) 870-2717, newsiesthemusical.com. (Brantley)
'Nice Work if You Can Get It' Every now and then a bubble of pure, tickling charm rises from the artificial froth of this pastiche 1920s musical, directed by Kathleen Marshall and featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin. But mostly the production, starring Matthew Broderick and Kelli O'Hara, registers as a shiny, dutiful trickle of gags and production numbers (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Once' This gentle musical, set in Dublin, about a love affair that never quite happens -- based on the 2006 movie -- inventively uses songs (by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova) and dance to convey a beautiful shimmer of might-have-been regret. Staged by John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett (''Black Watch''), the production stars the immensely appealing Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti (2:15). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Peter and the Starcatcher' The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.'' This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity. Roger Rees and Alex Timbers direct (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' Pam MacKinnon's shattering 50th-anniversary revival of Edward Albee's hair-raising drama of marital discord stars an electrifying Tracy Letts (of ''August: Osage County'' fame) as George and Amy Morton (ditto) as Martha, ably supported by Carrie Coon and Madison Dirks as the young couple they use as cannon fodder. Not to be missed (3:05). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
Off Broadway
'Bare' Stafford Arima directs this tragic tale of star-cross'd gay lovers in a Roman Catholic boarding school. While the boys try to keep their romance secret, the truth comes spilling out during a school production of ''Romeo and Juliet.'' Retooled significantly since its first incarnation in 2000, this emo musical has been updated to reflect attitudes toward homophobia and bullying in the ''It Gets Better'' era. But despite touching moments and a committed cast, the material is too painfully earnest and riddled with clichés to connect with audiences not still mired in adolescence (2:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, baremusicalnyc.com. (Rooney)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
'5 Lesbians Eating a Quiche' This frolicsome play, about a women's club in 1956, ventures into such heady excesses of absurdism, it deserves to be called Mama-ist. (Dada wouldn't do at all.) As written by Evan Linder and Andrew Hobgood, with Sarah Gitenstein directing, ''Quiche'' takes a giant leap from punning smirkiness into the outer space of nonsense (1:15). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Van Dam Street, South Village, sohoplayhouse.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Forbidden Broadway: Alive and Kicking' Gerard Alessandrini's essential satirical cheat sheet to Broadway musicals returns after a three-year absence, packing polished brass knuckles. A precisionist cast of four provides vocal cartoons as evocative as Al Hirschfeld's caricatures. This show not only tickles but also pierces the Achilles' heels of the productions under scrutiny (1:40). At the 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Forever Dusty' If Kristen Holly Smith turned up to your costume party in Dusty Springfield drag and started singing, there would be no mistaking the woman she was channeling. But doing a passable impersonation is a far cry from capturing the essence of one of the most distinctive female vocalists of all time, as this amateurish inflated cabaret act demonstrates. Written in by-the-numbers basics by Ms. Smith and Jonathan Vankin, and directed with minimal finesse by Randal Myler, this misconceived bio-musical is a soulless tribute to the platinum-haired, panda-eyed queen of white soul. She deserves better (1:40). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, foreverdusty.net. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'The Freedom of the City' The masterful contemporary Irish dramatist Brian Friel puts a human face on the Troubles in Northern Ireland with this stirring drama from 1973 about the shooting by British soldiers of three nonviolent civilian protesters at a march, which echoes the tragic events of Bloody Sunday the year before. Staged by Ciaran O'Reilly with a firm handle on the narrative's time-shuffling structure and a stinging clarity that illuminates the play's multiple perspectives, this drama steadily tightens its grip, from its absorbing beginnings through to its shattering conclusion. The standout among the generally solid cast is Cara Seymour as a stubbornly optimistic housewife and mother of 11 children, living in two rooms with a useless husband and no running water (2:00).

&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Andy Webster)
'Job' The professionally confrontational Thomas Bradshaw (''Burning'') revisits the Old Testament's most famously afflicted figure in this short, sharp and joltingly funny work, which lets us see a familiar tale through wise virgin eyes. Benjamin H. Kamine ably steers a bright young cast through Mr. Bradshaw's unsparingly graphic vision of heaven and earth (1:00). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 226-2407, theflea.org. (Brantley)
'Love in the Time of Cholera' Directed by José Zayas and performed by an efficient four-actor crew, Caridad Svich's adaptation of the Gabriel García Márquez novel is pleasing but lightweight. A production cannot live on romance alone. In Spanish with subtitles (2:00). Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Tuesday at 11 a.m. only.

'My Name Is Asher Lev' Aaron Posner's adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place -- the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic community in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30). Westside Theater/Upstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)
'Old Jews Telling Jokes' With old jokes, a few songs and a little schmaltz, this winning revue is simple, effective entertainment executed with obvious affection (1:20). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Jason Zinoman)
&#x2605; 'The Piano Lesson' August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, set in Pittsburgh in 1936, returns in a galvanizingly beautiful staging by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, featuring memorable performances virtually across the board.

&#x2605; 'Tribes' Nina Raine's smart, lively and beautifully acted play asks us to hear how we hear, in silence as well as speech.

Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Brantley)
'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' Nomenclature would seem to be fate for the title characters of Christopher Durang's sunny comedy about gloomy people. David Hyde Pierce, Kristine Nielsen and Sigourney Weaver portray three siblings (if not three sisters) whose parents burdened them with Chekovian names.

'Grimly Handsome' Weird urban wildlife, funny and expansive language, and three terrific actors: What's not to like about Julia Jarcho's latest play, which mucks around in the darkly rich underbelly of the city?

&#x2605; 'Patti Issues' In his funny, tender coming-of-age monologue, Ben Rimalower traces the obsessive Patti LuPone fandom that provided him with an empowering role model. That inspiration proved perhaps most useful to Mr. Rimalower in processing the fallout after his father kicked down the closet door and bailed on the family. While on one hand, this is the story of many young gay men's propensity for diva worship, the tartly observed show goes several steps further by exploring the wide-eyed experiences that result when the acolyte gets to interact with his idol (1:00).

HEADLINE: His Job Safe, Straus's Next Challenge Is the G.O.P.

BYLINE: By MORGAN SMITH. 
msmith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
With the latest threat to his leadership easily dispatched, the speaker of the House, Joe Straus, Republican of San Antonio, has proved once again that he can hold onto the third most powerful post in state government despite a vocal contingent of critics in his party's conservative wing.
But as he heads into the state's 83rd legislative session, he faces what may be a greater challenge -- tackling issues that have been thorny for Republicans in the past, including public education and plans for water and transportation infrastructure, without alienating the far right.
In a recent interview in his Capitol office, Mr. Straus said that addressing those basic needs was essential, not just for the state but also for the Republican Party. He said that if the party did not seek to attract anyone beyond its traditional primary voters, it would have to face the possibility that its statewide dominance could come to an end. "I'm somebody who wants to build the party, to see the Republican Party grow and not just be satisfied because you got 50 percent plus one,'' he said. 
On Tuesday, during his acceptance speech for the speaker's chair, he called on lawmakers from both parties to work together to make what he called the ''core responsibilities of government'' a priority.
He said the state's biggest challenges were ''not fiscal in nature,'' pointing to Texas' rapidly growing population and changing demographics, with increasing numbers of children in public schools who have limited English skills and economically disadvantaged backgrounds.
The remark contrasted with Gov. Rick Perry's speech that day, which focused heavily on the need to keep spending down. But Mr. Straus has stopped short of saying whether any of the $5.4 billion sliced from public schools during the last legislative session should be restored -- a position that would put him directly at odds with the governor, who said recently that the state's financing for public education has been ''pretty phenomenal.''
Mr. Straus's political resilience so far is in part because of the makeup of his district, which includes the affluent Alamo Heights neighborhood. His constituents, while conservative, tend toward mainstream Republicanism. He has also learned to wield the power of his position while earning a reputation among his House colleagues as a largely fair and reasonable leader.
But that has not prevented his facing the indignation of conservative grass-roots activists, whose opposition presents a serious roadblock to statewide primary candidates. They have targeted him since he came to power in 2009 by defeating Tom Craddick of Midland, the current dean of the House, who was the first Republican to lead the lower chamber in more than a century.
This session, Mr. Straus faced a challenge to his speakership from David Simpson, a Republican of Longview who is just beginning his second term. It was the latest in a series of attempts to undercut Mr. Straus from the right that included a May primary opponent backed by FreedomWorks, the deep-pocketed national Tea Party organization. Mr. Simpson, the second candidate to vie for the spot in advance of the 2013 session, withdrew his bid on the first day.
Michael Quinn Sullivan, the president of Empower Texans, a conservative group active in state politics that opposes Mr. Straus, attributed the speaker's staying power to the inside-baseball dynamics of the speakership, which he said meant candidates were responsible to other lawmakers rather than to the electorate.
The antagonism some of the Republican Party faithful feel toward Mr. Straus was apparent in June at the biennial state Republican convention of roughly 10,000 people in Fort Worth -- the same gathering at which he drew jeers in 2010. Stickers bearing his likeness with the slogan ''Oust Straus,'' provided by several regional Tea Party organizations, were worn on numerous lapels and blouses in the convention hall.
''It's a question of his record, and until now he and his leadership team as often as not have been obstacles to reform,'' Mr. Sullivan said.
The causes of their lack of affection can be difficult to pin down. During a challenge to Mr. Straus's speakership ahead of the 2011 legislative session, party activists circulated e-mails emphasizing the Christian faith of his opponents. But the same theme did not emerge during the latest bid to unseat Mr. Straus, who is Jewish.
Before this session, his critics instead accused him of obstructing pet legislation for conservatives -- like stricter immigration laws -- and they questioned his commitment to issues like reducing government spending and ending abortion. But those attacks struggled to gain traction.
Under Mr. Straus's leadership in the last session, the lower chamber passed a long-struggling voter ID bill, an abortion sonogram law and an austere budget that drastically cut financing for public education.
Mr. Straus said he was aware of his detractors, who he said were ''the same people who say no to everything.''
''There are some ugly voices out there,'' Mr. Straus said, ''and there are some people around the state who seem to have made a very small cottage industry out of opposing me, but they haven't gotten very far.''
While many of those voices are on the right, Mr. Straus also has some opponents on the left. Representative Trey Martinez Fischer, a San Antonio Democrat who has supported Mr. Straus in the past, has become a loud critic. Mr. Martinez Fischer said he wanted to give the speaker the benefit of the doubt on his plans to rise above partisan battles to take on major state needs, but that it was difficult after the 2011 session, when he led a bitterly divided chamber that passed major budget cuts to government services.
''It appears to me that Joe Straus is going to spend a lot of time looking over his shoulder,'' Mr. Martinez Fischer said. ''There is a lot of extreme conservative ideology surrounding this Capitol, and it appears for now Joe wants to be the adult in the room. I don't know how long that will last.''
Now a seasoned leader with a robust campaign war chest, Mr. Straus should have ample possibilities for his next political act. But what is next for him may instead be a waiting game -- and could depend on whether he can outlast conservative activists' control of the state Republican Party.
For now, Mr. Straus is careful to keep the exact nature of his future ambitions obscure, and he said he remained committed to his current position.
''I'm one who does believe that doing the best job you can do in the job you are elected to do is the best way to have options down the road,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Downturn Still Squeezes Colleges and Universities

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
An annual survey of colleges and universities found that a growing number of schools face declining enrollment and less revenue from tuition.
The survey, released by the credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service on Thursday, found that nearly half of colleges and universities that responded expected enrollment declines for full-time students, and a third of the schools expected tuition revenue to decline or to grow at less than the rate of inflation.
''The cumulative effects of years of depressed family income and net worth, as well as uncertain job prospects for many recent graduates, are combining to soften student market demand at current tuition prices,'' Emily Schwarz, a Moody's analyst and lead author of the report, said in a statement. 
The growing financial challenges for colleges and universities come as students and graduates have amassed more than $1 trillion in student debt, and many are struggling to pay their bills. Nearly one in six people with an outstanding federal student loan balance is in default, the federal government says.
Before the financial crisis of 2008, colleges and universities routinely raised tuition with little effect on the number of prospective students who applied. Some private colleges said that applications actually rose when they increased prices, apparently because families equated higher prices with quality.
But that attitude has changed, in part because family incomes have declined. Ms. Schwarz also noted, ''Tougher governmental scrutiny of higher education costs and disclosure practices is adding regulatory and political pressure to tuition and revenue from rising at past rates.''
In addition, she noted that budget negotiations in Congress could lead to cuts in student aid programs while the share of students that depend on government help continued to rise. At public universities, federal loans finance a median of 40 percent of student charges; at private schools, the median is 21 percent.
While nearly half the schools that responded to the survey expected enrollment declines, the changes are expected to be minimal and overall enrollment should remain relatively flat. The enrollment declines are more pronounced among graduate programs; small, lower-rated universities; and public schools in the Northeast and Midwest, where the number of high school seniors is declining.
By comparison, about 15 percent of the schools that responded to the survey in the fall of 2010 reported enrollment declines.
Daniel J. Hurley, director of state relations and policy analysis at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, said he was not surprised by the findings. He said that after years of cuts, he expected an uptick in state financing for public colleges and universities in the coming year.
In addition, he said states had become more strategic in how they finance higher education, offering incentives for schools that provide more graduates in critical fields, like engineering.
Tony Pals, spokesman for the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, which represents nonprofit private schools, said the report confirmed the tough realities of higher education. ''Economic, demographic, marketplace and technological trends are converging to cause an unprecedented time of change for higher education. The new reality is that colleges are expecting to have to do more with less for years to come,'' he said in an e-mail.
But Mr. Pals noted that his members had a history of resiliency and innovation. ''We are seeing a jump in three-year bachelor's degree programs, so-called no-frills satellite campuses and academic partnerships between four-year private colleges and local community colleges.''
Over all, 18 percent of private universities and 15 percent of public schools in the survey projected a decline in net tuition revenue for fiscal 2013. A much larger share, one-third, said net tuition revenue would decline or grow by less than 2 percent.
''Such weak revenue growth often means a college cannot afford salary increases or new program investments unless it cuts spending on staff and existing programs,'' the Moody's report said. By comparison, in fiscal 2008, only 11 percent of private schools and 9 percent of public schools did not increase tuition revenue by 2 percent or more.
Since the financial crisis, tuition at public schools has grown more rapidly than private ones, largely to offset sharp costs in state financing. Public universities have responded by recruiting more out-of-state and international students, who can pay more than in-state students.
Private schools have provided more and more financial aid to students to offset their higher price, a trend that many view as unsustainable.
Moody's has a more upbeat view of the most elite private schools and flagship public universities, which continue to have strong student demand and, in many instances, many other sources of revenue.
The Moody's survey included 165 nonprofit private universities and 127 four-year public universities.

HEADLINE: Costs of Medical Care at the End of Life

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Ezekiel J. Emanuel, in ''Better, if Not Cheaper, Care'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 4), does well to note that end-of-life care is not a major proportion of total health care spending. But the costs of patients in critical care with chronic disease and multi-organ failure -- heavily the elderly and those for whom death is a common but not an immediate outcome -- are exceedingly high.
The top 5 percent of such patients account for nearly half of spending (more than $600 billion a year), and the cost per capita of 1 percent of such patients is $90,000 compared with $236 per capita of the bottom 50 percent. 
Those patients are typically the ones whose doctors do not level with them or their families that their chances are not good, and who are put in hospice programs much later than they should be. A nascent movement under way is the development of better prognostic criteria for such patients, working against the false hopes that too often mark such care.

To the Editor:
Ezekiel J. Emanuel writes that the Joint Commission, the nonprofit group that certifies health care organizations, should require doctors and nurses in hospitals to have training in how to discuss end-of-life care with their patients.
As a health care advocate, I agree with the training concept but not the location: my clients frequently do not know the physicians caring for them in the hospital, and these conversations are deeply personal experiences that could be better managed in outpatient settings.
The most effective discussions happen with a health professional who knows my client well. The primary care physician, nurse practitioner or physician assistant in an outpatient setting can have these conversations over time.
These are rarely ''one time'' discussions: decisions may fluctuate over the course of a life span, and the ''best'' decisions come when people have time and space to engage in thoughtful dialogue with the providers they know best.

To the Editor:
When Ezekiel J. Emanuel says doctors face the decision to ''put a patient on hospice care,'' he describes a doctor-directed and passively received service for those facing death. Palliative care is the other way around; it is derived from individual patient and family needs, including services that transcend conventional medical care.
Anyone with the symptoms he lists -- ''pain, nausea, insomnia, shortness of breath, fatigue and depression'' -- should have palliative care, whether facing death, a long recovery or accommodation to a permanent disability.
Only when we can remove the shade of death from these services can we make them available to everyone who may be struggling to live long and purposeful lives with pain and disability.
And if we need to address the economics of palliative care, research shows that patients who are given relief from biological and psychological symptoms use less of more expensive services.
MARY O'NEIL MUNDINGER Rye, N.Y., Jan. 5, 2013
The writer is a professor of health policy, Columbia University School of Nursing.
To the Editor:
Ezekiel J. Emanuel offers excellent suggestions to lessen both suffering and costs in life's last chapter. But even greater improvement is possible when we all accept that sooner or later, mortality is not a medical problem to be solved but a spiritual problem to be faced. When we learn to number our days spiritually, then we may gain the Psalmist's heart of wisdom.
A physician with such a heart may better distinguish between treatments that prolong dying versus those that restore health. A patient with a heart of wisdom may better accept a lesson from Ecclesiastes that there is a time to stop running from death.
Finally, family who have gained a heart of wisdom may better accept that ''loving enough to let go'' is the highest love they can bestow on the dying.

The writer, a specialist in palliative medicine, is clinical director of clinical ethics and palliative care, Baylor Health Care System.
To the Editor:
Ezekiel J. Emanuel misses one big concern: Many older people live alone or with an elderly partner and do not wish to live in assisted living, which may significantly reduce one's personal freedom (set times for meals, for one).
What they need is help with the basic activities of daily living. Unfortunately, health professionals do not view arranging such basic assistance as part of their responsibility.
If older people had such assistance before an end-of-life issue presented itself, then returning home to die would be more achievable and practical for the older person and his or her family. Such at-home care would save hospital, nursing home and other unnecessary institutional costs.

HEADLINE: A Catalyst for New York City's Rebirth

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Ada Louise Huxtable, Champion of Livable Architecture, Dies at 91'' (obituary, Jan. 8) rightly lauds the highly regarded critic for bringing the public's attention to architecture and to New York City as a city of ''fantastic strength, sophistication and beauty.'' 
More than any one architect or public servant, Ms. Huxtable served as a catalyst for New York City's recent architectural rebirth, from the uninspired days of the 1960s when white wedding-cake apartment buildings and demolished landmarks like Penn Station were the norm, to the current era, when breathtaking skyscrapers, a waterfront revitalization and new historical districts are sprouting, even in Brooklyn, whose comeback was once unthinkable.

HEADLINE: A Disappearance in Laos Stirs Fears of a Return to Authoritarian Rule

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER; Poypiti Amatatham contributed reporting from Vientiane and Bangkok.

 BODY:
VIENTIANE, Laos -- He was last seen driving home in his old, rusty jeep. And then he vanished.
The disappearance nearly one month ago of Sombath Somphone, a United States-trained agriculture specialist who led one of the most successful nonprofit organizations in Laos, has baffled his family and friends and raised alarms that a nascent liberalization of the Communist-ruled country could be sliding backward.
Mr. Sombath, 60, who won many awards for his public service, was known to be nonconfrontational and adept at forging compromises with the authoritarian government of Laos.
''We have no malice against the government,'' said Ng Shui Meng, Mr. Sombath's wife, who is from Singapore and met Mr. Sombath while they both studied in the United States. ''We want to live our lives quietly.'' 
The disappearance has set off an enormous campaign by Mr. Sombath's large network of friends and aid workers across Southeast Asia who know him from his development work. The campaign has put Laos, an obscure country run by an opaque Communist party, under increasing pressure to provide answers.
The country has taken halting steps to modernize its one-party system in recent years but has also cracked down on dissent, and its security services have been linked to a series of politically motivated assassinations in neighboring Thailand.
Paradoxically for the Lao government, it is a network of cameras that the municipal police installed over the past three years to monitor ''anti-social behavior'' that have pointed to signs of the government's involvement in Mr. Sombath's disappearance.
Helpful workers at a local police station initially showed the family images of Mr. Sombath's jeep stopped at a police checkpoint on the evening of Dec. 15. Mr. Sombath then appeared to be driven off in a white vehicle.
Family members had the presence of mind to record the footage with their own digital devices -- crucial because the government now refuses to let them view the video again despite pleas by diplomats who would like to analyze it for clues like license plates. (The video is now circulating on YouTube and is also available at sombath.org, a site put up by Mr. Sombath's friends and dedicated to tracing his whereabouts).
Since the search for Mr. Sombath began, the Lao government has issued only short statements that suggest, without offering details, that he may have been involved in a personal dispute. But those following the case closely remain unconvinced.
''The bottom line is that we haven't heard anything beyond a brief statement that doesn't clarify anything,'' Karen B. Stewart, the U.S. ambassador to Laos, said in an interview. ''There's been no full report about the status of the investigation or whatever is going on.''
A mountainous and landlocked country of six million, Laos is often portrayed in guidebooks and tourist brochures as a gentle land of stilt houses along the Mekong River, smiling and easygoing rice farmers, Buddhist monks and village silk weavers.
But the contrast to these placid images is a Communist party, formally called the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, that crushes anything deemed to be a threat to its monopoly on power.
''There's a nostalgic picture of women in their wraparound skirts, a beautiful country with tourist attractions,'' said Adisorn Semyaem, an expert on Laos at the Mekong Studies Center at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok. ''That's not the total picture. There's also another side of the coin.''
A precise accounting of repression in Laos is difficult to obtain because the news media are controlled by the government and communication is poor across the impoverished countryside. But one measure of politically related violence can be found when it spills over into the country's freewheeling neighbor, Thailand, where it is recorded by the police and reported in the news media.
Mr. Adisorn, who has researched Lao politics for the past two decades, has compiled a list of more than 20 Lao citizens assassinated in Thailand over what appear to be political reasons, including a Buddhist monk who opposed the government and a member of the former Lao royal family. The crimes all remain unresolved.
Inside Laos, the government periodically arrests members of Protestant Christian religious groups, farmers who complain that their land had been taken away and anyone else whom they judge to ''have political agendas,'' Mr. Adisorn said.
Mr. Adisorn has an extensive network of contacts inside the Lao government and has been asking about Mr. Sombath's case. ''I assume that he is still alive but that the government is finding it very difficult to find a way out of the situation,'' he said.
An official who answered the telephone at the Lao Foreign Ministry advised a reporter to monitor the Lao press for updates on the case and said a spokesperson was not available.
There is a troubling precedent for a politically linked disappearance. In 2007, Sompawn Khantisouk, the manager of an ecotourism guesthouse who was outspoken in his criticism of Chinese-owned plantations in the north of the country, disappeared and has not been seen since.
If Laos has avoided the same level of scrutiny of other authoritarian countries in the region, it is partly because the political oppression is hardly visible to outsiders when they visit. The center of Vientiane has lively, outdoor restaurants and countless small hotels and tourist shops.
The country received a record 3.1 million foreign visitors last year -- equivalent to half the population -- according to the government, which promoted 2012 as Visit Laos Year under the slogan ''Simply Beautiful.''
Tourists come for the mountain scenery, spicy Lao food, the charms of towns like Luang Prabang and the cultural legacies of the French colonial years -- ocher buildings and nearly tax-free French wine.
But as the country opens up and embraces capitalism more vigorously, there are tensions between the old and new Laos, between a more transparent government and the more cloistered system that fought off U.S.-backed militias during what is known as the Secret War of the 1960s and 1970s.
''There's not total, 100 percent agreement or understanding about how to manage a market economy, a more globally oriented rule-of-law state and yet maintain the kind of political system they have,'' said Ms. Stewart, the U.S. ambassador.
The country's National Assembly has taken a more assertive role in debating government policies that were previously dictated by the top leaders. Last year, Laos completed negotiations to join the World Trade Organization and was the host of a major meeting between the European Union and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the grouping of 10 countries in which Laos is seeking a more active role.
At the same time, the Lao government cracked down on budding signs of free expression. In January 2012, the authorities shut down a radio program that discussed the issue of land seizures -- a hot topic with the increasing number of projects in rural areas led by Chinese and Vietnamese companies.
The host of that radio program, Ounkeo Souksavanh, said that farmers who appeared on the program were arrested several months later.
In December, the government expelled Anne-Sophie Gindroz, the head of the Lao chapter of the Swiss charity Helvetas, citing her ''explicit rejection'' of the Lao political system.
As for Mr. Sombath's case, the possible motives for his disappearance remain unclear. He retired last year from his organization, the Participatory Development Training Center, but continued to be engaged with nonprofit organizations in Laos.
Some speculate that going after such a high-profile personality was a warning to other private groups.
''To this day I am baffled,'' Mr. Sombath's wife said.
She rejects the term ''activist'' that many news organizations have used in describing him. ''We have lived here for a long time, during periods when Laos was less open than now, when people were afraid to talk openly. We survived that period without something like this happening.''
Mr. Sombath's U.S. connections may have made some old-guard officials suspicious, friends and old acquaintances say. He was an exchange student in Wisconsin in high school and went to college in Hawaii.
But his farming roots -- both his parents were rice farmers in Laos -- and his three decades of carrying out programs to help the poor won over many people. In 2005, he was awarded the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award, which honors public service in Asia.
Ms. Ng frets for her husband's health and safety at the couple's home overlooking the Mekong River. Mr. Sombath has a prostate condition and had been prescribed daily medication.
''I don't know where he is,'' she said. ''I hope he is safe.''

HEADLINE: Visit by Google Chairman May Benefit North Korea

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS; Choe Sang-Hun contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea, Claire Cain Miller from San Francisco, and Edward Wong from Beijing.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- As a work of propaganda, the images that North Korea circulated this week showing Google's executive chairman, Eric E. Schmidt, touring a high-tech incubation center are hard to beat.
With former Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico at his side, Mr. Schmidt, who is fond of describing the Internet as the enemy of despots, toured what was presented as the hub of the computer industry in one of the world's most pitiless police states. Both men gazed attentively as a select group of North Koreans showed their ability to surf the Web.
It is unclear what the famously hermetic North Koreans hoped to accomplish by allowing the visit. But the photos of the billionaire entrepreneur taking the time to visit the nation's computer labs were bound to be useful to a new national leader whom analysts say needs to show his people that their impoverished nation is moving forward.
It will matter little, those experts say, that the visitors were bundled against the cold, indoors -- a sign of the country's extreme privation -- or that the vast majority of North Koreans have no access to computers, much less the Web beyond their country's tightly controlled borders. 
The men's quixotic four-day trip ended Thursday much the way it began, with some analysts calling the visit hopelessly naïve and others describing it as valuable back-channel diplomacy at a time when Washington and Pyongyang are not on speaking terms (again).
''I'm still spinning my wheels to figure out a plausible motivation for why they went,'' said Daniel Pinkston, a North Korea specialist at the International Crisis Group.
Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Richardson insist they accomplished some good -- showing the world has not forgotten the plight of an American detained in the North, and at least trying to nudge the tightly sealed nation a bit closer to the fold of globally connected nations.
''As the world becomes increasingly connected, their decision to be virtually isolated is very much going to affect their physical world, their economic growth and so forth,'' Mr. Schmidt told reporters after arriving at Beijing International Airport. ''We made that alternative very, very clear.''
The unofficial visit, however, raised hackles in Washington, and provided rich fodder for commentators and comedians. Even before the Americans left Pyongyang, someone created an account on Tumblr, the popular social blogging site, called ''Eric Schmidt looking at things,'' that parodied sites (themselves parodies) featuring the country's leaders earnestly inspecting livestock, soldiers or leather insoles. (Mr. Schmidt is shown looking intently at computer screens, ''the back of a North Korean Student,'' and Mr. Richardson.)
Others were less kind. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, took to Twitter to call the self-appointed delegation ''useful idiots,'' and John R. Bolton, a former United Nations ambassador, said the delegation was unwittingly feeding the North Korean propaganda mill as it sought to burnish the credentials of Kim Jung-un, the nation's leader, who is in his 20s.
''Pyongyang uses gullible Americans for its own purposes,'' Mr. Bolton wrote in The New York Daily News.
The State Department said it did not think the timing of the visit was ''particularly helpful,'' given efforts by the United States to rally international support for tougher sanctions following North Korea's recent launching of a rocket that intelligence experts say could help in the development of missiles that could one day reach the United States.
As if on cue, the North Korean news media hailed the visit by ''the Google team'' -- which included Jared Cohen, who leads Google's think tank -- highlighting their visit to the mausoleum where Mr. Kim's grandfather and father lie in state. There, Mr. Richardson and Mr. Schmidt ''expressed admiration and paid respect to Comrade Kim Il-sung and Comrade Kim Jong-il,'' the North's main party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, said.
Although Mr. Richardson did not address the criticism during his brief remarks to reporters on Thursday in Beijing, he said he believed his visit was helpful in reducing tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
The delegation did not meet with the detained American, Kenneth Bae, a tour operator from Washington who has been accused of ''hostile acts,'' but Mr. Richardson said he received assurances that Mr. Bae was being treated well and that judicial proceedings would begin soon.
A number of North Korean analysts said that Mr. Richardson -- who has made several visits to Pyongyang -- should be commended for his efforts on behalf of Mr. Bae. ''It sends an important message that people outside his family care about his fate,'' said John Feffer, at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington.
Mr. Richardson said that he was invited by North Koreans whom he had met before, and that he extended an invitation to Mr. Schmidt.
Known for his independent streak, Mr. Schmidt appears to have drawn the lion's share of criticism for a trip that some have described as an act of vanity, or worse, hubris.
It is not the first time his personal ventures have distracted from company business. Privately, some Google executives say his activities, both political and personal, have at times become public relations headaches. An avid fund-raiser for President Obama, Mr. Schmidt was seen at election parties at a time when Google was embroiled in an antitrust investigation by the federal government.
For Mr. Kim, who did not meet the delegation, the trip appeared to have no downsides.
In the year since Mr. Kim became supreme leader, North Korea has been trying to build his image as a youthful, people-friendly modernist who understands the benefits of technology better than his late father. Analysts say the Google visit, coupled with the successful rocket launch, provide his image makers plenty of raw material. ''Kim Jong-un wants to show to the outside world that he is not as isolated and reclusive as is often believed,'' said Kim Yong-hyun, a North Korea specialist at Dongguk University in Seoul.
Mr. Kim spent some of his teenage years at a Swiss boarding school, where he was exposed to Western culture and technology. At home, he has emphasized science and technology to help build ''a strong and prosperous nation.'' He wants to computerize the country's antiquated factories, many of which have been idled by a lack of fuel and raw materials. He has even stressed following ''global trends'' by reaching out to other countries and using the Internet to acquire technological know-how from overseas. Last November, he recommended horseback riding to offset the occupational hazards of working with computers.
Despite such talk, the government remains openly hostile toward the Internet; the country is a reliable member of the annual ''Enemies of the Internet'' report issued each year by Reporters Without Borders. And under Mr. Kim, North Korea has intensified a crackdown on other forms of outside information, including the DVDs and thumb drives smuggled from China that often carry banned South Korean soap operas.
Given the government's obsession with keeping out any information that could undermine its grip on power or the Kim family's personality cult, analysts say North Korea is unlikely to embrace Mr. Schmidt's global connectivity dream any time soon.
''When Kim Jong-un talks about using the Internet, he means a one-way traffic of information: getting information North Korea needs,'' said Kim Kwang-in, head of the North Korea Strategy Center, a research institute in Seoul. ''It does not mean North Korea will open itself up to the Internet. It is not ready to -- and cannot -- adopt such reforms yet.''

HEADLINE: The Geithner Goodbye

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In a matter of days, the nation's Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, will leave the department he first joined more than two decades ago and re-enter private life for the first time since he was in his 20s.
Looking forward, Mr. Geithner has no plans. A regulator of Wall Street but not a creature of it, he will probably be the least likely former Treasury secretary to land there. ''I'm going to take a long time,'' he said in the second of two exit interviews, one conducted in the midst of the recent fiscal fight and one just after the news conference on Thursday at which President Obama formally nominated his successor, Jacob J. Lew.
Looking back, he is remarkably sanguine. He is comfortable with his decisions: the policy choices available to him were far from ideal, he said, but his team did the best it could within the realm of the politically possible. ''It was a very bad crisis. No playbook. No road map. No clear precedent,'' he said. ''If we had a different set of constraints, particularly in fiscal policy, then I think that the economic outcome could have been modestly better.'' 
A sense of the weight of those constraints emerged in the brief speech Mr. Geithner gave at the White House news conference on Thursday, as Mr. Obama thanked him for his service. While describing the ''compelling and rewarding work'' of government, he mentioned the ''divisive state of our political system.''
In the interviews, Mr. Geithner, 51, returned to the idea that the Treasury and the Obama administration might have done more if they had been given more latitude by Congress.
''The way our country is structured, by design, the founders left the Congress with all the meaningful authorities to determine the path of the economy and what you could do in a crisis,'' he said, mentioning how hard the White House had pushed for more authority. ''The scale of the fiscal response in particular was dependent'' on what Congress would allow.
Mr. Geithner ran the Treasury during the tumultuous years of the financial crisis and a recession that slowly gave way to a recovery, albeit an unsteady one. As president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York before he joined Mr. Obama's cabinet in 2009, he was at the center of the most nerve-racking moments of the banking crisis. And his low-key but forceful insistence kept the Treasury at the center of every major economic policy decision of Mr. Obama's first term, aside from the health care overhaul.
By a combination of historical accident and his own design, Mr. Geithner will go down as one of the most influential Treasury secretaries, alongside figures like Robert E. Rubin, who served under President Bill Clinton, and Henry Morgenthau Jr., who served under Roosevelt.
But he has not always been a popular one. Both Republicans and Democrats have accused him of subverting capitalism and dedicating taxpayer money to ''too big to fail'' institutions in perpetuity. The left has criticized him for helping ''fat cat'' bankers instead of regular people, especially underwater homeowners.
''Is the system safer today?'' said Dennis M. Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a nonprofit that advocates stricter financial regulations. ''The collapse turned an implicit public guarantee into an explicit public guarantee. It is one of the most dramatic changes of federal policy in history and puts too much at stake.''
Still, Mr. Geithner has attained something like a first-among-equals stature at the White House. He is one of the only top-level staff members to have remained throughout Mr. Obama's first term, and his word and policy judgments have prevailed in fight after fight and negotiation after negotiation.
''He went from someone who people were unsure of in the first six months to achieving the elevated status of being the guy who made the toughest and loneliest calls at the most politically perilous moments -- and turned out to be right,'' said Gene B. Sperling, director of the National Economic Council.
In many ways, his colleagues said, Mr. Geithner's job seemed at times to be that of a firefighter or, at its worst moments, a glorified janitor. His four years were filled with a series of crises: the collapse of the financial system, spiraling unemployment, the cratering housing market, the financial reform bill, the ailing auto industry, the European debt crisis, a debt ceiling standoff and two protracted budget negotiations.
''He is so serene in good times and in bad,'' said Michael Froman, a deputy national security adviser who has known Mr. Geithner for two decades and helped introduce him to Mr. Obama. Given Mr. Geithner's background fighting financial disasters abroad as a Treasury aide, Mr. Froman said, ''I think he was better prepared than anyone to deal with these crises.''
The decisions Mr. Geithner made during the financial crisis remain among his most controversial. For instance, he quashed proposals to seize bonuses, impose new taxes or otherwise punish bankers, whose pay rebounded quickly after the collapse.
Mr. Geithner refers to such proposals as the ''Old Testament'' part of the rescue and reform effort. ''We just didn't see a more effective response,'' he said. ''If you're governing, your responsibility is to do what you think is going to be best for the welfare of the country.'' More punitive measures might have been emotionally satisfying, administration aides said, but they might also have put taxpayer dollars at risk by destabilizing the banks.
Housing is another area in which Mr. Geithner's leadership has been criticized. The Obama administration estimated at first that it could reach three million to four million homeowners with its mortgage plans, but it has aided less than half that number and left billions of dollars unspent.
''Our authority on housing was very, very limited,'' Mr. Geithner said. ''We were able to use a significant amount of the authority in the Troubled Asset Relief Program to design a program for modifying the loans of a pretty substantial fraction of Americans facing foreclosure. But we had no legal authority to compel banks to provide mortgage relief. All we could do was find incentives.''
He added, ''It's not clear with greater authority we would have been able to achieve a significantly faster pace of improvement.''
Such technocratic responses are typical of Mr. Geithner. His aides say that empathizing with the public and communicating his anger or disappointment with the slow pace of the recovery have always been among his weak points.
He has struggled at times with the outward-facing role of the Treasury secretary. He dislikes speaking with the press and bristles at being a ''potted plant'' trotted out at news conferences, for instance. Aides said they prepared him for media appearances as if playing the game Taboo, banning him from using phrases like ''credit-default spreads.''
But within the White House, Mr. Geithner's technocratic skills and no-drama attitude, as well as his calls on how to deal with the crisis, made him one of Mr. Obama's most trusted aides. Though he is mostly known for his work on the financial crisis, he was also the White House's main emissary to Europe on its debt crisis and spent hundreds of hours working on fiscal negotiations with Congress. During his tenure, he made 61 domestic trips and 37 international ones, and testified 67 times to Congressional committees.
Looking back, he said, more authority or financing from Congress might have helped the administration promote the recovery. But he said he felt comfortable otherwise.
Asked directly how he viewed his tenure, however, Mr. Geithner shied away. ''I kind of think that's better for history to answer,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In 2nd Look, Few Savings From Digital Care Records

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON and JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
The conversion to electronic health records has failed so far to produce the hoped-for savings in health care costs and has had mixed results, at best, in improving efficiency and patient care, according to a new analysis by the influential RAND Corporation.
Optimistic predictions by RAND in 2005 helped drive explosive growth in the electronic records industry and encouraged the federal government to give billions of dollars in financial incentives to hospitals and doctors that put the systems in place. 
''We've not achieved the productivity and quality benefits that are unquestionably there for the taking,'' said Dr. Arthur L. Kellermann, one of the authors of a reassessment by RAND that was published in this month's edition of Health Affairs, an academic journal.
RAND's 2005 report was paid for by a group of companies, including General Electric and Cerner Corporation, that have profited by developing and selling electronic records systems to hospitals and physician practices. Cerner's revenue has nearly tripled since the report was released, to a projected $3 billion in 2013, from $1 billion in 2005.
The report predicted that widespread use of electronic records could save the United States health care system at least $81 billion a year, a figure RAND now says was overstated. The study was widely praised within the technology industry and helped persuade Congress and the Obama administration to authorize billions of dollars in federal stimulus money in 2009 to help hospitals and doctors pay for the installation of electronic records systems.
''RAND got a lot of attention and a lot of buzz with the original analysis,'' said Dr. Kellermann, who was not involved in the 2005 study. ''The industry quickly embraced it.''
But evidence of significant savings is scant, and there is increasing concern that electronic records have actually added to costs by making it easier to bill more for some services.
Health care spending has risen $800 billion since the first report was issued, according to federal figures. The reasons are many, from the aging of the baby boomer population, to the cost of medical advances, to higher usage of medical services over all.
Officials at RAND said their new analysis did not try to put a dollar figure on how much electronic record-keeping had helped or hurt efforts to reduce costs. But the firm's acknowledgment that its earlier analysis was overly optimistic adds to a chorus of concern about the cost of the new systems and the haste with which they have been adopted.
The recent analysis was sharply critical of the commercial systems now in place, many of which are hard to use and do not allow doctors and patients to share medical information across systems. ''We could be getting much more if we could take the time to do a little more planning and to set more standards,'' said Marc Probst, chief information officer for Intermountain Healthcare, a large health system in Salt Lake City that developed its own electronic records system and is cited by RAND as an example of how the technology can help improve care and reduce costs.
The RAND researchers pointed to a number of other reasons the expected savings had not materialized. The rate of adoption has been slow, they said, and electronic records do not address the fact that doctors and hospitals reap the benefits of high volumes of care.
Many experts say the available systems seem to be aimed more at increasing billing by providers than at improving care or saving money. Federal regulators are investigating whether electronic records make it easier for hospitals and doctors to bill for services they did not provide and whether Medicare and other federal agencies are adequately monitoring the use of electronic records.
Technology ''is only a tool,'' said Dr. David Blumenthal, who helped oversee the federal push for the adoption of electronic records under President Obama and is now president of the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit health group. ''Like any tool, it can be used well or poorly.'' While there is strong evidence that electronic records can contribute to better care and more efficiency, Dr. Blumenthal said, the systems in place do not always work in ways that help achieve those benefits.
Federal officials say they are drafting new rules to address many of the concerns about the current systems.
A handful of lawsuits have been filed over the systems. In the fall of 2010, for example, Girard Medical Center, a small hospital in Crawford County, Kan., hired Cerner Corporation to install an electronic records system. The hospital was hoping to obtain federal financing for it.
But after receiving $1.3 million in payments, Cerner employees failed to get the system up and running in time for the hospital to qualify for federal incentive payments. The company then notified the hospital that it was abandoning the project, according to a lawsuit Girard filed against Cerner last year. The case is in arbitration. A lawyer for Girard and a spokeswoman for Cerner declined to comment.
Late last year, a physician practice in Panama City, Fla., filed a lawsuit against the health care technology firm Allscripts after the company stopped supporting an electronic records system called MyWay that it had sold to 5,000 small-group physicians at a cost of $40,000 per physician. The lawsuit said that the system had problems and that the physician group was unable to meet the criteria for federal incentive money. A spokeswoman for Allscripts said it would defend itself vigorously.
The 2005 RAND report helped Cerner executives and others sell the new systems, despite criticism at the time that the analysis was too rosy. RAND said that the report was not influenced by its financial backers and that, in fact, it disclosed the corporate sponsorship prominently in the report itself.
The study was harshly criticized by the Congressional Budget Office for overstating expected savings.
The new analysis was not sponsored by any corporations, said Dr. Kellermann, who added that some members of RAND's health advisory board wanted to revisit the earlier analysis.
Dr. David J. Brailer, who was the nation's first health information czar under President George W. Bush, said he still believed tens of billions of dollars could eventually be squeezed out of the health care system through the use of electronic records. In his view, the ''colossal strategic error'' that occurred was a result of the Obama administration's incentive program.
''The vast sum of stimulus money flowing into health information technology created a 'race to adopt' mentality -- buy the systems today to get government handouts, but figure out how to make them work tomorrow,'' Dr. Brailer said.

HEADLINE: Obama's Chief of Staff Pick Is Said to Be Down to 2

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama on Thursday publicly acknowledged the big problem that he has created for himself by picking for the next Treasury secretary Jacob J. Lew, his trusted White House chief of staff. The shift left a vacancy in one of his administration's, and Washington's, most powerful if least understood jobs.
''I don't want to see him go because it's working out really well for me to have him here in the White House,'' the president joked in an East Room ceremony alongside Mr. Lew and the man he would succeed at Treasury if confirmed by the Senate, Timothy F. Geithner. 
But having nominated Mr. Lew to move next door to the Treasury Department, Mr. Obama for the fifth time must choose the aide who will be the Oval Office gatekeeper for every problem and person, domestic and foreign, that come before the president, and who is often the last to speak to Mr. Obama before he makes a decision. The title of White House chief of staff hardly conveys the reach of the officeholder; responsibility extends far beyond the White House, throughout the departments and agencies of the executive branch and to relations with Congress.
''It is the first person and the last person the president talks to, outside the vice president,'' said Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's first and at 20 months his longest-serving chief of staff, and now the mayor of Chicago. ''And it is both a chief -- meaning top dog -- but it is also staff.''
''I would argue that they are the second-most-powerful person really in the free world, behind the president and occasionally a vice president like Dick Cheney,'' said David B. Cohen, a political scientist at the University of Akron who is writing a book on White House chiefs of staff. ''It is the most powerful unelected position. Chiefs of staff are responsible for everything -- I mean everything -- that comes into the White House.''
The fact that Mr. Obama has burned through four chiefs in four years -- a contrast with Treasury, where Mr. Geithner stayed for the entire term and does not leave until Jan. 25, after the president's second-term inaugural -- is a testament to the unique difficulties and pressures of a job that really became institutionalized only with the Nixon administration. The chief of staff has cabinet status in this administration but ultimately is defined both by the times and the personalities involved.
While the turnover has been greater than for past presidents, Mr. Obama's term was complicated by a global economic crisis and two wars. The musical chairs also seem to reflect Mr. Obama's own shifting conception of what he wants from the job, however.
In Mr. Emanuel, a driven Congressional leader and a former Clinton White House adviser, Mr. Obama chose someone with the energy and legislative savvy to pass an ambitious agenda through a Congress then controlled by Democrats. When Mr. Emanuel left sooner than expected in late 2010 -- his party's nomination for Chicago mayor suddenly was up for grabs, but he also had alienated people in and out of the White House -- Mr. Obama enlisted one of his most trusted advisers, Pete Rouse, as an interim chief of staff.
Because Mr. Rouse initially did not want the job long term, and Republicans had taken control of the House after 2010, Mr. Obama next tapped William M. Daley, a Chicago executive and a longtime fixture in Democratic politics, hoping that Mr. Daley could build bridges to both Republicans and disenchanted business leaders. But Mr. Daley was unable to do so and also antagonized Democrats in Congress -- an occupational hazard for chiefs of staff in most administrations, as Mr. Lew found out after he became chief in January 2012.
In the low-key, pragmatically liberal Mr. Lew, Mr. Obama seemed to have found a kindred spirit and a good fit. Yet Mr. Lew, whose wife remains in New York, had made it known that he did not want to stay on as chief of staff. So Mr. Obama enticed him to stay in Washington by offering the Treasury portfolio, which, given the budget battles with Republicans in Congress, is now more oriented toward Mr. Lew's expertise in fiscal policy than it was when Mr. Geithner became secretary amid worldwide financial peril.
For some weeks, then, associates say, Mr. Obama has been considering just two other men to succeed Mr. Lew: Denis R. McDonough, the current deputy national security adviser in the White House, and Ronald A. Klain, former chief of staff to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and before that to Al Gore.
Mr. Biden has not weighed in heavily with Mr. Obama, officials say, because he knows the president is aware of his regard for Mr. Klain but also because Mr. Biden likes and respects Mr. McDonough.
What is striking, especially at a time when Mr. Obama has come under criticism for the scarcity of women among his top officials, is that both the deputy chiefs of staff to Mr. Lew are well-regarded women and neither seems to have been considered for promotion.
Nancy-Ann DeParle, 56, has been one of Mr. Obama's closest advisers, especially on the 2010 health care law, and in the Clinton administration she headed the agency for Medicare and Medicaid; she will leave after the inauguration and will lecture at Harvard Law School and join the Brookings Institution. Alyssa Mastromonaco, relatively young at 36, has managed Mr. Obama's logistical and travel arrangements since he first started running for president six years ago, and will remain as deputy chief of staff for operations, responsible for overseeing scheduling, personnel and much more.
The president's hesitation about choosing Mr. McDonough, 43, is his lack of domestic policy experience at a time when issues of the federal budget, immigration and gun violence are second-term priorities. But since the 2008 campaign, Mr. McDonough has been perhaps Mr. Obama's closest confidant on national security and foreign policy, enjoying access and trust beyond his position. As the principal deputy to the national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, Mr. McDonough has helped assemble Mr. Obama's new national security team, including the nominees for the Defense and State departments.
Mr. Klain, 51, is now an adviser to the AOL co-founder Steve Case, but much of his career has been as a counsel to Congressional Democrats and then in the Clinton and Obama administrations. Known as an aggressive and organized lawyer, he helped both John F. Kerry in 2004 and then Mr. Obama last fall with preparations for their presidential campaign debates. As a two-time chief of staff to a vice president, he was included for years in White House deliberations.

HEADLINE: Fed Profit of $88.9 Billion Sent to Treasury in 2012

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve said on Thursday that it sent $88.9 billion in profit to the Treasury Department in 2012, a record that reflected the vast expansion of the central bank's investment portfolio. 
The Fed is required by law to hand over a large majority of its profits, a long-standing provision that has become a lot more lucrative in recent years. Because the money is transferred at regular intervals throughout the year, Thursday's report does not affect the imminent arrival of the debt ceiling.
As part of its campaign to stimulate the economy, the Fed over the last five years has amassed $2.7 trillion in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities. And the central bank is still expanding its holdings by $85 billion a month.
The interest payments on those securities are the primary source of the Fed's profits. The Fed has transferred a total of $335 billion to the Treasury since 2009, compared with $147 billion in the previous five years, adjusted for inflation. The Fed has transferred at least some profit to the Treasury every year since 1934.
Because the Fed mostly holds debt issued by the federal government, its profits -- which totaled $91 billion in 2012 -- are largely payments from the government. By returning that money to the government, the central bank in effect is letting the government borrow at no cost.
Some conservative politicians say this back-and-forth -- and the Fed's broader efforts to reduce interest rates -- are worsening the government's fiscal problems by making debt seem less onerous and spending cuts seem less necessary.
The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has acknowledged the benefit, jokingly describing the savings as ''interest that the Treasury doesn't have to pay to the Chinese.'' But Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials note that the purchases have their own purpose, to stimulate the economy, and will not continue indefinitely. They also note that Congress is responsible for its own behavior.
The Fed buys Treasuries and mortgage bonds to make them less profitable, which makes borrowing cheaper and encourages investors to take larger risks on potentially more lucrative, alternative investments. Returns on Treasuries are so low that many investors are losing money after adjusting for inflation. The Fed's ability to profit nonetheless is a result of its unique business model: it pays for securities by creating money.
But there are risks. Higher interest rates would reduce the value of the Fed's securities. And the central bank has incurred a new cost in recent years, paying interest on the reserves that private banks keep with the central bank. That has allowed the Fed to buy assets without increasing the amount of money in circulation, but keeping the money in its vaults could require it to pay higher rates as the economy improves.
The Fed spent about $4.9 billion on its own operations last year. It provided another $387 million to finance the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the agency created by the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010 to take over the work of protecting consumers after lawmakers decided that the Fed and other federal banking regulators had failed to do so.

HEADLINE: Reversing Greece's free fall

 BODY:
Regarding ''Greece's rotten oligarchy'' (Views, Jan. 7): In citing the mendacity, corruption and avarice overrunning Athens, Kostas Vaxevanis describes a country whose political establishment has betrayed its citizenry. But the notion that modern-day Hellas can be revivified by a return to ''Greece's ancient democratic heritage'' is a chimera. 
Europe's sovereign debt crisis originated in a sclerotic Balkan polity -- not the legendary Athenian city-state of yore. Greece lacked the economic bona fides to join the elite euro club. But successive Greek governments manipulated E.U. subsidies and actively dissembled to join the common currency.
Even former Prime Minister George Papandreou has called his own nation ''corrupt to the bone.'' And draconian austerity measures have exacerbated a national propensity for indolence, nepotism and cronyism.
Reversing such a free fall into third-world decline requires astute economic reform and a demand-management program of infrastructure revitalization.

HEADLINE: Is Japan the Country of the Future Again?

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A surprise break with the Very Serious People. 

 BODY:
In the broad sense, surely not, if only because of demography: the Japanese combine a low birth rate with a deep cultural aversion to immigration, so the future role of Japan will be severely constrained by a shortage of Japanese. 
But something very odd is happening on the short- to medium-term macroeconomic front. For the past three years macro policy all across the advanced world has been dominated by Austerian orthodoxy; even where there haven't been explicit austerity policies, as in the United States, fear of deficits has led to de facto fiscal tightening, while monetary policy has fallen far short of the kind of dramatic expectation-changing moves theoretical analysis suggests are crucial to getting traction in a liquidity trap.
Now, one country seems to be breaking with the orthodoxy -- and it is, surprisingly, Japan:
The Japanese government approved emergency stimulus spending of ¥10.3 trillion Friday, part of an aggressive push by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to kick-start growth in a long-moribund economy.
Mr. Abe also reiterated his desire for the Japanese central bank to make a firmer commitment to stopping deflation by pumping more money into the economy, which the prime minister has said is crucial to getting businesses to invest and consumers to spend.
"We will put an end to this shrinking and aim to build a stronger economy where earnings and incomes can grow," Mr. Abe said. "For that, the government must first take the initiative to create demand and boost the entire economy." 
This is especially remarkable because Japan has been held up so often as a cautionary tale: look at how big their debt is! Disaster looms! Indeed, back in 2009 there were many stories to the effect that the long-awaited Japanese debt catastrophe was finally coming.
But, actually, not. Japanese long-term interest rates rose in the spring of 2009 because of hopes of recovery, not fear of bond vigilantes; and when those hopes faded, rates went back down, and are currently well under 1 percent.
Now comes Shinzo Abe. As Noah Smith informs us, he is not anybody's idea of an economic hero; he's a nationalist, a denier of World War II atrocities, a man with little obvious interest in economic policy. If he's defying the orthodoxy, it probably reflects his general contempt for learned opinion rather than a considered embrace of heterodox theory.
But that may not matter. Abe may be ignoring the conventional wisdom on spending, and bullying the Bank of Japan, for all the wrong reasons -- but the fact is that he is actually providing fiscal and monetary stimulus at a time when every other advanced-country government is too much in the thrall of the Very Serious People to do something different. And so far the results have been entirely positive: no spike in interest rates, but a sharp fall in the yen, which is a very good thing for Japan.
It will be a bitter irony if a pretty bad guy, with all the wrong motives, ends up doing the right thing economically, while all the good guys fail because they're too determined to be, well, good guys. But that's what happened in the 1930s, too ...

HEADLINE: California in Surplus

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Wait, weren't they supposed to be doomed? 

 BODY:
Guess whose state budget crisis seems to be over
As best I understand it, what's going on in CA is a microcosm (a pretty big microcosm, actually -- maybe more of a mesocosm or something?) of what's going on at the national level. A severely depressed economy led to big deficits, because tax receipts are strongly affected by the state of the economy -- indeed, are almost certainly much more cyclical than they used to be. 
In response to those deficits, there was a lot of spending reduction plus some more modest efforts to increase revenue. And now that we have the beginnings of real recovery, it's turning out that those efforts were enough to remove much if not all of the "structural", as opposed to recession-driven, deficit.
As this reality becomes more obvious, the deficit scolds will of course go wild. They have staked their careers on crusading against supposedly intractable deficits, and they have their hearts (and more important, their wallets) set on exploiting the alleged fiscal crisis to dismantle social insurance programs. Good news will be a blow to everything they want, and will be furiously and vigorously denied.
But once again: deficits are receding as an issue before our eyes.

HEADLINE: Carbon Taxes Provoke Debate on Economic Impact

BYLINE: CHRISTOPHER F. SCHUETZE


HIGHLIGHT: Carbon taxes can raise government revenue and lead to greater fuel efficiency, but economists and others disagree on whether they can make a country more competititive. 

 BODY:
THE HAGUE - Since the beginning of the year, California, the most populous of the United States, has a price on carbon emissions.
The cap-and-trade system known as AB 23 ultimately puts a dollar price on industry carbon emissions (according to our colleague Felicity Barringer, the precise price of $10.09 per metric ton of emissions in the first free-market bidding in November).
"By putting a price on carbon, we can break our unhealthy dependence on fossil fuels," said Mary D. Nichols, the chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, according to Felicity's report. 
With the new cap-and-trade system, California joins Ireland, Australia, Norway and many other countries in taxing what most agree is one of the root causes of global warming.
Much like tobacco taxes introduced in the latter half of the last century - and now commonplace in most developed countries - taxes on carbon emissions act both as a deterrent and as a source of revenue with which to finance clean energy solutions, proponents say.
The economist Robert H. Frank, in an opinion piece last year, made the basic case that high carbon taxes on gasoline would lead to more fuel-efficient cars.
Dr. Frank, of Cornell University, suggested that a carbon tax of $300 for a ton of carbon emissions might be enough to structurally change the kind of cars Americans drive. He wrote:
"The price of gasoline, for example, would slowly rise by somewhat less than $3 a gallon. Motorists in many countries already pay that much more than Americans do, and they seem to have adapted by driving substantially more efficient vehicles."
An excellent article on Ireland's carbon tax boon points to the other part of the equation - despite three years of recession, the Irish government is managing to balance its books, in part due to carbon taxes on cars, gas and even garbage.
Elisabeth Rosenthal reported late last year that Ireland's deficit has decreased from 32.4 percent in of gross domestic product in 2010 to 8.3 percent of GDP in 2012 in part due to a new taxes on carbon - despite the economic downturn.
"This is a way to secure competitiveness in the future," Connie Hedegaard, the European Union's commissioner for climate action, said in an interview with Elisabeth.
Opponents of carbon taxes are not sure about that claim to competitiveness. Depending on where the carbon tax is applied, it can make transport, utilities and production costs go up.
Last month, the Australian Retailers Association released results of a survey in which they found that 80 percent of Australian retailers say their business has been negatively affected by the new carbon taxes in place in that country since July of 2012.
Russell Zimmerman, the head of the retail organization wrote in a statement:
"The introduction of carbon pricing was a massive legislative change for small business and one which has had a significant impact. In a climate of already suppressed retail spending, retailers are taking the hit of the carbon tax as consumers bypass the stores to pay household bills.
Meanwhile, the cost of doing business has gone up for retailers due to higher utility bills and costs accumulated throughout the supply chain, which eventually fall onto retailers' bottom lines "

HEADLINE: Why the Unemployment Rate Is So High

BYLINE: LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON


HIGHLIGHT: The focus in Congress on debt reduction has pushed job creation and stimulus programs aside, to the economy's detriment, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Laura D'Andrea Tyson is a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and served as chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton. 
According to the last jobs report for 2012, the United States labor market continues to recover at a steady but modest pace despite a global slowdown, Hurricane Sandy and anxieties about future fiscal policy. Private payrolls increased by two million in 2012, and the unemployment rate fell by 0.7 percentage point to 7.8 percent. Over the last 34 months, the economy has added 5.8 million jobs. 
But that leaves a four million shortfall in employment relative to its 2007 peak. And the jobs gap, the number of jobs necessary to return to this peak and cover the growth in the labor force since then, is stuck around 11 million. The labor market is still far from full recovery, with a tremendous waste of human talent and a personal toll on unemployed workers and their families. 
This year is likely to be more of the same, as the deal on the fiscal cliff - the American Taxpayer Relief Act - will take about 0.4 to 0.6 percent off the economy's growth rate. 
Additional cuts in government spending later this year, above those already emanating from the cap on discretionary spending, would further restrain job creation. Proven policies to increase aggregate spending and near-term job growth, like the continuation of payroll tax relief and infrastructure investment, appear to be off the table. That's a mistake, because weak demand and slow growth of gross domestic product are the primary factors behind the tepid pace of job creation.

Despite anecdotes about how employers cannot find workers with the skills they need, there is little evidence that the unemployment rate remains elevated because of mismatches between the skill requirements of available jobs and the skills of the unemployed. 
When the recession hit in 2008, unemployment rates soared in every industry. As usual during recessions, mismatches between employer needs and worker skills also increased temporarily, reflecting greater churn in the labor market as workers were forced to move across industries and occupations. 
But industrial and occupational mismatch measures are now back to their prerecession levels, indicating that the overall unemployment rate is high because unemployment rates remain high across all industries and most skill groups, not because of a growing skills gap relative to the gap that existed before the recession. 
The unemployment rates for all workers at all education levels jumped during the recession and have not recovered to prerecession levels. Even before the recession, the unemployment rates for workers with a high-school education or less were much higher than those for workers with a college education or higher. And there were high vacancy rates and low unemployment rates for professional occupations, while many service and blue-collar occupations had low vacancy rates and high unemployment rates. These structural differences persist but are no larger than they were before the recession.
Increases in educational attainment levels and effective training programs would ameliorate such differences and the growing wage inequality they have generated. They would also facilitate the movement of workers among industries and occupations, making the labor market work better and reducing the structural unemployment rate from industrial and occupational mismatches. 
Alas, state funds for such programs have been slashed and federal funds will probably get an additional haircut later this year, even if the debilitating cuts in the sequester are averted as part of a long-run budget deal.
Another feature of the current recovery is the long duration of unemployment for many workers. At the end of last year, 4.8 million Americans were unemployed for 27 weeks or more, and their share in the total number of unemployed workers fell to 39 percent after peaking at 45.5 percent in March 2011 and exceeding 40 percent for 31 consecutive months. The previous peak was a far lower 26 percent in 1983, at a time when the unemployment rate was about as high as it is now. 
Moreover, the number of workers who are grappling with long-term job loss is probably far larger than the official number of long-term unemployed, as it does not include 1.1 million discouraged workers who want a job but are not currently looking for work, and many of the 1.7 million workers who have joined disability rolls because they cannot find a job. 
Why is the long-term unemployment problem so much more severe in this recovery? Part of the answer lies in the fact that the loss of jobs in the 2008-9 recession was more than twice as large as in previous recessions and the pace of gross domestic product growth during the recovery has been less than half the average of previous recoveries. 
The relationship between the vacancy rate and the unemployment rate - the so-called Beveridge curve - suggests other forces are at work as well. When the vacancy rate rises, the unemployment rate usually falls along a path that has remained quite stable over long periods of time, including the 2001 recession and subsequent recovery. 
But a recent study finds that during the current recovery the normal relationship has broken down for the long-term unemployed - the increase in the vacancy rate has produced a smaller-than-expected decline in the long-term unemployment rate. In contrast, the usual relationship between the vacancy rate and the unemployment rate has held for those unemployed for fewer than 27 weeks. 
There are several reasons that the long-term unemployed are not benefiting as much as the short-term unemployed from the increase in job vacancies as the economy recovers. Many long-term unemployed may not have the qualifications required for posted job vacancies, and the longer they are unemployed, the more their skills become obsolete and their actual or perceived employability erodes. To make matters worse, the longer workers are unemployed, the more skeptical employers become about their employability and work habits. Another recent study found that the likelihood that a job applicant receives a call-back for an interview significantly decreases with the duration of his or her unemployment. 
In addition, many jobs are filled through contacts and informal networks, and the longer workers are unemployed, the weaker their contacts with potential employers and the less information they have about job opportunities. 
Some long-term unemployed may also be searching less intensively or may be less willing to accept job offers during this recovery, in part because good jobs are so much harder to find and because unemployment benefits last longer and are more generous than in previous recoveries.
During his first term, President Obama proposed several initiatives to reduce long-term unemployment, including more flexibility for states to use unemployment funds for training and placement programs, a tax credit to businesses to hire workers out of a job for more than six months, and an $8 billion fund to support training and job placement at community colleges. 
These programs failed to win Congressional approval, and they have dropped out of the debate as Washington's focus has shifted from job creation to debt reduction. 
The economic evidence is compelling. The high unemployment rate is the result of weak demand, not structural mismatches. And the longer workers are unemployed, the more their skills, contacts and links to the labor market atrophy, the less likely they are to find a job and the more likely they are to drop out of the labor force. 
As a result, what is currently a temporary long-term unemployment problem runs the risk of morphing into a permanent and costly increase in the unemployment rate and a permanent and costly decline in the economy's potential output. That's what the Federal Reserve is worried about. It's too bad that more members of Congress don't share this concern.

HEADLINE: Wells Fargo's Mortgage Gains May Be Unsustainable

BYLINE: JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG and PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: Wells Fargo earned $5.1 billion in the fourth quarter, up 24 percent from the previous year, but continued growth depends on lower interest rates or a stronger housing recovery. 

 BODY:
 8:40 p.m. | Updated 
Wells Fargo has turned its mortgage business into an enormous profit machine. The San Francisco-based bank posted earnings of $5.1 billion in the fourth quarter, a 24 percent increase from the previous year.
But its strong gains may not be sustainable, unless interest rates drop significantly or the housing market recovers substantially. Both are long shots. 
"Rates really don't have to go up very much to discourage a whole swath of people from returning to the housing market," said Lance Roberts, chief economist at StreetTalk Advisors, an investment advisory firm.
In recent years, Wells Fargo has aggressively expanded its mortgage business, a strategy that has helped drive record profits. The company reported net income of $18.9 billion in 2012, up 19 percent from 2011. Revenue rose 6 percent in the same period.
"We saw robust growth across the entire bank, proving that there is a lot of value in a strong, diversified business," said Timothy J. Sloan, chief financial officer of Wells Fargo.
But after 12 consecutive quarters of rising profits, Wells Fargo may find it difficult to keep up the pace.
The bank's recent mortgage profits largely reflect the government's efforts to stimulate the economy, rather than a robust recovery in the housing market.
As the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates, millions of borrowers have refinanced their home loans to reduce costs. Refinancing accounted for 72 percent of Wells Fargo's mortgage origination in the fourth quarter.
That business has been especially lucrative of late.
Banks pass on most of their mortgages to government entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which guarantee that the loans will be repaid. With the guarantee attached, banks sell the mortgages to bond investors and book a financial gain.
Profits have ballooned with the government intervention. The Fed has been a big buyer of mortgage bonds in an effort to drive down interest rates. But banks have not cut ordinary borrowers' rates by the same amount.
That means the difference, or spread, between the rates increased last year. Wells Fargo's gains from this activity totaled $10.3 billion in 2012, more than double the previous year.
Those gains may be hard to beat.
While the Fed has promised to purchase more mortgage bonds, interest rates may not fall much further. If mortgage rates stagnate or rise, fewer borrowers are likely to refinance or buy a house. And if the mortgage bond market weakens, banks will make less of a gain when selling the mortgages.
Already, refinancing activity appears to be slowing. In the fourth quarter, Wells Fargo handled $125 billion of mortgage originations, up 4 percent from the previous year. But loan production was higher earlier in the year, peaking at $139 billion in the third quarter.
At the same time, the Fed's low rates are actually hurting other parts of the business. An important measure of a bank's overall lending profitability, the net interest margin, has eroded. In the fourth quarter, Wells Fargo's net interest margin dropped slightly to 3.56 percent, from 3.89 percent a year earlier.
Investors shrugged off the strong profits because of such concerns. Wells Fargo's shares fell slightly on Friday, to $35.10, a 0.85 percent drop.
In an effort to assuage investors' concerns about the refinancing business, Mr. Sloan, the chief financial officer, said in a conference call on Friday that he saw "billions of dollars in refinancing opportunities."
Housing market numbers support his optimism. Over 70 percent of mortgages had interest rates above 4 percent in the fall, according to CoreLogic, a housing data firm. Some of those borrowers would benefit financially from refinancing, given that the interest rate on fixed, 30-year loans is 3.4 percent.
If the refinancing boom does sputter, a significant increase in new mortgages could help fill the void. That depends largely on the health of the housing market. While house prices posted annual gains last year, the recovery is far from robust.
Wells Fargo's servicing business, in which the bank collects payments from homeowners, could also soften the blow. In the fourth quarter, the company reported $926 million in fees from that activity, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Wells Fargo can also rely on other businesses to pick up some of the slack. In an interview on Friday, Mr. Sloan said that strong loan growth throughout the bank, including in autos and credit cards, reflected potential opportunity.
The bank reported gains in its wealth management business, where profit increased 13 percent, to $351 million. It has also been focusing on its brokerage business as regulations have curbed profits in other areas.
Cost-cutting could be another option. In the past, the bank has shown it can be aggressive on that front.
Recently, Wells Fargo has been developing its online and mobile banking operations so that it can trim staffing costs in its branches. It has also refocused on core businesses and sold units like H. D. Vest Financial Services, which it put on the auction block in 2011.
The company has also cleaned up much of the costly legal mess stemming from the mortgage crisis, striking several deals with federal regulators over the last year. This week, Wells Fargo was among the 10 banks that agreed to an $8.5 billion settlement with the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve over claims of shoddy foreclosure practices, including sloppy paperwork used in home seizures and botched loan modifications. Separately, the bank has allotted $1.2 billion to prevent foreclosures.
With the settlement, Wells Fargo puts an end to an expensive foreclosure review that was mandated by regulators. The review cost the bank an estimated $125 million each quarter.
"By putting these issues behind us, we can focus more of our resources on serving our customers," the bank's chief executive, John G. Stumpf, told analysts on Friday.

HEADLINE: The Tax Code and the Very Rich

BYLINE: BUCKS EDITORS


HIGHLIGHT: Bucks readers offer their opinions on the new tax rules and discuss how their own taxes will be affected. 

 BODY:
Almost anyone who receives a paycheck will pay higher taxes this year. But as Paul Sullivan writes in his Wealth Matters column this week, the very wealthiest Americans -- those worth hundreds of millions or more -- usually don't get paychecks. These people, generally partners in private equity firms or hedge fund managers, earn much of their money as a share of their funds' earnings. And those earnings are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. 
So while tax economists say the tax code may now be the most progressive in a generation, the richest of the rich often have the most options for deferring taxes or sheltering some of their income.
Have you figured out yet how you will be affected by new tax rules? And what changes would you have made to the tax code?

HEADLINE: The Dicey Parent-Teacher Duet

BYLINE: SARA MOSLE


HIGHLIGHT: When does a helping hand become a total nuisance? 

 BODY:
The teacher-parent relationship is a lot like an arranged marriage. Neither side gets a lot of say in the match. Both parties, however, share great responsibility for a child, which can lead to a deeply rewarding partnership or the kind of conflict found in some joint-custody arrangements.
As a teacher and parent, I see the relationship from a dual perspective. Educators almost universally regard parent involvement within economically disadvantaged student communities as a vital way to boost student achievement.
Yet in more affluent neighborhoods, active parent engagement, as the clinical psychologist Wendy Mogel has argued in her latest book, "The Blessing of a B Minus," can interfere with children's necessary maturation and strides toward independence. 
Parents of all classes may be forgiven if they can't clearly identify the point at which a parent goes from providing valued hands-on support to becoming an obstacle to children's growth.
"No one wants to be a helicopter parent," says Liza Lee, head of the Columbus School for Girls in Ohio and a former head of the middle school at Brearley, the elite private school in Manhattan. "Parents just don't always know how to work with schools." Ms. Lee points out that few parents know anything about other families' private parent-teacher conferences and, as a result, have few models for guidance.
So parents have no idea whether it's better to be a squeaky wheel, or avoid rocking the boat lest they irritate a teacher who will subsequently take his or her annoyance out on the child, a common parental fear, according to Ms. Lee, and one that's almost always unwarranted.
For teachers, the terrain can feel equally treacherous. "Today, teachers are being bashed everywhere they turn," Ms. Lee says. "They're scared. They feel parents put their jobs in jeopardy. The parent is in the position of power."
A few simple guidelines emerge in conversations with educators and parents on the subject of how best to reduce the mutual anxieties and establish and maintain the kind of trust that is essential to respectful and productive parent-teacher communications:
First, encourage children to take the lead. Many parents can't resist the urge to fix even older students' problems for them instead of giving the child a chance to sort out difficulties on his own, says Kevin Skelly, a father of four and the superintendent of the Palo Alto Unified School District, which serves the offspring of Silicon Valley executives and a small percentage of students who qualify for free or reduced-price lunches. "We all need to learn how to work with diverse people," he says. "Imagine how confident a student will feel if he or she works with the teacher and resolves the issue on his or her own?" College admissions officers tell Mr. Skelly they're looking for students "with a voice," he says. "When parents intervene on their children's behalf, it's robbing them of their own voice."
Second, know the power - and limitations - of electronic communications. Many parents and teachers communicate almost exclusively by e-mail or text messages. The appeal is obvious: communications can be asynchronous and delivered with the tap of a thumb. Jasper Steenhuis, who teaches at a KIPP original charter school in the South Bronx, tries to accommodate families' needs. "It can be disruptive for a parent to receive a phone call on the job," he says, and those without a strong command of English may feel more comfortable composing messages in writing.
But there are drawbacks. It's easier to fire off a text in anger or annoyance; so, as Ms. Lee points out, conflicts often escalate in e-mail in ways they never would face to face. Educators caution against using e-mail or texts except to convey simple information like appointments or scheduled absences. Whenever a subject is delicate or a matter can't be resolved by a quick exchange, Mr. Steenhuis advises picking up the phone or meeting in person.
Third, if you use e-mail for minor matters with a teacher, don't copy the head of school or another administrator. "It's disrespectful to teachers and parents alike, as it sends the message you don't think there's even a chance you can work this out on your own," Mr. Skelly says. "If you have issues, take them up directly, as you would want."
Fourth, teachers, please respond to communications within a reasonable time period. Nothing drives parents battier, they say, than initiating communication and never receiving a reply. Teachers can't always resolve an issue immediately, especially when they need to consult colleagues in order to do so. But teachers can and should acknowledge messages promptly and let parents know they will respond.
It helps if parents have some idea of what teachers' days are like. If a parent sends an e-mail at 8 a.m., a teacher may not see it until after her classes are over for the day. My students know I'm unlikely to respond to an e-mail between the hours of 6 p.m. and 9 p.m., as that's when I'm focusing on being a parent to my own child.
Fifth, if you do drop the ball, say "I'm sorry," as you would to a friend. It's gracious and builds trust. "Nothing is more disarming," Mr. Skelly says, "and it's so simple to do."
Sixth, identify and build on strengths. I don't do this enough as a teacher, and most parents, according to educators I've spoken to, don't do it at all, but if you have something positive to say, say it early and often. Parents are better prepared to hear about a child's challenges, if a teacher knows their child, understands his or her strengths and is prepared to build on them. The same is true for teachers. Let them know what they're doing right, not just what they're doing wrong. Seventh, look for concrete solutions. When parents and teachers have chronic conflicts, Ms. Lee assumes that, as in a bad marriage, both sides are telling "the truth," at least from their perspective. But that doesn't relieve either party of coming up with a solution for the child's sake. Whatever the trouble, identify the concrete outcomes desired.
And finally, proceed with humility. Mr. Skelly counsels parents to take occasional bellyaching about his teachers by a child - especially a teenager - with a grain of salt. Most teenagers are in some kind of opposition to authority as they struggle to grow up.
"The teenager, being a teenager," Mr. Skelly says, "may not rank your parenting skills very high, either."

HEADLINE: Engineers Bring Processes of Nature to Design

BYLINE: PHIL PATTON


HIGHLIGHT: Morphogenesis, from the Greek words morph&#234;, for shape and genesis, for creation, refers to imitating evolution in developing designs. 

 BODY:
Biomimetic is a popular term among designers and engineers. Imitating nature's shapes promises more efficient as well as more elegant buildings and vehicles. Now get ready to hear "morphogenesis." Not content with adopting the forms of nature, engineers are looking to adapt the processes of nature to design.
Morphogenesis, from the Greek words morphê, for shape and genesis, for creation, refers to imitating evolution in developing designs. Algorithms that mimic the processes of evolution can produce lighter, stronger parts, say engineers like Jeff Brennan of Altair Engineering, a software and consulting company. 
Mr. Brennan was in New York for a conference recently and stopped by to explain his work. Morphogenetic software, he said, has been applied to many areas, including architecture and aviation. The software helped Boeing cut about 20 percent of the weight of the new generation airliner, the 787 Dreamliner, he said. Now Altair is looking to morphogenesis to reduce weight in automobiles, a process the company presents as a way to meet tough new corporate average fuel economy rules. Rather than radically new power plants, like hybrids, or wholesale substitution of materials, like carbon fiber for steel, smarter software can cut weight, Altair said.
Altair offers bone growth technology, which it says encourages industrial designers to take a new approach to their work by using the principles of nature and biomimicry. The company declares in a prospectus that "'morphogenesis' technology allows industrial designers to use nature's greatest strengths in their designs, including efficiency, strength and purpose in form. Using algorithms research scientists developed to mimic bone growth, morphogenesis allows designers to plug environmental factors into their designs and 'grow' what the structure or 'bones' of their design would look like," Altair said. 
"During the design process using morphogenesis, coliseums may vaguely resemble rib cages; chairs can look like vines growing up a tree; and motorcycle frames can resemble the shape and strength of a snake's jaw," Altair says in its prospectus.
The software analyzes stresses on a prototype part, suggesting areas that can be thinned or eliminated. Then the revised part is analyzed again, over several iterations or generations - like evolution at work. As Mr. Brennan put it, "The process is finding out where the holes in the Swiss cheese go."
Mr. Brennan said that the company had designed and built a bus using its software to illustrate the weight savings it made possible.
Think of it as Darwin on a disc, evolution as an algorithm. Mr. Brennan explained the process by showing off two different brackets to hold fans and other devices in a Volkswagen minivan. The two look roughly similar but one is lighter to the heft.
Some of the ideas behind morphogenesis are quite old. The Australian-born engineer Anthony George Maldon Michell developed a mode of stress analysis for bones in 1908. But it became practical and feasible to use only when powerful computers came along nearly a century later. Mr. Brennan sketched out the "Michell trusses" and how they relate to bone forms. The software helps deal with the challenge of combing a tube and beam in a single continuous form - something bones often have to do. Mr. Brennan learned about bones at the University of Michigan studying with an engineer, Noboru Kikuchi, who looked for ways to encourage bone growth for medical purposes.
William Myers, author of a new book Bio Design, said in an e-mail, "This technique is likely to become much more common: The engineering optimization found in nature is astonishing and often superior to our own innovations. Growth patterns and resource management systems within living organisms can be thought of as found technologies waiting to be understood and re-purposed for industry."
Altair has worked for almost all the car companies at one time or another, Mr. Brennan said. But few companies incorporate morphogenesis from the beginning of projects. The traditional view of weight reduction is ex post facto and is often pursued on a highly subjective basis, he said. Only when a project overruns weight targets do engineers turn in desperation to "lightweighting."
But ideally the process begins at the beginning. "These algorithms can be integrated with sophisticated computer aided design software," Mr. Myers said.
Techniques similar to those Mr. Brennan applies to auto design were demonstrated in parts from General Motors displayed at the Museum of Modern Art's exhibition "The Elastic Mind" in 2008. Also on display in that show was the Bone Chair, which was produced by morphogenetic software by Jars Laarman, who has since become widely associated with the technique. The chair was developed from software that repeatedly analyzed stresses and produced a series of more and more efficient prototypes.
Many of the pieces produced by morphogenesis resemble the buildings and furniture of Art Nouveau from the 1880s and 1890s, which look like botanical or other biological shapes. So it should be no surprise that Mr. Brennan is a fan of Antonio Gaudi, the master of Art Nouveau. Not long ago, he said, he visited Gaudi's masterpiece in Barcelona, the Sagrada Familia cathedral.
After visiting the interior of the cathedral, whose columns resemble a forest, Mr. Brennan ventured to the basement where the architect's model is kept. "Gaudi designed it upside down," Mr. Brennan said, using nature in the form of gravity to model the stresses of the soaring stone.

HEADLINE: So Much for the Growing Class War

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Despite all the talk of the 99 percent versus the 1 percent, the "class war" apparently abated last year, if you believe the American public. 

 BODY:
Despite all the talk of the lazy 47 percenters, the scruffy 99 percent versus the entitled top 1 percent, contentious proposals to raise taxes on the rich, and the uncapped political donations of billionaires, the "class war" apparently abated last year, if you believe the American public. 
Asked by Pew Research Center about conflicts between rich and poor, Americans were less likely to say there were "strong" or "very strong" conflicts at the end of 2012 than they were a year earlier. In 2012, 58 percent of Americans believed there were significant conflicts between rich and poor, compared with 66 percent in 2011. The biggest conflict Americans perceived was along partisan lines, not economic ones.
Here are the numbers from previous years Pew asked about conflicts between rich and poor, showing that Americans perceive about as much class warfare today as they did in 1987:
There was no statistically significant change in perceived conflicts between the young and the old (29 percent in 2012 versus 34 percent in 2011). Perceived conflicts between these two age groups is actually relatively low compared to some of previous years for which Pew has data:
From an economic standpoint, it's actually a bit surprising that Americans don't see greater tensions between the generations. Medicare and other public spending on the elderly (such as public pensions at the state level) has been gobbling up an increasing share of government budgets, which crowds out spending on the young and raises their future tax burdens.

HEADLINE: Would Exporting the Natural Gas Surplus Help The Economy, or Hurt?

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: Companies that rely on low gas prices oppose liquefied natural gas exports, saying it would hurt the economy. Drillers say the opposite. 

 BODY:
Natural gas exports are turning into Washington's hottest energy question.
On Thursday, five big corporations that rely on low gas prices announced a new trade association to try to block "unfettered exports," and Ron Wyden, the new chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, sent a letter to the Energy Department asserting that the analysis the department was relying on to justify the exports was . 
The gas drillers, meanwhile, have established a new group to push for export approvals and lined up two former energy secretaries -- Bill Richardson, a Democrat, and Spencer Abraham, a Republican -- to press their cause. 
The issue is driven by fracking, which has lowered the price of a million B.T.U. of gas to the range of $3.25, down 75 percent from its recent peak. Gas with the same energy content as a barrel of oil now sells for about $18, one-quarter of oil's price. And industry experts say they can convert the gas to a liquid, load it on a tanker and deliver it to distant markets for a price that remains far less than the world price of oil. Fracking, which involves injecting vast quantities of water and chemicals into underground shale formations to extract natural gas, has vastly increased gas supplies.

This has set off a rush to export. By Senator Wyden's count, companies have applied to build plants that would liquefy and export 48 billion cubic feet a day, a huge amount; in comparison, the Energy Information Administration predicts that 
It is unlikely, of course, that all or even most of those projects will reach fruition. If they did, they would flood the world market. But exports would probably drive up prices. How much is not clear; companies that produce gas say they have vast additional capacity that they have shut down because of low prices, and that if prices rose to $4 or $4.50, production would soar. 
But the companies benefiting from cheap natural gas are sounding nervous. For shale gas, produced by fracking, Peter A. Molinaro, the vice president for government affairs at Dow Chemical, "the words 'game changer' now seem insufficient." His company has reopened chemical plants that it closed when prices here were high, and big industrial users have collectively planned $90 billion in new investments because of cheap gas, he said.
Dow joined Alcoa, Eastman Chemical, Nucor steel, Celanese and the American Public Gas Association to form a new group, America's Energy Advantage to seek to limit exports.
Nucor's director of public affairs, Jennifer Diggins, said her company had just opened a $750 million plant in Louisiana that would provide 150 jobs, with an average pay of $75,000 a year, and that if it expands as planned, capital investment would reach $3.4 billion, with 1,000 jobs. 
The companies are treading a fine line, however. Nucor is a supplier to the oil and gas industry; Dow is a major exporter. "We're very much pro-free trade, very much pro-export,'' said Dow's vice president for energy and climate change, George Biltz. 
On the other side, the American Petroleum Institutereleased an analysis saying that fracking in shale formations for natural gas and oil would produce jobs and tax revenue gains in areas that previously had little oil and gas activity.

HEADLINE: Discolored Slopes Mar Debut of Snow-Making Effort

BYLINE: LESLIE MACMILLAN


HIGHLIGHT: An Arizona resort attributes the initial yellowish cast to a rusty residue in its snow-making equipment, not the material's wastewater origins. 

 BODY:
After a decade of legal battles, a ski resort in Northern Arizona recently became the first in the world to make artificial snow totally out of sewage effluent. On Dec. 24, Arizona Snowbowl fired up its snow guns for the first time, and to everyone's surprise, the snow that blasted onto the mountain was yellow.
The discolored snow has sharpened an already fraught conflict. 
Snowbowl's manager, J. R. Murray, said the problem was caused by rusty residue in the new snow-making equipment that carries the wastewater from neighboring Flagstaff, where it is piped directly from the town's sewage treatment plant.
But Taylor McKinnon of the Center for Biological Diversity, a conservation group, says something seems fishy. "I question whether that explanation is based on tests of the water or conjecture," he said. "Something's awry, and the onus is on the Forest Service and ADEQ to protect the public and determine the cause." (ADEQ is the acronym for the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality.)
As I have reported, environmentalists and Native American groups have long opposed the ski area's snow-making plan, arguing that the wastewater snow poses risks to public health and the ecology of a mountain considered sacred by 13 American Indian tribes.
Mike Fulton, water quality division director of the state Department of Environmental Quality, said the agency was "looking hard" into several complaints it had received claiming that the presence of the manufactured snow on the slopes violated state laws on the use of reclaimed water, which prohibit ingesting it. Critics argue, among other things, that wastewater snow is being tracked into eating areas and that children are playing in it and touching their faces with it.

The water used for making snow at the ski area is not drinking water. Studies have found that it contains hormones, pharmaceuticals, antibiotics and other chemicals. There is much debate about whether these chemicals are harmful in small amounts.
Regardless, the discolored snow has meant Snowbowl has to contend with a heightened ick factor. Kaelan Monroe, 11, said he went skiing on New Year's Day and that the conditions were "kind of disgusting."
"The snow is crusty and icy and doesn't look very clean," he said. But that won't keep him from Snowbowl, where he has skied since age 3, he said. "I'm not too worried about face-planting in the snow and getting sick," said Kaelan, who describes himself as a proficient skier.
Arizona Snowbowl operates on public land under a special-use permit issued by the Forest Service. In 2005, the agency approved the ski area's upgrade plans, including artificial snow-making, after conducting a long environmental impact study.
That study "did not predict that the snow would be yellow," Mr. McKinnon said.
He said the yellow snow and "a growing list of unforeseen impacts," including new scientific research that indicates harmful chemicals in the wastewater, have rendered the 2005 study obsolete. "Snowbowl would be smart to update the study before they're forced to do so in court," Mr. McKinnon said.
Mr. Murray counters that the excitement over the yellow snow is "a lot to do about a small issue."
"No one here even cares except for those that oppose us," he said.
However, a worker hired just before Christmas for making snow said that his impression had been that the management was concerned about the image problem posed by the yellow snow. The worker, Grayson Lookner, said part of his job had been to drain the snow guns when they were not in use and he was told to drag them into the woods so the ski trails would not turn yellow.
He said he worked there only eight days and then resigned because the work was quite hard and he felt a growing unease. "I didn't feel right about blowing" the effluent "all over a sacred mountain," he said. Snowbowl confirmed that Mr. Lookner was employed by the resort from Dec. 20 to 28.
With climate change and prolonged drought in arid places like the Southwest, the use of reclaimed water is gaining importance as a conservation tool. Snowbowl officials portray the resort as on the cutting-edge of creative water recycling. Opponents argue that economic interests are driving a federal wastewater policy that puts commerce ahead of ecology.
Snowbowl officials have said that, because of reduced snowfall, the resort needs to make snow to stay in business. And so far snow-making has been a boon for the resort, it says. "The skiing is great! The pipes are now cleansed," Mr. Murray said in an e-mail.
State environmental officials say they have sent an inspector to Snowbowl and expect to complete an investigation next week. And Mr. Fulton said the agency had already worked with Snowbowl to construct barriers around the ski lifts to prevent overspray from entering the adjacent forest, where endangered plants grow in the fragile alpine tundra.
Potential harm to that that habitat was the focus of a lawsuit that was recently settled out of court.
To date, the discolored snow has not been tested.

HEADLINE: Riff, the Beloved Community

BYLINE: DAVID GONZALEZ


HIGHLIGHT: Side Street: The Rev. Peter Heltzel sees his campaigns for social changes as examples of what can happen when people rooted in tradition improvise in the moment. 

 BODY:
There are times - like when John Coltrane plays "A Love Supreme" - that jazz becomes a mystical experience, burrowing deep into your soul. The Rev. Peter Heltzel knows a bit about both, being a jazzhead and a theologian. A few years ago, spellbound by the artistry of a combo in a West Village basement jazz club, he had a revelation: if musicians can start with standards and transform them, why can't preachers be equally adept? 
"Faith leaders need to learn some lessons about loving from jazz musicians, who've studied the standards, but improvise in making music in new ways," said Dr. Heltzel, who is director of the Micah Institute at New York Theological Seminary. "Corporate leaders, Wall Street financiers, real estate developers and insurance executives are already in conversation. We need to improvise with the religious traditions in our faith communities to create the conditions through which we can collaborate for justice as we build a deeper community." 
Those sentiments are at the heart of his book "Resurrection City," which presents an evangelical Christian perspective on working for social and economic reforms in modern-day America. Its title is a nod to the encampment set up on the National Mall after the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., where a cross section of faiths and races converged to continue the slain leader's mission of creating the "beloved community" where earthly and spiritual needs were met.
Dr. Heltzel's choice of title is no accident. He wants to remind people that many of the same concerns that dominated Dr. King's last years still confront society today. That was on Dr. Heltzel's mind in recent years as he joined other clergy and community activists to press for the living wage legislation that was ultimately passed by the City Council. Now he and his allies have set their sights on having employers provide paid sick leave.
He sees those campaigns - as well as recent environmental movements in places like the South Bronx - as examples of what can happen when people rooted in tradition improvise in the moment. During their efforts to pass the wage law, he was part of a group of clergy who approached the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, and presented her not with a list of demands, but with a framed portrait of Mother Teresa. 
"We said 'You're an Irish Catholic and if you're really serious about your faith and its social teaching, you need to step up and pass this bill,'" he recalled. "And she did."
This riff on faith goes back to one spring night in 2010, when he and several friends -- theologians, ministers and activists - squeezed into the dimly lighted sanctuary of Smalls Jazz Club on West 10th Street. He had been a regular, but there was a moment among those friends that touched him.
"The band featured a virtuoso sax player who reminded me of Coltrane, backed by a rhythm section that played the standards, but improvised," he recalled. "There was no real stage. They broke the fourth wall. There was a deeper communion with the music. The crowd was black and white and there was a feeling of togetherness, but also this sense of being beyond boundaries. It was a transitional space where people from all walks of the city came together and experienced friendship and fellowship in a way that harkens to the possibility of beloved community today."
He said he was optimistic - even excited - about the city's future, especially as he has seen like-minded evangelical Christians and Pentecostals tackling economic and social issues that affect neighborhoods and families. 
"When storefront Pentecostals from the Bronx join with tall-steeple pastors from Lower Manhattan on behalf of a citywide movement for economic justice, there will be change," he said. "The kicker for me on this is unless our faith is impacting the city where we live, I question if we have true faith at all."

HEADLINE: Don't Own It? Still Make Money on Land Sale Near Brooklyn Bridge

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: In a complicated deal, Consolidated Edison would sell 3.4 acres next to Brooklyn Bridge Park and near the Manhattan Bridge and split the profit with its customers. 

 BODY:
Hipsters are not the only ones reaping benefits from the soaring value of real estate in the Dumbo section of Brooklyn. All of Consolidated Edison's customers could soon share in a minor windfall from the sale of the next piece of Brooklyn Bridge Park. 
 Con Ed has asked state utility regulators to approve its plan to sell 3.4 acres between John Street and the East River that it has owned for half a century. The company said it bought the waterfront property north of the Manhattan Bridge for $250,000, or about half of what a studio apartment would cost in the neighborhood today.
 Con Edison says its total investment in the property over the years is about $600,000, but the Brooklyn Bridge Park Development Corporation has agreed to pay $9.2 million for it. That amounts to a return of roughly 1,500 percent, not accounting for inflation or taxes, but to only about $1.40 for each of the company's 3.2 million customers. 
 The utility is offering to share more than half of the gain - almost $4.5 million - with its ratepayers. The company would keep the rest of the profit - if the regulators approve and if the operators of the Brooklyn Bridge Park strike a deal with a developer.
 Park officials are awaiting responses to a request for proposals to build a 130-foot-tall apartment building on a small piece of the Con Edison land. Revenue from a 96-year lease on the land under the building would help pay for the purchase, they said. Then, the park's operators could complete the northern end of the park with a 13,000-square-foot lawn with a commanding view of the Manhattan Bridge and the city skyline.
 "What's funded is the capital money to build the park; we do not have the money to buy the land," said Regina Myer, president of Brooklyn Bridge Park. "We need to have a successful response" to the request for proposals to acquire the site, she said.
 Responses from potential developers are due by March 11. Ms. Myer declined to comment on the price offered to Con Edison or how it had been determined.

HEADLINE: Common Core Practice | A Mining Village in Peru, Weapons in Syria and Inaugural Poetry

BYLINE: JONATHAN OLSEN, SARAH GROSS and KATHERINE SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: In this week's installment, students can write argumentative pieces about a mining town in Peru; create poems in honor of the poet chosen for this year's presidential inauguration; and summarize why many countries are concerned with Syria's possible production of chemical weapons. 

 BODY:
Each Friday we collaborate with a classroom in New Jersey to test and publish three short writing ideas that address Common Core Standards and that are grounded in New York Times content. 
Just before the holiday break, these teachers wrote about using The Times in their classroom not only for the daily prompts, but also for "serendipitous discovery."
 Common Core Practice Tasks | Week of Jan. 7-11, 2013 
 Argumentative Writing 
 World: "Hundreds in Peru Balk at Relocation From Site of Mine"
Common Core Standards: RI1, RI10, W1, W4, W10, RH1, RH2
 More than 14,000 feet above sea level in the mountains of Peru sits a century-old village called Morococha. Now, a Chinese company called Chinalco plans to demolish Morococha and move its 5,000 residents to a new town it has built six miles away in order to make way for an enormous open-pit copper mine. A few hundred residents are resisting the move. What do you think? 
 Your Task: Using evidence from the text, including statements from Chinalco and quotes from the residents of Morococha, write a paragraph explaining whether, in your opinion, the mining company should have the authority to force the residents to move to a new town.
 Before You Do the Task, You Might ... 

        
Determine whether you support Chinalco or the residents of Morococha, based on what you read in this article.
        
How does the author compare the two villages? Why might some residents of the old village, with its "crude communal latrines" not prefer the new town with showers, toilets and running water in every house? What more do these residents want?
        
Write a topic sentence stating support for one side or the other.
        
Use this debatable issues graphic organizer from Any Day's Times to list arguments supporting your position. Use these arguments as support for your paragraph.
 Extension Activity 

        
Watch this video , filmed in Morococha. After hearing from Chinalco and residents of the town, has your opinion changed?
        
Does any aspect of this story remind you of anything else you've read about, or anything that has happened in your own area? When else have you read or heard of a place or group of people whose homes or way of life have been impacted by an economic or business decision? What debates have resulted in those places?
 Narrative Writing 
 The Arts: "Poet's Kinship with the President"
Common Core Standards: RI1, RI10, W3, W4, W9, W10, RH4
 From the moment Barack Obama burst onto the political scene, the poet Richard Blanco, a son of Cuban exiles, says he felt "a spiritual connection" with the man who would become the nation's 44th president. 
Now Mr. Obama is about to pluck Mr. Blanco out of the relatively obscure and quiet world of poetry and put him on display before the entire world as the 2013 inaugural poet, joining the ranks of notables like Robert Frost and Maya Angelou. 
 Your Task:Using information from the article, compose a 5-10 line poem about Mr. Blanco's life or achievements. You may compose either a found poem (PDF), or an entirely original piece that draws from information in the text.
 Before You Do the Task, You Might ... 

        
Listen to one of Richard Blanco's poems.
        
Underline at least five facts, details or quotes in the article that you think should be included in your poem.
        
Highlight language from the Times article that you think is especially evocative or interesting.
 Extension Activity 
Richard Blanco and President Obama share a common interest in the search for personal identity. Think about your life and your background: what makes you, you? Then, read George Ella Lyon's famous "Where I'm From" poem. Then, using this template from Scholastic as a guide, compose your "Where I'm From."
 Informative Writing 
 World: "Hints of Syrian Chemical Push Set Off Global Effort to Stop It"
Common Core Standards: RI2, RI10, W2, W4, W10, RH1, RH5
 A civil war has raged in Syria for nearly two years between forces loyal to president Bashar al-Assad and an opposition movement intent on removing al-Assad from power. 
In November, intelligence suggested that Syrian troops appeared to be mixing chemicals at two storage sites, probably the deadly nerve gas sarin, and filling dozens of 500-pounds bombs that could be loaded on airplanes
What followed next, officials said, was a remarkable show of international cooperation over a civil war in which the United States, Arab states, Russia and China have almost never agreed on a common course of action.
But concern remains that Mr. Assad could now use the weapons produced that week at any moment.
 Your Task: In a paragraph, summarize why many countries are concerned with Syria's possible production of chemical weapons.
 Before You Do the Task, You Might ... 

        
Highlight any examples in the article illustrating why countries might be concerned with Syria's production of chemical weapons.
        
To find an overview of the situation in Syria, read the Times Topics page
        
Choose the most relevant examples and be sure to include them as support in your paragraph.
 Extension Activity 

        
Watch this video about the Syrian civil war from the perspective of residents of Syria's largest city, Aleppo. (Please note: this video contains some graphic images that might not be suitable for all grade levels.) While watching the video, take notes on the conditions in Aleppo and what the residents and soldiers are saying. After watching, compare what you saw in Aleppo with your understanding of a conflict that you studied in history class. Mr. Olsen and Ms. Gross's classes compared the fighting in Aleppo with the religious wars taking place in Europe during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

HEADLINE: Wells Fargo's Mortgage Gains May Be Unsustainable

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG and PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
8:40 p.m. | Updated
Wells Fargo has turned its mortgage business into an enormous profit machine. The San Francisco-based bank posted earnings of $5.1 billion in the fourth quarter, a 24 percent increase from the previous year.
But its strong gains may not be sustainable, unless interest rates drop significantly or the housing market recovers substantially. Both are long shots. 
"Rates really don't have to go up very much to discourage a whole swath of people from returning to the housing market," said Lance Roberts, chief economist at StreetTalk Advisors, an investment advisory firm.
In recent years, Wells Fargo has aggressively expanded its mortgage business, a strategy that has helped drive record profits. The company reported net income of $18.9 billion in 2012, up 19 percent from 2011. Revenue rose 6 percent in the same period.
"We saw robust growth across the entire bank, proving that there is a lot of value in a strong, diversified business," said Timothy J. Sloan, chief financial officer of Wells Fargo.
But after 12 consecutive quarters of rising profits, Wells Fargo may find it difficult to keep up the pace.
The bank's recent mortgage profits largely reflect the government's efforts to stimulate the economy, rather than a robust recovery in the housing market.
As the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates, millions of borrowers have refinanced their home loans to reduce costs. Refinancing accounted for 72 percent of Wells Fargo's mortgage origination in the fourth quarter.
That business has been especially lucrative of late.
Banks pass on most of their mortgages to government entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which guarantee that the loans will be repaid. With the guarantee attached, banks sell the mortgages to bond investors and book a financial gain.
Profits have ballooned with the government intervention. The Fed has been a big buyer of mortgage bonds in an effort to drive down interest rates. But banks have not cut ordinary borrowers' rates by the same amount.
That means the difference, or spread, between the rates increased last year. Wells Fargo's gains from this activity totaled $10.3 billion in 2012, more than double the previous year.
Those gains may be hard to beat.
While the Fed has promised to purchase more mortgage bonds, interest rates may not fall much further. If mortgage rates stagnate or rise, fewer borrowers are likely to refinance or buy a house. And if the mortgage bond market weakens, banks will make less of a gain when selling the mortgages.
Already, refinancing activity appears to be slowing. In the fourth quarter, Wells Fargo handled $125 billion of mortgage originations, up 4 percent from the previous year. But loan production was higher earlier in the year, peaking at $139 billion in the third quarter.
At the same time, the Fed's low rates are actually hurting other parts of the business. An important measure of a bank's overall lending profitability, the net interest margin, has eroded. In the fourth quarter, Wells Fargo's net interest margin dropped slightly to 3.56 percent, from 3.89 percent a year earlier.
Investors shrugged off the strong profits because of such concerns. Wells Fargo's shares fell slightly on Friday, to $35.10, a 0.85 percent drop.
In an effort to assuage investors' concerns about the refinancing business, Mr. Sloan, the chief financial officer, said in a conference call on Friday that he saw "billions of dollars in refinancing opportunities."
Housing market numbers support his optimism. Over 70 percent of mortgages had interest rates above 4 percent in the fall, according to CoreLogic, a housing data firm. Some of those borrowers would benefit financially from refinancing, given that the interest rate on fixed, 30-year loans is 3.4 percent.
If the refinancing boom does sputter, a significant increase in new mortgages could help fill the void. That depends largely on the health of the housing market. While house prices posted annual gains last year, the recovery is far from robust.
Wells Fargo's servicing business, in which the bank collects payments from homeowners, could also soften the blow. In the fourth quarter, the company reported $926 million in fees from that activity, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Wells Fargo can also rely on other businesses to pick up some of the slack. In an interview on Friday, Mr. Sloan said that strong loan growth throughout the bank, including in autos and credit cards, reflected potential opportunity.
The bank reported gains in its wealth management business, where profit increased 13 percent, to $351 million. It has also been focusing on its brokerage business as regulations have curbed profits in other areas.
Cost-cutting could be another option. In the past, the bank has shown it can be aggressive on that front.
Recently, Wells Fargo has been developing its online and mobile banking operations so that it can trim staffing costs in its branches. It has also refocused on core businesses and sold units like H. D. Vest Financial Services, which it put on the auction block in 2011.
The company has also cleaned up much of the costly legal mess stemming from the mortgage crisis, striking several deals with federal regulators over the last year. This week, Wells Fargo was among the 10 banks that agreed to an $8.5 billion settlement with the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve over claims of shoddy foreclosure practices, including sloppy paperwork used in home seizures and botched loan modifications. Separately, the bank has allotted $1.2 billion to prevent foreclosures.
With the settlement, Wells Fargo puts an end to an expensive foreclosure review that was mandated by regulators. The review cost the bank an estimated $125 million each quarter.
"By putting these issues behind us, we can focus more of our resources on serving our customers," the bank's chief executive, John G. Stumpf, told analysts on Friday.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: What Came First? The Sack

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

 BODY:
ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- Von Miller is happy to show off the shiny, white, personalized high-tops he will wear in Saturday's playoff game against the Baltimore Ravens.
''I'm feeling kind of D. Rose-ish,'' he said.
Or to discuss his collection of 32 eyeglass frames, many of which, like the red, square, vintage Persol frames that are a personal favorite, were picked up during two-hour shopping trips to a store in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood.
''Jack Nicholson wears vintage Persols,'' Miller noted.
But to get Miller, one of the N.F.L.'s best pass rushers, to talk with the speed and enthusiasm with which he pursues quarterbacks, only one topic will do. 
''When it comes to chickens and turkeys,'' Miller said, ''I could talk all day.''
He could, considering he went from taking one easy class at Texas A&M with the intention of sleeping through the semester to getting a minor in poultry science. More than the 18.5 sacks in his second season in the N.F.L. or the Gumby-like flexibility that helps him evade offensive linemen or even the eyeglasses that have become such a signature that a teammate gave him a carousel last Christmas to store them, it is a passion for poultry that might best represent the goofy, free-spirited nature of the anchor and energizer of the Denver Broncos' defense. Miller, an outside linebacker, hopes to be the best defensive player in football, and then to become the best chicken farmer he can be.
''I'm the only one that wears glasses and raises chickens and plays football the way I do,'' Miller said, without much argument, even from a nearby teammate who was laughing.
It would be a mistake, though, to confuse Miller's playfulness and exuberance -- in a 20-minute conversation, Miller brought up four times how much he loved football and hanging out in the locker room with his teammates -- with a lack of seriousness about being one of the N.F.L.'s best defensive players. Miller is one of three second-year pass rushers -- Houston's J. J. Watt and San Francisco's Aldon Smith are the others -- who terrorized quarterbacks this season and whose teams are in the divisional round of the playoffs, which begins Saturday with the Broncos hosting the Ravens.
The Broncos, who allowed the fourth-fewest points during the regular season, chose Miller second over all in the 2011 draft, just after Cam Newton went to Carolina. In a conversation this week, he repeatedly said he wanted to be the player the Broncos brought him in to be.
Miller cannot quite articulate what he thinks that is. But Richard Smith, his position coach, can.
''I think he has the potential to be better,'' Smith said. ''He can be one of the better players to ever play the game. If he continues to push himself and continues to work hard and if he wants that, he has the athletic ability to achieve that. A lot of his stuff is on natural ability. In 25 years in the N.F.L., he's the most gifted player I've ever been around. He just has freakish athletic ability.''
Smith and Miller have an odd-couple relationship. Miller is the laid-back youngster, and Smith is the gruff, old-school coach who told Miller he should not dance after a sack, until Miller told him that a company donated money to his foundation, Von's Vision, which provides eye care to underprivileged children. Go ahead and dance, Smith told him.
But Smith has also taken a special interest in Miller, riding him for everything from bringing food into the meeting rooms to plays in which he did not perform well. Smith makes Miller sit next to him during meetings, to keep Miller alert. He will occasionally call Miller into his office to show him the bad plays Miller made, not the ''100 plays I could show you that are unbelievably great.'' Miller calls Smith's treatment of him ''comical'' but also credits him with his success.
While Miller's natural gift is pass rushing, Smith's goal is to mold Miller into a more complete player. Progress has been made. Miller can set the edge on offensive linemen on running plays because of his strength, and this season he was used much more often in pass coverage than last season. According to ProFootballFocus.com, Miller was thrown at 24 times this season and allowed 19 receptions, a catch rate of 79.2 percent. He had an interception and broke up another pass. Last year, Miller was thrown at 13 times and allowed 11 receptions, a catch rate of 84.6 percent. He had no interceptions.
Still, it is Miller's ability to effortlessly contort his body that most amazes teammates. Miller says even he cannot fully explain it, except that he is trying to get from Point A to Point B as quickly as possible. But he eschewed most traditional weight training programs last off-season to focus on yoga sessions with the Giants' Jason Pierre-Paul.
Broncos linebacker Keith Brooking recalled a sack of Carson Palmer in Oakland, when Miller, rushing from the left side of the defense, ran at right tackle Khalif Barnes. As he approached, he lowered his right shoulder and then bent his knees, turning the corner with his knees just inches off the ground and his torso almost parallel to the grass.
''You have a big offensive tackle, and he's running as fast as he can straight up the field, and this guy is trying to push on him,'' cornerback Champ Bailey said. ''He has the flexibility to get low, run under that and pop back up as if he's been standing tall the whole time. Nobody can do that. That's amazing. And how do you pop up? Usually people fall on their face.''
During the lockout two years ago, when lawyers representing the players union chose Miller to be the representative for the incoming rookies in a lawsuit against the league, Miller said he agreed to lend his name to the cause not to put himself in the spotlight, but to be a part of a group that included Mike Vrabel and Peyton Manning. ''It's a great feeling to have that I'm doing something for them,'' Miller said at the time. ''I enjoy being a great teammate.''
Two years later, with 30 sacks to his name -- eliciting comparisons to the former Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Derrick Thomas -- and having established himself as the most important Broncos player other than Manning, Miller said he did not think about what he had accomplished so far.
''That's just what I do to keep myself grounded and humble, being the Von I've always been,'' he said. ''This is what's always worked for me. I don't sit and think about stuff.''
But he has thought about what will come after football. After the professor of that first poultry class warned Miller that he could not coast through and still receive credit, Miller started to pay attention. Surrounded by students who planned to become farmers, he eventually took classes in poultry production and poultry genetics, and another in which students worked at a farm raising chickens. He said he believed that with the connections he made at Texas A&M, he could have a chicken farm up and running within a day, if he wanted.
''It's an easy lifestyle,'' he said. ''It's a billion-dollar industry. Chickens and turkeys are both recession-proof.''
At this, his teammate Robert Ayers, sitting nearby and eating Chick-fil-A for lunch, started laughing.
''If you don't eat chicken tenders, you use chicken broth to make soup,'' Miller continued, picking up speed. ''It's a very, very elaborate industry. I enjoy checking on the birds once or twice a day, and just having a tranquil lifestyle.''
There is nothing tranquil about Miller's current lifestyle, of course. But Miller seems to have found the only job he might love as much as the one he already has.
''Sad part about it -- it doesn't take long,'' Miller said. ''It's like six to eight weeks before a chick becomes a chicken tender. We knocked that out in just a semester. The house raises the chicken, the lighting, auto feeding, letting owners know how many dead birds are in the house, the disease and humidity. Really, all you've got to do is pick up the dead birds.''

HEADLINE: Technology Dividends Outpacing All Others

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
FOR what appears to be the first time ever, information technology companies in the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks are paying more in dividends than companies in any other sector, S.&P. reported this week. 
S.&P. Dow Jones Indices reported that in 2012 the technology sector accounted for 14.7 percent of all dividends paid to investors in the 500 companies, up from 10.3 percent in 2011 and from a little over 5 percent back in 2004. It replaced the consumer staples sector, which had been the largest payer of dividends for the previous three years.
The change was largely because of the decision by Apple, now the most valuable company in the world, to begin paying dividends last year. The company had been public for more than three decades before it announced plans in March to begin making payouts. Four other technology companies in the index -- all but one of which had been public for more than two decades without paying a dividend -- later joined in making payments to shareholders.
With those changes, 60 percent -- 42 -- of the 70 technology stocks in the index are now dividend payers. The dividends from many technology companies are relatively small, however, and of the other sectors, only health care comes close to having as large a share of companies that do not pay dividends.
But a few years ago, the idea that most technology companies would choose to pay dividends rather than hold profits to be reinvested, would have seemed highly unlikely. In 1999, when the technology stock bubble was nearing an end, companies that paid dividends were generally viewed as boring and growth companies as exciting. Over all, the S.& P. 500 index rose 20 percent that year, but the stocks that paid dividends were up only 4 percent. A portfolio composed only of big companies that did not pay dividends would have risen 90 percent.
The stocks in the S.& P. 500 are generally the largest and most widely held stocks in the country. S.& P. estimates that this year they will pay nearly three-quarters of all dividends paid by American companies. The accompanying chart shows information on the three sectors that have been the largest payers in at least one of the last nine years -- and provides a cautionary warning about the risks of buying stocks solely because they pay high dividends.
The financial sector was the largest dividend payer by far in the years leading up to the financial crisis, and those dividends were more than supported by reported profits. But those profits vanished at many of the companies, and so did the dividends. The sector went from providing nearly 30 percent of all S.& P. 500 dividends in 2006 and 2007 to providing about 9 percent of them in 2009 and 2010. That figure is now back to more than 12 percent, and will continue to rise if the Federal Reserve lets big banks increase dividends, as many want to do.

HEADLINE: Sri Lanka: Vote to Impeach Chief Justice Escalates a Constitutional Showdown

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- Defying a court order, Sri Lanka's Parliament voted overwhelmingly on Friday to impeach the nation's chief justice, a significant step in a worsening showdown between the legislature and the judiciary that has alarmed democracy advocates and many foreign governments.
President Mahinda Rajapaksa must now decide whether he is willing to take the last step in the impeachment process and dismiss Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake of the Supreme Court, who was seen as a Rajapaksa loyalist until September, when the court struck down provisions of a law that would have given greater power to the government's economic development minister, Basil Rajapaksa, who is also the president's brother. 
The chief justice's fall from grace since that ruling has been dizzying, with the state-controlled media sharply criticizing her. Impeachment proceedings began in November.
A parliamentary committee issued a guilty verdict against her in December, saying she had misused her power and failed to adequately declare her assets. Last week, an appeals court annulled the verdict and forbade further action by the Parliament against Chief Justice Bandaranayake.
The Parliament's willingness to ignore the court's ruling and impeach the chief justice anyway set the nation up for a possible constitutional crisis. Saliya Peiris, a lawyer for Chief Justice Bandaranayake, told The Associated Press that his client would not recognize the impeachment and that her next step would be announced later.
Since President Rajapaksa dominates the Parliament, the impeachment effort is widely seen by many democracy advocates as an effort by the president and his family to further consolidate power and eliminate any impediment to their almost complete control.
''The entire impeachment process is clearly politically motivated as a punishment to the chief justice for daring to apply the constitution in a way that went against the Rajapaksa administration,'' Alan Keenan, of the International Crisis Group, said in an interview.
The parliamentary committee found Chief Justice Bandaranayake unfit for office on charges of failing to disclose details of 20 bank accounts and intervening in cases before the court in which she had a financial interest. She was also alleged to have sought to protect her husband from corruption charges.
She had protested the rapidity of the parliamentary proceeding and her inability to confront or cross-examine her accusers.
Lawmakers voted 155 to 49 on Friday to impeach.
On Wednesday, Victoria Nuland, the United States State Department spokeswoman, said that the department had ''serious concerns about the actions that were taken to impeach the chief justice'' and that the proceedings raised ''serious questions about the process and government pressure on the judiciary.''
The United States Embassy in Colombo released a statement Friday repeating those concerns.
''This impeachment calls into question issues about the separation of powers in Sri Lanka and the impact of its absence on democratic institutions,'' it said in a statement.
President Rajapaksa and his brothers are widely credited with ending one of the world's longest and bloodiest civil wars in 2009 by defeating the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The war's end brought stability to much of the country and has increased opportunities for tourism. But he and his brothers have been accused of being involved in unlawful killings by security forces and government-allied paramilitary groups, and a United Nations panel ruled that accusations against the Sri Lankan government of war crimes were credible and should be investigated.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Deficit Expands to a Seven-Month High

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's trade deficit expanded in November to its widest point in seven months, the Commerce Department said on Friday.
The trade gap widened 15.8 percent, to $48.7 billion in November from October, the report said. Imports grew 3.8 percent, led by gains in cellphones, including Apple's new iPhone. 
Exports increased only 1 percent. And exports to Europe fell 1.3 percent, further evidence of the prolonged debt crisis that has gripped the region.
The report suggests trade will be a drag on economic growth when the figures for the October-December quarter are released. A wider trade gap slows growth because it means Americans spent more on foreign products while businesses in the United States earned less in overseas sales.
Still, the report showed consumers maintained an appetite for spending. They kept buying iPhones and other imported goods in November, despite high unemployment and low wage growth.
''A strong rebound in imports is not necessarily all bad for the U.S. economy because it indicates that consumers are spending. It shows the private sector is not dead,'' Gregory Daco, a senior economist at IHS Global Insight, said.
Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, predicts trade trimmed growth by about 0.5 of a percentage point in the final three months of last year. He expects fourth-quarter growth to be no more than an annual rate of 1.5 percent. That would be nearly half the 3.1 percent rate reported for the July to September quarter, which was helped by healthy growth in exports.
Martin Schwerdtfeger, senior economist at TD Bank, also expects the trade deficit to reduce fourth-quarter growth. But he said the flood of imports could be signaling stronger consumer spending and business investment.
''The higher imports could mean that domestic consumption is improving. That would override some of the drag from a higher trade deficit,'' Mr. Schwerdtfeger said.
Through the first 11 months of 2012, the trade deficit is running at an annual rate of $546.6 billion, which is about 2.4 percent lower than the 2011 deficit.
Imports of consumer goods grew to a monthly record in November. Much of the growth was from cellphones and other household electronics products.
Oil imports fell 2.5 percent, reflecting a fall in prices and lower volume.
Imports of foreign-made autos and auto parts rose, likely reflecting catch-up shipments after port disruptions in October caused by Hurricane Sandy.
The trade deficit with China, the largest with any country, totaled $29 billion in November, down slightly from the monthly record of $29.5 billion in October.
Trade was a modest positive for overall economic growth in 2012 and many economists say they believe that trend will continue in 2013. However, that forecast is based on a view that the European debt crisis stabilizes and growth in Asia begins to rebound.
In its latest outlook, a forecasting panel for the National Association for Business Economics predicted that the United States trade deficit for 2013 would total $533 billion, a slight improvement from the $540 billion deficit they expect when the trade numbers are totaled up for all of 2012. That expectation for a slight improvement is based on a view that export growth will outpace imports in 2013.

HEADLINE: 'Any Lawful Steps' Urged to Avert Default

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Democratic leadership in the Senate asked President Obama on Friday to take ''any lawful steps'' available to avoid a default on the nation's debt if Republicans continue to press their demand that an increase in the government's borrowing limit be accompanied by spending cuts of the same magnitude.
''In the event that Republicans make good on their threat by failing to act, or by moving unilaterally to pass a debt-limit extension only as part of unbalanced or unreasonable legislation, we believe you must be willing to take any lawful steps to ensure that America does not break its promises and trigger a global economic crisis -- without Congressional approval, if necessary,'' wrote Senators Harry Reid of Nevada, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, Charles E. Schumer of New York and Patty Murray of Washington. 
The letter signaled an escalation in the war of words over the federal debt ceiling, which has already technically been breached, leaving the Treasury Department scrambling to meet the government's domestic and foreign obligations. Lawmakers believe the bookkeeping flexibility will be exhausted by Feb. 15, at which time Washington would have to either default on its debt or shut down major expenditures.
Already, liberal policy experts have been trying to rally support for measures to go around the Republican blockade, from declaring that the Constitution's 14th Amendment gives the president unilateral authority to raise the debt ceiling to calling for the minting of a trillion-dollar platinum coin that would be used to pay the nation's debts.
''All Americans, Democrats and Republicans alike, have a stake in ensuring that our country meets its legal obligations,'' the Democratic leaders wrote. ''Financial markets have long viewed securities backed by the full faith and credit of the United States as the most trustworthy in the world. This lowers borrowing costs for homes, cars, and college for all Americans and strengthens our economy. If we violate that trust for the first time in history, we will never fully regain it, and every American will suffer.''
Mr. Obama has said he will not negotiate on raising the government's statutory borrowing limit, but without some extralegal maneuver, it is not clear how he can keep that promise. The House speaker, John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, has not backed down on his demand that any increase in the debt limit include cuts at least equal in scope, and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, has also said the debt ceiling issue must be used to secure spending reductions.
''Senate Democrats cannot ignore their responsibilities for political convenience -- and the American people will not tolerate an increase in the debt limit without spending cuts and reforms,'' said Michael Steel, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner.
Conservative Republicans say that even without an increase in the debt ceiling, the administration could continue to pay foreign and domestic creditors by ensuring that incoming tax receipts go first to paying off debts. To do that, however, huge and immediate cuts in government spending would be necessary, and global financial markets would almost certainly be rattled.
The Senate Democratic leaders did not suggest what ''lawful steps'' they had in mind. A Democratic aide said the senators would be inclined to have the president declare unilateral authority under the 14th Amendment, which says the debt's validity ''shall not be questioned.''
That, the aide said, would be more politically tenable than using the loophole of a trillion-dollar coin, issued under a legal provision that allows the Treasury to mint a platinum coin of any denomination. The coin would be deposited at the Federal Reserve, which in theory would then issue a line of credit against it.
But Democrats worry that the coin option would baffle voters. According to officials familiar with the drafting of the letter, top aides to Mr. Reid, the Senate majority leader, initially favored an explicit reference to the 14th Amendment. But in negotiations over the wording of their letter, the leaders opted for strategic ambiguity, to keep Republicans guessing and the president's options open.
One of the main reasons for the letter was to bolster the president's resolve, Senate aides said. In 2011, Mr. Obama dismissed the 14th Amendment option, telling reporters that his lawyers ''are not persuaded that that is a winning argument.'' This week when asked about the coin, the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, said, ''There is no Plan B, there is no backup plan. There is Congress's responsibility to pay the bills of the United States.''
Democratic leadership aides said the Senate would probably take up legislation in early February that would allow the president to raise the debt ceiling on his own in set increments, perhaps of $1 trillion. Congress would have the ability to reject the increase, but that would take a two-thirds majority.
That plan was first used at the suggestion of Senator McConnell in 2011 to solve the last debt-ceiling impasse. Late last year, Mr. McConnell proposed it on the Senate floor again, but when Democrats called his bluff, he reversed course and blocked his own proposal.

HEADLINE: Hotel Fire in Philippines Kills 7, Officials Say

BYLINE: By FLOYD WHALEY

 BODY:
OLONGAPO CITY, Philippines -- A fast-moving fire ripped through a small hotel early Friday morning near the former United States naval base in Subic Bay, killing seven people, including four foreign visitors to the area, officials said. 
The fire started on the ground floor of the Dryden Hotel Subic, in the Barrio Barretto entertainment district, sending flames and smoke into upstairs rooms where guests were sleeping, Jose Borlagdatan, Olongapo City's chief fire investigator, said in an interview outside the establishment.
Fire investigators on the scene described a hellish situation as the fire raged through the hotel's upper floors, where guests died trying to escape fast-moving flames and intense smoke. One woman was found dead in a cabinet apparently trying to avoid the smoke.
''The casualties were the people sleeping upstairs,'' said Mr. Borlagdatan, who added that the cause of the blaze was still under investigation.
Mr. Borlagdatan said hotel front desk registration records helped identify three American fatalities -- James Brigati of Kodiak, Alaska, and Patrick Burt and Joseph Valuso, whose cities of residence were not known. A South Korean national was identified as Kyung Ook Kim of Suwan City.
The other casualties were citizens of the Philippines whose identities had not yet been determined, Mr. Borlagdatan said.
The fire department received the initial report of the blaze at 3:37 a.m. Friday morning and quickly extinguished it upon arriving at the scene, said Mr. Barlagdatan.
Jovy Lustre, a cashier and front-desk clerk working at the hotel when the fire broke out, said that she was alerted when a co-worker ran from the back of the establishment yelling ''fire.''
Ms. Lustre said she checked the back of the hotel and saw fire near a back office, with flames licking the ceiling and sending smoke gushing forward. She said she tried to call the fire department but the hotel phone had no dial tone. She ran to a nearby community center to report the incident.
''The fire got bigger and bigger,'' she said. ''It was fast.''
On Friday afternoon, the hotel -- which is along a national highway about 100 miles north of Manila -- appeared gutted. The windows on the second floor, where guests were sleeping when the fire broke out, were broken and the panes were charred.
The hotel, lodged between the Lollipop and Rum Jungle nightclubs, which were also damaged in the fire, offered rooms from $20 to $30 for visitors to the beach and entertainment district near Subic Bay.
The United States turned over the Subic Bay Naval Base to the Philippines in 1991 and since then the facility has been transformed into a special economic zone. Neighboring Olongapo City was a booming red-light district for decades while the navy base supported the operations of the American navy's Seventh Fleet.
In the 20 years since the base was handed over, Olongapo has retained a red-light district but has also gained popularity as a beach resort area for Filipino families seeking to escape the heat and congestion of Manila.

HEADLINE: Etiquette Lessons for the Braggart: Step 1, Don't Pretend to Be Humble

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND

 BODY:
MOST of you are probably not aware that, in the last month, many seniors in high school have learned whether they have been accepted to their top-choice college.
Or maybe you are. Maybe, even if you have no interest in this news, you've heard it reverberating on social media and across phone lines. Some call it celebrating. Others call it bragging.
As a newcomer to all of this, I was fascinated by the self-imposed rules that people have about how and when it's proper to boast about such an achievement.
Some friends told me they thought it was fine for students to post about their acceptances and let their friends know, but too much for parents announce their son's or daughter's accomplishment online. Others felt that students should hold back in deference to peers who may have been rejected, but gave free rein to proud mothers and fathers. 
Watching people parse the sharing of good news made me think about the bigger issue of bragging. As I researched it further, it became clear that this is something most of us are conflicted about: we want to let people know about our successes, but we don't want to appear to be doing so. And we want to hear about others' victories, but not too often or too loudly.
There is a common perception that it's more acceptable to brag now than it was in the past, especially about our children. It used to be that parents didn't want their children to get swollen heads (when's the last time you heard that expression?) or, for more superstitious reasons, feared that praise would bring on the wrath of the gods, or at least bad luck.
Such trends are hard to measure. What is clear is that technology has provided ''more outlets and a lot more reinforcement,'' said Susan Krauss Whitbourne, a professor of psychology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. ''Every cute thing a baby does is on YouTube.''
There are many reasons people feel the need to publicize their successes, ranging from sharing the joy to one-upping. But what research shows is that talking about ourselves just feels good.
Last year, two Harvard neuroscientists published a paper, ''Disclosing Information About the Self Is Intrinsically Rewarding,'' in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. They conducted brain imaging and behavioral experiments and found that when people talked about themselves, there was heightened activity in the same brain regions associated with rewards from food, money or sex.
Diana I. Tamir, co-author of the study and a doctoral student at Harvard, said the research focused not on bragging, but on answering neutral questions about one's personality.
''When asked questions about themselves, there was more reward activity than when asked about someone else,'' Ms. Tamir said. And there was even more activity when the participants could choose to share information, by pressing a button, with someone outside the scanner.
Another experiment found that people were willing to give up small amounts of money to reveal information about themselves, rather than talk about someone else.
''I think there is a natural human tendency'' to talk about oneself, Ms. Tamir said. ''The interesting question is why we are motivated to share.''
Another interesting question is when sharing turns into bragging -- and the answer is often in the eye of the beholder. As one commenter wrote on the Canadian blog wondercafe.ca, ''I wonder if it's sharing if I do it and bragging if someone else does it.''
Although boasting may seem more acceptable now, Susan A. Speer, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Manchester in England, has found that ''self-praise'' is still largely considered unacceptable.
Professor Speer, a conversation analyst, looked at a variety of data, from psychiatric interventions to everyday conversations, that involved self-praise. The information came from the United States and Britain.
In her study, published last year in the Social Psychology Quarterly, Professor Speer discovered that in almost every case, directly praising oneself seemed to violate social norms.
She said people responded to self-praise negatively or, more subtly, with a long silence or a roll of the eyes.
She found that the only way to really blow your own horn -- or toot your own trumpet, as they say in Britain -- without alienating someone was to repeat something positive someone else said about you.
It's easier for a listener to respond to this kind of self-praise, Professor Speer said, by saying, for instance, ''How nice someone said that.''
Even being self-deprecating about accomplishments doesn't work. In fact, it can be even more irritating, and it has come to be known as ''humblebragging'' or ''underbragging.''
Examples? Complaining about e-mail service from Cannes or about having to sign too many autographs. As Henry Alford wrote in The New York Times last November about his annoyance with this phenomenon: ''Outright bragging expects to be met with awe, but humblebragging wants to be met with awe and sympathy.''
Oliver Burkeman, a columnist for the British newspaper The Guardian, has also written about the art of boasting while appearing not to. He argued that while technology is partly to blame, so are these economic times, because there is great pressure in a highly competitive job market to portray yourself as better than everyone else.
Often, the advice to would-be braggarts is to ''know your audience.'' Are the people you're telling (or tweeting or posting to) really interested in your child's sports victories or your brilliant cooking efforts, or should you save that information for your husband or the grandparents?
The trouble, Mr. Burkeman told me, is that it has become harder to determine who your audience is. On Facebook, for example, friends can include everyone from family members to work colleagues you barely know.
''It's unacceptable to brag about the achievements of your child to strangers, but to close friends it's great,'' said Mr. Burkeman, author of ''The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can't Stand Positive Thinking.''
Presumably, we would be sensitive to the feelings of an unemployed friend and not boast about a recent promotion. But when we're talking to a vast social network, we don't know whose buttons we're pushing.
Such confusion may be why an August 2011 post on The Times's Motherlode blog on bragging about one's children got 141 heated comments.
So to brag (or celebrate) or not? Professor Whitbourne suggests stopping before you open your mouth or type something and asking: ''What are you trying to accomplish? What is your goal? You have to ask yourself, 'Why am I sharing my information?' ''
And while most of us find incessant braggarts annoying and avoid them if possible (hey, that's what the ''hide'' option on Facebook is for), Professor Whitbourne says it is also worth noting if you are constantly irritated by people's successes. Do they make you feel insecure or resentful? Why does it matter to you, and what can you learn about yourself?
Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised that questions of how to present ourselves in the best light are so complicated. As Professor Speer noted, researchers have found that it involves a delicate balance of ''self-enhancement, accuracy and humility.''

HEADLINE: Options for Protecting Social Security

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Gary King and Samir S. Soneji rightly argue that difficult choices must be made if Social Security is to remain in place for my generation, the millennials (''Social Security: It's Worse Than You Think,'' Sunday Review, Jan. 6).
However, I think that they are utterly mistaken in suggesting that a reasonable solution is for all Americans to work until 69 or 70 simply because the average life expectancy has increased since the 1970s. Virtually all longevity gains have gone to the top 50 percent of American earners. The bottom half of the income distribution represents far more physically demanding and/or mentally monotonous jobs. These are the people least able to work later into life. 
For people like the writers and me, working until 70 may not be a problem. But suggesting that we take away the choice to retire at 67 for everyone else isn't just unrealistic; it's cruel.
ANTHONY BONEN New York, Jan. 7, 2013
The writer is a researcher at the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis, New School for Social Research.
To the Editor:
Gary King and Samir S. Soneji underscore the challenges brought about by increasing longevity combined with the large boomer cohort moving into retirement.
One strategy is delaying retirement, but studies show most older workers do not want (and may not be able) to continue in their current full-time jobs to ages 69 or 70. Rather, they want to shift to new ways of working that may be lower-paying but less demanding, more flexible and/or more meaningful.
As it now stands, most boomers have two choices: their current full-time jobs or else full-time retirement. There are few options in between.
Instead of delaying Social Security benefits, corporate and public policy makers could fashion a range of flexible positions that would not only encourage continued employment (and payroll tax contributions) but also tap the talents of boomers in ways that might enhance the public good.
PHYLLIS MOEN Minneapolis, Jan. 6, 2013
The writer is a sociologist and co-author of ''The Career Mystique.''
To the Editor:
The writers mention several possible fixes for Social Security. The worst is the idea of lowering initial benefits for workers with lifetime wages above the national average, currently $43,000. This would simply exacerbate the already shameful levels of regressiveness of the Social Security payroll tax.
But the idea of taxing wages above the current $113,700 earnings limit should be a no-brainer. Currently, a person with income of $250,000 pays only 2.8 percent in Social Security taxes. The $500,000 earner pays less than 1.5 percent. These are insignificant amounts for people at those levels, but the $50,000 earner paying 6.2 percent feels it where it hurts.
Like sales taxes, Social Security is a regressive tax. Nothing will change that. But it can be mitigated in a way that will return the system to fiscal health.
PETER GRAY Madison, Wis., Jan. 7, 2013
To the Editor:
Many Americans are living longer, healthier lives. Yet if the Social Security full retirement age is to go up, so must the age at which Americans are able to keep their jobs. Millions of middle-aged workers are being dumped for younger employees who are cheaper and, employers believe, more profitable.
Until we deal with the problem of age discrimination by strengthening and enforcing anti-discrimination laws, we should not be discussing increasing the retirement age. If you can't work and can't retire, what do you?
Older Americans want -- and need -- to keep their jobs, and should be given that option.

HEADLINE: France Battling Islamists in Mali

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER and ERIC SCHMITT; Adam Nossiter reported from Bamako and Eric Schmitt from Niamey, Niger. Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York, and Scott Sayare from Paris.

 BODY:
BAMAKO, Mali -- The international standoff with Islamists controlling northern Mali took a decisive turn on Friday, as French forces engaged in an intense battle to beat back an aggressive militant push into the center of the country.
Responding to an urgent plea for help from the Malian government, French troops carried out airstrikes against Islamist fighters, blunting an advance by hundreds of heavily armed extremists, according to French officials and Gen. Carter F. Ham, the top American military commander in Africa. One French helicopter had apparently been downed in the fighting, he said.
The Pentagon is now weighing a broad range of options to support the French effort, including enhanced intelligence-sharing and logistics support, but it is not considering sending American troops, General Ham said. 
The sudden introduction of Western troops upends months of tortured debate over how -- and when -- foreign nations should confront the Islamist seizure of northern Mali. The Obama administration and governments around world have long been alarmed that a vast territory roughly twice the size of Germany could so easily fall into the hands of extremists, calling it a safe haven where terrorists were building their ranks and seeking to extend their influence throughout the region and beyond.
Yet for months, the Islamists have appeared increasingly unshakable in their stronghold, carrying out public amputations, whippings and stonings as the weak Malian army retreated south and African nations debated how to find money and soldiers to recapture the territory.
All of that changed this week, when the Islamists suddenly charged southward with a force of 800 to 900 fighters in 50 to 200 vehicles, taking over a frontier town that had been the de facto line of government control, according to General Ham and a Western diplomat. Worried that there was little to stop the militants from storming ever further into Mali, France -- for the second time in less than two years -- intervened with guns and bombs into a former African colony rent by turmoil.
''French forces brought their support this afternoon to Malian Army units to fight against terrorist elements,'' President François Hollande of France said in a statement to reporters in Paris on Friday, noting that the operation would ''last as long as necessary.''
''The terrorists should know that France will always be there,'' he added.
Sanda Ould Boumana, a spokesman for Ansar Dine, one of the Islamist groups that controls northern Mali along with Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, known as A.Q.I.M., and its allies, insisted in a telephone interview that the militants had held their ground.
''Some planes came and bombed some civilians,'' he said. ''A woman was killed. It's a well-known scenario. There wasn't even combat. Planes bombed a mosque. That's it.''
Mr. Boumana called the intervention illegal, saying the French had ''come to support a bunch of murderers. That's France, and that's the West. We are not surprised.''
Malian officials in the capital, Bamako, called the French military strike a welcome shift in the standoff.
''It was evident that the Malian Army would never have been able to handle this,'' said Tiébilé Dramé, a leading opposition politician. ''The French intervention goes beyond what was hoped for. No one was expecting things would go this quickly. France had said it wouldn't intervene, and Malians were hoping for a rapid intervention.''
Why the Islamists provoked a military strike by capturing the village of Konna on Thursday, a possible prelude to attacking bigger towns on their way to the capital, more than 300 miles away, remained unclear. They were not facing a military intervention for many months, and even then it was not expected to include Western forces.
''Was this a move by A.Q.I.M. toward Bamako? Were they making a move to simply strengthen negotiating position, to gain a little more territory?'' General Ham said. ''The real question is, now what?'' he said, adding that discussions were now under way among Washington, Paris and African governments in the region.
The big prize the Islamists evidently sought -- capturing the major Malian government airfield nearby in Sévaré, which is vital for any military intervention in the north of Mali -- seemed to be outside their grasp on Friday.
But while senior Malian officers heralded their new military ''partners on the ground,'' some warned that the Islamists remained strong and could still press forward. ''It's temporary,'' said one officer, who was not authorized to speak publicly. ''They have the means to advance.''
Holding off the Islamists, moreover, is a far cry from retaking the north. While tens of thousands of civilians have fled the area, many others remain in the ancient city of Timbuktu and other towns under Islamist control, leaving them highly vulnerable in the event urban warfare breaks out.
Beyond that, extremists in the north, who finance themselves in part by kidnapping and ransoming foreigners, are still holding more than a dozen hostages and have sometimes threatened to kill them if an attack takes place.
Still, Western and Malian officials said the French assault had changed the dynamic of the conflict, accelerating plans for a broader military strategy.
''What's sure now is that things will not happen as we thought they would a month ago,'' said a Western diplomat, who was not authorized to speak publicly. ''We've told Ecowas countries to accelerate preparations to send troops,'' he added, referring to the 15-member Economic Community of West African States, which has agreed to provide an intervention force.
France has a long history of expeditionary military actions in its former African colonies. Mr. Hollande had said that France would not send troops into combat in Mali until Friday, when it seemed that the government in Bamako might collapse. But the French had positioned military contingents near Mali, with deployments in Senegal, Burkina Faso and the Ivory Coast, for example. There were also persistent reports that French special forces were in Mali.
Under Mr. Hollande's predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, France also carried out airstrikes to dislodge Ivory Coast's strongman, Laurent Gbagbo, in 2011, bringing a quick end to a bloody four-month civil war precipitated by Mr. Gbagbo's refusal to leave office after an electoral defeat.

HEADLINE: Rockefeller Will Leave Senate After Five Terms

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER; Jonathan Weisman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, a longtime liberal voice in Congress, announced on Friday that he would not seek a sixth term in 2014, providing an opening for Republicans to cut into the Democratic Senate majority.
The decision by Mr. Rockefeller, 75, who also served two terms as governor of West Virginia, was no surprise and came after he gave a Senate floor speech last June that angered the state's politically influential coal industry. He is the first incumbent to announce he will not run in a challenging election cycle for Democrats who will be defending a seat not only in conservative West Virginia but in Republican-leaning states like Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana and Montana. 
Mr. Rockefeller would have faced his stiffest challenge since joining the Senate in 1985. Representative Shelley Moore Capito, a seven-term Republican, had announced her intention to challenge Mr. Rockefeller, and his retirement could spur more interest.
Speaking in Charleston, W.Va., with his wife, Sharon, at his side, Mr. Rockefeller said his decision to retire was not an easy one.
''As I approach 50 years of public service in West Virginia, I've decided that 2014 will be the right moment for me to find new ways to fight for the causes I believe in and to spend more time with my incredible family,'' said the senator, who is chairman of the Commerce Committee and has played a critical role in fights to expand health care coverage. ''For the next two years in the Senate, and well beyond, I will continue working tirelessly on behalf of all West Virginians. Championing those most in need has been my life's calling, and I will never stop fighting to make a difference for the people who mean so much to me.''
The departure of Mr. Rockefeller, a great-grandson of John D. Rockefeller, the oil tycoon, will unofficially bring to a close the tradition of dynastic reigns of powerful American families shaping public policy. When Representative Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island left the House in 2011 shortly after the death of his father, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Congress did not have a member of the Kennedy clan for the first time in six decades. However, this month, Joseph P. Kennedy III, grandson of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, was sworn in as a new congressman from Massachusetts.
Ms. Capito is the favored choice of many Republicans in West Virginia, though some conservatives have questioned her candidacy. She also comes from a political family. Her father, Arch A. Moore Jr., is a former governor of West Virginia, and a former rival of Mr. Rockefeller. In 1972, he beat Mr. Rockefeller in the governor's race, only to lose to him in a rematch eight years later.
West Virginia, with its deep Democratic past, has not been represented by a Republican in the Senate since the late 1950s. While the state has increasingly trended Republican -- President Obama did not carry a single county in the state -- its other senator, Joe Manchin III, and Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin are both Democrats. Still, Republicans see a prime opportunity.
''Senator Rockefeller's decision not to seek re-election makes West Virginia an even stronger pickup opportunity for Republicans in 2014,'' said Rob Collins, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. ''Voters next year will have a clear choice between a Democrat who will be a loyal vote for President Obama and Harry Reid as they try to kill West Virginia's coal industry and bankrupt our country with reckless government spending, versus a Republican who will serve as an effective check-and-balance on their liberal agenda and work to get our country's economy back on track.''
But Democrats, who had a very successful 2012 election cycle, said they would retain Mr. Rockefeller's seat.
''While we will greatly miss him in our caucus, I am confident we can elect an independent-minded Democrat to his seat,'' said Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ''Democrats maintain nearly a 2-to-1 voter registration advantage over Republicans in West Virginia, and I know there are a number of leaders there who will consider taking this next step to serve their state.''
With the issue of gun control gaining increasing national prominence and likely to be an issue in 2014, the success of the Democrats here will hinge in part on Mr. Manchin and his willingness to fight hard for the seat.
The idea that Mr. Rockefeller, who has had health problems in recent years, would not seek a sixth term became widespread last June when he gave a Senate speech opposing Republican attempts to prevent regulation on mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The speech prompted outrage from business interests in West Virginia, a state that relies heavily on coal. At the time, Mr. Rockefeller warned that the coal industry needed to ''face reality,'' arguing that they ''would rather attack false enemies and deny real problems than find solutions.''
Mr. Rockefeller's service as a Vista volunteer brought him to West Virginia in 1964 after graduating from Harvard University in 1961, where he made his home and quickly began his career in public service, joining the state's House of Delegates in 1966. He championed liberal causes, supporting President Bill Clinton's thwarted attempt at near-universal health insurance coverage and Mr. Obama's successful Affordable Care Act nearly 20 years later.

HEADLINE: Justices to Hear Case On Groups' Free Speech

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to decide cases on the First Amendment rights of groups fighting AIDS and the Fifth Amendment rights of people who refuse to answer questions from the police.
The First Amendment case arose from a 2003 law that requires private groups that receive federal money to combat AIDS abroad to have ''a policy explicitly opposing prostitution.'' The restriction does not apply to other recipients, including the World Health Organization.
The Supreme Court has said the government may not attach strings to money it provides to some people and groups if those conditions infringe on constitutional rights -- even though the government has no obligation to spend the money in the first place. 
In 2011, a divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, blocked the law, saying it ''compels grantees to espouse the government's position on a controversial issue.'' The full appeals court declined to rehear the case. Dissenting from that ruling, Judge José A. Cabranes wrote that the measure was ''an uncomplicated and common-sensical condition of federal funding.''
In 2007, considering an earlier version of the program, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld it. The federal government asked the Supreme Court to hear the case from New York to resolve the conflict.
In urging the Supreme Court not to hear the case, the groups challenging the law said it interfered with their work. They said they ''generally avoid taking policy positions or making statements that are likely to offend'' the nations they work in and the people they seek to help. ''Adopting a policy that explicitly opposes prostitution'' would do harm to the groups' ''effectiveness in working with high-risk groups to fight H.I.V./AIDS,'' their brief said.
Justice Elena Kagan recused herself from the case, United States Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International, No. 12-10, presumably because she had worked on it as United States solicitor general.
The second case, Salinas v. Texas, No. 12-246, addresses a major open question in the court's Fifth Amendment jurisprudence: May the failure to answer a police officer's questions before an arrest be used against a defendant at trial?
The Supreme Court has said the amendment's protection against self-incrimination applies after arrest and at trial. But it has never decided, in the words of a 1980 decision, ''whether or under what circumstances pre-arrest silence'' in the face of questioning by law enforcement personnel is entitled to protection.
The case arose from the 1992 murders of two brothers, Juan and Hector Garza, in Houston. Among the evidence the police found were discarded shotgun shells.
They questioned Genovevo Salinas, who was said to have attended a party at the Garzas' apartment. Mr. Salinas answered questions for almost an hour but would not say if a shotgun the police had taken from his home would match the recovered shells.
The question about the shells was the only one Mr. Salinas refused to answer. Instead, a police officer later testified, he ''looked down at the floor, shuffled his feet, bit his bottom lip, clinched his hands in his lap, began to tighten up.''
Mr. Salinas was charged with murder after a friend told the police that Mr. Salinas had confessed. The jury deadlocked at his first trial. At a retrial, prosecutors again relied on testimony about the confession and ballistics evidence. They now also emphasized Mr. Salinas's silence about the shells.
''An innocent person,'' one prosecutor told the jury, ''is going to say: 'What are you talking about? I didn't do that. I wasn't there.' He didn't respond that way. He didn't say, 'No, it's not going to match up.' ''
Mr. Salinas was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison.
In urging the justices not to hear the case, prosecutors in Texas said Mr. Salinas had effectively answered the question about the shells through his conduct. In any event, they said, the Fifth Amendment does not apply when ''there is no official compulsion to speak.''

HEADLINE: Gun Sales Surge as Nation Weighs Tougher Limits

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER; Reporting was contributed by Kim Severson in Villa Rica, Ga.; Trip Gabriel in New York; Ian Lovett in Simi Valley, Calif.; Campbell Robertson in New Orleans; and Michael D. Shear in Washington.

 BODY:
As Washington focuses on what Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will propose next week to curb gun violence, gun and ammunition sales are spiking in the rest of the country as people rush to expand their arsenals in advance of any restrictions that might be imposed.
People were crowded five deep at the tiny counter of a gun shop near Atlanta, where a pastor from Knoxville, Tenn., was among the customers who showed up in person after the store's Web site halted sales because of low inventory. Emptying gun cases and bare shelves gave a picked-over feel to gun stores in many states. High-capacity magazines, which some state and federal officials want to ban or restrict, were selling briskly across the country: one Iowa dealer said that 30-round magazines were fetching five times what they sold for just weeks ago.
Gun dealers and buyers alike said that the rapid growth in gun sales -- which began climbing significantly after President Obama's re-election and soared after the Dec. 14 shooting at a school in Newtown, Conn., prompted him to call for new gun laws -- shows little sign of abating. 
December set a record for the criminal background checks performed before many gun purchases, a strong indication of a big increase in sales, according to an analysis of federal data by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a gun industry trade group. Adjusting the federal data to try to weed out background checks that were unrelated to firearms sales, the group reported that 2.2 million background checks were performed last month, an increase of 58.6 percent over the same period in 2011. Some gun dealers said in interviews that they had never seen such demand.
''If I had 1,000 AR-15s I could sell them in a week,'' said Jack Smith, an independent gun dealer in Des Moines, referring to the popular style of semiautomatic rifle that drew national attention after Adam Lanza used one to kill 20 children and 6 adults at a Newtown school. ''When I close, they beat on the glass to be let in,'' Mr. Smith said of his customers. ''They'll wave money at me.''
Mr. Smith said many people were stocking up on high-capacity magazines in anticipation that they might be banned. Two weeks ago, he said, a 30-round rifle magazine was $12, but it now fetches $60. Popular online retailers were out of many 20- and 30-round rifle magazines.
In Washington, Mr. Biden said the task force he leads is ''shooting for Tuesday'' to make its recommendations to President Obama about preventing gun violence. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, one of the nation's leading gun control groups, said its top priority was to close the loopholes that currently allow 40 percent of gun sales to be made without background checks.
Some groups that support gun control urged the White House not to focus too much energy on an assault weapons ban, which they said could be hard to persuade Congress to pass. Officials at Third Way, a left-leaning research group in Washington, urged the president to save his political capital for higher-priority goals like universal background checks and cracking down on gun trafficking.
Outside Greta's Guns, a gun store in Simi Valley, Calif., about an hour northwest of downtown Los Angeles, several customers said that they opposed any assault weapons ban, but would support more thorough background checks.
George Gray, 60, who said that he already owned ''more arms than arms to bear them,'' said that he was in favor of more background checks. ''If you own a weapon, you should be stable,'' said Mr. Gray, who said he had come from Los Angeles to buy a gun for his daughter. ''You should be accountable for your actions. I don't mind stricter background checks. What we've done with the mental health in this country -- these people used to get care and were in facilities. And in most of these instances, it's been people with mental problems.''
Some customers at Greta's said that they wanted to buy guns before any new gun control measures made it more difficult. Bob Davis, 64, said that he wanted a new pistol. ''They want to take guns out of citizens' hands,'' he said. ''So as a consequence I ordered a gun. And they're not going to be able to get me a gun for like six months, because of the backlog. They can't make guns fast enough.''
The gun industry expected a surge in sales even before the Newtown shooting. Gun sales rose after President Obama was first elected in 2008, and many manufacturers expected an increase in gun sales in the event of his re-election. ''We believe the continued economic uncertainty and the outcome of the 2012 presidential election is likely to continue to spur both firearms and ammunition sales,'' the Freedom Group, which owns Bushmaster, the company that makes the rifle used in Newtown, wrote in a financial report on the quarter that ended Sept. 30.
The possibility that the federal assault weapons ban -- which lasted from 1994 to 2004 -- might be reinstated was enough to spur sales of semiautomatic rifles with military-style features.
Dale Raby, who manages one of two Gus's Guns shops in Green Bay, Wis., said his inventory of guns and ammunition was almost cleaned out, and that most of the interest was in AR-15-style rifles.
''I had almost fistfights over the remaining inventory of that type gun,'' he said.
Joel Alioto, 44, an Iraq war veteran who lives in the area, said he recently sold an AR-15 rifle at a gun show for $1,700, more than three times what he had paid for it. ''I think the shooting in Connecticut was a terrible thing,'' said Mr. Alioto, who is unemployed. ''But before the shooting the gun was worth 500 bucks. I don't think I did anything wrong. I wanted to get my teeth done, get a computer and pay for my first year of Bible college.''
Brad Williamson, one of the owners of Quint's Sporting Goods in Saraland, Ala., said the waiting lists for some products are double what they normally are -- especially for guns that are mentioned in the gun control debate. ''Whenever there's a blip on the news about a particular model, the next day people want to come in wanting whatever they named,'' he said. ''When Biden makes his recommendation next week, you're going to see another surge.''
At Georgia Arms in Villa Rica, Ga., west of Atlanta, the ammunition business was brisk, with dozens of the yellow bins that usually held ammunition empty. The Rev. Laurence Hesser, a pastor at Memorial United Methodist Church near Knoxville, stopped by because he had been unable to buy ammunition on the shop's Web site, which halted sales because inventory was so low.
He likened the current run on ammunition to the rush to buy Twinkies last year after its maker, Hostess Brands, announced it was closing. ''It's the same thing,'' he said. ''When you are threatened with the possibility that you are going to lose something, you get a bunch of it.''

HEADLINE: They Got 2012 Right. What About 2013?

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
To many politicians, the deal that raised taxes on the wealthy and averted the fiscal cliff was a sellout, a cop-out, a Band-Aid -- in short, nothing good. And now the debt ceiling showdown is looming. So why have stock investors cheered, pushing the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to five-year highs?
My annual survey suggests that investment experts are cautiously upbeat about the economy and the stock market (but not bonds) for 2013, even though they acknowledge that political dysfunction in Washington poses risks. The tax deal may have upset Tea Party Republicans looking for big cuts in entitlement spending and liberals demanding even bigger tax increases on the wealthy. But investors seem to be taking the long view that the warring factions did in the end reach a deal, and it amounts to a $4 trillion stimulus compared with what would have happened if Congress had done nothing. Stimulus may be a bad word in Washington, but many investors seem to believe that continued deficit spending and only a modest tax increase will be good for the economy and corporate profits, at least this year. 
The experts I consulted a year ago -- Bill Miller for stocks, Bill Gross for bonds and Karl E. Case for real estate -- proved accurate in their predictions for 2012. So I asked them for a return engagement. I also spoke to Byron Wien, vice chairman and a senior adviser at Blackstone. Last year, Mr. Wien was one of the few pundits who was exactly right about the stock market, predicting that the S.& P. 500 would close the year ''over 1,400.'' The index ended the year at 1,426, a gain of 13.4 percent for the year.
Bill Miller:
'The great bond bear market has begun'
Perhaps the biggest comeback of 2012 belongs to Mr. Miller of Legg Mason, who became a mutual fund legend by beating the S.& P. 500 for 15 consecutive years, from 1991 to 2005. Then, during 2008 and the financial panic, he seemingly lost his magic touch. His fund plunged 55 percent. The Wall Street Journal, in its headline about the fund's dismal returns, spoke of his ''defeat.'' And after another disappointing year in 2011, he retired as head of the Legg Mason Value Trust, the firm's flagship fund.
But Mr. Miller kept his hand in the market, managing the much smaller Legg Mason Capital Management Opportunity Trust. When I sought him out a year ago, reasoning that even the most brilliant investors can be expected to have a few bad years, he was bullish on stocks. That proved good advice. Mr. Miller's fund gained over 40 percent in 2012, and was the top-performing mutual fund in Morningstar's database. How did he do it?
Mr. Miller made big bets on the battered and out-of-favor homebuilding and financial sectors, the kind of contrarian strategy that served him well for so many years. Major holdings like Pulte Homes (which gained 160 percent over the past year) and Bank of America (which nearly doubled) were some his best-performing stocks.
Mr. Miller remains optimistic about stocks for 2013, with an asterisk. When I reached him this week, he offered these predictions: ''The great bond bear market has begun, starting with Treasuries, which should see years of losses as interest rates gradually normalize. Equities, which outperformed bonds in 2012, will continue to do well, driven by rising earnings, strong free cash flow, solid profit margins, low inflation and attractive valuation relative to bonds. The path of least resistance for stocks and the economy is higher. The chief risk is the dysfunctional political environment, which could derail what otherwise is a very promising outlook.''
Mr. Wien, whose long career on Wall Street included stints at Morgan Stanley and Pequot Capital, told me he's ''gloomy'' about prospects in Washington. ''We can't solve our problems simply by getting the rich to pay more. We have to broaden the tax base, revise the tax code and tackle the structural problems we aren't facing. We need to deal with entitlements. The latest deal did absolutely nothing to address that. I don't know if democracy can solve these problems.''
Despite his success at predicting the market last year, Mr. Wien isn't putting a number on the S.& P. 500 this year, but his expectations are modest. He expects the S.& P. 500 to test 1,300 at some point, which would be about a 10 percent decline from current levels, before ending the year about where it is now. ''I don't expect the stock market to do much this year,'' he said. ''Most analysts are forecasting returns of 10 percent or more, but I think earnings could be down for the year, which would make it hard for the market to gain that much.''
But he's optimistic about stock markets in some other countries, especially China, where stocks lagged last year, and Japan, which has been in the doldrums for years. He's forecasting a 20 percent gain this year for Chinese shares.
Bill Gross: 'Ashes in our stocking'
After a rough 2011, Mr. Gross, the highly regarded bond expert and a founder of the investment firm Pimco, bounced back last year. Pimco's Total Return Fund, which Mr. Gross manages, returned over 10 percent in 2012, a year when short-term Treasury bonds were yielding close to zero. A year ago, he told me that tax-free municipal bonds, which he termed a ''deserted'' asset class because of widespread fears of municipal bankruptcies, would provide healthy returns. He was right: municipal bond returns averaged over 7 percent last year, and some bonds earned double-digit returns
But Mr. Gross is far more muted now. ''I'm afraid there are going to be ashes in our stocking this year,'' he said, ''and that applies to almost all asset classes. Bonds are priced not just for perfection, but with close to 0 percent yields. The juice has been squeezed out of the orange. You just can't get to 10 percent returns.''
Will 2013 be the year that interest rates in the United States finally start to rise, which could devastate returns for fixed-income investors? (Bond prices move inversely to interest rates.) A growing number of experts (including Mr. Miller) think so, but not Mr. Gross. ''I don't see a lot of risk in bonds,'' Mr. Gross said. ''The Federal Reserve is buying, and there's no real risk until the Fed declares the war is over. It's looking for 6.5 percent unemployment. By any reasonable standard, that's going to be a long time coming -- certainly not in 2013, and probably not for at least two to three more years.''
Mr. Gross likes bonds from emerging market countries as well as from Italy and Spain. And for conservative investors who prize safety, he recommends Treasury Inflation Protected Bonds, or TIPs, even though their nominal yields are minuscule. ''I like countries like Brazil and Mexico especially,'' he said. ''They have half the debt the United States does relative to G.D.P. They have much better growth prospects. Mexican bonds yield about 6 percent and Brazil is at 8.5 percent. And an emerging market bond fund that holds countries like this would be attractive.''
Karl Case: 'A lot of reasons to be optimistic'
Last year will probably go down as the year that residential real estate prices hit bottom and began to rise after the collapse that began in 2007. This came as no surprise to Mr. Case, an emeritus professor of economics at Wellesley College. Mr. Case's name is practically synonymous with real estate values, since he helped create the widely cited S.& P. Case-Shiller Index of housing prices (along with the Yale economics professor Robert Shiller). A year ago, he told me it was a ''terrific'' time to buy a house.
He was right, at least for most cities. Last month, Standard & Poor's reported that its Case-Shiller 20-city composite index showed a 4.5 percent gain. Prices in hard-hit Phoenix have now gained for 13 consecutive months. And even in New York City, which along with Chicago was one of just two markets where average prices dropped in 2012, prices of high-end properties hit records, a trend Mr. Case expects to continue.
''Phoenix is amazing,'' Mr. Case said last week. ''California is strong, and it's doing what it's done in every other cycle, which is important, because California makes up one-fourth of the housing value in the United States. But residential real estate is not going to go up like a rocket ship.''
That's because the slump was so severe that expectations for homeownership have been sharply lowered. Talk in Washington of eliminating or curbing the mortgage deduction in the name of tax reform is weighing on prices. And Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both taxpayer-supported, are still guaranteeing most mortgages, which isn't sustainable, he said.
As a result, ''the recovery won't be anything like we've seen in the past,'' Mr. Case predicted. ''We're cheering because we got to 800,000 housing starts. That's still weak. It only looks good because we dug ourselves into such a deep hole.'' But real estate tends to move in longer cycles, and Mr. Case is still saying now is a good time to buy. ''There are a lot of reasons to be optimistic, but cautiously so,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Worthwhile Japanese Initiative

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Never mind the motivation. 

 BODY:
Shinzo Abe has taken Japan off in a surprisingly Keynesian direction. Noah Smith points out, again, that he's probably doing it for disreputable reasons, mainly old-fashioned LDP pork-barrel (katsu barrel? tofu barrel?) politics. But this may not matter. 
Noah also raises a different point: does Japan really need a big boost? He points to the low measured unemployment rate; after a couple of decades of watching Japanese unemployment numbers, I don't think that tells us much. But there is a case to be made that Japan's economy is in better shape than most people believe. Overall GDP growth since the crisis has been roughly comparable to the euro area, but with far worse demography:
In fact, given that Japan's working-age population is actually shrinking, there's a reasonable argument to the effect that Japan is closer to potential output than the US.
But if Japan is doing relatively well in cyclical terms, it's still far from clear that macroeconomic caution is appropriate. After all, Japan has a much longer-term monetary issue: persistent deflation, which among other things has meant that Japanese real interest rates have been well above those in the United States even though nominal rates are low. (I wrote about that here.)
What Japan needs, then, is to boot itself out of its deflationary trap; and a situation where there isn't too much economic slack is actually a very good time to do that.
And here's an important point that has gone remarkably unreported, except on a few financial blogs: something dramatic does seem to be happening on the expected inflation front. Here's the 5-year breakeven, the spread between indexed and non-indexed bonds:
The big move actually came before Abe took office, maybe reflecting the sense that the political environment had changed and that the Bank of Japan's freedom to impose monetary orthodoxy was about to end. Whatever caused it, this is a remarkable change -- it's the kind of upward move in inflation expectations advocates of radical monetary policy in the US can only dream of. And coupled with a fiscal boost, it could mean that Japan's long deflationary era is finally coming to an end.
So while I very much dislike what Abe stands for on cultural issues, and take very seriously Noah Smith's warning that he may be basically about patronage politics, none of that matters on the macro front; it sure looks as if Japan is, for whatever reason, doing the kinds of things an economy still stuck in the Lesser Depression should be doing.

HEADLINE: Taking Violence Against Women Seriously....

BYLINE: NICHOLAS KRISTOF


HIGHLIGHT: Readers comment on my column about gender violence as a global human rights challenge, from India to America. 

 BODY:
My Sunday column grew out of the rape/murder in Delhi. At the time I was in China, reporting there, and so I didn't weigh in. But this is of course an issue that I've covered in one way or another for decades and that Sheryl and I tried to call attention to in Half the Sky, and friends began emailing me about other incidents of sexual violence or gender violence that deserved attention. An American woman raped in India, whom the authorities weren't interested in. A 13-year-old girl dying of injuries caused by rapein Liberia. A separate incident in which an 8-year-old girl is kidnapped by a pimp in Liberia. A woman in San Francisco allegedly doused with gasoline by her boyfriend and set on fire. A girl in Nepal burned alivebecause she refused a marriage offer. And so on and so on. 
None of these are news in the conventional sense, yet collectively they should amount to news. And its news not only about a social injustice but also about an economic impediment to development. If half the population in India fears taking a bus, then that's a burden for economic development.
Then on top of all that, I've been thinking of the events in Steubenville, Ohio, in which football players allegedly carted a comatose 16-year-girl around and raped her, possibly even urinated on her. We've got so much work to do right here at home -- and Congress can't even bother to renew the Violence Against Women Act or the Trafficking Victims Protection Act! Grrr. Read the column and post your thoughts.

 BODY:
 Today's Times 

        
As Chuck Hagel heads into contentious confirmation hearings to become President Obama's defense secretary, he remains estranged from his close friend Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, over policy differences that started with the Iraq war, spread into bitter presidential politics and ultimately damaged their bond. Elisabeth Bumiller delves into the differing accounts of their dissolved relationship.
 

        
Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, announced on Friday that he would not run for re-election, Ashley Parker reports. His retirement could be challenging for the party, as Democrats will be defending a seat not only in conservative West Virginia but in other Republican-leaning states as well.

        
Makers of popular video games like Call of Duty and Mortal Kombat are rallying for support in Washington after the massacre in Newtown, Conn. spurred threats of legislative restrictions on violent video games, Eric Lichtblau writes.

        
Senate Democratic leaders wrote to President Obama on Friday asking him to take "any lawful steps" available in the face of Republican opposition if it means avoiding a default on the nation's debt, Jonathan Weisman reports. The letter signals an escalation in the war of words over the ceiling for federal borrowing.

        
The Obama inaugural committee is struggling to meet its $50 million fund-raising goal, especially when it comes to enlisting corporate donors, Nicholas Confessore reports.
 Weekly Address 

        
President Obama delivered his weekly address on Saturday after meeting with President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, updating the American people on "how we will end this war, bring our troops home, and continue the work of rebuilding America." Afghan troops would take the lead on security across the country this spring as American forces shift to a supporting role. "And by the end of the year, America's war in Afghanistan will be over," he said, thanking the service members and diplomats for their sacrifices. With a focus on advancing the economy and fixing infrastructure and immigration, Mr. Obama acknowledged that "after more than a decade of war, the nation we need to rebuild is our own."

HEADLINE: Industry's New Year Buffet: Entrees and a Few Desserts

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
THE annual North American International Auto Show, which opens in Detroit on Monday with two days of press previews, is off life support after a few touch-and-go years when various automakers pulled out and some threatened to go elsewhere.
More than 50 concept cars and production models are set to be revealed. While the volume of introductions is not overwhelming -- shows in Geneva, Paris and Frankfurt may feature twice as many -- the vehicles being shown are critically important, including new pickup truck designs from Ford and General Motors, revamped Mercedes-Benz E-Class models and a next-generation Chevrolet Corvette.
Sales ended 2012 on a strong note, so automakers are unveiling their latest models with high expectations. Here are some of the anticipated highlights:
ACURA The MDX crossover gets a complete makeover, including a much-needed nose job, in a concept version that is likely to differ relatively little from the production-ready version that will be seen at the New York auto show in March. 
AUDI Having rolled out new versions of its top sellers over the last couple of years, Audi will be in Detroit to promote performance tweaks for the existing lineup. In addition to a mild face-lift of the R8 supercar, Audi will show a convertible version of its powerful RS5 coupe, an S-Line performance version of the Q5 crossover and possibly an RS version of its big A7.
BENTLEY With 625 horsepower and a top speed of 202 m.p.h., the latest version of the Continental GTC Speed convertible will be an even faster version of what I once called the world's fastest four-person hair dryer.
BMW The popular 3 Series coupes are being revised and spun off into a new 4 Series line; the new car is longer, lower, wider and curvier. BMW is also showing a high-performance 560-horsepower M version of the 6 Series Gran Coupe.
CADILLAC Remember the Converj concept coupe that Cadillac unveiled to great fanfare in 2009? It's back in revised form as the 2014 ELR plug-in hybrid, which some are calling the ''Voltillac'' because of the car's electronic kinship with the Chevrolet Volt.
CHEVROLET Promoting the new seventh-generation Corvette is Chevy's main aim at the show. But while the halo sports car is certainly the most delectable morsel on G.M.'s dessert menu, meat-and-potato entrees will also be served, like the 2014 Silverado pickup and Impala sedan.
CHRYSLER With little actual news, Chrysler's marketers turned to conjuring up special packages for existing models like the 300 sedan. The latest is a Motown-theme version with a sound system enhanced for rhythm and blues and preloaded songs by Motown stars.
DODGE In recent years, Dodge was stripped of its truck line (now badged as Rams), its Viper sports car (now an SRT) and its Magnum wagon (now deader than Plymouth). So Dodge will concentrate on its Dart subcompact at the show, adding a GT version with added power and performance.
FORD The long-running game of crosstown one-upmanship continues as Ford rushes to greet G.M.'s new pickups with a sneak preview of its still-percolating 2015 F-150. Ford is also showing new Transit vans, a new turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 and a 5-cylinder 3.2-liter diesel engine.
HONDA With the CR-V enlarged and the Element discontinued, Honda has a hole at the low end of its crossover lineup. So it will show a concept version of a model based on the Fit hatchback. Production is expected in Mexico in 2014.
HYUNDAI Having made no secret of its desire to move upmarket, the Korean automaker will unveil a luxury sedan concept that could be the basis for the next-generation Genesis sedan, expected as a 2014 model.
INFINITI The G37 entry-luxury sedan has been redesigned and gets a new name: the Q50. The larger M sedan becomes the Q70, but it will remain largely unchanged for now.
JEEP Didn't we just see a new Grand Cherokee? If that's how it seems, you're probably thinking of the recent SRT version. But it's already time for a restyled and re-engineered Grand Cherokee. The 2014 model will get much better fuel economy with an 8-speed automatic transmission, and both diesel and SRT performance versions will be offered.
LEXUS The LF-CC concept shown in September in Paris has changed, slightly, into the production version of the IS compact sedan. The IS, which will also come later as a hybrid, shares a platform and a 3.5-liter V-6 with the larger GS sedan. But for those Lexus buyers who have been clamoring for even less power and torque, an entry-level 2.5-liter 4-cylinder will also be offered.
LINCOLN Desperate for a reset, Ford's luxury division is now calling itself the Lincoln Motor Company, and its business plan is to remake Fords into Lincolns by adding features and raising prices. The latest of these is the MKC, a well-garnished rendition of the latest Ford Escape.
MASERATI Although this Fiat-owned brand has aspirations to sell a lot more cars than it does now, that's a tall order for a company with essentially two models. But the redesigned Quattroporte sedan, to be shown here, should provide a jump start.
MAZDA NBC once used the slogan ''It's New to You!'' to promote reruns of shows you might have missed. That would work for the Mazda 6 as well: for some inexplicable reason, Mazda unveiled its biggest sedan at the Moscow auto show. It was put on display again, with little fanfare, in Los Angeles six weeks ago. Now, in case you missed it, it will appear in Detroit. The car, which will bring new fuel-saving technology to a highly competitive class, is actually worth a look.
MERCEDES-BENZ One might think that Mercedes would have reserved its showing of the midcycle revamping of the E-Class sedan and wagon for one of the European shows later this year. But the car is an icon in America -- it's a taxi in Germany -- and will thus make its debut in America. The biggest Mercedes news will not happen in the show hall, but at an off-site gala where the 2014 CLA, a small $30,000 front-drive sedan, will get a sneak preview. It will then be whisked away until its official debut at the Geneva show in March.
NISSAN For those disappointed that the restyled 2013 Versa lineup did not include a hatchback, the mourning is over. The 2014 hatchback will be featured at a lavish new display stand, a splashy embrace of a show that Nissan actually skipped for three years when the industry was on the ropes. Nissan will also show a hybrid design study, the Resonance, that will hint at the look of the brand's future crossovers.

HEADLINE: Cinematic Polish for an Evolving Shore Town

BYLINE: By TAMMY LA GORCE

 BODY:
ASBURY PARK, N.J.
''WE do things a little different in Asbury Park,'' Nancy Sabino remarked recently at a gathering of a dozen or so people attending a special event at the ShowRoom Cinema, her art-house movie theater here.
She was referring to the refreshments that the group sampled in the smallest of the newly reopened theater's three screening rooms. ''You've heard of wine and cheese tastings, right? Here we do beer and chocolate,'' said Ms. Sabino, 60, of Asbury Park. 
The tasting -- confections from Donna & Company, a Kenilworth chocolatier, paired with beer from Lush, a neighborhood wine and spirits store -- was part of a fund-raising event for the Monmouth County Arts Council; it preceded a screening of the documentary ''Beauty Is Embarrassing,'' directed by Neil Berkeley. After the film, the 30-person audience -- both those who attended the tasting and those who came simply for the film -- stayed for a discussion, via Skype, with the artist Wayne White, the subject of the film.
It was not the sort of experience the typical multiplex is likely to replicate. But as Ms. Sabino suggested, Asbury Park seldom tries for typical, at least where the arts are concerned.
Ms. Sabino and her partner, Michael Sodano, introduced the ShowRoom in 2009 in a 2,000-square-foot space across the street from its current location. Last year, they set in motion a plan to expand that would double their space and add two more theaters. Their new building opened in late November, after a construction project that cost around $500,000 and was delayed by Hurricane Sandy and its aftermath. The biggest theater now seats 75, the second-biggest 25 and the smallest, where the tasting was held, 12.
''Our opening date was pushed back by a few weeks, but in effect everyone was so consumed with the aftermath of the storm no one was going to come out anyway," Ms. Sabino said.
Business since then has been ''good -- so far, so good,'' said Mr. Sodano, 60, with patrons coming to see independent and art-house films like ''Searching for Sugar Man,'' ''Mahler on the Couch'' and ''Chasing Ice.''
They are the sorts of films people would ''normally have to go to New York to see,'' said Dennis Carroll, 70, of Asbury Park, a ShowRoom regular who was at the tasting. But films that appeal to those who favor such releases over the latest superhero franchise are not the only draw.
The multiple theaters lend themselves to live performances -- ''readings, theatrical performances, poetry slams, comedy,'' Mr. Sodano said. Though the ShowRoom had them before, it can now host a live event at the same time as a screening, for example. By late December, the ShowRoom had presented a standup comedy show, the first in a planned series, and a discussion with Andrew Demirjian, a communication professor at Monmouth University, and his students in the 75-seat theater.
''This is the type of community that supports that kind of programming,'' Mr. Sodano said. In weeks to come, the theater plans to show Oscar-nominated short films and a series of food-related documentaries that will tie into promotions with local restaurants.
Mr. Sodano and Ms. Sabino, who also run a business called Eventure, which produces corporate presentations and documentaries, moved to Asbury Park from North Caldwell four years ago, seeing an opportunity there. ''There was no theater in town, and we were greatly impressed by the vibe of the city. It had this sort of unfinished quality,'' Ms. Sabino said.
From the standpoint of local culture, that unfinished quality may be approaching something more complete.
In late 2011, the Shore Institute of the Contemporary Arts, a museum with rotating exhibitions that also hosts open-mike events and other performances, moved to Asbury Park from Long Branch. This month, the city introduced a new public arts space when the Asbury Park Musical Heritage Foundation, a nonprofit group begun in 2011, moved into the premises vacated by the ShowRoom. The foundation was scheduled to open its first exhibition on Jan. 12, to coincide with the New Jersey run on Jan. 17 to 21 of Light of Day, the charity rock event that travels the globe but originated here.
''We were hoping to open a space a year from now, to put a face to our organization,'' and then Hurricane Sandy hit, said Tom Gilmour, chairman of the foundation and Asbury Park's director of economic development. Asbury Park fared better in the storm than some neighboring shore towns, he said, but the boardwalk was damaged, and the southern part of it remains closed. ''All of our board almost instinctively said, 'Let's do it now,' '' Mr. Gilmour recalled. ''We're not ready. We're not ready by any means, but we're doing it anyway.''
Its inaugural exhibition features images by John Cavanaugh, a photographer who has been documenting Light of Day, and the many appearances at the event by Bruce Springsteen since it started in 2000. In February the foundation is planning to showcase memorabilia documenting the city's black musical history, to coincide with Black History Month.
''We fall right between Atlantic City and New York, so before the Garden State Parkway was built, musicians would always play here, because we were geographically well positioned for them. They'd play in Atlantic City, then they'd stop here, then they'd go to New York,'' Mr. Gilmour said. Now, Mr. Gilmour, like Ms. Sabino and Mr. Sodano, is hoping to promote Asbury Park as a culture hub.
''So many people, musicians and artists, have come to us saying they want to be a part of what we're doing,'' Mr. Gilmour said. Said Ms. Sabino: ''We think we've got a very art-focused, vibrant community here.''

HEADLINE: New Targets For Future Taxes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Heads, You Win. Tails, You Win, Too.'' (Economic View, Jan. 6): 
Robert H. Frank's advocacy of Pigovian taxes -- the kind that penalize harmful activities -- is fair and sensible, with a glaring exception.
There is no greater strain on our resources and infrastructure than unchecked population growth, yet there is no suggestion of a tax based on the number of children in a family. When people reproduce exponentially, they wreak far more societal and ecological damage than can be compensated for by any Pigovian measures, no matter how wide-ranging.
Mr. Frank's approach requires taxing an assortment of detrimental factors so that a balance is ultimately achieved for all. To ignore the element of family size as a taxable target is to render the entire idea incomplete. DENNIS B. APPLETON
Madison, Wis., Jan. 6
To the Editor:
Following up on Professor Frank's column, we should consider Pigovian taxes on guns. Or we could use something very similar to taxes: a requirement for gun liability insurance. Insurance, like taxes, quantifies the perceived societal cost of an activity. EDWARD PEARLMAN
South Portland, Me., Jan. 6
To the Editor:
Pigovian taxes are a great idea, but way too abstract for some. Why not such a tax on House and Senate seats, refundable for each day the legislator actually accomplishes something, but with a double levy for days spent filibustering?

HEADLINE: The Unaffordable Luxury of Food

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
Sometime around 1990 and not too long out of college, I held what memory tells me was my first true dinner party, in a three-bedroom brownstone duplex in Brooklyn, where the rent was approximately $1,200 a month. The menu revolved around a pork loin stuffed with sausage and dried apricots, a recipe that came from ''The New Basics,'' which along with ''The Silver Palate Cookbook,'' its predecessor, and the various musings of Laurie E. Colwin would have made up the near entirety of any young aspiring cook's kitchen library. That evening, we were paying tribute to a friend who had recently begun working as a writer for David Letterman, and in that spirit my roommate and I purchased several bottles of Kendall-Jackson chardonnay for $11 each, feeling very grand about it. 
Judged by the rigorous standards we impose today, it took very little to be considered a food person in New York 20 years ago. It was a time when it was possible to go for very long periods without meeting even one 24-year-old who could tell you anything about sea urchin or the cured meats of the southern Tyrol. With the exception of an annual birthday dinner that might be spent at the Mesa Grill or the now-closed Chanterelle, restaurants, for those of us newly inaugurated into adulthood, were not ends in themselves but rather places to go to pass the time before heading to the parties where you would lose all sense of it. I spent many wonderful hours at Bistrot Margot, a restaurant, now defunct, on Prince Street, but I could not now recall the contents of any meal I ever consumed there.
All of this is said with only very little of the inclination toward dissembling that wistfulness enables. Watching ''Girls,'' which returns to television on Sunday, it can seem as though it is recording a past time, not the present, if only because the culinary obsessions that currently capture young creative-class minds, the annotations of every exceptional meal, are so little in evidence. Every generation of young New Yorker finds its own way to squander its meager earnings, and this one seems content to spend the money it makes on expensive, curated food with little sense that it is really squandering anything at all.
There is vast cultural support for this exercise, of course. We have long since moved past the vague idea that the personal is political to the notion that the epicurean is essential -- for ethical cleanliness, environmental sensitivity and all the rest. Pleasure is mingled with obligation. ''I don't think about what anything costs,'' Emily Gerard, a recent graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and a publishing assistant making the requisite salary, told me recently. ''I'll drop $60 once a week at the Greenmarket, which I would never do at a grocery store; I like supporting local farmers.''
We talk a lot about exquisite food but we rarely talk about a corollary to our fixation with it -- the financial toll it takes on people who do not in any real sense have the income to afford it. Last week Yaffa Fredrick, who is 23 and a production assistant at MTV, broke down the finances of her passion for me. After taxes, she makes about $30,000 a year, a little over half of which goes to rent. In an especially frenetic dining week before the holidays, she went to Morimoto in the meatpacking district one night, Fig & Olive the next and Spice Market a few nights later, with a drinks evening sandwiched in between at Experimental Cocktail Club on the Lower East Side.
Typically, she told me, she spends about $250 a week eating in good restaurants, which amounts to about $13,000 annually, and this does not include the additional $50 to $100 a week she spends on cooking classes, wine tastings and cheese pairings. Because about half of her salary is given over to food, she works an additional 10 to 15 hours a week tutoring and baby-sitting to supplement it.
It surely comforts modern parents who have spent fortunes educating their children to know that these children are spending money on pork belly and not, for instance, cocaine. But what solace can it offer to realize that $300 a week put into an S. & P. 500 Index fund over the past five years would have provided an annual rate of return of 10.34 percent and grown to $100,354 today? Even saving $300 a week at a 6 percent rate of return would have yielded about $91,000, Mark X. Chemtob, a financial adviser at Ameriprise, said, adding that in both cases, the sums would qualify for a down payment on a starter apartment in New York.
Few of us are engineered to think this way, obviously, when we are young and we live in a moment when economists like Garett Jones have argued that memory ought to be considered a durable good. ''Most of the joy -- the utility in econospeak -- happens when you're not having the experience,'' he wrote last year. When you are spending $2,013 on a four-course prix fixe meal that includes pasta with wild mushrooms, lobster and truffle shavings, in other words -- an offering currently on the menu at Bice Ristorante in Midtown -- you are investing in the prospect of a cherished recollection decades hence. Or just as likely, one could say, the costly psychotherapy that so often stems from regret.

HEADLINE: The End of Courtship

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
MAYBE it was because they had met on OkCupid. But when the dark-eyed musician with artfully disheveled hair asked Shani Silver, a social media and blog manager in Philadelphia, out on a ''date'' Friday night, she was expecting at least a drink, one on one.
''At 10 p.m., I hadn't heard from him,'' said Ms. Silver, 30, who wore her favorite skinny black jeans. Finally, at 10:30, he sent a text message. ''Hey, I'm at Pub & Kitchen, want to meet up for a drink or whatever?'' he wrote, before adding, ''I'm here with a bunch of friends from college.''
Turned off, she fired back a text message, politely declining. But in retrospect, she might have adjusted her expectations. ''The word 'date' should almost be stricken from the dictionary,'' Ms. Silver said. ''Dating culture has evolved to a cycle of text messages, each one requiring the code-breaking skills of a cold war spy to interpret.'' 
''It's one step below a date, and one step above a high-five,'' she added. Dinner at a romantic new bistro? Forget it. Women in their 20s these days are lucky to get a last-minute text to tag along. Raised in the age of so-called ''hookup culture,'' millennials -- who are reaching an age where they are starting to think about settling down -- are subverting the rules of courtship.
Instead of dinner-and-a-movie, which seems as obsolete as a rotary phone, they rendezvous over phone texts, Facebook posts, instant messages and other ''non-dates'' that are leaving a generation confused about how to land a boyfriend or girlfriend.
''The new date is 'hanging out,' '' said Denise Hewett, 24, an associate television producer in Manhattan, who is currently developing a show about this frustrating new romantic landscape. As one male friend recently told her: ''I don't like to take girls out. I like to have them join in on what I'm doing -- going to an event, a concert.''
For evidence, look no further than ''Girls,'' HBO's cultural weather vane for urban 20-somethings, where none of the main characters paired off in a manner that might count as courtship even a decade ago. In Sunday's opener for Season 2, Hannah (Lena Dunham) and Adam (Adam Driver), who last season forged a relationship by texting each other nude photos, are shown lying in bed, debating whether being each other's ''main hang'' constitutes actual dating.
The actors in the show seem to fare no better in real life, judging by a monologue by Zosia Mamet (who plays Shoshanna, the show's token virgin, since deflowered) at a benefit last fall at Joe's Pub in the East Village. Bemoaning an anything-goes dating culture, Ms. Mamet, 24, recalled an encounter with a boyfriend whose idea of a date was lounging in a hotel room while he ''Lewis and Clarked'' her body, then tried to stick her father, the playwright David Mamet, with the bill, according to a Huffington Post report.
Blame the much-documented rise of the ''hookup culture'' among young people, characterized by spontaneous, commitment-free (and often, alcohol-fueled) romantic flings. Many students today have never been on a traditional date, said Donna Freitas, who has taught religion and gender studies at Boston University and Hofstra and is the author of the forthcoming book, ''The End of Sex: How Hookup Culture is Leaving a Generation Unhappy, Sexually Unfulfilled, and Confused About Intimacy.''
Hookups may be fine for college students, but what about after, when they start to build an adult life? The problem is that ''young people today don't know how to get out of hookup culture,'' Ms. Freitas said. In interviews with students, many graduating seniors did not know the first thing about the basic mechanics of a traditional date. ''They're wondering, 'If you like someone, how would you walk up to them? What would you say? What words would you use?' '' Ms. Freitas said.
That may explain why ''dates'' among 20-somethings resemble college hookups, only without the dorms. Lindsay, a 25-year-old online marketing manager in Manhattan, recalled a recent non-date that had all the elegance of a keg stand (her last name is not used here to avoid professional embarrassment).
After an evening when she exchanged flirtatious glances with a bouncer at a Williamsburg nightclub, the bouncer invited her and her friends back to his apartment for whiskey and boxed macaroni and cheese. When she agreed, he gamely hoisted her over his shoulders, and, she recalled, ''carried me home, my girlfriends and his bros in tow, where we danced around a tiny apartment to some MGMT and Ratatat remixes.''
She spent the night at the apartment, which kicked off a cycle of weekly hookups, invariably preceded by a Thursday night text message from him saying, 'hey babe, what are you up to this weekend?'' (It petered out after four months.)
Relationship experts point to technology as another factor in the upending of dating culture.
Traditional courtship -- picking up the telephone and asking someone on a date -- required courage, strategic planning and a considerable investment of ego (by telephone, rejection stings). Not so with texting, e-mail, Twitter or other forms of ''asynchronous communication,'' as techies call it. In the context of dating, it removes much of the need for charm; it's more like dropping a line in the water and hoping for a nibble.
''I've seen men put more effort into finding a movie to watch on Netflix Instant than composing a coherent message to ask a woman out,'' said Anna Goldfarb, 34, an author and blogger in Moorestown, N.J. A typical, annoying query is the last-minute: ''Is anything fun going on tonight?'' More annoying still are the men who simply ping, ''Hey'' or '' 'sup.''
''What does he think I'm doing?'' she said. ''I'm going to my friend's house to drink cheap white wine and watch episodes of 'Dance Moms' on demand.''
Online dating services, which have gained mainstream acceptance, reinforce the hyper-casual approach by greatly expanding the number of potential dates. Faced with a never-ending stream of singles to choose from, many feel a sense of ''FOMO'' (fear of missing out), so they opt for a speed-dating approach -- cycle through lots of suitors quickly.
That also means that suitors need to keep dates cheap and casual. A fancy dinner? You're lucky to get a drink.
''It's like online job applications, you can target many people simultaneously -- it's like darts on a dart board, eventually one will stick,'' said Joshua Sky, 26, a branding coordinator in Manhattan, describing the attitudes of many singles in their 20s. The mass-mailer approach necessitates ''cost-cutting, going to bars, meeting for coffee the first time,'' he added, ''because you only want to invest in a mate you're going to get more out of.''
If online dating sites have accelerated that trend, they are also taking advantage of it. New services like Grouper aren't so much about matchmaking as they are about group dates, bringing together two sets of friends for informal drinks.
The Gaggle, a dating commentary and advice site, helps young women navigate what its founders call the ''post-dating'' landscape, by championing ''non-dates,'' including the ''group non-date'' and the ''networking non-date.'' The site's founders, Jessica Massa and Rebecca Wiegand, say that in a world where ''courtship'' is quickly being redefined, women must recognize a flirtatious exchange of tweets, or a lingering glance at a company softball game, as legitimate opportunities for romance, too.
''Once women begin recognizing these more ambiguous settings as opportunities for romantic possibility,'' Ms. Massa said, ''they really start seeing their love lives as much more intriguing and vibrant than they did when they were only judging themselves by how many 'dates' they had lined up.''
THERE'S another reason Web-enabled singles are rendering traditional dates obsolete. If the purpose of the first date was to learn about someone's background, education, politics and cultural tastes, Google and Facebook have taken care of that.
''We're all Ph.D.'s in Internet stalking these days,'' said Andrea Lavinthal, an author of the 2005 book ''The Hookup Handbook.'' ''Online research makes the first date feel unnecessary, because it creates a false sense of intimacy. You think you know all the important stuff, when in reality, all you know is that they watch 'Homeland.' ''
Dodgy economic prospects facing millennials also help torpedo the old, formal dating rituals. Faced with a lingering recession, a stagnant job market, and mountains of student debt, many young people -- particularly victims of the ''mancession'' -- simply cannot afford to invest a fancy dinner or show in someone they may or may not click with.
Further complicating matters is the changing economic power dynamic between the genders, as reflected by a number of studies in recent years, said Hanna Rosin, author of the recent book ''The End of Men.''
A much-publicized study by Reach Advisors, a Boston-based market research group, found that the median income for young, single, childless women is higher than it is for men in many of the country's biggest cities (though men still dominate the highest-income jobs, according to James Chung, the company's president). This may be one reason it is not uncommon to walk into the hottest new West Village bistro on a Saturday night and find five smartly dressed young women dining together -- the nearest man the waiter. Income equality, or superiority, for women muddles the old, male-dominated dating structure.
''Maybe there's still a sense of a man taking care of a woman, but our ideology is aligning with the reality of our finances,'' Ms. Rosin said. As a man, you might ''convince yourself that dating is passé, a relic of a paternalistic era, because you can't afford to take a woman to a restaurant.''
Many young men these days have no experience in formal dating and feel the need to be faintly ironic about the process -- ''to 'date' in quotation marks'' -- because they are ''worried that they might offend women by dating in an old-fashioned way,'' Ms. Rosin said.
''It's hard to read a woman exactly right these days,'' she added. ''You don't know whether, say, choosing the wine without asking her opinion will meet her yearnings for old-fashioned romance or strike her as boorish and macho.''
Indeed, being too formal too early can send a message that a man is ready to get serious, which few men in their 20s are ready to do, said Lex Edness, a television writer in Los Angeles.
''A lot of men in their 20s are reluctant to take the girl to the French restaurant, or buy them jewelry, because those steps tend to lead to 'eventually, we're going to get married,' '' Mr. Edness, 27, said. In a tight economy, where everyone is grinding away to build a career, most men cannot fathom supporting a family until at least 30 or 35, he said.
''So it's a lot easier to meet people on an even playing field, in casual dating,'' he said. ''The stakes are lower.''
Even in an era of ingrained ambivalence about gender roles, however, some women keep the old dating traditions alive by refusing to accept anything less.
Cheryl Yeoh, a tech entrepreneur in San Francisco, said that she has been on many formal dates of late -- plays, fancy restaurants. One suitor even presented her with red roses. For her, the old traditions are alive simply because she refuses to put up with anything less. She generally refuses to go on any date that is not set up a week in advance, involving a degree of forethought.
''If he really wants you,'' Ms. Yeoh, 29, said, ''he has to put in some effort.''

HEADLINE: Machine of the Moment

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
IN the days that followed Hurricane Sandy, the developer of the luxury condominium 150 Charles Street hunkered down with his team of architects and engineers to rethink the building's design.
Just steps from the Hudson River, the construction site was partially flooded. ''Their mandate was to figure out how the building would have stayed open in a storm like this,'' said Steven Witkoff, the developer. ''They came back with a list of five things, and we implemented every single one.''
The efforts delayed the project by some six weeks and added as much as $3 million to its cost.
It was one of a number of projects that convened their engineers and construction teams to reconsider their plans after the rising waters rushed over the city's embankments and into the basements of countless residential buildings across Lower Manhattan. 
Now, more than two months after the storm caused millions of dollars in damage, novel and costly waterproofing techniques are being employed, including the addition of backup generators and floodgates, and the relocation of mechanical equipment. The owners of buildings that predate the flooding are also looking at these measures, although retroactive installation is so complex and costly that some may decide not to do anything.
''If you are in the flood zone and you are marketing a new high-end property, it will need to stand up to the test of another superstorm,'' said Stephen G. Kliegerman, the executive director of development marketing for Halstead Property. ''I think buyers would happily pay to be relatively reassured they wouldn't be terribly inconvenienced in case of a natural disaster.''
At 150 Charles Street, Mr. Witkoff plans to forestall a blackout by installing two natural-gas-powered generators on the roof to run the fire-alarm system, the emergency egress lighting, the elevators, and electrical and mechanical support equipment. Each apartment will be equipped with at least one electrical outlet connected to the generators. The developer is also ordering five-foot-tall floodgates that can be assembled and installed to encircle the building in a matter of hours. The gates, which fit together like toy Lincoln Logs, are to be stored in the basement.
Finally, Mr. Witkoff is using poured concrete instead of cinder block for the basement walls. And each basement mechanical room will be sealed with watertight submarine-style doors.
''This is the new normal,'' said Adam Gordon, the president of Adam Gordon Holdings, which is building a condominium at 560 West 24th Street in Chelsea. ''With two hurricanes in two years, this is the new base level for the way people should think about building in New York.''
Mr. Gordon's Chelsea project will have a waterproof ''concrete superstructure'' from the basement to the second floor that has 13-foot floodgates; waterproofed rooms with submarine-style doors to protect mechanical and electrical systems; and a generator and a pumping system run on natural gas.
The floodgates are expected to cost Mr. Gordon roughly $100,000 -- ''not an insignificant cost, but not breathtaking.'' He is still pricing the other waterproofing measures. The building, eight units averaging 3,300 square feet each with a ground-floor art gallery, is to be completed in spring 2014.
The developer Time Equities is rethinking the plans for its approximately 62-story condominium at 50 West Street. It is considering replacing a hotel with multilevel retail and, to make the building flood-resistant, moving the mechanical room onto the second or third floor. The developer is also looking at raising the sill height on the ground floor and using floodgates at the entrances.
After the storm, Time Equities hired the Albanese Organization, which built the Visionaire, the Verdesian and the Solaire in Battery Park City, to be its development manager.
''The Albanese Organization are the exact people to handle the project,'' said Robert Singer, the director of development and acquisitions for Time Equities, ''because Battery Park City was the only place that had electricity during the storm, while the rest of Lower Manhattan went dark.''
As for timing, ''50 West Street is looking to expedite its design,'' said Jack C. Becker, the executive vice president for design and construction of the Albanese Organization, ''and we are hoping that by late spring or early summer to at least get the foundation started.''
Mr. Becker is looking at similar strategies for 111 Washington Street, a 50-story rental project on which Albanese is also advising. There, the electrical system is being moved to a higher floor from the basement, at an estimated cost of $850,000, Mr. Becker said.
Relocating basement mechanical systems means eliminating space on upper floors that could have been used for apartments or building amenities, said George Poniros, the assistant director of construction at Pink Stone Capital Group, the developer of 111 Washington. ''It does cut into some of our sellable space,'' he said, ''but when people go to rent in our building they will know that we have taken these extra precautions, and it will give us an edge.''
Pre-existing buildings in the flood zone are also weighing their options. At Superior Ink, the condominium and town-house development in the West Village, the storm flooded the lobby and basement, and some mechanical systems were damaged by saltwater erosion. The residents, forced out of their apartments for more than 40 days, paid an assessment totaling $1 million in December so renovations could start immediately, without any wait for insurance proceeds.
The building is moving its electrical and mechanical systems to the second floor, to share space with the garage, and is considering installing a generator.
Superior Ink is rebuilding amenities in their below-ground sites, including the gym, the playroom, the residents' lounge and the bike room. ''It is almost a lucky accident since it provides us a rare opportunity to do over the common spaces the way the residents want them,'' said Melanie Lazenby, an executive vice president of Douglas Elliman and a resident. Ms. Lazenby, who stayed with her mother on the Upper East Side for 42 days after the storm, said the lobby was already 70 percent rebuilt.
As for that $1 million assessment, ''they anticipate we will be given the money back once the insurance money comes in,'' Ms. Lazenby said.
Many affected buildings whose residents did not pay a special assessment are still waiting for their insurance proceeds. The development 88 Greenwich, across from Battery Park City, incurred basement flooding. The water dislodged an oil tank, which hit a ceiling beam and cracked open, necessitating a major cleanup.
''The building is now open again,'' said Dan Wurtzel, the president of Cooper Square Realty, the condominium's manager, ''but the only thing currently on their radar is getting through the insurance process. It is going to take several months for this to be completed, and only then will they begin to confront the next question, which is what can they do to prevent this from recurring.''
Some pre-existing buildings are not taking any action at all. At 116 John Street, a 419-unit rental, the boiler and generator were fortunately already on the roof. But not so the electrical switchgear that controlled many other systems; it was damaged by floodwater.
''Our switchgear is in the basement and I don't know how one can move that elsewhere,'' said Nathan Berman, the principal of Metro Loft Management, the building landlord. ''It is a matter of economics -- I'm not sure too many developers would want to compromise lucrative space elsewhere in the building for a storm that was hopefully just a 25- or 50-year event.''
Some management companies that oversee buildings in the flood zone are thinking along the same lines.
''While buying a generator itself may not be that expensive,'' Mr. Wurtzel said, ''it is everything else -- like connecting it to the various building systems that you want to run in case of a power failure, then securing a fuel supply by either running a natural-gas line or using diesel fuel -- that can be costly and logistically complicated.
''I don't want to say you are throwing your money away,'' he continued, ''but if your electrical mains that feed the building are in the basement, they are going to be damaged anyway, so it just may not be worth it.''
Paul Gottsegen, the Halstead Management Company's president and management director, is advising buildings to ''instead of retrofitting their mechanical areas, to concentrate more on preparedness.'' The company's emergency task force has come up with recommendations on when to evacuate buildings and other best practices.
The issue of where to put building systems remains a thorny one for many new buildings. The building code does not count basement space used for mechanical equipment in the square footage permitted by zoning. But if the mechanical room is on an upper floor, it is included in the square footage and thus impinges on sellable space, like apartments and amenities. And while in some cases the equipment can be moved to the roof, many buildings are subject to height restrictions.
''Builders want to be more resilient, but don't want to be penalized by giving up space,'' said Russell Unger, the executive director of the Urban Green Council. He is a member of a task force set up by the City Council and the mayor's office to study ways to help buildings better prepare for extreme weather. Its findings will be published this summer.
''If you are in a flood zone, you cannot have your mechanicals in the basement,'' said Donald A. Capoccia, the managing principal of the developer BFC Partners. ''There are no two ways about it. The building codes have to change to reflect this new reality.''
Although builders across the city are only in the initial stages of figuring out how to build in a post-Sandy landscape, one thing is clear: ''People are discussing spending billions of dollars for sea walls around the city or barrier islands, or even redesigning entire coastal communities,'' said Vishaan Chakrabarti, an architect and an associate professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation.
''But there are many simpler measures that builders can do quickly and relatively affordably. We should utilize these strategies first and foremost, and see where that takes us.''
By Design, Water in the Basement
The architect Vishaan Chakrabarti, in the Netherlands when Hurricane Sandy sent water crashing over riverbanks and into Manhattan, was inspired by what he saw.
''There, they do not fight the water,'' said Mr. Chakrabarti, a partner at SHoP Architects and an associate professor at Columbia's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, ''but rather allow the lower level of buildings and parks to flood to retain the water, which is a much lower-cost strategy. This is not rocket science; places like the Netherlands and Venice have been dealing with this for centuries.''
One beneficiary of his trip may be a 350,000-square-foot retail and hotel project that he is designing for the Staten Island waterfront. In conjunction with the developer, BFC Partners, Mr. Chakrabarti is considering building the lower level of the complex's three-floor parking garage to double as a giant water-retention tank capable of holding millions of gallons of floodwater.
''Our lowest point is eight feet above sea level,'' said Donald A. Capoccia, the managing principal and founder of BFC, ''so if you have a 13-foot surge, you would still get 5 feet of water on the site, so we have to plan for it.''
If a garage reservoir is built, Mr. Chakrabarti said, developers ''should get some sort of zoning incentive, since it would help flood control not just at the development, but across the entire neighborhood.''

HEADLINE: Over 50, and Under No Illusions

BYLINE: By CAITLIN KELLY

 BODY:
IT'S a baby boomer's nightmare. One moment you're 40-ish and moving up, the next you're 50-plus and suddenly, shockingly, moving out -- jobless in a tough economy.
Too young to retire, too old to start over. Or at least that's the line. Comfortable jobs with comfortable salaries are scarce, after all. Almost overnight, skills honed over a lifetime seem tired, passé. Twenty- and thirty-somethings will gladly do the work you used to do, and probably for less money. Yes, businesses are hiring again, but not nearly fast enough. Many people are so disheartened that they've simply stopped looking for work.
For millions of Americans over 50, this isn't a bad dream -- it's grim reality. The recession and its aftermath have hit older workers especially hard. People 55 to 64 -- an age range when many start to dream of kicking back -- are having a particularly hard time finding new jobs. For a vast majority of this cohort, being thrown out of work means months of fruitless searching and soul-crushing rejection.
To which many experts say, ''What did you expect?'' 
Everyone, whatever age, needs a Plan B. And maybe a Plan C and a Plan D. Who doesn't know that loyalty and hard work go only so far these days?
''Shame on you if you're not thinking every single year, 'What's my next step?' '' says Pamela Mitchell, a career coach and author. ''It's magical thinking not to do this.''
Ms. Mitchell, who has reinvented her own career a few times, says everyone should think about options, alternative job paths and career goals, just in case. She recommends talking over job possibilities with family members and, if possible, building a financial cushion.
Constant networking is crucial, too. The idea, she says, is to prepare in case a big change comes.
''If you're thinking about it, you'll be doing all this piecemeal along the way,'' she says.
All of which, of course, is easier said than done. But some people who have gone through the emotional and financial strains of late-career unemployment say that with skill, determination and a bit of luck, the end of a job doesn't have to be the end of the world. Changing jobs or careers can be a good thing later in life, despite the many risks. Many agree that a willingness to push beyond the comforts of location, lifestyle and line of work is vital.
Though there is no single path, there are success stories that offer hope.
Like the story of Bonjet Sandigan, now of Delray Beach, Fla. An information technology specialist, Mr. Sandigan was laid off from Dun & Bradstreet in August 2011. But Mr. Sandigan, now 51, has since carved out a new career with ShelfGenie, a seller of custom home shelving.
It was a big switch. Mr. Sandigan grew up in the Philippines and has a computer science degree from Texas A&M. For years, he worked in I.T. support, helping customers over the phone. But he never managed to move up. When Dun & Bradstreet offered him a severance package, he figured that he could finally afford to take a little time to figure out his next move.
''I did some soul-searching about what's important to me,'' he says. ''As you grow, your priorities change.''
His father had been an entrepreneur in the Philippines, and Mr. Sandigan was attracted to the idea of working for himself. With the help of a consultant, he looked into buying a franchise in the I.T. or health care industries. Then he considered a ShelfGenie franchise, which appealed to him partly because it was a turnkey operation.
''The infrastructure is there, the market is there, the policies and procedures are there,'' he says. ''You just have to follow the procedures.''
Mr. Sandigan had worked in I.T. in various industries, including health care, gambling and financial services, so he was willing to try something new again. Still, the change wasn't easy.
''I had a whole lot of fears,'' he says. ''But my background told me to do the numbers, do the math and research the market.''
He eventually spent a low six-figure sum to buy four ShelfGenie sales territories and, after living for decades near Dallas, moved to Delray Beach for his new career and new life. He says his experience in I.T., working with cross-cultural teams in India and China, has been surprisingly useful in his new job, which requires a focus on customer service.
''It was a very diverse culture, so my experience there, trying to understand where people are coming from'' proves helpful in his current work, he says. He says his old career taught him to listen closely -- a valuable skill in his new work.
''Now that I have to be in front of the client,'' he says, ''I can spend two hours with them before we even discuss the product, and I can do a demonstration.''
Mr. Sandigan says he figured that the switch would mean a drop in income, at least initially. The first six to eight months would be hard. But, by his reckoning, his new career is on track financially.
''I'm right where I'm supposed to be,'' he says.
The Adventurer
Clare Novak is more than on track with her new career. At 58, she is making twice as much as she did in 2008, when her previous work dried up.
But Ms. Novak didn't just change jobs. She changed countries and cultures. After 18 years working in Chester Springs, Pa., doing management training for a range of businesses, she moved to Islamabad, Pakistan, in November, to work as a human resources adviser to nine power companies. Her first contract will last through this year, and possibly through 2015, a prospect she is happy to contemplate.
How did she end up making such a leap? She had formerly done work for someone in Egypt, who e-mailed her a job description and asked if she knew anyone who might fit the bill.
''The only person I know who would go there is me,'' Ms. Novak says. When asked if she was interested, she said, ''I was thrilled and said yes.''
Today, her life is vastly different. Once an avid hiker, she now spends more time at home, given that she is a foreign woman in a patriarchal society. She lives in what amounts to a rooming house and no longer enjoys the privacy she did in Chester Springs.
''Fortunately, I'm with a very collegial group,'' she says.
She is accustomed to adapting, and to using her networking skills. In the economic downturn, ''networking and word of mouth were how I developed my business,'' Ms. Novak said in an e-mail interview. ''Volunteering and networking kept me in business quite nicely, including overseas work in Egypt and Ukraine, and later Canada and Kuwait.''
When American businesses began automating the training that was her specialty, a shrinking profession shrank further. Several of her large clients ended projects.
''My business was down to a few small projects and one week's work a month in Kuwait,'' she says. ''The year after, I had only Kuwait, which was not enough to make ends meet.
''In those down years, it was a struggle to remain positive and keep at it,'' she says. ''A longtime friend and colleague suggested that we form a business forum of like-minded women to help each other. We kept each other on track with our businesses and emotionally.''
To this day, she says, all of those women ''are still in business, and we are all experiencing upturns.''
Moving to Pakistan has meant big changes. ''There is considerably less autonomy for any foreigner of any age here,'' she says. ''Due to security, both men and women can only walk in the daylight, and never alone. Our driver can take us to specific sectors, and outside of that we require a protection officer to accompany us. Society is relatively segregated socially, so women cluster together and men likewise. The businesswomen I meet are comfortable in mixed groups, and some are very cosmopolitan.''
All the trade-offs are worth it, she says. Ms. Novak says she loves the adventure of living abroad, and the satisfaction of ''being able to make a difference in people's lives.''
The Inventor
After 15 years selling men's clothing for a national retailer, Jeffrey Nash, 58, was earning $90,000 a year and was often the top salesman in his company. But as the recession deepened, he began referring his customers to struggling co-workers. His sales commissions took a hit.
''I kind of softened up,'' he says. ''My sales went down because I was sharing them.''
His income fell to $65,000. And as shoppers became more cautious during the recession, he knew that it would soon fall even further.
''I was doomed,'' he says. ''I knew I had to come up with an idea.''
Mr. Nash, who lives in Las Vegas, had invented a device he called the Juppy, a sling that helps toddlers learn to walk more safely and confidently.
''I had already touched base with a patent attorney and had started the ball rolling,'' he says. He took three weeks of vacation to see if he could make a go of his invention, telling only a few people about his plans. Their opinions were ''really negative,'' he recalls.
Undaunted, he drove to Los Angeles and San Diego, selling the Juppy from his trunk and on a televised sales show, and earning $12,000 in three weeks.
''I never went back to work,'' he says.
Investing $35,000 of his savings and an additional $9,000 from his father and a friend, Mr. Nash had the device manufactured in China.
''The transition was simple,'' he says. ''If I'd stayed in my old job, I was going to lose in the end. I was done. I needed a massive change. I needed income of several hundred thousand dollars. I knew I had to take a risk, a massive risk.''
That included selling his home -- for $200,000 less than he had paid for it, because of the downturn -- and renting a house instead.
''I used to drive a Lexus,'' he says. ''I let that go. I don't need it anymore.''
Mr. Nash has since sold $500,000 worth of his product, netting $200,000 in two and a half years, an annual average of $80,000.
He is relieved, and proud of having successfully leapt from the familiar into the unknown.
''It's unbelievable to me that at my age I recognized a need and filled it,'' he says. ''We're having a hard time filling orders right now, we have so much demand.''
The Renovator
When the economy heads south, it helps to have been through the situation a few times before, says Duke Marquiss, 67, a real estate investor and broker in Fort Collins, Colo. In 1974, he bought a motel in Gillette, Wyo., during an oil and coal boom. ''I made the most money of my life,'' he recalls.
But the boom went bust, and in 1987, he moved to Scottsdale, Ariz., where he worked as a mortgage broker. By the time he and his wife moved to Colorado in 1989, Mr. Marquiss understood how to buy, sell, manage and rehabilitate real estate.
Today he earns his living in the real estate market niche known as A.R.V., for ''after repair value.'' He buys properties, restores them and sells them for a profit. Tipped off by a local friend, he bought 65 town houses in Rock Springs, Wyo., in 2005 for $75,000 apiece, on average, and sold them each for about $100,000.
Mr. Marquiss had saved carefully and lived for three years with no income during the worst years of the recession. Because of a lack of new construction, he says he couldn't ''do the development side I liked and was good at.''
''That left me back selling houses,'' he adds, ''so I decided I would 'fix and flip.' ''
Growing up on a large sheep farm taught him ''ranch-hand logic,'' but Mr. Marquiss acknowledges that he has had to learn his new business quickly, including how to use social media to gather advice from generous industry veterans. ''LinkedIn helped a lot,'' he says.
Mr. Marquiss uses only private investors to do his deals, borrowing between $15,000 and $450,000. ''They're tired of low interest rates or losing their money in the stock market,'' he says.
His new line of work is not for everyone, he warns.
''You've got to be flexible and think very quickly,'' he says. ''You can't bank on any of these deals ever closing.''
Before he found his new field, his wife suggested at one point that he find a full-time job working for someone else. He sent out 200 résumés, but received only one call. Sharply reducing their costs of living helped Mr. Marquiss and his wife, Ginger, weather the transition to their new life. They sold their 3,000-square-foot mountain home and now live in a condominium a third of the size in Fort Collins. He also saves $600 to $700 a month on gasoline by not commuting 45 minutes each way into town.
''It takes a conscious decision to reduce your overhead,'' he says. ''I see so many people in denial about where they really are financially.''
The Networker
Since graduating from college, Kenneth Jay Cohen, 52, of Stamford, Conn., has faced six layoffs, the first in his early 30s, and the most recent at 50 with two young children to support. A prolonged period of unemployment wasn't an option, so he did what he has done diligently for decades: he called upon his multiple networks for guidance and leads.
The first time he lost his job, ''it was a shock, because I'd never experienced this before,'' he says. ''But now I know exactly what to do. I try to feed the network as much as I can while I'm still working so I know it's there when I need it.''
He has more than 1,000 contacts on LinkedIn and works at finding and keeping business contacts elsewhere, too. ''Every three or four months I go to a meeting,'' he says. ''I know who in my network is out of work, so every time I pick up a lead I pass it along to the group.''
Staying actively connected has also helped.
''I'm associated with a few finance groups within my own industry because people in finance need I.T.,'' he says. ''I also network with bankers, investment bankers and management types and a few accounting groups.''
In all, Mr. Cohen belongs to 24 groups, of which he is most active in seven to nine at any given time.
When he has lost a job, he has made a point of expanding his networks even further. ''I always pick a new group to which I devote my time and my leadership skills,'' he says. ''It keeps me sane. It keeps me focused.''
It took him five months to find his latest job, a full-time position handling I.T. security for a Manhattan-based financial services company. He found his previous job within 30 days, picking up a year's guaranteed contract work in Hartford.
''I seem to be able to find work,'' he says modestly. ''I know project managers who've been out of work for two years, and they're really frustrated.'' Some, he says, are too busy nursing their wounds to get out and meet the dozens, perhaps hundreds, of others in their field and affiliated areas who might be able to help them.
Living in an affluent area can complicate the issue when it's time to tighten your belt.
''I'm back to where I was three and a half years ago financially,'' he says. ''The consumer I used to be when I was younger has considerably changed. It boils down to what your priorities are, and mine is my family. Sure, I'd like a shiny new Lexus and a million-dollar home. But is that practical for me? I'd rather have my kids.''

HEADLINE: Our Economic Pickle

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE. 
A reporter on labor and workplace issues for The New York Times, and author of ''The Big Squeeze: Tough Times for the American Worker.''

 BODY:
FEDERAL income tax rates will rise for the wealthiest Americans, and certain tax loopholes might get closed this year. But these developments, and whatever else happens in Washington in the coming debt-ceiling debate, are unlikely to do much to alter one major factor contributing to income inequality: stagnant wages. For millions of workers, wages have flatlined. Take Caterpillar, long a symbol of American industry: while it reported record profits last year, it insisted on a six-year wage freeze for many of its blue-collar workers.
Wages have fallen to a record low as a share of America's gross domestic product. Until 1975, wages nearly always accounted for more than 50 percent of the nation's G.D.P., but last year wages fell to a record low of 43.5 percent. Since 2001, when the wage share was 49 percent, there has been a steep slide. 
''We went almost a century where the labor share was pretty stable and we shared prosperity,'' says Lawrence Katz, a labor economist at Harvard. ''What we're seeing now is very disquieting.'' For the great bulk of workers, labor's shrinking share is even worse than the statistics show, when one considers that a sizable -- and growing -- chunk of overall wages goes to the top 1 percent: senior corporate executives, Wall Street professionals, Hollywood stars, pop singers and professional athletes. The share of wages going to the top 1 percent climbed to 12.9 percent in 2010, from 7.3 percent in 1979.
Some economists say it is wrong to look at just wages because other aspects of employee compensation, notably health costs, have risen. But overall employee compensation -- including health and retirement benefits -- has also slipped badly, falling to its lowest share of national income in more than 50 years while corporate profits have climbed to their highest share over that time.
Conservative and liberal economists agree on many of the forces that have driven the wage share down. Corporate America's push to outsource jobs -- whether call-center jobs to India or factory jobs to China -- has fattened corporate earnings, while holding down wages at home. New technologies have raised productivity and profits, while enabling companies to shed workers and slice payroll. Computers have replaced workers who tabulated numbers; robots have pushed aside many factory workers.
''Some people think it's a law that when productivity goes up, everybody benefits,'' says Erik Brynjolfsson, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''There is no economic law that says technological progress has to benefit everybody or even most people. It's possible that productivity can go up and the economic pie gets bigger, but the majority of people don't share in that gain.''
From 1973 to 2011, worker productivity grew 80 percent, while median hourly compensation, after inflation, grew by just one-eighth that amount, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group. And since 2000, productivity has risen 23 percent while real hourly pay has essentially stagnated.
Meanwhile, it's been a lost economic decade for many households. According to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, median income for working-age households (headed by someone under age 65) slid 12.4 percent from 2000 to 2011, to $55,640. During that time the American economy grew more than 18 percent.
Emmanuel Saez, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, found that the top 1 percent of households garnered 65 percent of all the nation's income growth from 2002 to 2007, when the recession hit. Another study found that one-third of the overall increase in income going to the richest 1 percent has resulted from the surge in corporate profits.
MANY economists say the stubbornly high jobless rate and the declining power of labor unions are also important factors behind the declining wage share, reducing the leverage of workers to demand higher wages. Unions represent just 7 percent of workers in corporate America, one-quarter the level in the 1960s.
''There are very few occupations or industries where unions are strong enough where they can set standards,'' says Lawrence Mishel, president of the Economic Policy Institute. ''There are no standards being set, so companies can push down on wages for all workers, union and nonunion alike.'' When the Detroit automakers secure two-tier contracts, that enables them to pay new hires $16 an hour, far less than the $28 an hour earned by longtime workers. This also pushes down labor's share.
Pamela Waldron, a cashier at a KFC restaurant in Manhattan, earns $7.75 an hour after eight years on the job and says she last received a raise in 2007. ''Being here eight years, I think I should be getting more,'' she said. ''You can fight for a raise, but I don't think you're going to get it.''
It is often thought that college graduates can escape these unfortunate wage trends. But college graduates -- hit by the bursting of the tech bubble in the late 1990s and then by the deep recession -- have been hit hard, too. Seventy percent of the nation's college grads have had their after-inflation hourly wages decline since 2000, according to the Economic Policy Institute, with the typical graduate experiencing a 3.1 percent decline.
Jared Bernstein, who served in the Obama administration as executive director of the White House Task Force on the Middle Class, said many steps should be taken to increase labor's income share, including raising the minimum wage, pushing down the jobless rate, enacting laws that make it easier for workers to unionize and increasing wage subsidies for those on the bottom. He also said the federal government, in spending hundreds of billions on health care, might insist that providers pay home-care aides or lab technicians $20 an hour rather than $10. ''There's no reason why a lab technician with a few years of community college shouldn't be able to find her way into some segment of the middle class,'' he said.
Professor Katz of Harvard said it would make sense to create a more progressive tax system when corporations and the top 1 percent are commanding more of the economic pie. He said those on top should agree to some redistribution and to invest in the next generation.
''We'll end up with a larger pie, and they'll be better off -- even though they may think it clashes with their own self-interest,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Despite Protests, Gun Show in Upstate New York Goes On and Draws Crowds

BYLINE: By VIVIAN YEE

 BODY:
SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. -- The line to enter the Saratoga Arms Fair at the City Center here had never been so long, and David Petronis, its organizer, said he had never shaken so many hands in one morning.
''I appreciate you opening this show, not giving into the pressure,'' a man told him as he clasped Mr. Petronis's hand in the echoing convention hall, where hundreds of dealers of guns, ammunition, hunting equipment, war memorabilia and antiques were behind tables, talking up their wares. 
Mr. Petronis grinned back. He had not had any intention of giving in, not when a resident recently started a petition to shut down the gun show he had put on in Saratoga Springs four times a year since 1984. Not when several dozen people showed up at a City Council meeting two weeks ago to speak out against his event -- too soon after the tragedy in Newtown, Conn., they said, and too close by. Not when reporters began calling and his name appeared in newspapers as far west as Las Vegas.
And not on Saturday, the first day of the show, when thousands of attendees, three protests and a counterprotest made Saratoga Springs -- more known for its racetrack and mineral springs -- the latest American city to play host to the national debate over gun control.
The dispute has made for outstanding business. The deaths last month of 20 schoolchildren and 6 adults in Newtown prompted politicians to propose additional gun-control legislation. Since then, Mr. Petronis's shop in Mechanicville, N.Y., called Hudson River Trading Company, has sold out of assault-type weapons, said his wife, Cathy, the store's co-owner. On Saturday, a line of mostly male attendees stretched out the doors and around nearly two blocks.
For Mr. and Ms. Petronis, the attention amounts to free advertising. ''The more people to the event, the more dealers are happy,'' he said. ''I'll be answering my Web mail for months.''
The show had not attracted so many people before, City Center staff members said. And it had never attracted so many protests. As traffic snarled and parking spots filled outside the convention center, about two dozen members of the newly formed Saratogians for Gun Safety held up 26 painted wooden angels, copies of those a Connecticut artist planted in Newtown after the Dec. 14 shootings.
The group's members say they oppose the use of the City Center, which is run by a public authority, to support sales of firearms. And there is the matter of sensitivity, they added: other towns in Connecticut and New York have canceled gun shows, with some officials saying they are concerned weapons would be sold that could someday be used in a mass shooting.
''Newtown just happened a few weeks ago,'' said Deirdre Ladd, 46, one of the protest's organizers. ''There are lots of similarities between Newtown and Saratoga, but the difference is that Saratoga has a gun show four times a year.''
Many in the area would say that is a difference to be proud of. Owning a gun or two, or even a dozen, is not uncommon, especially in the nearby Adirondack Mountains. Hunting, skeet shooting and target shooting are popular hobbies.
The protests had left more than a few gun-show attendees feeling beleaguered. Second Amendment advocates handed out fliers to reporters and gathered in small groups, talking anxiously of the state and federal gun-control legislations that many feared were soon coming. ''I don't have enough angels to represent genocide by tyranny,'' read one of the signs in the pro-gun camp opposite the angel holders, attracting honks and waves from passing drivers.
''I feel we're kind of persecuted,'' said Sean Garvey, 60, the president of Dunham's Bay Fish and Game Club nearby, who has been coming to the Saratoga show for 20 years. He sighed and added: ''Gun owners are blamed for certain things. We've been under attack for a long time, and we've been framed for things.''
Donald Fangboner, 70, a retired police officer from Lake George, N.Y., said he had come not just to browse, but also to lend his support.
''I want to see a free America, and if we lose this, it's over,'' he said, patting an anti-Cuomo button on his chest. (Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo recently vowed to enact the country's ''toughest gun assault weapon ban'' in New York.)
A concession Mr. Petronis made was to bar dealers from selling military-style assault rifles similar to those used in recent mass shootings.
Mark Baker, the City Center's president, said that while he and other center officials were sensitive to the concerns of residents who said holding the gun show was inappropriate, they also wanted to honor the center's contract with the Petronises. The arms fair, which runs both days this weekend, is also ''a significant piece of economic activity for this weekend,'' he said.
But he said the City Center authority would review future contracts, including that of the gun show, which, like all other organizations that exhibit at the center, must renew its contract yearly. The officials are also keeping an eye on proposed gun legislation in Albany and in Washington, which could affect the types of weapons that are sold in gun shows or how the sales are conducted.
Anticipating a larger crowd than usual, center officials brought in additional security guards, and the Saratoga police stood near the protest area. But as the day wore on, an uneasy truce appeared to hold.
''Our goal is not to confront them, and I believe theirs is not to confront us,'' said Mike Winn, 52, as he hoisted a wooden angel into the air.

HEADLINE: In Wyoming, Many Jobs But No Place To Call Home

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
CASPER, Wyo. -- After losing everything last year to Southern California's soured economy, Tiffany Kipp and her family packed up three boxes and a diaper bag and caught a Greyhound bus to Wyoming, their best chance at a fresh start.
They were drawn to Wyoming, where Ms. Kipp has family, by the promise of plentiful jobs and a booming energy sector, and a thin hope of rebuilding their futures on the High Plains. But like a growing number of people here, they ended up on the underside of the boom.
Unable to scrape together enough money for an apartment, the Kipps, who once rented a four-bedroom house north of Los Angeles, bounced from motel rooms to friends' couches. They ended up in a single room at a shelter run by a local nonprofit organization.
''We lost everything,'' said Ms. Kipp, 25, whose husband works for an oil services company. ''We needed somewhere to go.'' 
There is a surprising downside to Wyoming's economic resilience and its 5.1 percent unemployment rate: a sharp rise in homelessness.
As another winter settles in, many people who moved here fleeing foreclosures and chasing jobs in the oil, gas and coal industries now find themselves without a place to live. Apartments are scarce and expensive, and the economy, while strong, is not growing at the swift pace of drilling towns in western North Dakota, where cashiers can earn $20 an hour and fast-food workers can be paid thousand-dollar signing bonuses.
As homeless rates held steady nationwide last year, federal data show that Wyoming's homeless population soared by 67 percent, to 1,813 people from 1,083 in 2011. Advocates attribute the surge in part to a more aggressive attempt to count the state's homeless.
As in any other place in the country, many homeless people in Wyoming have lived on the streets for years or suffer from mental illness or drug and alcohol addictions. But social service workers say they have seen a growing number of economic migrants from Florida and Michigan, Wisconsin and California, with nowhere to settle.
''They'd pack up their pit bulls, their children and they'd move to Wyoming with nothing, just the clothes on their backs,'' said Lily Patton, a housing counselor with Interfaith of Natrona County, a nonprofit group. ''They keep saying, 'I've never been in this situation before.' ''
When jobs elude them or a trip to the hospital eats away at their money, some of these new arrivals and returnees visit social service groups to find a way out of town: enough money to fix their car or catch a bus back home. But caseworkers said most were determined to stay and came seeking housing.
Around Casper, population 56,000, robust growth in oil and gas drilling has helped cut unemployment to 4.3 percent, but the boom has also made it nearly impossible for struggling families to find an apartment. Vacancy rates are close to 1 percent, housing officials say, and two-bedroom apartments can rent for $800 to $1,000, out of reach for many of the working poor.
Advocates say the town's few shelters and temporary housing are full, and the wait for low-income apartments has swelled to as long as two and a half years. On particularly bitter nights, when the wind tears in from the west and temperatures plummet, homeless advocates spread mattresses on their office floors or set out space heaters in storefronts to accommodate people who might otherwise freeze.
''We literally do not have anyplace for people to live,'' said Marilyn Dymond Wagner, the executive director of Interfaith. ''Where are all these people coming from?''
John Meek, 56, came from Altamonte Springs, Fla., north of Orlando, where ''you couldn't buy a job,'' he said. In July, a friend from Wyoming visited and told Mr. Meek about the opportunities here: jobs that paid $18 and $19 an hour for anyone who walked in the door.
''Like a worm on the hook, I bit,'' Mr. Meek said.
He found work on the night shift at a pipe extrusion plant, but the job paid only $10 an hour, and those hours have been erratic lately, he said. He has worked only a handful of shifts since Christmas.
Like others, he is staying at a motel, the Royal Inn, where weekly rents run about $250. But Mr. Meek is quickly falling behind. He and a friend met with a landlord but were told they could not sign a lease without $3,000 cash for the rent and the security deposit.
Still others are squeezed into subsidized single-room occupancy apartments or live out of campers in RV parks. Ms. Patton, the housing counselor, recalled one woman from Denver who came to town last summer looking for work. She pitched a tent at a campground on the west side of town and told her two children they were going on an extended camping trip.
At night, the far edge of a Walmart parking lot on the east side of town is transformed into an impromptu campground. Pickup trucks and minivans driven by people looking for a place to sleep slip into the spaces where the night-shift workers park, to blend in and reduce the chance anyone will notice them.
Among those in the parking lot is Chrystal Wise, 39, who spends the cold nights on the bench seat of her 2005 Dodge Durango. Her husband once worked in the oil fields in North Dakota, she said, but became addicted to methamphetamines and lost his job. After losing their apartment in Casper in April, Ms. Wise sent her 15-year-old son to stay with friends, and she and her husband made the truck their home.
This is the first winter she has been homeless, and she never thought she could be so cold. She said she turns on the engine once or twice each night to run the heater, but she cuts it quickly to save gas, and the cold seeps back in. The nights seem to stretch on forever.
At 7 a.m., Ms. Wise wakes up, scrapes the frost from the windshield and drives to a nearby truck stop to wash herself and clean off her work uniform. Then she heads to work at the Hamburger Stand, where she makes $7.60 an hour -- barely enough to pay for food, gas and the $450 monthly payments on her truck. Getting an apartment feels like a distant dream.
''I'm just lost,'' she said.
If families like the Wises are strained by splitting up, others are trying to stay afloat by doubling up. Angela Morgan and her two teenagers moved back to Wyoming last January from Texas. She got a job cleaning hotel rooms for $9.50 an hour and worked as many shifts as the week allowed. But as the economy slowed for the winter and tourists headed toward the ski slopes 300 miles away, Ms. Morgan's hours were cut to eight per week. She ran out of money to pay for propane or electricity, her pipes froze and the landlord taped an eviction notice to the door of her mobile home.
Now, she and her children are staying with friends, all six of them crammed into a single mobile home at the Aspen Park trailer court. Ms. Morgan's friend Misty Elfering has been welcoming, but Ms. Morgan worries about what she will do now.
''I came back for some stability, for some hope,'' she said. ''It didn't work out that way. Now, I'm just trying to survive the winter.''

HEADLINE: Good Economy or Bad, Hurdles for Junk Bonds

BYLINE: By NORM ALSTER

 BODY:
WHEN the financial crisis erupted several years ago, its victims included lenders to the weakest and most debt-laden companies. Investors in junk-bond mutual funds suffered a negative return of roughly 25 percent in 2008.
But since then, Federal Reserve policies have flattened interest rates, punishing savers with yields that don't even keep up with inflation. With little incentive to park money in bank certificates of deposit, yield-starved investors have sought out riskier instruments.
This quest for yield has been a boon to the below-investment-grade debt known as junk or high-yield bonds. Issuance of such bonds -- those ranked BB or lower -- set a record last year, according to Standard & Poor's. ''Even the lowest-rated issuer has access to capital markets,'' said Diane Vazza, head of global fixed-income research at S.& P. 
As the capital-raising prospects brightened for such companies, so did the fortunes of their bondholders. Junk bonds have produced an average annual total return of nearly 19 percent over the last four years, Ms. Vazza reported. In 2012, high-yield mutual funds trailed only emerging-market funds among all fixed-income sectors, producing total returns of more than 14 percent, according to Morningstar.
''The Fed is winning,'' said Elaine Stokes, co-manager of the Loomis Sayles High Income fund. ''You're not making anything by leaving money in the bank. High-yield has been a clear net winner.''
Of course, the past is only sometimes prologue in the fickle financial markets. Many high-yield portfolio managers caution against expectations of repeat double-digit returns this year.
''It's hard to get really excited by U.S. high-yield or high-yield globally, given the huge run-up it's had,'' Ms. Stokes said.
Andrew Feltus, lead manager of the Pioneer Global High Yield fund, and Darren Hughes, co-manager of the Invesco High Yield fund, foresee returns of 6 to 7 percent this year for junk bonds in general.
Of course, that's awfully good when the alternative is a bank certificate of deposit that may yield a sliver of 1 percent. Even 10-year Treasuries return less than 2 percent.
Is the world so topsy-turvy that risky investments are a sure bet to at least triple the safest investments?
Maybe.
But junk-bond buyers should remember that they face some serious risks. One is the risk of default. For speculative issues, the default rate is currently low, just 2.7 percent. Even if it ticks higher, as S.& P. expects, to 3.7 percent in 2013, that's still below the 30-year historical norm of 4.5 percent. So defaults probably shouldn't cost investors ''much more than one percentage point in total return'' this year, said James Keenan, lead portfolio manager of the BlackRock High Yield Bond Portfolio.
The bigger risk may be a decline in bond prices. Rising interest rates are typically the lurking natural enemy of bond prices. But with the Fed adamantly holding rates down, that seems an unlikely ambush for now.
More worrisome is the prospect of an economic downturn. ''The risks of the high-yield market declining in price are tied to the risks of recession,'' Mr. Keenan said.
But even without a recession, the prices of junk-bond investments could tumble if investors decided for any number of reasons to move their money out of the category.
One such catalyst would be a sharp pickup in the economic recovery. A more robust recovery would produce an ''acceleration of earnings growth'' that would drive investors out of bonds and into stocks, Mr. Hughes of Invesco said.
That's why market watchers pay close attention to fund flows: the streams of money coming in and out of investment sectors. For most of 2012, junk bonds have been fund-flow magnets. But there have been recent signs of reversal. High-yield mutual funds had outflows of cash in September, November and December, and high-yield exchange-traded funds had outflows in October and November.
''The greatest risk is rotation out of high-yield into equities as a result of an improving economy and improving earnings,'' Ms. Stokes said.
Fund managers, meanwhile, wonder whether the sectors that performed so well last year will lead again in 2013.
Housing and building materials, among the strongest sectors last year, were big winners for the Invesco fund. ''We've been pretty bullish on the housing recovery and it's worked well,'' Mr. Hughes said. The fund holds credits of the homebuilder Hovnanian Enterprises, as well as Nortek, which makes residential heating, cooling and ventilation products.
At Pioneer Global High Yield, Mr. Feltus notes that European credits were very strong performers last year. But in 2013, he sees potential for currency gains to bolster returns in several emerging markets. ''Mexico's might be the best-performing currency next year,'' Mr. Feltus said. He also sees potential gains in the currencies of Malaysia and the Philippines.
Mr. Feltus emphasizes the importance of credit analysis in sifting through high-yield debt issues. ''You've got to do your homework,'' he said.
Fund managers, of course, are always aware of the credit ratings issued by an agency like S.& P. or Moody's, But Mr. Hughes also says it's important to dig further. ''The agencies may be wrong,'' he said. ''''We do our own credit analysis.''
FOR investors torn between a hunger for return and a need for safety, high-yield will always pose a conundrum. ''This is a very risky asset class,'' said Sarah Bush, an analyst at Morningstar. ''There's a lot of credit risk. This is not a place you should think of as a safe place for your money.''
On the other hand, as Ms. Stokes says, investors are making little money by leaving it in the bank.
Similarly, Mr. Keenan said, ''I think 6 to 7 percent returns are going to look pretty good at the end of 2013.''

HEADLINE: When Markets Rise Above Politics

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
ECONOMIC growth remained sluggish and politics often intruded on the markets, yet stocks achieved solid returns last year all the same. It wasn't the first time that investors scaled a wall of worry, but it might be the only instance when the main source of concern, at least in the fourth quarter, was thought to be a cliff.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 13.4 percent for the year, even with a 1 percent decline in the fourth quarter. In those last months, doubts rose about whether Congress and President Obama could reach an agreement on taxes and spending in time to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff -- and the recession that was thought to lie below.
The drama in Washington was one of several throughout the year that kept investors focused more on capitols than corporate boardrooms. European leaders were continually devising plans to rescue the euro and some of the economies that use it, and China underwent a change of leadership. 
Although the fourth-quarter loss was worse soon after Election Day and stocks raced ahead at the start of the new year, investors' concerns may yet prove well founded. The immediate concerns related to taxes were resolved only at the 11th hour -- just past midnight, really -- and much remains to be sorted out on spending. Investment advisers said that politics, at home and abroad, would continue to guide markets.
''The political environment and uncertainty revolving around policy decisions has been a really big factor,'' said Jeremy DeGroot, chief investment officer of the fund provider Litman Gregory. ''There are significant deficit issues that developed economies are facing, and the markets are hanging on every development.''
One bit of uncertainty was eliminated on Jan. 1, when Congress agreed to limit the scope of scheduled tax increases, although the deal still resulted in higher tax rates on payrolls, dividends and capital gains.
Worries also abated when European Union finance ministers agreed in the fourth quarter to place big banks under the supervision of the European Central Bank. That followed the bank's announcement that it would support the bond markets of weaker economies, which are concentrated along the region's southern periphery.
THE moves on both sides of the Atlantic helped stock funds achieve modest fourth-quarter gains. The average domestic fund in Morningstar's database rose 0.9 percent. International funds fared better, up 4.8 percent, on average, with portfolios that focus on European stocks returning 7.4 percent and emerging-market funds rising 6.2 percent. Full-year returns exceeded 14 percent for all four categories.
Yields on short- and long-term debt remained low all year as the Federal Reserve and other central banks maintained the easy monetary policies in force since the 2008 crisis. While that could account for much of stocks' strength during 2012, the influence on bond returns, at least on high-quality government issues, may be waning.
The average bond fund rose a healthy 8.4 percent on the year, but the fourth-quarter gain was a slim 1.3 percent, dragged lower by a 1.1 percent loss for portfolios of long-term government bonds. High-yield bond funds rose 3.1 percent for the quarter, on average, and funds that specialize in debt issued in emerging economies gained 3.9 percent.
Just how helpful low interest rates were for economic growth is hard to discern. American economic output has continued to expand at a sluggish pace. And Europe is widely seen to be in recession.
''The trend of deterioration in Europe is not slowing down,'' said Virginie Maisonneuve, head of global and international equities at Schroder Investment Management. She noted, though, that some indicators suggested that conditions were stabilizing at very low levels along the continent's troubled southern fringe.
Whatever the economic impact of low interest rates, they seem to be helping corporate America. Corporate debt issuance last year exceeded $1 trillion for the first time.
Increased indebtedness provides leverage that lifts profit margins, said Jeremy Grantham, chief investment strategist of the fund management company GMO. Margins have reached record levels as a proportion of economic output and are ''weirdly high,'' in his opinion, ''unless we're in one of those wonderful secular shifts that people talk about but almost never see.'' He doesn't glimpse any such new normal, however, and cites high margins as a reason to be cautious about most stocks.
Rising debt of another kind is a pressing concern for many investors. With the national debt above $16 trillion, the second part of the fiscal cliff debate, focusing on spending cuts, is expected to be played out over the next month or so in Washington.
This could have higher stakes for the economy and markets and cause more acrimony than the haggling over tax rates. That's because the debt ceiling -- the limit imposed by Congress on the government's borrowing authority -- has been reached again. The concern is that Republicans will withhold approval to raise the ceiling without meaningful spending cuts. A similar battle in 2011 led to a downgrade of Treasury debt and was the catalyst for a violent stock market decline.
''We know there's going to be another fight around the debt ceiling in February,'' said Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist for Citigroup. ''We avoided plummeting off the cliff, but we haven't avoided more cliffs in the future.''
THE immediate outlook for financial markets depends on how the next cliff is navigated. An overhaul of programs like Social Security and Medicare, combined with a revamping of the tax code in a so-called grand bargain, would set spending on a gentler slope for the long term without abrupt cuts now, investment advisers said. But some, like Mr. DeGroot, were not holding their breath.
''We have to have a credible medium- to long-term plan to bring down the excess of spending over revenues, but politicians are usually not ones to make those tough decisions until they're forced to,'' he said. ''It usually takes a market disruption to force their hand. Kicking the can is an easier, less painful approach. At some point, do investors say they don't see a resolution to this?''
Mr. DeGroot finds little to recommend to investors, though he does see opportunity in foreign stocks, particularly in emerging economies. Better still, he said, are so-called unconstrained bond funds whose managers have great flexibility in how they invest.
Mr. Grantham also finds emerging stock markets appealing, along with Japan and ''cheap European value stocks,'' and he advises longer-term investors to consider commodity and energy stocks. As for the United States, he judges the market overvalued and recommends only high-quality companies.
Sometimes, all it takes to do better is to avoid doing worse. Ms. Maisonneuve said investors in Europe, for example, had begun to recognize that if the region ''is leaving behind its near-death experience, then equity valuations are very attractive, compared to fixed income.'' A recovery in Chinese and American growth could help Europe ''continue to heal itself,'' she added.
As for sectors, she particularly favors global health care, which can profit from drug sales to emerging economies, and cyclical industrial companies and commodity providers that would benefit from resurgent Chinese growth. She also likes financial service companies but is avoiding European banks.
Investors fixated last year on so-called tail risks, or potential negative surprises. But what if 2013 offered some head risks? Such positive surprises wouldn't faze Francis Scotland, director of global macro research at Brandywine Global.
''I think people are looking in the wrong direction,'' Mr. Scotland said. ''There is a risk that something might actually go right. I think we're in a sweet spot. Let's assume we take most of the sting out of the fiscal cliff. Just the clarity will improve the corporate sector outlook. There's a real case for the economy to grow above trend in the first half. It's time to move to a more risk-oriented strategy.''
While he is happy to advocate for the American economy and likes domestic market sectors like consumer discretionary and financial services, Mr. Scotland prefers to take risks elsewhere. He recommends bonds in peripheral European countries like Italy and Ireland; investment-grade emerging bond markets like Mexico, Poland and South Africa; and Japanese, Chinese and European stocks.
''You could make a case for all of these markets doing well, relative to the U.S.,'' he said.
MR. LEVKOVICH makes the case for American stocks doing well. He says he expects the S. &P. 500 to rise 13 percent this year, to 1,615. He agrees with Mr. Scotland that ''there's a bunch of good news out there.''
''Housing has improved, and job trends should improve based on surveys and credit growth,'' Mr. Levkovich said. ''There's an energy boom in places like Montana and South Dakota that is growing more jobs, and manufacturing competitiveness is developing in this country; it's cheaper to build a plant and produce goods in South Carolina than in Shenzhen.''
Even though he is hopeful about 2013, Mr. Levkovich acknowledged that investors might want to wait until Washington produced a deal that averts the next fiscal cliff before they focus on the more pleasant landscape beyond it.
''We've got this positive dynamic,'' he said. ''The biggest constraint we're facing is the fiscal issue and dysfunctional government.''

HEADLINE: A Lone Yank Takes Joy In Togetherness

BYLINE: By JOHN LITHGOW

 BODY:
LONDON
THE language of theater here is slightly different from ours in New York. The crackly speaker in a London dressing room is called the ''tannoy.'' The opening night of a London show is called its ''Press Night.'' When a stage manager announces the start of a performance, London actors don't hear the word ''places.'' They hear ''beginners.''
At the National Theater when beginners is called over the tannoy on Press Night, something extraordinary happens. It is a simple, sentimental and highly theatrical custom unique to the National. On Nov. 21 there was a Press Night. I was in the show. Hence I was there to witness this custom firsthand. My memory of that moment, more than any other event, has come to crystallize the experience of working at the National. I am one of only a handful of American actors to perform there during its 50-year history, which perhaps explains why I found that heartfelt custom so stirring.
And what exactly is the custom? I'll get to that shortly. First let me tell you a bit about the National and how I came to be there. 
The National is a big operation, arguably the biggest of its kind in the world. Its enormous, many-tiered physical plant dominates the South Bank, looming up from the Thames at the southern end of Waterloo Bridge. Its exterior walls of poured concrete, so modish when the theater opened in 1976, have not aged especially well, but the building still manages to project youthful bustle and fun. The concrete's oppressive gray is enlivened by pastel banners, by scores of bright posters for current and future productions and, at night, by vivid colored lights projected onto its vast rectangular planes.
Inside, the National teems with activity. It houses three theaters: the large thrust-style Olivier, the slightly smaller proscenium-style Lyttelton and the tiny, infinitely adaptable Cottesloe. All three are in constant year-round use. At any given time each presents up to three plays in repertory, amounting to, plus or minus, nine shows at once. New productions open with amazing frequency. Considering its prolific output, it is not surprising that the National sends so much work across the Thames to the West End and across the Atlantic to Broadway. Recent prizewinning examples include ''The History Boys,'' ''War Horse'' and ''One Man, Two Guvnors.''
A lot of the excitement at the National these days is attributable to Nicholas Hytner, its director for the last 10 years. I first got to know Nick when he directed me in the 2002 Broadway musical adaptation of the 1950s showbiz noir ''Sweet Smell of Success.'' At that time he had been hired as the National's director but would not officially take the reins for several months. In our numerous conversations he would effusively describe his aspirations for the place. He envisioned a truly national theater that would attract audiences from age groups, economic strata and ethnicities that had rarely set foot in the building before. Above all he wanted the National to be the place where everyone most wanted to work.
The following year I was in the audience at the Lyttelton for a preview performance of the first major production of Nick's regime: a new musical piece with the memorable title ''Jerry Springer: The Opera.'' It was an outrageous, profane and hilarious spectacle, the first smash hit of Nick's tenure and a brash statement of his intent. It was an audacious, auspicious start, and the following 10 years have borne out its early promise.
So imagine my excitement last July when I read an e-mail from Nick that began with the following words:
''Dear John,
''Do you know Pinero's 'The Magistrate'? And are you free September 24th -- February/March?''
The e-mail went on to describe the plot of ''The Magistrate,'' a Victorian farce, from 1885, by Arthur Wing Pinero, which Nick wanted to produce on the Olivier stage. In 1969, at 13, he had seen Alastair Sim in the play's title role at the Chichester Festival Theater, and he now imagined me in the same part. As it happened, I had seen the very same production as a 23-year-old drama student. I had loved it so much that, given the chance, I had directed the play and played a small role in it the following year in American summer stock. In the intervening four decades, I had not heard the play mentioned even once.
My answer to the two questions that began Nick's e-mail? Yes and yes.
And so it was that on the first day of the following October I found myself in the bowels of the National, meeting the 21 British actors who would be my onstage colleagues for the next five months. There were roughly 150 actors employed by the National that day, working on shows in various stages of rehearsal and production. Of all of them I was the only American.
That morning, as I navigated the building's mazelike hallways, I saw small signs that pointed the way to rehearsal rooms for three or four different plays. At 1:30 p.m. all those rehearsals broke for lunch simultaneously, and scores of actors headed to the Blue Room. This is the National's canteen, a bright, utilitarian dining room with a capacity of around 60.
The actors piled in, lined up for hot lunches and then sat together in groupings loosely based on the shows they were working on. It was a daily ritual not unlike that of a high school cafeteria, the difference being that, instead of raucous teenage schoolkids, this crowd included some of the finest English-speaking stage actors in the world.
I shortly learned that, in the coming months, I would be sharing the building with Fiona Shaw, Alex Jennings, Rory Kinnear, Frances de la Tour, Anthony Sher and Simon Russell Beale. These men and women are among Britain's most highly regarded actors, but in the Blue Room the whiff of hierarchy is barely detectable.
The same egalitarian spirit prevails in the Green Room, the National's pub. It is about 20 feet from the Blue Room, across a large common space whose walls are covered with announcements and schedules. Every night all three of the National's theaters discharge their companies at roughly the same time, and a large contingent from every show congregates in the pub, joining their guests and friends.
By 10:30 p.m. the Green Room is packed and the decibel level is high. Half of the customers are National Theater actors, their pink faces scoured clean of makeup and all of them bursting with tipsy self-congratulation.
The actors at the National are a smart and raffish lot, full of high spirits and self-mocking humor, with a disarming absence of snobbery and pretense. Because of them I have loved my time there. I have rarely had a job where I have been so eager to get to the theater at night. All of which accounts for the sentimental importance I attach to that vivid Press Night tradition in the National's dressing rooms.
Remember that? At long last, let me tell you about it.
There are about 30 dressing rooms at the National. Some hold up to five people, and a few accommodate just one. They are arranged around a 60-foot-square air shaft, five stories high, at the very center of the building's sprawling complex. All of the dressing room windows face in on one another. Look out any window at the half-hour call, and you stare right into the windows of dozens of other actors, all readying themselves for one of the three shows they are about to perform.
Actors wave greetings to one another, send news via sign language or open their windows to chat breezily across the air shaft. As the three showtimes approach, everyone gets down to business. The actors sit at their mirrors, don their wigs, make up their faces and climb into their costumes. Few choose to draw their curtains. The architectural setup tends to sharpen everyone's latent tendency toward exhibitionism and voyeurism.
When one of the shows opens for the press, no official announcement is made over the tannoys, but everyone is acutely aware that, for a third of their number, this is their big night. At the instant their show's stage manager announces beginners, all the actors in all the dressing rooms walk to their windows and, with open palms and in full view of everyone else, they drum on the glass. The sound is like the stampede of a thousand wildebeests.
It is a glorious moment and the most beautiful tribute from one set of actors to another that I have ever been a part of. It is like the thunderous heartbeat of theater itself. When it happened on that November night for all of us in ''The Magistrate,'' I stood at my window, banged on the glass and burst into tears.
A few weekends ago I was at my makeup mirror tying a Victorian cravat around my neck. It was a few minutes before an evening performance of our show. I heard beginners called for ''This House,'' being presented that night at the Cottesloe. It was to be the final performance of its sensationally successful premiere run.
''This House'' was slated to reopen on the much larger Olivier stage three months hence, but for now this was its closing night. A few seconds after the call I heard a familiar rumbling sound. At first I thought it was a low-flying jet passing overhead, or perhaps an earthquake. I looked out my dressing room window and there they were -- 50 actors banging on their windows.
''Of course,'' I thought. ''The Press Night custom applies to closing nights too. And nobody told me.''
I joined in once again. If anything, it was even more moving than the first time. My thoughts, you see, were racing ahead to the night of Feb. 10. That is the night when our show will close, everyone will bang on their windows for us, and my five months at the National Theater will come to an end. Unlike the return of ''This House,'' our beloved production of ''The Magistrate'' will not be coming back.
I could hardly bear to think about it.
''The Magistrate'' will be broadcast beginning Thursday to some movie theaters as part of the National Theater Live program. Information: microsites.nationaltheatre.org.uk/ntlive.

HEADLINE: Indo-Caribbean Content, Victorian Style

BYLINE: By VERA HALLER

 BODY:
RICHMOND HILL, in southeastern Queens, is the ultimate study in New York diversity. It is a place to eat Caribbean cuisine, shop for Bollywood movies, worship at a Sikh temple and stroll through streets lined with Victorian-era houses, a slice of pure Americana.
Extending down the south slope of Forest Park, the neighborhood evolves from the quiet streets just off the park, where the old wood-framed homes are found, to vibrant ''Little Guyana'' along Liberty Avenue, its southern border with South Ozone Park.
''There are churches next to mosques next to mandirs,'' said Richard S. David, the executive director of the Indo-Caribbean Alliance, a social service agency that works in the neighborhood. (A mandir is a Hindu temple.)
Ivan Mrakovcic, the president of the Richmond Hill Historical Society and a vice chairman of Community Board 9, says he also sees religious diversity near his home in the Victorian section, where an Orthodox synagogue sits near Lutheran and Roman Catholic churches. 
Mr. Mrakovcic moved to Richmond Hill in 1994, finding it more affordable than Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where he had originally looked in order to be close to family. The way he describes it, the area offers both urban and suburban living. ''You can have a vegetable garden and mow the lawn, but the J train is three blocks away and it's a short walk to the park,'' he said, also noting that the Rockaway beaches are a 20-minute drive.
According to 2010 census figures compiled by the city Planning Department, Richmond Hill covers about three square miles and has nearly 63,000 residents, including Asians (27.4 percent), Hispanics (36 percent), whites (11.2 percent), and blacks/African-Americans (11.1 percent).
Among those populations are the neighborhood's Indo-Caribbean residents: Guyanese immigrants of South Asian ancestry who began settling in the area in the 1960s, Mr. David said. Now, the community includes second- and third-generation Americans.
''A lot of people are renting basements or housing family members,'' said Seema Agnani, the executive director of Chhaya Community Development Corporation, a housing agency that works with South Asians in New York City. ''All floors of those homes are occupied.''
For immigrants especially, housing space has been particularly limited by the foreclosure crisis, which hit hard in parts of Richmond Hill. ''People fell prey to predatory loan practices and many refinanced during the height of the high interest rates,'' Ms. Agnani said. Financial troubles were compounded when homeowners who held service jobs or who worked in construction saw their incomes drop.
''It was really a loss of income together with the bad loans that pushed a lot of homeowners over the edge,'' Ms. Agnani said, adding that the housing market is slowly improving.
It is south of Atlantic Avenue, in an area also known as South Richmond Hill, that Guyanese-Americans have settled in large numbers. There, homes are smaller and more closely spaced.
Liberty Avenue serves the Indo-Caribbean population with its many small businesses: sari stores, Guyanese bakeries and restaurants, and fish and vegetable markets. Colorful wares and clothing are displayed on sidewalks, which bustle with shoppers.
According to Mr. David, Sikhs took root here during the height of the real estate market in the early 2000s, when some Guyanese-Americans in the area moved to Florida, Pennsylvania and other states and often sold their homes to Sikhs. The city's largest Sikh temple, the Sikh Cultural Center, is at 117th Street and 97th Avenue.
WHAT YOU'LL FIND
The area is low-rise, made up of single- and multifamily homes with a smattering of apartment buildings. The northern part has larger houses, many of them fine examples of Queen Anne Victorian architecture, adorned with gables and inviting verandas.
The historical society has unsuccessfully petitioned the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission to designate a historic district in the northern part. Mr. Mrakovcic said a new petition would seek to cover a smaller area between Forest Park and Myrtle Avenue.
Homeownership turnover in this microneighborhood of Richmond Hill is low, especially since the downturn of 2007 and 2008, said Mitra Hakimi, a real estate agent who works in Richmond Hill and other Queens neighborhoods. She said some owners were testing the market now, putting their houses up for sale to see how much buyers would be willing to pay.
Inventory is more plentiful below Atlantic Avenue. Some homes share narrow driveways that lead to free-standing garages that abut backyards of neighboring properties. This part of the neighborhood is lined with block after block of neatly kept homes, most with aluminum siding in white and light colors and well-tended front gardens.
WHAT YOU'LL PAY
Home values suffered during the mortgage crash. ''Before the 2008 financial crisis,'' Ms. Hakimi said, ''you couldn't find a property under $250,000; It didn't exist. Now you can easily find one.''
According to a search of properties in Richmond Hill on the Multiple Listing Service last month, 159 properties -- predominantly single- and multifamily with some mixed-used buildings -- were for sale.
On the high end was a six-bedroom Victorian with a formal living room and a home office, listed for $779,000.
The least expensive was a four-bedroom listed at $150,000, as a short sale, in which a bank sells the property because the mortgage debt has surpassed the home's value. It was one of 43 short sales on the list of 159.
Prices are still depressed compared with levels before the crisis. According to Ms. Hakimi, a house that sold for $470,000 in 2004 would very likely sell for $100,000 less now. Rooplall Phagu, an agent with Family Choice Realty in Richmond Hill, said he saw a similar trend. A large two-family home listed for $480,000 to $550,000 would have sold for as much as $650,000 before 2007, he said.
Ms. Hakimi added: ''It is a price-driven market. Nobody is going to overpay. They want to buy, but at the right price.''
THE COMMUTE
Richmond Hill is well served by the subway system, which has elevated lines running along two avenues. The rides to Manhattan are direct, if long. The northern part of Richmond Hill has J trains along Jamaica Avenue. A trip to Grand Central Terminal from the 104th Street station takes about an hour and requires a transfer to the 6 train at Canal Street. The A train has a branch that runs along Liberty Avenue ending at the intersection with Lefferts Boulevard, the center of Little Guyana. The journey from the Lefferts Avenue stop to Times Square takes about an hour.
Residents also can take a bus to the nearest Long Island Rail Road stop in Kew Gardens; the trip to Penn Station in Manhattan takes 17 minutes.
WHAT TO DO
Residents of northern Richmond Hill have easy access to Forest Park, which has a golf course, a horseback-riding school and equestrian path, a historic carousel, playgrounds, ball fields and trails for hiking and running. Shopping and eating on Liberty Avenue are also popular. Mr. David says Guyanese-Americans who live in the Bronx and Brooklyn come to Liberty Avenue to do their grocery shopping. Ms. Agnani added: ''On the weekend, it's very thriving on the streets with music and food. The diversity of our city -- it comes out very clearly there.''
The commercial area in northern Richmond Hill along Jamaica Avenue has experienced the loss of longtime businesses like Jahn's ice cream parlor, which closed a few years ago. A shopping center being built along Hillside Avenue at Lefferts Boulevard promises the arrival of a Dunkin' Donuts, a rare fast-food presence in the neighborhood.
THE SCHOOLS
Richmond Hill High School, with about 2,500 students, got a C on its most recent city progress report. Its combined SAT average last year was 1156, versus 1325 citywide. The neighborhood has a number of elementary schools, among them Public School 90 Horace Mann School, which has 860 students and got an A on its most recent progress report. No. 66 Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis has 500 students and also received an A. For middle school there is No. 137 America's School of Heroes, which has nearly 2,000 students and got a C.
THE HISTORY
A mural depicting the neighborhood's beginnings in the late 19th century can be found inside the Queens Library at Richmond Hill on Hillside Avenue. The American artist Philip Evergood painted it in the 1930s with funding from the Works Progress Administration. Covering a wall above the fiction section, the work shows three scenes: a crowded and squalid immigrant neighborhood in Manhattan; a group of prosperous real estate barons surveying plans for a new garden community near a railroad stop; and a bucolic scene of trees, homes and happy mothers and children in the newly created Richmond Hill.

HEADLINE: The Low Politics of Low Growth

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY. 
A reporter on economic policy for The New York Times.

 BODY:
WE typically blame Washington for not doing more to help the economy grow. But what if we have it backward: What if it is the weak economy that is driving the failures in Washington?
That is what Benjamin Friedman, a Harvard economist who has studied the way slow growth frays societies and strains politics, thinks. ''We could be stuck in a trap,'' he told me last week. ''We could be stuck in a perverse equilibrium in which our absence of growth is delivering political paralysis, and the political paralysis preserves the absence of growth.'' 
Consider how different our politics might be today if the economy had not collapsed in 2008 and not been mired in sluggish growth ever since. A ballpark estimate suggests that if the economy were to grow one percentage point more than expected in each year over the next 10, the deficit would shrink by more than $3 trillion. That would be more than enough to set the ratio of our debt to our annual economic output on a comforting downward trajectory. Moreover, it would happen without making cuts to a single program, like Medicare or food stamps, or without raising a single dollar of additional tax revenue. Even a much smaller boost to growth -- say one-tenth of a percentage point per year, or even half that -- would make Congress and the White House's burden hundreds of billions of dollars lighter.
And consider how much better deficit reduction might feel to families in a growing economy, compared with a limping one. The recovery in the past year has delivered only sluggish wage growth, with much erased by inflation as more of a worker's paycheck goes to paying for more expensive groceries, tuition bills and gas. The end of a payroll tax holiday was only one small portion of the fiscal deal the White House and Republican leaders brokered at the turn of the year. Yet it was enough to wipe out a full year's worth of wage gains entirely.
Indeed, even before the economic crisis, middle-class incomes had stagnated, with the economy's gains primarily going to a thin sliver of wealthy families. Then, of course, the crisis hit, forcing millions into unemployment and millions more into poverty. Given that reality, Democrats have fought for making the George W. Bush-era tax cuts permanent for 98 percent of households. Republicans have argued that nobody should have to shoulder the burden of tax increases at all.
''Everything is easier to do if the economy is growing,'' says William G. Gale of the Brookings Institution. ''If you want to cut spending, it is easier to do in an environment where people think they are going to have robust income growth and aren't as dependent on government. In terms of taxes, growth gets you not just more income to tax, but taxpayers moving into higher rates.''
Yet growth has broadly disappeared from the fiscal discussion that continues to occupy Congress and the White House, a discussion that has focused obsessively on deficits and debts, spending and taxes and fairness. But growth will be one of the most crucial determinants of whether the country can find its way back to fiscal health in the long run.
Indeed, the United States is currently facing a burden of debt so large that, hypothetically, it would take more than half of the country's economic output over a whole year to pay it off. It is also recovering from a recession so deep and a recovery so sluggish that there has been no net job growth since 2005.
That makes deficit reduction vastly harder, as it means asking voters who are already struggling to sacrifice more now in order to avert the abstract threat of a future debt crisis. ''I do think that part of what we're seeing -- the nasty tone of our politics, the anti-immigrant sentiment -- has a lot to do with the fact that the average American family has now seen no increase in its real income for 15 years,'' said Mr. Friedman, the Harvard economist.
The problem is that it is not easy to increase growth, and it is particularly difficult if you are also trying to reduce deficits. The deal just struck by Congress to remove the worst of the blow from the so-called fiscal cliff will nevertheless give the economy a cold chill of austerity this year, with forecasters estimating that the expiration of that payroll tax holiday, new tax hikes and previously legislated spending cuts might cut 2013 economic growth from 3 percent to 2 percent or even lower.
AT the same time that the fiscal cliff deal did little for growth, it did little to reduce deficits either. Indeed, the deal, as a whole, increased the debt by almost $4 trillion over 10 years as compared with simply going over the cliff.
That comes with its own growth implications. ''We've put ourselves in the box that we have an economy so heavily laden with debt that anyone thinking about growing-expanding-hiring here is facing a fundamental roll of the dice,'' said Doug Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and a top Republican economist. At some point, Mr. Eakin says, the country would need to increase taxes, slash social spending or face significantly higher borrowing costs -- none of which would help businesses or individuals. ''We're giving people a terrible deal over any sensible horizon,'' he told me.
That is why the original White House proposal and many bipartisan deficit proposals -- like those put forward by the Simpson-Bowles commission or Alice Rivlin of Brookings and former Senator Pete Domenici -- included a jolt of stimulus to help ensure growth as the country continues to recover from the recession.
The idea is that we do not have to choose between aiding growth now and cutting deficits later. We can simply put in place an integrated policy that does both. This is particularly true given that borrowing costs for the federal government rest at record lows, making growth-boosting investments now and deficit reduction later a particularly good deal by historical standards.
It has frustrated many economists that Congress has thus far been unable to agree on such a package. But this is where the chicken-and-egg problem of bad policy in a bad economy comes into play: It is perhaps the case that a side effect of bad economies is bad policy, which then makes the economy worse, which makes politics worse, and so on.
A potential example of how that might manifest in an extreme fashion is the debt ceiling. The unusually bad economic and budgetary conditions the country has faced in recent years have led Republicans to make the unprecedented decision to threaten national default unless the White House accedes to their preferred economic policies -- namely finally making significant cuts to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.
If the two sides are unable to come to an agreement by the deadline, the United States government could fail to pay its obligations for the first time in history, triggering global financial chaos and doing terrific damage to the United States economy. Thus would a bad economy have led to bad political decisions that ended in a much worse economy.
At this point, even the optimists do not sound that optimistic. Their argument is not that fast growth will return quickly, but that it will, eventually, return. ''I don't think the long-term growth picture has changed at all,'' says Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics. ''What we have been going through is wrenching, and it's hard to say it is temporary because it has been going on for a while. It's a deep hole, and it's taking a long time to get out. But we'll get on the other side of this.''

HEADLINE: The Parent-Teacher Trap

BYLINE: By SARA MOSLE. 
Sara Mosle is a sixth-grade English teacher, a journalist and the author of a forthcoming book about a 1937 school explosion in New London, Tex.

 BODY:
The teacher-parent relationship is a lot like an arranged marriage. Neither side gets a lot of say in the match. Both parties, however, share great responsibility for a child, which can lead to a deeply rewarding partnership or the kind of conflict found in some joint-custody arrangements.
As a teacher and parent, I see the relationship from a dual perspective. Educators almost universally regard parent involvement within economically disadvantaged student communities as a vital way to boost student achievement.
Yet in more affluent neighborhoods, active parent engagement, as the clinical psychologist Wendy Mogel has argued in her latest book, "The Blessing of a B Minus," can interfere with children's necessary maturation and strides toward independence. 
Parents of all classes may be forgiven if they can't clearly identify the point at which a parent goes from providing valued hands-on support to becoming an obstacle to children's growth.
"No one wants to be a helicopter parent," says Liza Lee, head of the Columbus School for Girls in Ohio and a former head of the middle school at Brearley, the elite private school in Manhattan. "Parents just don't always know how to work with schools." Ms. Lee points out that few parents know anything about other families' private parent-teacher conferences and, as a result, have few models for guidance.
So parents have no idea whether it's better to be a squeaky wheel, or avoid rocking the boat lest they irritate a teacher who will subsequently take his or her annoyance out on the child, a common parental fear, according to Ms. Lee, and one that's almost always unwarranted.
For teachers, the terrain can feel equally treacherous. "Today, teachers are being bashed everywhere they turn," Ms. Lee says. "They're scared. They feel parents put their jobs in jeopardy. The parent is in the position of power."
A few simple guidelines emerge in conversations with educators and parents on the subject of how best to reduce the mutual anxieties and establish and maintain the kind of trust that is essential to respectful and productive parent-teacher communications:
First, encourage children to take the lead. Many parents can't resist the urge to fix even older students' problems for them instead of giving the child a chance to sort out difficulties on his own, says Kevin Skelly, a father of four and the superintendent of the Palo Alto Unified School District, which serves the offspring of Silicon Valley executives and a small percentage of students who qualify for free or reduced-price lunches. "We all need to learn how to work with diverse people," he says. "Imagine how confident a student will feel if he or she works with the teacher and resolves the issue on his or her own?" College admissions officers tell Mr. Skelly they're looking for students "with a voice," he says. "When parents intervene on their children's behalf, it's robbing them of their own voice."
Second, know the power - and limitations - of electronic communications. Many parents and teachers communicate almost exclusively by e-mail or text messages. The appeal is obvious: communications can be asynchronous and delivered with the tap of a thumb. Jasper Steenhuis, who teaches at a KIPP original charter school in the South Bronx, tries to accommodate families' needs. "It can be disruptive for a parent to receive a phone call on the job," he says, and those without a strong command of English may feel more comfortable composing messages in writing.
But there are drawbacks. It's easier to fire off a text in anger or annoyance; so, as Ms. Lee points out, conflicts often escalate in e-mail in ways they never would face to face. Educators caution against using e-mail or texts except to convey simple information like appointments or scheduled absences. Whenever a subject is delicate or a matter can't be resolved by a quick exchange, Mr. Steenhuis advises picking up the phone or meeting in person.
Third, if you use e-mail for minor matters with a teacher, don't copy the head of school or another administrator. "It's disrespectful to teachers and parents alike, as it sends the message you don't think there's even a chance you can work this out on your own," Mr. Skelly says. "If you have issues, take them up directly, as you would want."
Fourth, teachers, please respond to communications within a reasonable time period. Nothing drives parents battier, they say, than initiating communication and never receiving a reply. Teachers can't always resolve an issue immediately, especially when they need to consult colleagues in order to do so. But teachers can and should acknowledge messages promptly and let parents know they will respond.
It helps if parents have some idea of what teachers' days are like. If a parent sends an e-mail at 8 a.m., a teacher may not see it until after her classes are over for the day. My students know I'm unlikely to respond to an e-mail between the hours of 6 p.m. and 9 p.m., as that's when I'm focusing on being a parent to my own child.
Fifth, if you do drop the ball, say "I'm sorry," as you would to a friend. It's gracious and builds trust. "Nothing is more disarming," Mr. Skelly says, "and it's so simple to do."
Sixth, identify and build on strengths. I don't do this enough as a teacher, and most parents, according to educators I've spoken to, don't do it at all, but if you have something positive to say, say it early and often. Parents are better prepared to hear about a child's challenges, if a teacher knows their child, understands his or her strengths and is prepared to build on them. The same is true for teachers. Let them know what they're doing right, not just what they're doing wrong. Seventh, look for concrete solutions. When parents and teachers have chronic conflicts, Ms. Lee assumes that, as in a bad marriage, both sides are telling "the truth," at least from their perspective. But that doesn't relieve either party of coming up with a solution for the child's sake. Whatever the trouble, identify the concrete outcomes desired.
And finally, proceed with humility. Mr. Skelly counsels parents to take occasional bellyaching about his teachers by a child - especially a teenager - with a grain of salt. Most teenagers are in some kind of opposition to authority as they struggle to grow up.
"The teenager, being a teenager," Mr. Skelly says, "may not rank your parenting skills very high, either."

HEADLINE: The Messy Work Of Examining Disorganizations

BYLINE: By LOGAN HILL

THE Brooklyn documentarians Audrey Ewell and Aaron Aites were watching live online as Occupy Wall Street started its ill-fated march over the Brooklyn Bridge. It was October 2011, and ''there was this crazy drama unfolding,'' Ms. Ewell said. ''All of a sudden everybody is being arrested -- and then the guy who was filming it said his batteries were running low, and the screen went black.''
Ms. Ewell turned on the television. ''There was absolutely nothing,'' she said. ''No coverage of 740 people being arrested on the Brooklyn Bridge.'' So she and Mr. Aites, who had made ''Until the Light Takes Us,'' about Norwegian death metal, took their cameras to Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan. ''We're not part of the movement, but we were interested, and there was this experimental aspect that appealed to us,'' Ms. Ewell said. ''What would happen if you took their sort of diffuse processes and turned them into a really goal-oriented project?'' 
The result of that experiment, ''99%: The Occupy Wall Street Collaborative Film,'' will have its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival next Sunday. It is one of three films at this year's festival, along with the Arab Spring documentary ''The Square'' and the Tea Party documentary ''Citizen Koch,'' that are racing to catch up with rapidly evolving social movements. The level of difficulty of all three films is extraordinary. At a time when digital filmmaking makes it easier to speed the news into theaters, it's also harder to keep pace with it. Each of these films faces the challenge of describing a diverse social movement that's still coalescing. They don't readily present central leaders or particularly coherent messages.
''For a filmmaker it's always a question of: What are your assets and what is the narrative approach that you want to take when you want to tell a story about something as diffuse, in a way, as a movement?'' said Cara Mertes, director of the Sundance Institute Documentary Film Program, which supported all three films. ''Each of these actually take different narrative strategies in order to bring you into a narrative about something that is quite disparate, quite complex.''
In ''The Square'' Jehane Noujaim, whose credits include the Al Jazeera documentary ''Control Room,'' tries to makes sense of the sprawling Arab Spring movement by focusing on Egyptian activists in Tahrir Square. ''Jehane actually uses Tahrir Square as a geographical location, but it's her central character,'' Ms. Mertes said. ''You get to know several characters, but only in relationship to that geography.''
In ''Citizen Koch'' the directors Carl Deal and Tia Lessin take the pulse of the Tea Party by focusing on David H. Koch and Charles G. Koch, the billionaire brothers who financed Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks. ''They use a third kind of angle, a follow-the-money approach,'' Ms. Mertes said.
The Occupy Wall Street film is the most experimental, as Ms. Ewell and Mr. Aites tried to mirror the consensus-building, nonhierarchical democracy of that movement. The title cards announce, ''The film you're about to see was made collaboratively by more than 100 filmmakers and newcomers across the United States.'' The unusual credits read, ''A film founded by Audrey Ewell and Aaron Aites,'' and go on to list two other directors, Lucian Read and Nina Krstic, and five co-directors: Katie Teague, Peter Leeman, Aric Gutnick, Abby Martin, and Doree Simon.
''They actually tried to cut a film that resembled the process of the movement itself,'' said John Cooper, director of the Sundance Film Festival.
Shortly after the protesters' clash on the Brooklyn Bridge, Ms. Ewell sent out an open call. ''We started off with the basic idea that anybody was welcome, experienced filmmakers would lead the project, and we wouldn't make propaganda,'' she said over coffee in a cafe in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The filmmakers were inundated with volunteers. A list-serv soon became unmanageable. An anarchist activist hijacked their Facebook page. ''We had hundreds of e-mails every day,'' Ms. Ewell said, ''from people who were like, 'I think we should start working on what bands are in the movie.' ''
''That was the most popular topic,'' Mr. Aites agreed.
The two were able to coordinate an outline for the documentary via e-mail before killing off the list. ''We ditched the consensus process wholesale,'' Ms. Ewell said, ''and it actually turned into the strictest hierarchy imaginable because it was complete and utter chaos without it.''
Instead they focused on reflecting the diversity of the movement. ''The biggest way we thought we were mirroring the movement was actually not so much about the consensus process,'' Ms. Ewell added. ''It was about the idea that people from all walks of life all over the country would have a voice in the final film.''
Much like the Occupy Wall Street protesters, who organized into specialized affinity groups, Ms. Ewell and Mr. Aites divided contributors into subgroups by geography and issue: economic disparity, the media, student debt, protests and home foreclosure, as represented by a single mother's situation in Minneapolis. The process involved assignments and the arduous task of reviewing more than 18 terabytes of submitted digital video. But Ms. Ewell said the film was not crowdsourced: ''When people hear that, they think it's going to be 90 minutes of YouTube.''
Much like the movement the film took shape according to who volunteered -- and who disappeared. ''Despite their terms that there are no leaders, there were very clear, identifiable leaders in the movement,'' Ms. Ewell said. ''It's who keeps showing up. And it's the same idea with our film.''
It's no accident that the tension between democratic access and goal-oriented expertise becomes a theme in the film itself, as people argue that Occupy Wall Street's horizontal structure prevents it from making a greater practical impact.
''They need a production manager,'' Ms. Ewell said, ''to get that thing whipped into shape.''
Mr. Aites said, shrugging: ''I don't know. They did what they did.''
Ms. Ewell replied, nodding in agreement: ''I know, I know. I'm imposing other values on them -- and that's what we try not to do too much of.''
