HEADLINE: End Deductions For Mortgages

BYLINE: By AGNES T. CRANE

 BODY:
Mortgages should be made less attractive. That's one lesson of the recent housing bubble and bust. As long as borrowing seems like the easy road to riches, people will do too much of it. But right now in the United States, the tax code encourages many people to take out big mortgages. That's why it's a good idea to put the elimination of the tax deductibility of mortgage interest on the political agenda.
 American homeowners can for tax purposes deduct interest on mortgages of up to $1 million. It's a politically popular arrangement, and the lure of paying a bit less to the government has been an incentive to stretch housing budgets up to, or past, the limit. Even extra cash borrowed under home equity loans can share in the tax largess, whether or not the funds go to home improvement. 
 Take a married couple spending $400,000 on their home, a bit more than twice the $164,700 median price reported by the National Association of Realtors. The mortgage interest deduction, plus the deduction of property tax, is worth well over $20,000 a year, based on a 20 percent down payment, a 6 percent interest rate, and a 1 percent property tax. That's an alternative to the $11,400 standard deduction the couple would otherwise be entitled to, but at a 28 percent tax rate, it would still reduce their annual taxes by some $3,000.
 And the more the couple borrows, the more they save. A $900,000 home could reduce their taxes by nearly $13,000, assuming a 33 percent tax rate on income.
 But not everyone benefits from the mortgage interest tax perk. The gross tax deduction for a married couple in a median home, as measured by the real estate agents' association, would come to a bit more than $9,000, not enough on its own to make it worthwhile to forgo the standard deduction, which is available to every taxpayer.
 The high income needed to take advantage of this tax benefit undercuts the claims of supporters that tax deductibility of mortgage interest promotes home ownership, which almost all Americans seem to assume is a good thing. In fact, it is a distortion in favor of those who need the least help.
 The tax logic also encourages families to borrow rather than save. When the personal savings rate is a paltry 3 percent and policy makers are wringing their hands about global imbalances, this is the wrong message to send. Moreover, potential investment is skewed toward housing rather than, say, infrastructure, manufacturing and education.
 Economists have been pointing out these distortions for years, but for politicians, advocating the elimination of this deduction is seen as suicidal. One problem is that an immediate elimination would probably pull down house prices, the last thing the already weak housing market needs.
 The danger comes from the lower purchasing power that higher taxes would bring. For the couple who used to be able to afford a $400,000 home, the maximum purchase price would fall by 11 percent. The $900,000 home would have to drop about 21 percent in value to offset its owners' higher tax payments. That sounds like an invitation to open another chapter of the financial crisis.
 But even such a big change in tax policy could be phased in slowly enough to avoid disaster. Britain removed the tax advantages of home ownership over a period of 12 years. In the 1990s, the mortgage tax relief rate gradually fell from 25 percent to 10 percent before disappearing completely in 2000.
 The British experience teaches another lesson besides the feasibility of a fairer approach to housing tax. Mortgage tax relief ended just as a housing bubble began. Far from slumping, the median British house price rose 145 percent from 2000 to the peak in 2007, according to the Halifax bank.
 Higher taxes for mortgage borrowers would not prevent excesses in the United States housing market either. They would need to be complemented by careful controls on lending. But it would be a step in a good direction. As policy makers consider how to reshape this troubled sector of the economy -- and the need to raise taxes to shrink an enormous deficit -- getting rid of a poorly designed tax incentive is good place to start.

HEADLINE: Celebrating the Delicate Beauty of the Desert Landscape

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
Few architects have invested more time trying to bridge the gap between the high-tech aesthetics of the West and the traditions of the Middle East than Jean Nouvel.
 His design for the Arab World Institute in Paris in 1987 was dominated by mechanical, light-regulating apertures arranged in a pattern that evoked Islamic motifs. A planned branch of the Louvre Museum in Abu Dhabi will be shaded by a gigantic dome that turns its grounds into a kind of oasis. And workers are putting the final touches on an office tower in Doha, Qatar, that is sheathed in aluminum latticework and capped by a filigreed, mosquelike dome. 
 But Mr. Nouvel's design for the National Museum of Qatar, scheduled to be unveiled on Tuesday at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, may be that French architect's most overtly poetic act of cultural synthesis yet. One of a number of major museum projects in Doha, including I. M. Pei's year-old Museum of Islamic Art, it is part of a government push to encourage the exchange of cultural traffic -- between East and West, tradition and modernity -- after many years in which it seemed to move only one way. Every level of Mr. Nouvel's project, from its materials to its dominant forms to its sprawling layout, reflects a richly imaginative effort to retain a connection to the fading world of the Bedouins from which modern Qatar sprang, while also embracing the realities of a rapidly urbanizing society.
 As recently as the 1950s Doha was a small town built on fishing and pearl diving; its souk served as a trading center for Bedouin tribes. 
 That began to change with the rise of an economy built on oil, and the urban growth that resulted. By the 1990s high rises and air-conditioned malls were replacing traditional stucco houses. The process accelerated during the global economic boom, creating an entirely new skyline, and has continued apace since, as the government pushes ahead with construction projects like the new museums and vast Western-style university campuses. Meanwhile, as younger Qataris, many of them educated in the West, began to embrace urban culture, an older generation that grew up in the desert began to die off, taking their memories with them. 
 As the national museum's director, Peggy Loar, an American who was formerly the director of the Wolfsonian Museum in Miami, put it: ''The problem is that Bedouin culture is very intangible,'' with artifacts that are few and fragile: ''tents, hand painting, the delicate stitch on a textile.''
 The Bedouins were ''really about telling stories,'' she continued. ''So even as you see this amazing second renaissance in the Arab world, they are losing the basic underpinnings of who they are. Younger people go out into the desert in their SUVs, but they don't live there anymore. They are losing a connection to their culture.''
 Mr. Nouvel's design begins by making a fundamental connection along these lines.
 Inspired by sand roses, the tiny formations that crystallize just below the desert's surface, the building's dozens of disclike forms, intersecting at odd angles and piling up unevenly atop one another, celebrate a delicate beauty in the desert landscape that is invisible to those who have not spent time there. The lightness with which these forms rest on the land, meanwhile, conjures the ethereality of desert life. 
 Under these disclike roofs, the building is a chain of interconnected pavilions and outdoor terraces surrounding a large open-air courtyard, a layout that evokes caravanserais, shelters that were built along the old trade routes. The Amiri Palace, a traditional mud-brick structure built for the royal family in the 1920s, breaks in among the pavilions near the museum's main entry, where it serves as a visual anchor. 
 Seen from above in a model, the tumbling abstract disc forms recall the explorer Wilfred Thesiger's description of the ''apparently haphazard confusion'' of the desert dunes. The discs' pinkish-beige concrete surfaces echo the hidden patterns that give the desert sands their richness -- the subtle blend of colors, of heavy and light grains.
 But the more you stare at the renderings, the more the project becomes recognizable as a building shaped by a forward-looking sensibility. The asymmetrical arrangement of the discs -- whose razor-thin edges emphasize the building's lightness -- speaks to contemporary architectural ideas about heterogeneity and openness. 
 The galleries will be loosely arranged in chronological order, beginning with exhibitions on the natural history of the desert and the Persian Gulf, artifacts from Bedouin culture, historical exhibitions on the tribal wars and the establishment of the Qatari state, and finally the discovery of oil to the present. The tilting plates that form the walls in some places will create peekaboo views from one gallery to another, pulling you along. But the arrangement will also allow the audience to drift in and out of the gallery pavilions, treating them as a single sequence or as individual chapters in a looser narrative. 
 Mr. Nouvel imagines a minimal number of fixed displays -- tents, textiles, fishing boats -- set at the center of the rooms, as in a more traditional museum. The walls of the larger galleries would be covered in large-scale moving images meant to immerse visitors in the world of the desert. As he put it recently, ''To understand the desert today you need helicopters and four-wheel-drive Jeeps. I think we could replicate that experience here, so the museum becomes a kind of portal to the desert.'' 
 The design's freshness is thrown into relief by its relationship to Mr. Pei's distinguished Museum of Islamic Art. That building's heavy stone geometric forms were intended as an expression of an ideal balance between traditional Islamic architecture and an equally traditional modernism. They speak of permanence. Mr. Nouvel's creation gives weight to an underappreciated history while remaining firmly pointed toward the future. It shows an awareness of the speed with which contemporary cultures change.
 Together, the two museums form the beginnings of a conversation about cultural identity that should resonate on both sides of the divide.

HEADLINE: With Health Bill's Approval, Some Anxiety Is Eased

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Drug and hospital companies led stocks higher on Monday after House lawmakers ended months of uncertainty and approved the health care overhaul bill.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose about 44 points. Broader indexes also climbed.
 Investors had expected the health care bill would pass the House, but the approval late Sunday removed some of the anxiety that has dogged stocks of hospitals and drug makers. A bill with changes made by the House now goes back to the Senate for approval. Debate could begin on Tuesday.
 The 10-year, $938 billion bill will extend benefits to 32 million uninsured Americans. That will have far-reaching effects on health companies. 
 Hospital stocks rose on expectations they would have more business and increased revenue. Some insurers fell because of greater restrictions imposed by the changes.
 The hospital operator Tenet Healthcare rose 9 percent, and the insurer UnitedHealth Group fell 3.2 percent.
 ''You've got some uncertainty here lifted,'' Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago, said. 
 Mr. Ablin added, however, that other industries would face higher costs to pay for wider coverage. ''What it really comes down to is that as a result of this bill, health care is a beneficiary at the expense of every other sector.''
 The Dow rose 43.91, or 0.41 percent, to 10,785.89. It has risen 14 of the last 17 trading days and stands at its highest level since October 2008.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.91, or 0.51 percent, to 1,165.81. The Nasdaq composite index rose 20.99, or 0.88 percent, to 2,395.40. It closed at a high for the year and is at its best level since August 2008.
 Bond prices rose and yields fell. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 9/32, to 99 23/32, and the yield fell to 3.66 percent, from 3.69 percent late Friday.
 The dollar fell against other major currencies, and gold also fell. Crude oil rose 57 cents, to $81.25 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Stocks fell on Friday because of renewed concerns about budget problems in Greece. More questions about Greece hurt stocks early Monday. The country's debt troubles have dragged down global stock markets on and off for nearly two months as the country tries to cut its budget deficit.
 Questions about Greece arose again when Germany's chancellor said on Sunday that a bailout for Greece would not be discussed at a European summit meeting this week. But concern eased after the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, said Monday that Greece would not be able to dump the euro as its currency.
 Meanwhile, retailers signaled that affluent consumers were stepping up spending. The jeweler Tiffany said its fourth-quarter profit quadrupled, though earnings fell short of analysts' forecasts.
 Williams-Sonoma said increased revenue raised profit by more than sevenfold from a year ago, when one-time costs dented results. The company, which sells kitchenware, forecast stronger results for its current fiscal quarter.
 Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist for Stifel Nicolaus in Baltimore, said he was encouraged that expectations were growing for first-quarter profits. Corporate earnings are the biggest driver of the stock market.
 ''More analysts than not are choosing to increase their estimates, and that's a good thing,'' Mr. Cripps said.
 Tiffany rose 16 cents to $47.41, and Williams-Sonoma advanced $2.96, or 12.3 percent, to $27.10.
 Google fell $2.50, or 0.5 percent, to $557.50 after the company stopped censoring the Internet in China by moving its search engine off the mainland. Visitors to Google's China service were redirected to Google's Chinese-language service based in Hong Kong.

HEADLINE: Wave of Airline Strikes, Led by British Airways, Sweeps Europe

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- Travelers across Europe braced for chaos as a strike by British Airways cabin crew entered its third day on Monday and labor strife spread to other airlines. 
 The British Airways strike was scheduled to end at midnight Monday and resume Saturday for four more days. 
 Pilots at TAP Portugal have called a five-day strike to begin on Friday. Alitalia canceled flights Monday because of a four-hour strike by crew members. 
 Air France said Monday that it had narrowly averted a strike after unions that had planned a four-day walkout to begin Sunday agreed to return to the bargaining table.
 The showdowns with unions come as European airlines, hurt by falling revenue and an uncertain economic outlook, have taken a hard line on costs. Formerly state-run airlines are having to compete with nimbler low-cost rivals like Ryanair and easyJet in their regional businesses, while battling Middle Eastern and Asian carriers for intercontinental traffic.
 ''The biggest issue for the European flag carriers is labor costs,'' said Stephen Furlong, an airline analyst at Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin. ''Only fuel eats up more of their revenue. So to close the gap, they have to restructure or consolidate.'' The carriers, he said, had reached a point ''where labor is pushing back.''
 Advocates say passengers are caught in the middle. ''We're pawns in other people's disputes,'' said Simon Evans, chief executive of the Air Transport Users Council in Britain. ''We're powerless and they know it.''
 British Airways said Monday that over the first two days of the strike, the airline operated 78 percent of its intercontinental flights and 50 percent of its short-distance flights.
 It estimated the cost of the strike at $:7 million ($10.6 million) a day, but added that it expected its annual earnings for the full year through March 31 to be ''broadly unchanged.'' A British Airways spokesman in London declined to say how many flights had been canceled on Monday. ''We're looking to move over 60 percent of our passengers today,'' said the spokesman, who did not want to be identified because of company policy. ''The contingency plans are going well.'' 
 The Unite union, which is representing the British Airways crews, said Monday morning that of 77 flights scheduled, 37 had been empty and that most service to the United States was ''out.'' It said only three flights were working normally, to Hong Kong, Bangkok and Vancouver. 
 Unions representing Air France cabin crews called off a strike planned to begin Sunday and will return to negotiations, a company spokeswoman said.
 Union representatives could not be reached for comment Monday night. The Sud Aerien union last week called for crews on short- and medium-distance flights to strike in protest to what it said were management's efforts to undermine their contracts. The union called the job action ''essentially a strike for jobs and working conditions.''
 The Italian carrier Alitalia canceled or delayed flights across the country because of a four-hour strike by pilots, flight attendants and baggage handlers, news agencies reported. 
 TAP Portugal pilots are planning to walk off the job on Friday through March 31, according to the airline. 
 Lufthansa pilots went on strike last month, stranding thousands of passengers, in protest to the move of cockpit jobs to foreign subsidiaries where pilots earn less. The pilots agreed to halt the action after a judge intervened.
 The Cockpit Association union, which represents about 4,500 pilots at Lufthansa and its subsidiaries, said Monday that negotiations with management had not advanced, and that pilots at Lufthansa, Lufthansa Cargo and Germanwings were planning to strike for four days beginning April 13.
 Salaries for British Airways cabin crews are nearly double the salaries of rivals, according to the Civil Aviation Authority, the aviation regulator in Britain. The airline argues that the savings are necessary if it is to remain competitive.
 Tony Woodley, Unite's joint general secretary, said Monday that the union was ready for talks at any time before the next strike, slated for Saturday, but that the airline had not responded.
 ''B.A. needs to wake up and understand that a dispute like this can only be resolved through negotiations and agreement,'' Mr. Woodley said, adding that the company's willingness to lose money ''can only lead to suspicions that there is another, union-busting, agenda at work here.''

HEADLINE: Ruling Upholds International Ban on Ivory Sales, Rejecting Moves by Tanzania and Zambia

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

 BODY:
PARIS -- In a victory claimed by conservationists seeking to shield Africa's elephants from poachers, the main international agency protecting endangered species resolved on Monday to uphold a 21-year-old ban on the international trade in ivory, rejecting efforts by Tanzania and Zambia to dilute the prohibition.
 With elephant poaching on the rise -- despite increased populations of the animal in some countries -- the 175-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, known by its acronym, Cites, turned down a Tanzanian proposal to permit a one-time sale of some 90 tons of its ivory stocks. 
 Hours later, Zambia withdrew a similar request for a one-time sale of 21 tons of tusks, but it sought a modest reduction in the international protection of its elephant population to permit eventual future trade. Despite support from the United States, that proposal, too, was defeated.
 The votes represented a turnabout in the fortunes of conservationists at the current meeting of Cites in Doha, Qatar, where delegates last week defeated American-supported plans to ban international trade in bluefin tuna and to protect polar bears.
 The moves by Zambia and Tanzania touched the heart of a long-running and often passionate debate about the conservation of elephant herds. Both countries insisted that the main threat to the animals -- 27,000 in Zambia and 137,000 in Tanzania, by official counts -- was not the international trade in ivory, often for customers in Asia, but the conflict between elephants and the often impoverished humans in the bushlands and savannas of eastern and central Africa.
 The international trade prohibition was imposed in 1989 and has been relaxed only sparingly since then to permit three one-time sales. Each sale has touched off new debates about whether exemptions to the ban mainly benefit organized crime syndicates by reopening trade connections, allowing gangsters to peddle poached ivory in addition to the official sales of documented stocks held by governments. After the last one-time sale was completed in 2008, Cites agreed to a nine-year moratorium on such trades.
 In its proposal for an easing of the ban, Tanzania said its plan aimed at ''promoting sustainable conservation of the elephant population'' by reinvestment of profits from a one-time sale in wildlife conservation and in support of ''development activities of communities living within the elephant ecosystems.''
 ''Rural people do not tolerate the presence of elephants unless the costs of living with elephants can be offset by economic benefits derived from elephants,'' the proposal said. Tanzania had been hoping to raise up to $20 million from the sale.
 The Zambian proposal echoed the Tanzanian argument, saying, ''The primary risk to the long-term survival of the elephant in Zambia is not international trade but increasing conflicts with legitimate human interests such as agriculture as shown by the rising number of human-elephant conflicts. 
 ''The Zambian government by law owes it to the rural communities to conserve and to benefit from wildlife resources in a serious partnership,'' the proposal said. ''Situations where human beings rise against the elephant due to rising incidences of crop damage, injury and worse still, loss of human life, cannot be tolerated in an era where various sustainable use options for intervention exist'' in other southern African countries.
 But conservationists in the United States, Europe and other parts of Africa had argued that Tanzania and Zambia had not adequately combated poaching of elephants and the illegal ivory market, where the price of ivory has risen more than sevenfold since 2004 to as much as $1,500 now, according to The Associated Press.
 ''To permit any step toward further trade in ivory makes no sense whatsoever,'' said Jason Bell-Leask of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, in a statement before the Doha meeting. ''It flies in the face of every basic conservation principle.''
 In a telephone interview from Doha after the votes on Monday, Mr. Bell-Leask said the outcome of the voting on Monday was ''a victory for elephants'' and a ''huge relief'' for conservationists. 
 ''Both Tanzania and Zambia have been implicated in some of the largest seizures'' of poached ivory in recent years, he said.

HEADLINE: Ford's Chief Earned $17.9 Million in 2009

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DEARBORN, Mich. -- The Ford Motor Company said on Monday that its chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, was paid $17.9 million in 2009, a 5 percent increase, as the automaker posted its first profit in four years. 
 Mr. Mulally's compensation rose largely because of an increase in stock awards, even though he took a 30 percent cut in salary, to $1.4 million, for 2009 and 2010. He received stock awards worth $11 million, more than double what he received in 2008. His total compensation last year was 19 percent less than in 2007, his first full year at Ford.
 Ford's executive chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., earned stock and option awards worth $16.8 million last year, according to the company's preliminary proxy statement. But he will not receive that compensation until ''the board determines the automotive sector has achieved full-year profitability,'' a spokesman, Mark Truby, said.
 Mr. Ford did not earn any salary last year, as has been the case since 2005, but he began earning deferred compensation in 2008. Ford was not required to release Mr. Ford's compensation in 2008.
 Ford, as the only Detroit automaker to not file for bankruptcy protection and take a government bailout, is not subject to the restrictions that limit executive pay at General Motors and Chrysler.
 Edward E. Whitacre Jr., G.M.'s chief executive and chairman, is to receive compensation worth $9 million a year, mostly in stock to be awarded starting in 2012, the company said in a filing last month. The government, which owns 60 percent of G.M., approved Mr. Whitacre's pay package, which includes a base salary of $1.7 million.
 Chrysler pays its chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, $600,000 in stock for his service as a director, but his salary for running the company is paid by Chrysler's partner, Fiat, of which he also is chief executive.
 Ford's automotive business reported an operating loss of $1.4 billion in 2009, but the company earned an overall profit of $2.7 billion and increased market share in the United States for the first time since 1995. In 2008, Ford lost more than $1.4 billion, the most in its history.
 As a result, Ford is giving profit-sharing checks of $450 each to 43,000 hourly workers this month.
 Salaried employees did not receive merit-pay increases or matching contributions to their 401(k) plans in 2009, but those benefits have been reinstated for 2010. The company has not resumed paying bonuses.
 The value of Ford stock has nearly quintupled in the last year. It was worth $13.29 a share at the end of last week, compared with $2.90 a year ago.
 ''Given the challenging economic environment, we believe this performance to be outstanding, and we are gratified that stakeholders have shown renewed confidence in our future,'' Ford said in the proxy statement.
 Compensation declined for Ford's chief financial officer, Lewis W. K. Booth, and its president for the Americas, Mark Fields. Mr. Booth earned $3.8 million, 30 percent less than in 2008, and Mr. Fields earned $4 million, down 14 percent. Both men earned more than $10 million in 2007.

HEADLINE: Health Vote Is Done, but Partisan Debate Rages On

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and ROBERT PEAR; Carl Hulse contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As jubilant Democrats prepared for President Obama to sign their landmark health care legislation in a big ceremony at the White House, Republicans opened a campaign on Monday to repeal the legislation and to use it as a weapon in this year's hotly contested midterm elections.
 ''We will not allow this to stand,'' Representative Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota, promised Monday afternoon as the House reconvened, a day after the bitterly partisan vote. 
 Democratic leaders hailed the passage of the bill as a towering achievement. 
 ''Last night, we made history,'' Speaker Nancy Pelosi said as she prepared to sign the legislation and send it to the White House. ''We honored the vows of our founders who in the Declaration of Independence talked about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We believe the legislation that we have gives all people in our country the liberty to have healthier lives.'' 
 Democrats said they would focus on explaining the measure to their constituents and on highlighting some immediate benefits, and they called on Republicans to ease off on their attacks now that the legislation had passed. 
 ''It is time to chill out, Republicans,'' said Representative Bob Filner, Democrat of California. ''Let this bill work. Let our constituents finally get health care.''
 But there were no signs of a cease-fire. Senate Democrats said they would take up a budget reconciliation containing the final revisions to the health care measure shortly after Mr. Obama signs the main bill on Tuesday. 
 Far from sounding a conciliatory note, Senate Republicans said they would employ every procedural maneuver available to derail the reconciliation bill, or at least knock out main provisions. At the top of their list of targets are changes to a proposed tax on high-cost employer-sponsored insurance policies. 
 The White House negotiated changes to the tax with leaders of organized labor, who worried that it would hit too many middle-class workers who have robust union-sponsored benefits plans. House Democrats also disliked the tax, and if Senate Republicans succeed in blocking the changes, it could create a major political headache for Mr. Obama. 
 The proposed changes to the tax were among the topics when Republicans and Democrats met on Monday afternoon with the Senate parliamentarian, who will rule on the procedural challenges Republicans are planning to raise in debate this week. 
 Senate Democratic leaders also went to the White House on Monday to discuss strategy for the floor fight over the reconciliation bill. 
 The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, quickly adopted a new rhetorical strategy on Monday, portraying the changes sought by Democrats as revisions that would make the health care law worse, not better. 
 ''Democrat leaders now want us to take the bill that passed the Senate in December and that the House voted on last night and make the tax hikes even higher, the Medicare cuts even deeper,'' Mr. McConnell said in a floor speech. ''They want us to endorse a raft of new sweetheart deals that were struck behind closed doors last week so this thing could limp over the finish line last night.'' 
 It was unclear that the argument would stick, given that many of the changes in the reconciliation measure are intended to adjust provisions the Republicans themselves had criticized, like the so-called Cornhusker kickback that would provide extra Medicaid money for Nebraska. 
 Around the country, reaction to the bill's passage was emotional, and in some cases violent. 
 Representative Gabrielle Giffords, Democrat of Arizona, said her Tucson office was vandalized after her vote in support of the measure. A glass door was shattered, she said. 
 After a weekend when protesters outside the Capitol subjected some Democratic lawmakers to racial slurs and other epithets, Representative Randy Neugebauer, a conservative Republican from Texas, revealed on Monday that he was the lawmaker who shouted ''baby killer'' on the House floor Sunday night as Representative Bart Stupak, Democrat of Michigan, discussed abortion-related provisions in the health care bill.
 In a statement, Mr. Neugebauer, a three-term member of the House from Lubbock, said he got caught up in the passions of the moment and was not referring to Mr. Stupak personally but to the bill itself.
 ''In the heat and emotion of the debate, I exclaimed the phrase 'it's a baby killer' in reference to the agreement reached by the Democratic leadership,'' Mr. Neugebauer said. ''I deeply regret that my actions were mistakenly interpreted as a direct reference to Congressman Stupak himself.''
 Across the nation, Republican candidates seized on the passage of the health care measure to bolster their efforts to capture Democratic seats in Congress. 
 ''Last night, Washington thumbed its nose at the American people, taking over one-sixth of our nation's economy and adding to the mountain of debt already looming over our children's future,'' said former Representative Rob Simmons of Connecticut, who hopes to succeed Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Democrat who is retiring. 
 ''This is not the time to give up and go home,'' Mr. Simmons said. ''Now is the time to fight.'' 
 Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, said he would introduce a bill to repeal the health care legislation even though the Republican minority does not have anywhere near the votes needed to pass it. 
 ''There's no fixing the government health care takeover Democrats forced through on Sunday,'' Mr. DeMint said. ''Unless this trillion-dollar assault on our freedoms is repealed, it will force Americans to purchase Washington-approved health plans or face stiff penalties.'' 
 The American Legislative Exchange Council, an association of conservative state legislators, said it was accelerating its efforts to block the federal requirement for people to carry health insurance that would take effect in 2014.
 State legislators in 39 states have filed or plan to file bills to block the requirement, the council said. Virginia lawmakers have already approved such legislation. 
 The attorney general of Florida, Bill McCollum, said Monday that he and the attorneys general of eight other states would file suit to block enforcement of the federal law. The federal measure ''violates the U.S. Constitution and infringes on each state's sovereignty,'' said Mr. McCollum, a Republican.
 Gov. C. L. Otter of Idaho, a Republican, signed a bill last week that directs the state attorney general to file suit against the federal government if state residents are forced to buy health insurance.

To the Editor:
 Re ''Congress Sends White House Landmark Health Overhaul'' (front page, March 22):
 With great anticipation and history in mind, I watched the live House proceedings of the 219-to-212 vote in overhauling our nation's health care system. Democrats should be praised and deeply thanked for their unwavering century-long commitment to providing health coverage to most Americans and for their political maneuvering against an obstructionist Republican Party that wants to maintain the status quo. 
 Today is indeed a historic day, as the United States finally joins the rest of the industrialized world that offers citizens guaranteed health care coverage. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi was correct when she proudly proclaimed that health insurance ''is a right and not a privilege!'' 
 As for the critics, let's remind them that in the last election both President Obama and Congressional Democrats made this a major campaign issue and the American people supported them and gave them the majority to carry it out. 
 Thus, by passing this historic legislation, President Obama and his fellow Democrats have delivered to the people yet another demonstration of democracy in action! Michael Hadjiargyrou

 To the Editor: 
 Those who voted against this historic legislation should be forewarned. They may have scored easy, even cynical, political points by opposing passage of a comprehensive and expensive health care bill. But 10 years from now, health care will be considered another bipartisan sacred cow, universally popular. 
 Forty years from now, the opponents of this bill will be remembered in the same vein as the opponents of the Social Security Act and the Civil Rights Act. I would not want to be in their historical shoes. James Monk

 To the Editor:
 As a medical student from 1937 to 1941, I campaigned vigorously for what became the Murray-Wagner-Dingell bill, introduced in Congress in 1943 during Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency. The bill called for the establishment of a national health program.
 In spite of strong public support, the bill failed to pass. I was disappointed again when other presidents, including Truman, Nixon and Clinton, attempted to have a national health program passed but met with failure.
 I have had the good fortune to live beyond my 93rd birthday so that I can witness, finally, the passage of a national health program. I congratulate President Obama and all his colleagues for succeeding in bringing about this historic achievement.

 To the Editor:
 On the evening of March 21, 2010, with the passage of the health care bill, we witnessed the beginning of the end of private-practice medicine in the United States of America. The costs associated with this bill will, over time, consume the economy and force the government to take total control of all health care spending. Government will decide who receives treatment, when they receive treatment and who provides treatment. 
 The greatest attributes of American health care -- immediate access, high quality and experienced caring physicians -- will quickly disappear like the setting sun, replaced by a highly regulated government-sponsored program. When has the government ever delivered a product that was efficient, caring and timely? Edward J. Donahue

 Congratulations on a historic moment in your society. This reform was long overdue: as a Canadian I was dumbfounded by a country as wealthy and prosperous and innovative as the United States that discarded so many. For us, universal health care is as inalienable a right as your right to bear arms.
 This is not about big-government intrusion as the Republicans would have it; it is about the well-being of human beings. Along with the passing of this bill, there should be a serious dialogue on nutrition, responsible eating and exercise. David Duranovich

 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman calls the new health care reform legislation a ''victory for America's soul'' (''Fear Strikes Out,'' column, March 22).
 Women's reproductive freedom was sacrificed to expedite passage of this bill, rendering it a hollow, soulless victory. On the eve of passage, President Obama cajoled Representative Bart Stupak and several other anti-abortion legislators into voting for the bill by assuring them that it would severely limit women's access to abortion. 
 With Roe v. Wade in jeopardy, the alacrity with which President Obama seems willing to bargain away women's reproductive freedom is cause for grave concern. Linda Mischler

 To the Editor: 
 As a person without health insurance, I dispute your assertion that those without insurance will gain the most from passage of the health care bill (''Taking Stock of the Impact on the Wallet,'' front page, March 22). 
 Without a doubt that prize goes to the private health insurance companies, whose already obscene profits will be swelled by the addition of millions of new customers who will be forced, under penalty of fine, to buy their deeply flawed and grossly overpriced policies.
 As one of the uninsured, I gain nothing from this bill. On the contrary, I will lose a portion of my income and gain nothing of real value in return.

 Re ''For Historic Stakes, a Big Obama Gamble on a Partisan Victory'' (news analysis, front page, March 22):
 You state that President Obama lost ''the promise of a 'postpartisan' Washington in which rationality and calm discourse replaced partisan bickering.'' 
 We have had nothing but partisan bickering since before the founding of our country. That is what our democratic process is all about.
 President Obama's vision of rationality was surely just an ideal. I don't think he truly envisioned that all the Sturm und Drang of the political process would suddenly vanish. After all, politics is all about conflict. It is not a warm and fuzzy business. Benjamin H. Bloom

 I share your ''hope and belief'' that the health care reform legislation ''will in the end accomplish its great objectives'' (''Health Care Reform, at Last,'' editorial, March 22).
 I cry tears of joy for those who will be treated and cured as a result of this legislation. But I quiver and quake for those who are left in limbo between now and the proposed enactment date of 2014 for the major expansion of coverage. What of them?
 I think of the last soldier to die in a war after the truce has been declared, or the passenger on a sinking ship who has missed the last lifeboat. We cannot ignore them. And we must realize that but for a turn of fate they could be us.

 To the Editor:
 It is truly a hopeful day. Although this reform is far from all I wished for, it is a significant beginning. To no longer fear that you can be dropped from your health coverage, and to have some hope that your children will actually have health care, is so uplifting.

HEADLINE: Proposals for Direct Taxes on Banks to Cover the Bailouts Gain Ground in Europe

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
PARIS -- President Obama's proposal for a direct tax on banks to cover the cost of the financial bailout is gaining support in Europe. Germany is set to move ahead with its own levy, and Britain is expected to endorse a similar measure ahead of the Group of 20 meeting next month.
 The developments leave France as one of the few major Western economies yet to endorse the idea of such a tax. 
 But while Mr. Obama and the German government press ahead, analysts and officials cautioned that a globally coordinated approach would be preferable to deter banks from shifting operations to countries without the tax, potentially offsetting its effectiveness.
 A spokeswoman for the German Finance Ministry said Monday that the government was still hoping for a ''common framework'' to handle financial rescues at the European and global level.
 But at weekend meetings, Chancellor Angela Merkel's governing coalition agreed to introduce a tax on lenders as ''a kind of insurance,'' to help finance future bank bailouts, according to the spokeswoman, who declined to be quoted by name because of government policy.
 More money would be levied on banks with high-risk businesses, she said, to ensure that the policy worked to counter speculative activity by banks.
 During the financial crisis, the German government rescued the lenders IKB and Hypo Real Estate with billions of euros in capital and guarantees. The government also took a 25 percent stake in Commerzbank, bolstering its capital. Britain nationalized the lender Royal Bank of Scotland and supported other banks including Lloyds.
 France helped to rescue Dexia, which lends mainly to municipalities, with a capital injection and engineered a merger between two savings banks, Banque Populaire and the Caisse d'Epargne.
 The American proposal would aim to recover the billions in government funds spent bailing out giant lenders like Citigroup and Bank of America. It would remain in place for at least 10 years and would be levied on all financial institutions with more than $50 billion in assets, at 0.15 percent of covered liabilities.
 Further details were left to Congress, where a fierce fight is expected.
 The German cabinet is working on details of its plan and aims to fix the amount of the tax and other details at a meeting on March 31, the spokeswoman said. The country is willing to proceed with its own plans even if a global agreement is not forthcoming, she said.
 In Britain, Alistair Darling, the chancellor of the Exchequer, is expected to endorse a similar tax in his budget proposals being announced on Wednesday, according to a person with direct knowledge of the plan.
 A spokesman for the British Treasury said that Prime Minister Gordon Brown was an early proponent of such a tax. But he added, ''Any proposal needs to be implemented by all responsible financial centers to be effective.''
 David Cameron, the leader of the opposition Conservatives, who hold a slight edge in polls just months before a general election, came out with an even stronger endorsement of the plan this weekend.
 ''We had the biggest bank bailout in the world; we can't just carry on as if nothing happened,'' Mr. Cameron said in a speech. ''A Conservative government will introduce a new bank levy to pay back taxpayers for the support they gave and to protect them in the future.''
 ''It won't be popular in every part of the City,'' he said, referring to the London financial district. ''But I believe it's fair and it's necessary.''
 In a statement Monday, the British Bankers' Association said ''any further reforms need to be timely, considered and internationally coordinated so they do not restrict credit to individuals and businesses as recovery picks up speed.''
 A French official, who was not permitted to speak publicly, said the government had no imminent plans for legislation on the matter and would first consult with international partners. The French economy minister plans to attend the German cabinet meeting at which the bank levy will be discussed on March 31.
 Analysts say that American lawmakers could yet block Mr. Obama's plans to tax banks.
 ''There are two dimensions -- paying for the past and paying for the future,'' said Edwin M. Truman, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ''It's not yet clear that either will pass in the U.S. The whole financial reform package is somewhat up in the air.''

HEADLINE: Stimulus Plan For Rail Line Shows System Of Weak Links

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
TAMPA -- The drive from Orlando to Tampa takes only 90 minutes or so. Despite the short distance, the Obama administration awarded Florida $1.25 billion in stimulus money to link the cities with a fast train to help kick off its efforts to bring high-speed rail service to the United States. 
 The Florida train would indeed be high speed -- as fast as 168 miles per hour. But because the trains would make five stops along the 84-mile route, the new service would shave only about half an hour off the trip. 
 Time-pressed passengers may also find themselves frustrated at the end of their trip. Neither city is known for great public transportation, so travelers may discover that they have taken a fast train to a slow bus. 
 Proponents of high-speed rail worry that the new line, which is scheduled to be up and running in 2015, might hurt rather than help their cause, if it comes to be seen as little more than an expensive way to whisk tourists from Orlando International Airport to Walt Disney World, which is slated to get its own stop. 
 Even Representative John L. Mica, a Republican whose district in northeast Florida stops about 20 miles short of the proposed line, has questioned whether his state was the best choice to receive some of the $8 billion that was set aside in the stimulus act for high-speed rail. 
 Mr. Mica wondered if the notoriously congested Northeast corridor from Boston to New York to Washington, which was largely shut out of the pool of money, might have been a better choice.
 ''That would have the most dramatic impact, as far as a positive result for the country,'' said Mr. Mica, who added that he was grateful for the investment in his home state. 
 State officials say they have been planning the route for decades and own most of the right of way needed for the tracks -- a big selling point to the Obama administration, which saw it as the fastest and cheapest way to get a line up and running. 
 And Florida hopes that it would be only the first leg of a high-speed line that would eventually stretch south to Miami, linking several of the state's tourism and business centers. 
 But it is unclear where the state will get the money to extend the train line. As it is, officials are uncertain where they would get the rest of the $2.6 billion that they believe is needed to build the Orlando to Tampa route.
 Supporters of high-speed rail often argue that it can be a way to lure passengers off airplanes. Orlando and Tampa are so close, however, that no airlines fly between them. 
 The drive took less than 82 minutes on a couple of recent test runs by a reporter; the train is expected to cover the same ground in 54 to 58 minutes.
 Even the Florida project's planners have acknowledged it would have a limited impact on traffic. An environmental impact statement issued in 2005 estimated that the train would draw 11 percent of the 4.5 million people who drive between Tampa and Orlando each year. 
 It also said the drivers who opted instead to ride the train ''would not be sufficient to significantly improve'' traffic flow on Interstate 4.
 Tourists who try to use public transportation, rather than renting a car, may find themselves seeing sights they would rather avoid and missing some they would like to see. As the Frommer's travel guide to Tampa advises, ''Like most other Florida destinations, it's virtually impossible to see Tampa's major sights and enjoy its best restaurants without a car.''
 A couple of tourists from Chilliwack, British Columbia -- Allana Strickland and her teenage daughter, Sarah McKenzie -- learned this firsthand recently. When they took the public bus from Tampa to the Salvador Dali Museum in nearby St. Petersburg, a major draw in the region, they found themselves on a journey that lasted more than two and half hours to go less than 20 miles. 
 ''It's not as easy to get around here as it could be, for sure,'' Ms. Strickland said.
 The Florida route was one of only two true high-speed rail projects -- with trains capable of going more than 150 miles per hour, as is common in Europe and China -- to win some of the $8 billion in high-speed rail money in the Stimulus Act that was awarded in January. (The Acela trains on the Northeast Corridor are capable of going 150 m.p.h., but average only around half that because they operate on crowded, curvy tracks.) 
 The other high-speed route is in California, which was awarded $2.25 billion, a small fraction of what it will need to build a rail line for trains that could travel from Los Angeles to San Francisco at speeds of up to 220 m.p.h. 
 The rest of the stimulus money was divided among 31 states, mostly to speed up existing train service by improving track and signal systems. Supporters see the Florida line as a hedge against future population growth and congestion. 
 ''We believe it's a mode for the future, and we have to start today,'' said Nazih Haddad, the chief operating officer for the Florida Rail Enterprise, a division of the state's Department of Transportation. He said ridership studies projected that the route would attract enough passengers to cover its operating costs. 
 But when America 2050, a planning group, ranked potential routes last year in a report called ''Where High Speed Rail Works Best,'' the Tampa to Orlando route did not even make the cut, because the group found that cities should be at least 100 miles apart to capture riders.
 The planned route from Tampa through Orlando to Miami did make the list, though: it was ranked 100th among potential routes in the United States. 
 If the project is built but is not successful, it could make it harder for other high-speed rail projects to get money in the future. Florida knows about that possibility firsthand: its voters once passed a constitutional amendment requiring the state to build a high-speed rail system, only to repeal it later over cost concerns. 
 As it stands, the proposed route does not have the easiest connections. It would go to downtown Tampa, but not to Tampa's airport. It would go to Orlando's airport, but not to downtown Orlando. 
 Orlando is planning to build a commuter rail system, but the current plans do not connect it to the proposed high-speed rail line. Tampa is debating a new light rail system, but construction could be years off.
 In the short term, experts predict that up to a third of the train's ridership would be for the 19-mile trip between the Orlando airport and Walt Disney World, which has agreed to donate land for a stop. 
 A recent visit to the Tomorrowland Transit Authority, a retro-futuristic people mover in the Magic Kingdom, shows the enduring pull of car culture in Florida: a sign at the station announces that it is presented by Alamo, the car rental company.

A Fast Train to a Slow Bus?: If a high-speed rail line is built linking Orlando and Tampa, passengers may find they still need a car when they reach the last stop. Neither city has an extensive public transit system. Indeed, Frommer's travel guide warns that ''it's virtually impossible to see Tampa's major sights and enjoy its best restaurants without a car.'' So how easily can a tourist get from downtown Tampa to a sandy Gulf Coast beach by public transportation?

HEADLINE: N.Y.U. 20-Year Plan Seeks Big Expansion in Village and Beyond

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
New York University is proposing the largest expansion in its history, with a new tower on Bleecker Street and three million square feet of new classrooms, dormitories and offices in the Greenwich Village area. The plans also call for creating a new engineering school in Brooklyn and a satellite campus on Governors Island, complete with dorms and faculty housing.
 The projects, which would expand N.Y.U.'s physical plant by 40 percent over the next 20 years, are aimed at accommodating a growing student body and competing for money and prestige with other universities. They will require approvals from city agencies and have already met with a skeptical response from some neighbors and preservationists.
 The city's top economic development official, Deputy Mayor Robert C. Lieber, said that approval of the university's plans was not guaranteed. ''They've been deliberate and thoughtful,'' Mr. Lieber said. ''That doesn't mean it's all going to go exactly as they intended. There's lots of opportunity for discussion here.'' 
 The university has clashed repeatedly with its neighbors over much less ambitious expansion efforts of recent decades. N.Y.U. officials acknowledged on Monday that these earlier projects had been marked by piecemeal planning and undistinguished design and said they have made a concerted effort this time to conduct an open public process that is mindful of the neighborhood context, architectural quality and residents' interests.
 ''It's clear that N.Y.U. had a history of moving forward without listening,'' John E. Sexton, the university's president, said in a telephone interview from Qatar, near N.Y.U.'s new campus in Abu Dhabi. ''What this process has allowed us to do is take advantage of the wisdom that's out there. There are some people just trying to make reputations attacking N.Y.U. But there's a lot of wisdom in the community.'' 
 Between 1991 and 2001, the number of students living in N.Y.U. housing tripled to 12,000, from 4,000, as the university raised its national profile. (In the early '90s, 50 percent of its students came from the metropolitan area; now that figure has declined to 10 to 15 percent.) By 2031, N.Y.U. expects its total student body to grow to 46,500 students, up from the current 41,000.
 By 2031, the university aims to have 240 academic square feet per student; it now has 160, according to its own study, compared to Columbia University's 326, Harvard's 673 and Yale's 866.
 The plan calls for adding 6 million square feet of space -- at a projected cost of about $1,000 a square foot -- to N.Y.U.'s existing 15 million, development that quietly started in 2006 and already amounts to 787,000 square feet.
 ''For New York to be a great city, we need N.Y.U. to be a great university,'' Mr. Sexton said. ''We need the space to run our academic programs: to have the faculty that teach in these programs, to have the students who attend these programs, to create not only carriers of knowledge but ambassadors of New York for the future.''
 The university's effort to enlist local support for the plan, to be formally introduced at a series of events in April, has yet to win over some key critics, who worry that N.Y.U.'s expansion will overwhelm its historic area. In its Washington Square neighborhood, the university will be creating the equivalent in square footage of a little more than the total floor area of the Empire State Building.
 ''We're deeply concerned,'' said Andrew Berman, executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation. ''N.Y.U. seems to have worked on their P.R. machine quite a bit, but the reality of what they're doing -- which is taking over more and more of the neighborhood -- doesn't seem like it's changed very much. They've given everybody the opportunity to say what they think and then they've largely ignored that feedback.''
 In Brooklyn, N.Y.U. wants to build one million square feet of new space for a new engineering school at the downtown Metrotech complex, site of Polytechnic University. N.Y.U. became affiliated with Polytechnic in 2008 and will merge with the college in the next three to five years to start its own engineering school.
 On Governors Island, the university envisions an institute that would unite several academic disciplines around a subject like the urban future. ''What does it mean in the 21st century to build a great city?'' Mr. Sexton said. ''Let's be the lab and thinking space for it, the center in the world for thinking about cities.''
 N.Y.U.'s nursing school is to move uptown to the university's ''health corridor'' along First Avenue in the East 20s and 30s to share a new space with the dental college (they merged about three years ago).
 In most cases, N.Y.U.'s plans do not yet include specific information on what will be built where and when. The 2031 plan is a framework for growth over the next 20 years, not a building-by-building blueprint.
 ''It's different from a master plan that compels you to put certain things in certain places,'' said Lynne P. Brown, a senior vice president at the university. 
 Several city officials said they would wait for more details before deciding whether to support the projects. ''It is important for our higher education learning centers -- Columbia, Fordham, N.Y.U. -- to expand if we're going to grow the New York economy, but they have got to incorporate community concerns and not be seen as running over these neighborhoods,'' said Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president. ''The rubber now hits the road when this campus plan is announced. The details will matter. It's showtime now. Give me the whole story.''
 Mr. Stringer is leading a task force on N.Y.U.'s development that includes Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn and Representative Jerrold Nadler. In the early stages of the plan's formation, the university was also guided by four design firms: SMWM, Toshiko Mori, Grimshaw Architects and Olin Partnership. 
 Ms. Mori and Grimshaw have stayed on to advise the university on developing its core neighborhood, N.Y.U. said, and other architects have become involved. 
 Cooper, Robertson & Partners is working on a design for the Brooklyn site and, along with the landscape architect Michael Van Valkenburgh, on the Governor's Island plan. Polshek Partnership Architects is working on the health corridor. 
 The university has held several ''open house'' meetings to give the public an opportunity to learn more about the plans and respond. Preservationists like Mr. Berman said they were troubled by N.Y.U.'s handling of the historic Provincetown Playhouse theater on MacDougal Street, which the university is turning into a research center for its law school. While the building's facade was preserved, part of a wall was demolished; N.Y.U. said it was structurally unsound.
 In addition, some are concerned about the university's plans to build a fourth tower at the Silver Towers complex on Bleecker Street, which was designed by I. M. Pei, opened in 1966 and landmarked in 2008. But N.Y.U. said the plans for that superblock would leave all four corners with open space. ''Everything we're trying to do on the superblock is meant to have it be a more friendly place for the community,'' Mr. Sexton said. 
 The university's plan for Governors Island must compete with other proposals that will be submitted to the Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation, a city-state partnership. 
 The 2031 plan also includes creating new theaters, costume shops and rehearsal studios for the Tisch School of the Arts in a building at Lafayette and East Fourth Street. 
 Under the plan, half the new space will be in remote sites and half within walking distance of its Washington Square core. ''We need to recognize our limitations on the Greenwich Village campus to meet our major academic plans,'' Ms. Brown said. ''You can't look in these hills anymore.''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 26, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about New York University's plans to expand referred incorrectly in some editions to the size of the expansion in Greenwich Village. The total square feet, about three million, is a little more than that in the Empire State Building, not more than two Empire State Buildings. The article also referred imprecisely to another N.Y.U. project, in which the building on Macdougal Street that housed the Provincetown Playhouse theater is being turned into a research center for the law school and will also have a theater. While the facade of the Provincetown Playhouse entrance was preserved, the rest of the building's facade was destroyed, not preserved.

HEADLINE: Legal and Political Fights Loom

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The battle over health care is poised to move swiftly from Congress back to the country as Democrats, Republicans and a battery of interest groups race to define the legislation and dig in for long-term political and legal fights.
 President Obama plans to open a new campaign this week to persuade skeptical Americans that the bill holds immediate benefits for them and addresses the nation's shaky fiscal condition. Republicans said they would seek to repeal the measure, challenge its constitutionality and coordinate efforts in statehouses to block its implementation.
 The politics of health care are fragile -- and far from certain -- in the eight-month midterm campaign that will determine which party will control Congress next year. But both sides steeled for a fight to extend well beyond November, involving state legislative battles, court challenges and, ultimately, the next presidential race.
 Even before the final vote, Republicans began relentlessly assailing lawmakers who supported the legislation, suggesting Democrats are spendthrift and proponents of big government. Democrats said they would seek to capitalize on the momentum from their success and strive to move beyond the political arguments in hopes of demystifying the complicated legislation. 
 Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of health and human services, offered an early argument on Monday morning, saying she thought the public image of the bill had been hurt by ''a lot of attempts to confuse and scare Americans.''
 Appearing on ''The Early Show'' on CBS, Ms. Sebelius said that she, the president and the majority party were convinced that once Americans learn how the legislation might improve their lives, ''they'll be very enthusiastic about what Congress did last night.''
 Among the points she cited were the bill's ban on the insurance company practice of excluding children with pre-existing medical conditions from coverage, provisions meant to lower prescription drug expenses for some elderly Americans, and more funds to help pay for preventive care.
 ''The president has said from the beginning this bill was about health care for all Americans -- for small-business owners, for families in desperate shape,'' she said.
 The next chapter in the health care fight will play out not only in the midterm elections, but also in the courts. Attorneys general in three states -- Virginia, Florida and South Carolina -- have indicated they will file legal challenges to the measure, arguing that its requirement that individuals buy insurance is a violation of the Constitution. In an interview Sunday, the Virginia attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, said he intended to base his challenge on two grounds: that the federal bill conflicts with a newly passed state law that says no Virginian may be compelled to buy insurance, and that Congress does not have authority to impose the mandate under its powers to regulate interstate commerce, as Democrats contend.
 ''This is such an incredible federal overreach,'' Mr. Cuccinelli said, but added that he did not plan to ask the courts for an order that would prevent the bill from going into effect because the individual mandate does not take effect until 2013. ''On our basis for a constitutional challenge, there's no rush,'' he said.
 The White House and Democrats were preparing to counter the legal arguments and coordinate a state-by-state response to any prospective challenges. For his part, aides said, Mr. Obama will lead the effort to define the bill, but also will shift his focus to the economy and jobs. A campaign, featuring Mr. Obama and examples of people who benefited from health care, will take place in the coming months.
 Democrats were also beginning to form a permanent campaign, of sorts, to follow the bill through its various stages. Party strategists studied the public's reaction to Medicare -- it was not immediately positive -- and were trying to create a friendlier climate for Mr. Obama when he faces voters again.
 A fresh multimillion-dollar wave of television and radio advertisements was to begin Tuesday morning, with groups on both sides of the contentious health care issue trying to influence the lasting impressions about the long legislative debate.
 The president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, Thomas J. Donohue, pledged to keep opposing the health care measure ''through all available avenues -- regulatory, legislative, legal and political.'' And organizations supporting the legislation, including AARP and labor unions, intend to defend the bill and run commercials to thank lawmakers for their votes and to extol what they see as benefits.
 The coalition, known as Unity 10, has worked closely with the White House for the last year. The goal over the short and long term, organizers said, was to protect politics from health care and protect health care from politics.
 When vulnerable Democrats who supported the legislation return to their home districts later this week, they will be met with billboards at airports and rallies. They have been advised not to say they voted for the bill out of courage, aides said, because that suggests it was politically risky, and possibly, a wrong decision. To explain the bill, lawmakers have been given a district-by-district analysis filled with facts and tidbits. Take Representative John Boccieri, the Ohio Democrat who drew praise from Mr. Obama in a weekend visit to the Capitol for supporting the bill ''in as tough a district as there is.''
 The analysis of Mr. Boccieri's district, typically carried by Republicans, says the bill would give tax credits to up to 167,000 families; improve Medicare for 111,000 beneficiaries; extend coverage to 38,500 residents; guarantee that 9,800 residents with pre-existing conditions can obtain coverage; allow 49,000 young adults to remain on their parents' plans; and so on.
 ''This is not a bad debate to have,'' said Andy Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union. ''If the debate is about big government, it will not be the right debate to have. It's about your life, your doctor, your hospital.''
 Senator John Cornyn of Texas, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said passage of the health care bill would be ''a bonanza'' for Republicans in states like Arkansas, Nevada and particularly Indiana, where Representative Brad Ellsworth, a Democrat, is running for the Senate and voted for the bill.
 ''It seems like it's a kamikaze mission on his part,'' Mr. Cornyn said in an interview on Sunday.
 Democrats argue that the bill has deep political benefits, particularly because some of its popular provisions -- allowing young adults to stay on their parents' health plans until they turn 26, for instance -- will kick in this year, while the unpopular provisions, like the mandate to buy insurance, will not take effect until much later.
 Mr. Cornyn said Republicans would spotlight other provisions, like changes in private Medicare Advantage plans, which will also kick in quickly and are worrisome to older people.
 Republicans also expect to take advantage of the fact that while the health bill may ultimately help contain rising premiums, it is unlikely to actually bring the cost of health insurance down, and certainly not in the short term.
 ''The question you're going to see Republicans asking in November is, 'Have your health insurance costs gone down?' '' Mr. Cornyn said. ''And I think the answer to that is going to be no.''

HEADLINE: An Absence Of Class

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Some of the images from the run-up to Sunday's landmark health care vote in the House of Representatives should be seared into the nation's consciousness. We are so far, in so many ways, from being a class act.
 A group of lowlifes at a Tea Party rally in Columbus, Ohio, last week taunted and humiliated a man who was sitting on the ground with a sign that said he had Parkinson's disease. The disgusting behavior was captured on a widely circulated videotape. One of the Tea Party protesters leaned over the man and sneered: ''If you're looking for a handout, you're in the wrong end of town.'' 
 Another threw money at the man, first one bill and then another, and said contemptuously, ''I'll pay for this guy. Here you go. Start a pot.''
 In Washington on Saturday, opponents of the health care legislation spit on a black congressman and shouted racial slurs at two others, including John Lewis, one of the great heroes of the civil rights movement. Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, was taunted because he is gay.
 At some point, we have to decide as a country that we just can't have this: We can't allow ourselves to remain silent as foaming-at-the-mouth protesters scream the vilest of epithets at members of Congress -- epithets that The Times will not allow me to repeat here. 
 It is 2010, which means it is way past time for decent Americans to rise up against this kind of garbage, to fight it aggressively wherever it appears. And it is time for every American of good will to hold the Republican Party accountable for its role in tolerating, shielding and encouraging foul, mean-spirited and bigoted behavior in its ranks and among its strongest supporters.
 For decades the G.O.P. has been the party of fear, ignorance and divisiveness. All you have to do is look around to see what it has done to the country. The greatest economic inequality since the Gilded Age was followed by a near-total collapse of the overall economy. As a country, we have a monumental mess on our hands and still the Republicans have nothing to offer in the way of a remedy except more tax cuts for the rich.
 This is the party of trickle down and weapons of mass destruction, the party of birthers and death-panel lunatics. This is the party that genuflects at the altar of right-wing talk radio, with its insane, nauseating, nonstop commitment to hatred and bigotry.
 Glenn Beck of Fox News has called President Obama a ''racist'' and asserted that he ''has exposed himself as a guy, over and over and over again, who has a deep-seated hatred for white people or the white culture.''
 Mike Huckabee, a former Republican presidential candidate, has said of Mr. Obama's economic policies: ''Lenin and Stalin would love this stuff.''
 The G.O.P. poisons the political atmosphere and then has the gall to complain about an absence of bipartisanship. 
 The toxic clouds that are the inevitable result of the fear and the bitter conflicts so relentlessly stoked by the Republican Party -- think blacks against whites, gays versus straights, and a whole range of folks against immigrants -- tend to obscure the tremendous damage that the party's policies have inflicted on the country. If people are arguing over immigrants or abortion or whether gays should be allowed to marry, they're not calling the G.O.P. to account for (to take just one example) the horribly destructive policy of cutting taxes while the nation was fighting two wars.
 If you're all fired up about Republican-inspired tales of Democrats planning to send grandma to some death chamber, you'll never get to the G.O.P.'s war against the right of ordinary workers to organize and negotiate in their own best interests -- a war that has diminished living standards for working people for decades.
 With a freer hand, the Republicans would have done more damage. George W. Bush tried to undermine Social Security. John McCain was willing to put Sarah Palin a heartbeat away from the Oval Office and thought Phil Gramm would have made a crackerjack Treasury secretary. (For those who may not remember, Mr. Gramm was a deregulation zealot who told us during the presidential campaign that we were suffering from a ''mental recession.'')
 A party that promotes ignorance (''Just say no to global warming'') and provides a safe house for bigotry cannot serve the best interests of our country. Back in the 1960s, John Lewis risked his life and endured savage beatings to secure fundamental rights for black Americans while right-wing Republicans like Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan were lining up with segregationist Democrats to oppose landmark civil rights legislation.
 Since then, the right-wingers have taken over the G.O.P. and Mr. Lewis, now a congressman, must still endure the garbage they have wrought.

HEADLINE: The Ongoing Toll From 9/11

 BODY:
A House subcommittee has finally begun moving vital legislation to provide long-term health care and compensation for thousands of emergency responders, volunteers and community residents left seriously sickened after the World Trade Center terrorist attack. The 25-to-8 vote cut across regional lines -- an encouraging recognition that the 9/11 attack was an assault on the nation and that its victims still need and deserve the nation's help. 
 The measure is separate from the $657 million settlement proposed by New York City and lawyers for about 10,000 rescue and cleanup workers claiming damages. That proposal was rejected by the court last week as too little and too confusing. It left the issue to be renegotiated, underlining the need for federal help for the much larger numbers adversely affected by Sept. 11. 
 As many as 60,000 people suffering from lung cancer and other diseases traced to the clouds of toxic elements that blanketed the neighborhoods around ground zero now receive medical care and monitoring under limited and year-to-year programs. No one is sure how many more will fall ill in years to come. The House bill would set aside $5.1 billion for the initial decade. It also would wisely provide future economic compensation as additional Sept. 11 victims find themselves unable to work because of their illnesses. 
 The health care legislation is needed more than ever in the city's painfully slow recovery from the attacks. Important votes remain, but Congress must persevere. More than eight years later, for many victims, the nightmare of Sept. 11 is just as real and just as painful today.

HEADLINE: Housing Crisis on Arizona Street Divides Neighbors

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
CAVE CREEK, Ariz. -- The uncertain line between hope and despair divides this exurb of Phoenix, where the trim stucco houses used to sell so briskly. 
 It winds around the swimming pools and the pebbled yards of East Montgomery Road like a slow-burning fuse. 
 On one side are people like the Setbackens, Gary and Cissie, who moved here from Washington State and, with prudence, have managed to pay their mortgage bill month after month. On the other side are those like Kelley Carter, who never dreamed that home prices would fall so hard, and got in over their heads.
 Two in five homeowners in this sprawling development 30 miles northeast of Phoenix are underwater on their mortgages. And that reality is wearing away household budgets and people's patience.
 Arizona is one of five states that, with money from Washington, hopes to help at least some of these people hold on to their homes. Under a new, federally financed pilot program for the hardest-hit housing markets, state officials will decide who will get a homeowner bailout, and who will not. 
 The idea is as controversial in Washington as it is here. Do the neighbors next door who lived beyond their means -- the ones who, say, bought that house they could not afford, or who binged on home equity loans to buy new cars and flat-panel TVs -- really deserve to be bailed out with taxpayer dollars? Do they deserve to have some of their debts forgiven? And is that fair to the cautious ones who paid their mortgages?
 For the people of Cave Creek, the answers will fall to state officials like Michael Trailor, the director of the Arizona housing department. 
 A former real estate developer, Mr. Trailor knows firsthand about the perils of the property market. 
 ''I feel for all of them,'' Mr. Trailor said of the struggling homeowners. ''But we do not have the funds to help all of them. If we can help 6,000 people, which ones should we help?''
 The federal government will pay for pilot programs in Arizona, California, Florida, Michigan and Nevada with $1.5 billion from the federal banking rescue. That figure is a small fraction of the funds that would be needed to help all of the people at risk. Arizona, for instance, received $125 million. If it allocates $30,000 of aid for each residence, 4,166 homeowners would benefit. But the Phoenix area is bracing for as many as 50,000 foreclosures this year alone. 
 Mr. Trailor said he was reluctant to help homeowners with ''self-inflicted wounds,'' like those who overspent or cashed out the equity in their homes during the bubble years. He wants the banks to match the public money being used for debt forgiveness, and he is focusing on people whose incomes have fallen but who still hold jobs. 
 He is considering an approach known as ''earned forgiveness,'' where the state and the banks promise to forgive mortgage debt later on, but only if the homeowners stay in their homes and keep making their payments.
 The question of who deserves help rouses neighbors here. Not long ago, home values seemed to reach relentlessly toward the bright blue sky. 
 Then the boom went bust. Home prices in the Phoenix area have collapsed by 50 percent since mid-2006, leaving many owners with mortgages that are higher than their property values. One in 10 homes in this development in Cave Creek have moved through foreclosure since 2008, according to Netvaluecentral, a real estate tracking company in Glendale, Ariz. Half of the homes here are owned by banks or are being sold for less than the value of their mortgages. 
 ''Underwater homes make it highly likely people will walk away, and if they do, these foreclosures are going to push everyone's prices down,'' said Brett Barry, a real estate agent here. ''People need to realize that we're in this together.''
 The new reality is evident on East Montgomery Road, where the bust is playing out in a variety of ways. 
 There are the Setbackens, at 4355, who arrived in 1993 and paid down their mortgage even as home prices skyrocketed. 
 Across the street are the Chatburns, Tim and Leslie. They also arrived in the 1990s, before prices exploded, but struggled recently to keep up with the bills after an injury kept Mr. Chatburn out of work. 
 Mr. Chatburn, an air-conditioning repairman, used to say that bailing out his neighbors would be unfair, but he changed his mind after watching news programs about the rescues of big financial companies like the American International Group. 
 ''I started thinking about all this money we paid as taxpayers to the banks,'' he said, ''and I thought, 'Why don't we take care of our own a little bit?' '' 
 Ms. Carter, at 4344, arrived in 2005, as the bubble was inflating. She took out tens of thousands of dollars in home equity for repairs and other items, and by this year, she was underwater on her mortgage by $86,000. A single mother, she moved out this month, days before her home was sold in a short sale, which meant her mortgage lender allowed her to sell for less than the value of her mortgage and the lender took the loss.
 And then there is the young couple with a toddler, at 4343. They moved out on the same day as Ms. Carter, before a scheduled foreclosure of their home that was $115,000 underwater. The couple, who asked not to be named, also bought near the peak and took out a home equity loan to pay off their student loans and other debts. Then, a year ago, they stopped paying their mortgage, after both of them lost their jobs for a time. They now have office jobs again.
 Mr. Setbacken, a salesman, said he had warned his neighbors not to get in over their heads but they did not listen. He and his wife might have stepped up to a bigger house if they, like so many of their neighbors, had gambled recklessly on the housing market, he said. 
 ''Everybody that I know that got themselves in trouble was because of one word: greed,'' said Mr. Setbacken, 63, a former Marine who remains in tip-top physical condition. ''I have no sympathy for any of them, on the financial end. When I hear about dropping the amount you actually owe, I could stick my finger down my throat.'' 
 Then the doorbell rang. It was a young girl bearing Girl Scout cookies. ''My adopted granddaughter,'' Mr. Setbacken announced. 
 The 8-year-old is Ms. Carter's daughter, Ava. Across the street, Ms. Carter was packing up the house. 
 Ms. Carter said she felt guilty about leaving. With her short sale, the price of the home went down to the benefit of the new homeowner. But it dragged down prices in the neighborhood, she said. 
 Ms. Carter, a mother of two and a real estate agent who poses as an angel with wings on her Web site, has been through hard times before. Years ago, she considered filing for bankruptcy but then changed her mind. She said she was accountable for her actions and was making what amounted to a business decision to leave her home.
 ''I had to take emotion out of it,'' said Ms. Carter, 36. ''If I had a business, and every single month I was losing money, would I keep on paying? No, I wouldn't.''
 Sitting at her dining room table, before a large tank of fish, she recalled how she had made this a perfect home. It is one of the few on East Montgomery Road with grass in the yard, an expensive proposition in the desert. A Mercedes sits in the driveway. 
 She said she did not feel she deserved to have her debts forgiven, but added that if her mortgage had been lowered, she would have tried harder to stay. The worst part, she said, is that her decision will hurt Mr. Setbacken, who has watched out for her over the years. ''For Gary, he's going to have to deal with the ramificationsof what I'm doing because I'm bringing his property value down,'' she said. ''I pray at church. I feel horrible for what I'm doing to my neighbors.''
 Later, after Mr. Setbacken talked to Ms. Carter -- she ''cried and cried and cried,'' he said -- he had a change of heart. In an e-mail message, he said that perhaps wealthy Americans could donate money to aid homeowners. If he had more money himself, he might help some neighbors pay their mortgage bills. 
 ''I have focused on the financial issues during these times and overlooked what was more important, the emotional stress that my neighbors are feeling,'' Mr. Setbacken wrote. He walked down East Montgomery Road and gave a bottle of wine to the young couple facing foreclosure. It was, he said, ''to help them pack.''

HEADLINE: Next Big Issue? Social Security Pops Up Again

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Now that landmark legislation overhauling the health insurance system is about to become law, addressing Social Security's solvency could well become the next big thing for President Obama and Congressional Democrats.
 Central to the health care changes are hundreds of billions of dollars in reductions in Medicare spending over time and expansions of Medicaid. As some administration officials acknowledge, that effectively takes those fast-growing entitlement programs off the table for deficit reduction just as Mr. Obama's bipartisan commission to reduce the mounting national debt gets to work.
 That leaves Social Security, the other big entitlement benefits program and one that Mr. Obama has suggested in the past that he is willing to tackle. While its looming problems are not of the scale of those afflicting Medicare, it now stands as the likeliest source of the sort of large savings needed to bring projected annual deficits to sustainable levels, many budget analysts agree. 
 And, they say, packaging future reductions in the retirement program that Democrats zealously defend with tax increases that Republicans typically oppose would have the makings of a grand compromise to shrink the debt. 
 ''You would think that there ought to be a way to get together and talk about a balanced package of some changes in benefits and some increases in revenues that would actually help Social Security,'' said James R. Horney, the director of federal fiscal policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research organization.
 Some liberals, however, already have begun mobilizing to oppose any changes to Social Security benefits, arguing that the program does not face an imminent crisis. A group called Social Security Works began forming in January, with financing from Atlantic Philanthropies, and is seeking alliances with other groups. 
 In Congress, the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, and other Democratic leaders, who last year quashed White House talk of forming a Social Security task force, are not likely to be eager after the 14-month battle over health care to confront so controversial an issue, certainly not before November's elections. 
 Yet Representative Steny H. Hoyer, the moderate Democrat who is the House majority leader, gave a speech this month in which he called for the two parties to compromise on a mix of tax increases and benefit reductions to avert fiscal chaos. Among his options were proposals to gradually raise the retirement age for future Social Security recipients and to reduce benefits for those with high incomes.
 Early signs of disagreement have also been evident in the White House between members of the economic team, who generally favor addressing Social Security's finances, and the political advisers, who resist it. 
 The president's debt-reduction commission is likely to force the issue, even though it is not required to report its recommendations to Congress until Dec. 1, weeks after this year's midterm Congressional elections.
 Erskine B. Bowles, a former White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton who is the commission co-chairman along with Alan K. Simpson, a former Republican senator from Wyoming, said: ''As Senator Simpson and I have said all along, everything is on the table. No one has mentioned to me taking anything off the table.''
 Mr. Simpson said Mr. Obama had in fact agreed that everything was on the table. Actuaries from the Social Security Administration will be among the experts the commission will call upon for help, he said.
 Because 14 of the 18 commission members are required to agree on any recommendation to Congress, few people think the panel's Democrats and Republicans will succeed in coalescing around a package of both short-term and long-range deficit reductions, as Mr. Obama directed. Yet some Democrats in the administration and in Congress say they privately expect that some proposals, including on Social Security, could well end up in Mr. Obama's budget early next year.
 ''Whether or not the budget commission reaches a conclusion, and I think the odds have to be against that, Obama is going to have to say something about the long-term budget, and ignoring Social Security altogether is not politically possible if you want to do that,'' said Henry J. Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution, who has defended the program against deep cuts or privatization but acknowledges that it is not sustainable without some combination of benefit cuts or tax increases.
 By 2016, Social Security will begin paying more in benefits than it collects in payroll taxes, according to the annual report of government trustees; reserves in the form of government i.o.u.'s will be exhausted by 2037, after which incoming taxes will cover three-quarters of benefits. 
 Before his inauguration, Mr. Obama said of Social Security, ''We have to signal seriousness in this by making sure some of the hard decisions are made under my watch, not someone else's.''
 Similarly, some Democrats argue that their party should act now, while it controls the White House and Congress, rather than take the chance that Republicans will regain power and try to carve private retirement accounts from Social Security, as former President George W. Bush did unsuccessfully. 
 Proponents of acting soon also argue that changes to benefits or taxes could be delayed so that current retirees and those nearing retirement are unaffected, and yet the promise of future reductions would immediately reassure global markets fretful that the United States' debt is already its highest since World War II.
 An agreement on Social Security ''would send a very important signal to the world,'' said Robert D. Reischauer, a former Congressional Budget Office director.
 That argument appeals to Mr. Obama, say Democrats who have spoken with him, and at the same time fits with advisers' image of the president as someone who does not play ''small ball'' but seeks transformational changes.
 The administration includes several economists who are authorities on Social Security, including Peter R. Orszag, the budget director; Jeffrey Liebman, an associate budget director; and Jason Furman, deputy director of the National Economic Council.
 ''Three of the best minds and prolific authors on Social Security among Democratic economists are all working for the White House,'' said an adviser to Congressional leaders, who asked to remain anonymous to talk candidly. ''So it's natural that there has been a lot of thought given internally to different ways we could deal with Social Security.''

HEADLINE: Two Rallies

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE DOWNES

 BODY:
A few hundred Tea Party-types clustered on the south end of the Capitol on Sunday, trying to kill health care reform, fouling the crisp spring air with shouts of violence and loathing. 
 Instead of pitchforks, they hoisted revolting signs. Some showed Barack Obama as a whiteface Joker, and some as Mao and Hitler. The Democrats were traitors and vermin; ''government'' was an evil beast. ''Kill the bill!,'' the people chanted, cheering House Republicans who came out to the balcony now and then to feel the hate.
 The eruption had an underground source, ugly and not always unspoken. A huge spray-painted banner acknowledged it. A ponytailed guy held it up, advising ''All Tea Party'' on what to do ''if u hear a racial slur'': step away, point, boo, take the person's picture and post it on the Web.
 The ones who had hurled racist and antigay epithets and spat at congressmen earlier in the day were lying low in the late afternoon. Now the crowd screamed, ''We want Stupak!'' Not to hail Representative Bart Stupak's staunch antiabortion convictions, but to take his head off for supporting the bill.
 Kill the bill. It throbbed in the ears, like an infection. I escaped it at the other end of the National Mall, at a rally that far eclipsed the Tea Party in size, hopefulness and decency.
 Many tens of thousands of immigrants and allies were pressing for immigration reform. It's an issue for which they have marched and waited, marched and waited -- their hopes dashed repeatedly. Sunday's rally was a demand for action.
 ''We've listened quietly. We've asked politely,'' said Representative Luis Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat. ''We've turned the other cheek so many times our heads are spinning.'' 
 If anyone has reason to fear government, it is immigrants like those at the rally, which Mr. Obama addressed via a jumbo TV screen. The government has violently invaded their lives, broken into homes, torn parents from children and sent them away to distant prisons. They have law-scoffing sheriffs and brutal employers and unjust laws aiming just at them.
 This is a fear the Kill-the-Billers will never know. No matter how darkly they loathe Medicare, unemployment insurance or Social Security, the safety net is theirs for life.
 It's usually best to avoid depicting life in black-white contrast. Not this time. Here were two rallies: one good, one loathsome. One hopeful, one paranoid. One trying to repair how Washington works for all America, and one looking to break it so the system can go on failing. 
 Kill the bill! Si, se puede! Same beat, different drums. I'll take the one that rings with patience and hope. Sounds more American.

HEADLINE: For Democrats, a Win Is a Win

BYLINE: By STANLEY B. GREENBERG. 
Stanley B. Greenberg is a Democratic pollster and the author of ''Dispatches From the War Room: In the Trenches With Five Extraordinary Leaders.''

 BODY:
PASSAGE of the new comprehensive health care reform bill by Congress may not be the ''game changer'' some joyful Democrats are declaring it to be, but it may at least herald a new game for the 2010 midterm elections. 
 When the president re-engaged on health care four weeks ago -- making clear his own priorities, inviting Republicans to a forum at Blair House and relentlessly pressing his case against the villainous insurance companies -- the public noticed. Yet the Republicans were frozen in post-Massachusetts time, still reveling in Scott Brown's surprise victory in the Senate race, which they felt was the result of an arrogant Democratic Party trying to jam an unpopular health care plan down the throats of the American people. 
 The Republicans handed Senator Brown the party's weekend radio address on March 13. ''Rarely have elected leaders been so intent on defying the public will,'' he warned. In a similar vein, the House minority leader, John Boehner, said last Saturday that, ''In a democracy, you can only ignore the will of the people for so long and get away with it.'' Indeed, voters will have their say in November.
 But the evidence shows that people were not sitting still as the politicians went into the final battle. Four of the seven latest major public polls showed an increase in the numbers favoring the health care reform as it was being debated over the last few weeks. Only one showed it losing ground. 
 While the health care battle over the previous nine months had intensified opposition to reform and fueled the ''tea party'' revolt, the last two months produced the opposite effect. A poll that I conducted with the Democratic strategist James Carville for Democracy Corps over the past week showed a 5-point increase in the number of self-identified ''intense'' reform supporters, to 24 percent. Likewise, the Kaiser Family Foundation's latest poll found that 28 percent of respondents were now ''strong'' supporters, up from 19 percent in January. 
 Across the public polls, while a literal majority of 50 percent opposed the reform package, the number in favor rose last week to an average of 42 percent. Voters have been watching the two parties and starting to recalibrate in favor of the Democrats, who -- if one averages polling by the Associated Press; CNN; and NBC/Wall Street Journal -- now hold a 9-point average advantage on the question of which party would do a better job with health care. 
 In addition, Republicans may have crossed a line with voters, particularly independents. In our Democracy Corps poll, we found that favorability ratings among independents for incumbent Republican members of Congress had dropped by 11 points in the last month, to just 42 percent. The Republican vote among independents in the Congressional ballot dropped by 12 points. 
 Why? Independent voters may have been stirred by Senator Jim Bunning's one-man filibuster that stopped work sites and unemployment checks. They may have noticed the Republicans' last stand for the insurance companies, just as one of the largest insurers, WellPoint, raised its rates 39 percent. 
 As we look to the 2010 midterms, one must not overestimate the role the health care debate will play with voters. The economy remains the dominant concern. On virtually every economic question -- the prospect of a recovery, job creation and their own finances -- voters were more pessimistic than a month ago. While Democrats were making headway on health care, they lost ground on the question of who will do a better job on the economy, now trailing Republicans 38 percent to 44 percent. 
 Still, I believe that the Democrats' winning on health care reform will affect voters' perceptions on a wide range of issues. Competence and progress count. And all the comparisons to the 1994 midterms, indeed a disaster for Democrats, may need revision. 
 I got to view those elections from inside the White House as President Bill Clinton's pollster, and am not able to forget what others may have forgotten. As the campaign began in earnest, we were just entering a harrowing six-month period for the president, starting with an independent counsel taking up the Whitewater investigation and the sexual harassment lawsuit filed by Paula Jones. That was followed by the ugly defeat of the president's crime bill at the hand of the Democratic majority in the House and the health care fiasco. The voters reasonably came to view the Democrats as arrogant and incapable of governing. 
 By contrast, Democrats today could easily be at the beginning of a hopeful six-month period, starting with the signing of the health care legislation that will further raise the public profile of the president and the Democratic Congress. 
 One closing suggestion for President Obama. I worry that he is tempted to talk about how ''America waited a hundred years'' for this moment, as he did Sunday night, just as Republicans are talking about the dawn of socialism and the Europeanization of America. The health care reform victory was hard politics. The president should learn the bread-and-butter lesson of the last month: focus on telling voters what the insurance companies won't be doing to you any more.
 And then, create some jobs -- that would be a true game changer.

HEADLINE: The Democrats Rejoice

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Parties come to embody causes. For the past 90 years or so, the Republican Party has, at its best, come to embody the cause of personal freedom and economic dynamism. For a similar period, the Democratic Party has, at its best, come to embody the cause of fairness and family security. Over the past century, they have built a welfare system, brick by brick, to guard against the injuries of fate.
 If you grew up, as I did, with a Hubert Humphrey poster on your wall and a tradition of Democratic Party activism in your family, you recognize the Democratic DNA in the content of this bill and in the way it was passed. There was the inevitable fractiousness, the neuroticism, the petty logrolling, but also the basic concern for the vulnerable and the high idealism. 
 And there was also the faith in the grand liberal project. Democrats protected the unemployed starting with the New Deal, then the old, then the poor. Now, thanks to health care reform, millions of working families will go to bed at night knowing that they are not an illness away from financial ruin.
 For apostates like me, watching this bill go through the meat grinder was like watching an old family reunion. One glimpse and you got the whole panoply of what you loved and found annoying about these people.
 Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi were fit to play the leading roles. They both embody the two great wings of the party, the high-minded aspirations of the educated class and the machinelike toughness of the party apparatus. Obama and Pelosi both possess the political tenaciousness that you only get if you live for government and believe ruthlessly in its possibilities. They could have scaled back their aspirations at any time but they hung tough.
 Members of the Obama-Pelosi team have spent the past year on a wandering, tortuous quest -- enduring the exasperating pettiness of small-minded members, hostile public opinion, just criticism and gross misinformation, a swarm of cockeyed ideas and the erroneous predictions of people like me who thought the odds were against them. For sheer resilience, they deserve the honor of posterity.
 Yet I confess, watching all this, I feel again why I'm no longer spiritually attached to the Democratic Party. The essence of America is energy -- the vibrancy of the market, the mobility of the people and the disruptive creativity of the entrepreneurs. This vibrancy grew up accidentally, out of a cocktail of religious fervor and material abundance, but it was nurtured by choice. It was nurtured by our founders, who created national capital markets to disrupt the ossifying grip of the agricultural landholders. It was nurtured by 19th-century Republicans who built the railroads and the land-grant colleges to weave free markets across great distances. It was nurtured by Progressives who broke the stultifying grip of the trusts.
 Today, America's vigor is challenged on two fronts. First, the country is becoming geriatric. Other nations spend 10 percent or so of their G.D.P. on health care. We spend 17 percent and are predicted to soon spend 20 percent and then 25 percent. This legislation was supposed to end that asphyxiating growth, which will crowd out investments in innovation, education and everything else. It will not.
 With the word security engraved on its heart, the Democratic Party is just not structured to cut spending that would enhance health and safety. The party nurtures; it does not say, ''No more.''
 The second biggest threat to America's vibrancy is the exploding federal debt. Again, Democrats can utter the words of fiscal restraint, but they don't feel the passion. This bill is full of gimmicks designed to get a good score from the Congressional Budget Office but not to really balance the budget. Democrats did enough to solve their political problem (not looking fiscally reckless) but not enough to solve the genuine problem.
 Nobody knows how this bill will work out. It is an undertaking exponentially more complex than the Iraq war, for example. But to me, it feels like the end of something, not the beginning of something. It feels like the noble completion of the great liberal project to build a comprehensive welfare system.
 The task ahead is to save this country from stagnation and fiscal ruin. We know what it will take. We will have to raise a consumption tax. We will have to preserve benefits for the poor and cut them for the middle and upper classes. We will have to invest more in innovation and human capital.
 The Democratic Party, as it revealed of itself over the past year, does not seem to be up to that coming challenge (neither is the Republican Party). This country is in the position of a free-spending family careening toward bankruptcy that at the last moment announced that it was giving a gigantic new gift to charity. You admire the act of generosity, but you wish they had sold a few of the Mercedes to pay for it.

HEADLINE: European Disunion

 BODY:
A few weeks ago, a solution to Greece's debt problems seemed close. The Greeks did their part by adopting a tough new austerity program earlier this month. But Europe has not followed through with the needed guarantee that the money Greece must borrow to pay its bills will be safe from default. 
 That is a big problem for Greece, and for the European Union, whose reputation for effective coordination is suffering. It also is bad for the United States. The nervous decline of the euro pushes up the dollar, making exports more expensive and slowing America's recovery. 
 The European Union has been unable to deliver because Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Europe's biggest, richest country, has been unwilling to lead. If Mrs. Merkel does not do so at this week's gathering of European leaders in Brussels, Greece may be forced to turn to the International Monetary Fund instead. 
 That would deal a damaging blow to the European Union's credibility and would also raise serious questions about the euro's future. Five of the 16 countries that use the euro are now facing serious fiscal difficulties.
 Greece does not need, has not asked for, and would not get a bailout loan. But it does need European guarantees to roll over its loans at affordable interest rates. Greece now pays 6 percent interest, twice the German rate. For its austerity program to work, that rate must drop or debt service will wipe out most of the savings.
 German voters, proud of their economic competitiveness, resist the idea of helping Greece, or other troubled countries like Ireland, Italy, Spain or Portugal. But Germany's economic strength is not just built on German hard work and efficiency. It is built on consumer demand elsewhere -- including its deficit-plagued euro partners. German voters who favor casting Greece and the others adrift seem to miss that connection.
 Mrs. Merkel has not slammed the door on a European solution. She says Germany is prepared to support ''stability'' as long as it does not have to put any money on the table. Greece says it is not seeking bailout money now, just loan guarantees. There is room for a deal, but it will require German leaders to take on parochial domestic opinion for the larger European cause. Mrs. Merkel's predecessors have done that in the past, and the European Union has been stronger for it.

HEADLINE: Trade Ruling That Airbus Got Subsidies Is Affirmed

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW and NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization ruled on Tuesday that the European plane maker Airbus received improper subsidies for its $13 billion A380 superjumbo jet and several other airplanes, hurting Boeing, its American rival, industry officials in the United States and Europe said.
 The ruling affirmed the organization's interim findings last September in response to a longstanding complaint by the United States over European support for Airbus. 
 Boeing has contended that the subsidies helped Airbus vault past it in 2003 to become the world's largest plane maker. Boeing hopes that the ruling could help it catch up once its new 787 Dreamliner jet hits the market. 
 The decision was made as tensions mounted over European claims of protectionism in the Pentagon's competition for a $35 billion to $40 billion contract for Air Force refueling tankers, the latest scrape between the companies.
 European leaders were upset when Northrop Grumman, which had teamed with Airbus's parent, dropped out of the tanker bidding, leaving Boeing the apparent winner.
 The Airbus parent, the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, initially said it would withdraw. But it has since asked the Pentagon for more time to consider bidding on its own. 
 For the American side, the most crucial finding was that most of the loans from European governments to help Airbus develop the A380 passenger jet amounted to prohibited subsidies. The loans, called ''launch aid,'' are considered improper if they are provided at below market rates.
 Representative Norm Dicks, Democrat of Washington, said the trade organization also found that Europe had provided improper subsidies to all of Airbus's large commercial airplanes, including five other series of jets -- the A300, A310, A320, A330 and A340.
 In a statement on Tuesday, Airbus confirmed that the panel had found the loans contained ''a certain element of subsidy.'' Airbus said it did not ban the use of government loans in general.
 But trade lawyers have said launch aid can be legal only if the loans are made at commercial rates. 
 The trade organization also found that the aid for the A380 was aimed at fostering export sales. Under its rules, such subsidies need to be withdrawn ''without delay.'' The Europeans would have more time to halt any aid still being paid on the older models. 
 Airbus may also appeal the ruling, and the case, filed nearly six years ago, is likely to drag on for many more months. 
 The W.T.O. is also looking into a European complaint that Boeing has benefited improperly from subsidies from its military business. Airbus said in the statement that ''resolution will finally only be found in trans-Atlantic negotiations.''
 Airbus also noted that the trade organization had rejected 70 percent of the specific arguments that the United States had made. But Boeing has said in the past that on crucial points, only one of the various arguments needed to be accepted for the panel to find the subsidies were unfair.
 Boeing has hoped that a victory in this case would pressure Europe to eliminate subsidies for the A350, a wide-body passenger jet being developed to compete with Boeing's most important plane, the new carbon-composite 787 Dreamliner. 
 The trade organization's ruling does not formally apply to the roughly $4.3 billion in European pledges of loans to help Airbus develop the A350, since work on it had not begun when the complaint was filed. Airbus said on Tuesday that the ruling would not affect that financing. 
 ''It's very difficult to make governments change their ways,'' said Richard L. Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at the Teal Group. ''You can rule against them in one way, and they just find a different way to achieve the same goal.''
 But the ruling could prompt Boeing's supporters in Congress to try to keep the Pentagon from giving the European company more time to bid on the tanker contract.
 Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington who led efforts to initiate the case, said on Tuesday that, given the ruling, ''Now's not the time to delay this competition further.''
 The ruling could mean that Airbus will be required to refinance some of its low-interest loans on commercial terms. Under the current terms, Airbus makes repayments as it delivers planes to customers. 
 Brazil, Canada, China and Japan -- all World Trade Organization members with aircraft industries -- have been watching to see whether they could be affected by any precedent set in the ruling. So has Russia, which has been negotiating to enter the organization since 1995. All five countries have invested significant public money, and some hope to compete with Boeing and Airbus in the market for 150- to 200-seat jets.

HEADLINE: Muscling In From Kansas

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

DATELINE: ARKANSAS CITY, Kan. 

 BODY:
 FAIR warning to anyone repulsed by succulent sirloin, robust rib-eye, primal porterhouse and tender T-bone: Avert your eyes. The following report is definitely not your meat. 
 Over the past 18 months, tender, flavorful Black Angus beef from an ultramodern plant amid table-flat farms dotted with pecan groves and patches of green winter wheat has roiled steak-and-burger-mad New York.
 Out of nowhere, seemingly, Creekstone Farms Premium Beef has challenged established red-meat royals like Niman Ranch, selling as much as four times more meat, by some estimates. Creekstone meat is served at many of the city's high-profile restaurants, including Babbo, Balthazar, Cafe Boulud, China Grill, Del Posto, Pastis, Porterhouse New York and the Standard Grill, as well as the Shake Shack burger joints. The newcomer mesmerized Marea, Tabla and Primehouse New York into printing its name on their menus.
 Indeed, Michael White, the chef and an owner of Marea, along with Alto and Convivio, can't say enough about ''the taste and the tenderness'' of this arriviste protein, which he calls ''a very superior product.'' Nonbelievers, on the other hand, view Creekstone's ascent as a triumph of canny marketing and tenacious salesmanship. 
 Inarguably, the Johnny Appleseed of the brand in the tough-to-crack New York City market has been Mark Pastore, the chief operating officer of Pat LaFrieda Wholesale Meat Purveyors Inc., the exclusive distributor for Creekstone in the Northeast. In any given week LaFrieda, with more than $40 million in annual revenues, pays $300,000 to $400,000 for two loads of meat shipped from Arkansas City, just north of the Oklahoma border. 
 ''I shake the hands and kiss the babies,'' said Mr. Pastore, 35. His method for motivating many top restaurants to try Creekstone, he said, was just to be in their face ''with terrific beef.'' 
 Beyond being a testament to Mr. Pastore's baby-bussing prowess, the rise of Creekstone is a result of the huge demand for beef that can satisfy both epicurean and ethical demands. 
 Close to a fourth of Creekstone's meat is ''natural,'' meaning free from antibiotics and growth-producing hormones; cattle are given vegetarian feed and, as a quality-control measure, it is noted which ranch each came from. In 2005, after adopting stringent standards, the company won certification to provide its highest-end products to the European Union, Japan and Korea. 
 ''We want to know that the animals are raised responsibly,'' said Riad Nasr, an executive chef at Minetta Tavern. 
 And customers do, too, because ''they can't trust the regulators,'' said Malcolm M. Knapp, who heads a restaurant consulting company in Manhattan that bears his name. ''These days, diners can use their phones right in the restaurant to check beef out on the Internet. And they do.''
 Creekstone partisans point to its single-facility operation, which affords better supervision, and its Corn Belt cattle from Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa and Oklahoma. Some of Creekstone's cachet has derived from the perception that it was ''courageous'' in standing up to the meat industry, said the food historian Betty Fussell, whose 2008 book, ''Raising Steaks: The Life and Times of American Beef'' (Houghton Mifflin), sounded alarms about factory-farmed beef. 
 In 2004 Creekstone opposed the United States Department of Agriculture, and won enemies in the business, by demanding the right to test every one of its cattle -- at $20 a head -- for mad cow disease. In 2008 a federal appeals court ruled against it, but Ms. Fussell said that the company ''has turned that to its advantage'' in image-making.
 Creekstone began 20 years ago on a farm in Campbellsburg, Ky., that is depicted on its logo. ''Despite the word 'farm,' this is not your local little operation; it is an industrial beef company,'' Ms. Fussell said. ''They've found a very clever way to market themselves.''
 Creekstone is now a subsidiary of Sun Capital Partners Inc., a private equity firm that has invested in more than 200 companies, with total sales of more than $37 billion over the last 15 years. 
 Creekstone cattle are hand-picked by eight roving field buyers. Ryan Meyer, the company's director of cattle procurement, said its most elite meat derives from about 100 ranches supplying just 15 feed yards; beef from other companies can come from thousands of ranches. 
 One of Creekstone's sources is the 7,000-acre spread in Goff, Kan., owned by Gary Pfrang, 53, a fifth-generation cattleman. He raises 1,500 head a year, along with the corn they are fed after they have eaten pasture grass for more than a year. 
 He fattens them himself in pens that offer ''plenty of room -- more room than in one of those condos in New York,'' Mr. Pfrang said feistily, ''because if they're crowded and stressed,'' they won't grade as prime at Creekstone.
 Though many ranches misrepresent the purity of their Angus genetics, ''we can prove ours,'' Mr. Pfrang said. ''We have been tracking our cow families since 1948, and we've worked on their genetics, retaining the best offspring and turning them back into our herd.''
 In the cut and thrust of meat distribution, ''there are many fine suppliers of Angus beef,'' said Stephanie Crane Faison, spokeswoman for DeBragga & Spitler, the Manhattan meatpacking-district stalwart. DeBragga, which wouldn't discuss its revenues, sells steaks to Daniel, Patroon, Gotham Bar and Grill, Craft and Colicchio & Sons. 
 DeBragga is supplied by, among others, Niman Ranch, which says marketing is the only reason for the Creekstone insurgency. ''We have better genetics and husbandry than any of our competitors,'' said John A. Tarpoff, a vice president at Niman, which has offices in Denver. 
 Niman Ranch -- appearing on the menus of the River Cafe, Mercer Kitchen and Il Buco -- says the grass-and-corn-fed Black Angus cattle for its ''natural'' line derive from some 70 ranches across the country supplying 30 feed-yard operations. Year-round, Mr. Tarpoff said, the percentage of Niman's beef graded as prime is higher than that of Creekstone and other high-end producers. But Mr. Tarpoff said its ''natural'' output is a fourth of Creekstone's. Niman contracts its meatpacking to a Swift & Company plant in Hyrum, Utah.
 Creekstone's $185 million, 450,000-square-foot packing plant was built a decade ago and is one of the most advanced slaughterhouses in the country. Cattle enter temperature-controlled pens suffused in low, even light. There are no distractions like white-garbed workers. ''Cattle balk at color contrasts, reflections, shadows,'' said Temple Grandin, the slaughterhouse consultant who designed that and other features of the facility.
 Her goal was to reduce stress and fear in the animals, as some studies have suggested that they harm the quality of meat and are factors in producing so-called dark cutters, cattle whose meat appears brownish or blackish and may be sticky to the touch.
 Cattle amble to their doom along serpentines that do not present alarming sharp angles. An air-circulation system prevents the animals from smelling either blood ''or fear,'' Dr. Grandin said. 
 Steak aficionados who prefer not to take responsibility for their taste buds might skip the rest of this paragraph. Dr. Grandin's conveyor-belt system lifts the live cattle up to the ''knock room.'' There, a pneumatic bolt gun ''kills them instantly,'' she said, putting a five-inch-long retractable bolt into the head. ''They walk up and then, bang, it'sdone,'' she said.
 In the plant on a recent morning, a vast beehive of 700 nonunion workers moved purposefully through the sweetly acrid abbatoir tang of the plant amid the din of slaughterhouse machinery. Wielding their sharpening steels, butchers took glittering knives to some 900 carcasses swaying solemnly on computerized trolleys, riding rail after rail to their disassembly. In its advertising, Creekstone trumpets its slow and careful ''line speed,'' processing 150 cattle an hour, about half the industry average. 
 The factory breaks down 1,000 head daily to produce some five million pounds of beef weekly, all tested for E. coli and salmonella before shipping. The plant utilizes ''everything but the moo,'' Mr. Meyer said. Even cattle eyeballs are packed in dry ice to be hurried to a pharmaceutical company in Texas for use in medical research. 
 But much of the company's fate hangs on one crucial prime cut. Each carcass is opened at the 12th rib, exposing the rib-eye and revealing the marbling of the muscle.
 A grader from the United States Department of Agriculture, who declined to be interviewed, examined carcasses. He was shadowed by Trace Nuckles, a Creekstone beef evaluator. Sometimes, they had words. ''We talk about some of them a bit,'' Mr. Nuckles said, smiling, of their adversarial dance. 
 The quality of marbling, in steak after steak, has bewitched chefs who buy Creekstone. Mr. Nasr, of Minetta Tavern, said he highly prized the consistency -- minimal varying degrees of tenderness, marbling and flavor.
 Some standardbearers of the sustainable-meat movement, like Joshua Applestone of Fleisher's Grass-Fed and Organic Meats, a butcher in Kingston, N.Y., sniff at Creekstone's boxed ''factory meat.'' Pasture-fed animals bought from local farms are ''healthier for customers and better for the animals, the small farmers and the small slaughterhouses,'' Mr. Applestone said. 
 But Mr. White, the chef at Marea, said there is a quality-control difference between Creekstone and the giant processors with dozens of plants and thousands of farm-and-feedlot subcontractors. In an industry that processes more than 600,000 head of cattle weekly, Creekstone accounts for less than 1 percent with its 5,000 head a week.
 And even for a relatively tiny player like Creekstone, beef production is capital-intensive, Mr. Meyer, the cattle procurement officer, said. ''We spend $1 million a day just to purchase cattle.'' 
 Whatever the processors' size, the economics of beef are unforgiving. It costs a rancher more to raise cattle humanely. Each Angus steer or heifer can cost Creekstone $1,100, and it even costs the company $150 for a first look at ranchers' cattle. Those costs, plus profits for LaFrieda and for restaurants, are passed on to customers, who now insist on down-economy affordability even in high-end dining rooms. After all is said and done, Creekstone makes a profit of $10 to $40 a head. 
 Demand for its product has given Creekstone single-digit growth in a contracting economy, with $370 million in revenues in 2009. Dennis Buhlke, Creekstone's president, predicts 7.5 percent growth in 2010. 
 Lately, Mr. Pastore, of LaFrieda, said that he cannot keep up with the demand for Creekstone rib steaks, porterhouse and other so-called middle meats. ''That is the ice cream of the animal,'' he said.
 And new competitors ceaselessly try to turn the heads of top chefs. Bill Niman, who in 2007 parted from the company he founded, Niman Ranch, now owns BN Ranch in Bolinas, Calif., with his wife, Nicolette. The ranch will offer its first aristocratic natural beef from 3-year-old grass-fed cattle this August in a restricted release that will be, as Mr. Niman put it, ''like the arrival of the Beaujolais nouveau.''

HEADLINE: Dow Soars to 18-Month High on Renewed Confidence About the Economy

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Investors snapped up industrial and materials stocks on Tuesday, helping the Dow soar to a 18-month high. 
 Better-than-expected data on home sales helped renew confidence about the economy, even though investors remained concerned that a recovery for the housing market was stalling.
 The Dow Jones industrial average is just 112 points below the 11,000 mark, closing up 102.94 points, or 0.95 percent, to end regular trading at 10,888.83. It was its highest level since Sept. 26, 2008. 
 It was helped by a 4.1 percent surge in shares of Caterpillar, which rose to $62.41, and a 1.4 percent jump for General Electric, to $18.33.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 8.36 points, or 0.72 percent, to 1,174.17, also an 18-month high. 
 The Nasdaq composite index increased 19.84 points, or 0.83 percent, to 2,415.24, a level not seen since August of 2008.
 Google shares fell 1.52 percent, or $8.50, to $549 after the company decided to redirect users in mainland China to an uncensored Web site in Hong Kong. 
 Market gauges rose as President Obamasigned health care legislation into law, helping remove some uncertainty from the market. 
 Dan A. Faretta, senior market strategist for the LaSalle Futures Group, said the focus for investors was now on economic fundamentals. The Dow has found new momentum lately, but light trading and meager gains have stirred doubt about the viability of the upward thrust.
 ''What we need now is another catalyst to keep this rally alive,'' Mr. Faretta said, pointing to data on sales of new homes and jobless claims later this week.
 The National Association of Realtors said sales fell 0.6 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.02 million homes. That beat expectations of a 1.1 percent drop, but sales remain well below historical averages. The data was far from reassuring, but investors saw it as a reprieve from several months of startlingly weak figures.
 ''Housing is a continuing concern,'' said Sean C. Kraus, chief investment officer for CitizensTrust in Pasadena, Calif. ''We need to see job creation to see a tangible pickup in home purchases. We seem to be headed that way.''
 Still, some investors remain nervous that the housing market could drag the economy down. 
 On Wall Street, forecasts for home sales have grown increasingly restrained after projections for December and January widely missed the mark. 
 Shares of KB Home fell 1.66 percent, or 29 cents, to $17.15, after its first-quarter earnings fell short of expectations. The company said new home orders increased 5 percent in the three months that ended in February, but it reported a loss of $54.7 million.
 Investors hope the looming expiration date for the government's tax credit of up to $8,000 -- buyers must be under contract by April 30 to qualify -- will bolster sales. But there are no firm signs yet that the market can thrive on its own, and many economists foresee weak demand after the credit expires.
 A robust jobs market could give sales a jolt, but the unemployment rate remains at 9.7 percent.
 In other market news, shares of the Walgreen Company rose 1.64 percent, to $35.91, after the company said its profit was up 4.5 percent in the most recent quarter. 
 Alcoa was up 1.12 percent, to $14.50, amid signs that aluminum demand would grow.
 The Treasury's 10-year note fell 7/32, to 99 16/32. The yield rose to 3.69 percent, from 3.66 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: Garden Shows An Interest In M.M.A.

BYLINE: By RAY KRUEGER

 BODY:
Mixed martial arts is not legal in New York State, but that has not stopped Madison Square Garden from jumping into the cage. 
 Radio City Music Hall, which the Garden operates, will host a news conference on Wednesday for the Ultimate Fighting Championship pay-per-view card on Saturday in Newark. The fights, to be contested at the sold-out Prudential Center, will be shown on a big screen at Radio City. 
 The Garden also has a co-promotional deal with Bellator Fighting Championships, a smaller mixed martial arts organization based in Chicago, to have fights at a Garden-owned theater in Chicago and a theater in Boston. 
 ''The world's fastest-growing sport seems like a perfect fit for the world's most famous arena,'' said Scott O'Neil, the president of Madison Square Garden Sports. 
 As revenue for some leagues and teams has fallen during the economic downturn, crowds for mixed martial arts have continued to grow. Saturday's U.F.C. event will take in at least $4 million in ticket sales. 
 Melvina Lathan, the chairwoman of the New York State Athletic Commission, has expressed support for legalizing the sport, and momentum for it to become sanctioned seems to be growing with the state's budget deficit.
 Lorraine A. Cortes-Vazquez, New York's secretary of state, favored the legalization and regulation of mixed martial arts in an op-ed articleshe wrote for The Times Union of Albany. She cited its potential economic benefits, among other issues.
 Gov. David A. Paterson included a proposal to legalize the sport as a way to raise money in his budget proposal in December. But when Lt. Gov. Richard Ravitch presented a five-year financial rescue plan this month, he did not mention any specific programs.
 The U.F.C. is hoping the economic potential of events in New York will keep mixed martial arts as a part of the state's revenue plans. 
 ''We have people who fly in from all around the world to our events,'' said Dana White, the president of the U.F.C. ''That is a lot of hotel rooms, a lot of merchandise.'' And this week, a lot of hoopla in New York for a sport that is prohibited there. 
 O'Neil did not see any contradiction in promoting an event for another arena.
 ''We have had press conferences for lots of events that did not take place here,'' he said.
 O'Neil denied that the Garden was trying to make a point by showing how much revenue a fight could generate if it were in Manhattan. 
 White said the U.F.C. was just doing business as usual, promoting an event in the most visible way in a major market.
 ''This is not some small little cult following,'' he said. ''We have millions of fans.''
 The number of fans has grown with the number of states sanctioning the sport. A lobbying effort led by Marc Ratner, vice president for regulatory affairs with the U.F.C., has led to 44 states sanctioning the sport.
 ''It is not a question of if we will be sanctioned in New York, but when,'' Ratner said.
 But the sport's opponents are not about to tap out.
 Assemblyman Bob Reilly, an upstate Democrat, opposes the sport on moral grounds. He disagrees with Paterson's projections that the sport would bring in $2 million annually to the state.
 ''It is violence for violence's sake,'' Reilly said. ''And violence begets violence.''
 White countered by saying that his sport may not be for everyone and that ''there are fewer serious injuries in the U.F.C. than in competitive cheerleading.''
 Bjorn Rebney, the president of Bellator, is not involved in the lobbying effort in New York, but is glad the Garden is getting involved in his sport. His tournament-based organization has a deal with Fox Sports to televise fights and with NBC to televise a weekly highlight show.
 ''When you get a call from Madison Square Garden, you pay attention,'' Rebney said.
 He added, ''If the U.F.C. was to hold a major pay-per-view in the Garden, it would be reminiscent of the Ali fights.'' 
 Reilly is working to prevent that. He sent a letter signed by 48 members of the 150-seat Assembly to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver asking to have the sanctioning of mixed martial arts removed from the budget process. But if that effort fails, he said, the state's fiscal problems are too big to be held up by a fight over mixed martial arts.
 ''Then I will probably not vote against it,'' he said. ''As this will only be a small part of the budget.''

HEADLINE: Reviving a Poor Neighborhood for Its Inhabitants

BYLINE: By LINDA BAKER

 BODY:
PORTLAND, Ore. -- To revive a languishing neighborhood, one theory goes, cities should encourage new restaurants, locally owned shops and quality market-rate housing, and the money will follow. In the Old Town/Chinatown district here, however, that model is being turned upside down.
 The Resource Access Center, a $47 million complex that will provide affordable housing and a shelter and services for homeless people, is the focal point of a 10-year plan to end homelessness here. The eight-story, 106,000-square-foot center, which will open next year, is expected to help catalyze development in the north end of Old Town/Chinatown, a neglected area that supporters say is poised for significant growth. 
 ''The R.A.C. will be at an intersection of our education system, transportation system and economic development laboratory,'' said Nick Fish, a city commissioner who oversees the Portland Housing Bureau, which works on behalf of low-income residents. ''It will be a showcase for the city.''
 The center, under construction since last fall, is a partnership among the city, the Housing Authority of Portland and Transition Projects Inc., a nonprofit organization. It will include a 90-bed men's shelter, 130 units of rental housing, and services that include a barbershop, a laundry, and job and housing assistance. Also planned is a community court, a Multnomah County project that allows people accused of minor offenses to perform community service instead of serving time in jail.
 ''The center will be a one-stop center to get folks where we want them to be -- self-sufficient,'' Mr. Fish said.
 Since December 2004, the city has moved nearly 7,000 chronically homeless people into permanent housing, Mr. Fish said. The new center, which will serve about 1,000 people a day, will accelerate that effort.
 Just west of the development site is a 130,000-square-foot former federal building that was recently acquired by the Pacific Northwest College of Art. To the north is Union Station, the end of a new light rail line. The city hopes to redevelop a 13-acre site across the street where the main post office stands.
 Old Town business owners said the community supported the development, with reservations. A majority of Old Town residents are poor, and Howard Weiner, a former neighborhood group chairman, said market rate housing would have helped create a more balanced demographic mix. ''We'd like to see 50 percent of the folks living in the neighborhood have means,'' he said. 
 Designed by Holst Architecture, a local business known for its modern condominium developments, the center has a sleek concrete and brick slab face with asymmetrically placed windows. It will incorporate ecologically friendly features like the use of recycled water from washers and showers to flush toilets. 
 Recognized for its collection of historic buildings, Old Town/Chinatown has a large concentration of mental health, addiction and shelter agencies serving a low-income population. The resource center would improve on the typical configuration of these agencies by providing a place for homeless people to get help but without the sidewalk lines that can interfere with local businesses.
 ''The whole notion is, What do we do with visibly homeless people in the daytime?'' said Steve Rudman, executive director of the Housing Authority of Portland, the project developer.
 To address that issue, the development includes a 3,285-square-foot courtyard ''where people can hang out with a cup of coffee, their shopping carts,'' Mr. Rudman said. Case managers will be stationed in the outdoor space, which will also have kennels for clients' dogs.
 Inside will be offices for county agencies, classrooms, private areas for phone calls, and information and referral services. A computer center, a library and a mailroom also are planned.
 The 14,000-square-foot men's shelter, which will have a separate entrance, is replacing a smaller one Transition Projects operates a block away. The new shelter will have private showers and a separate eating area, giving people ''space and dignity,'' said Doreen Binder, the executive director of Transition Projects.
 The apartments on the upper floors will serve a population that is difficult to house, often because of mental health or addiction problems. The 300-square-foot studios have wall racks for bicycles, solar-heated hot water and exposed concrete floors. Exterior window frames, painted in eight alternating shades of green, are part of a design strategy intended to ''raise the bar'' for low-income housing, said David Otte of Holst Architecture. The goal was to incorporate ''warmth and color, whimsy and individuality,'' Mr. Otte said. 
 Ed Blackburn, executive director of Central City Concern, a nonprofit housing developer and provider of services for the homeless, said policies tied to the 10-year homelessness plan, called Home Again, had played ''a major role'' in the development of low-income housing projects -- in Old Town and elsewhere. He pointed in particular to a Portland requirement that 30 percent of tax increment financing -- money borrowed against future growth in property taxes -- generated in renewal zones be used for affordable housing.
 The Resource Access Center is in the River District urban renewal area, and has received $29.5 million in tax increment financing. Low-income housing tax credits added $11.7 million, and $3.3 million came from the federal stimulus. The housing authority contributed $1.9 million, with the remainder coming from other sources.
 Eventually, 125 construction workers will be employed at the site, 25 of them homeless. One Transition Projects client is already working as an apprentice laborer, said Pete Bruns, project superintendent with Walsh Construction.
 Such partnerships are central to the resource center mission, Ms. Binder said. Chronically homeless people often have to overcome multiple social, psychological and economic barriers before they can make the transition to housing, she said. ''We are going to be able to address most of those barriers in this building.''

HEADLINE: Economy Cools Migration To Cities in the Sun Belt

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Americans stung by the recession and the burst housing bubble hunkered down as the decade ended. As a result, hot spots in the South and the West that had surged in population after 2000 grew more slowly or lost migrants to other places, according to census data released Tuesday. 
 Metropolitan Las Vegas, Bakersfield, Calif., and the Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Fla., metropolitan area recorded more people leaving than arriving for the first time. The loss rate in Cape Coral, which experienced the fastest gain during the bubble at the middle of the decade, was surpassed only by Detroit and Youngstown, Ohio.
 Phoenix, which was drawing 100,000 new residents at mid-decade, gained only 12,000 in the 12 months ending July 1, 2009.
 Demographers said the decline in mobility reflected both the breadth of the recession -- there were no jobs to move to -- and the likelihood that retirees were saddled with homes they could not sell or were forced by shrunken savings to delay retirement. 
 While the typical population magnets lost their pull, metropolitan Boston registered its first gain in migration from elsewhere in the United States since at least 1990. Washington reversed its migration loss, and New York recorded its lowest loss since at least 1990. 
 Metropolitan Los Angeles lost about 80,000 people to other places from July 1, 2008 to July 1, 2009, about a third of its annual loss in mid-decade. And metropolitan Detroit, Cleveland, Philadelphia and Chicago registered reduced losses. 
 Houston, which has been the leader in attracting newcomers from other places in the nation, drew even more in the latest year, defying the decline recorded in Atlanta and, to a lesser degree, in Raleigh, N.C., and Austin, Tex.
 ''These new data show that the migration slowdown continues and may not let up in the foreseeable future,'' said William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution.
 An analysis by Kelvin Pollard and Mark Mather of the Population Reference Bureau found that counties that typically draw an influx of people ages 60 and older grew at 1.7 percent from 2007 to 2009, compared with an annual average of 3.1 percent from 2000 to 2007.
 Since 2000, three metropolitan counties nearly doubled their population: Kendall, near Chicago; Pinal, near Phoenix; and Rockwall, near Dallas.

HEADLINE: At Some Neighborhood Schools, Waiting Lists Get Longer

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
It was once an unspoken social compact -- move to the right school zone and your child was guaranteed a spot in the right school. 
 But for the second year in a row, hundreds of families throughout the city will receive letters telling them that their children have been placed on a waiting list for their local elementary school. 
 The lists are longer this year at some schools on the Upper West Side and Upper East Side in Manhattan. Public School 87, on West 78th Street, has space for 130 kindergartners, and 111 children are on the waiting list. Across Central Park at Public School 290, 91 students are on the waiting list, nearly as many as the school admitted. 
 Michelle Hankin, who moved to the Upper East Side shortly before her daughter, Sydney, was born, was among the first in line at P.S. 290 when kindergarten enrollment began in February. When she called the school on Monday, she learned she was No. 62 on the waiting list. A school official told her it was unlikely that students that far down on the list would be reached, Ms. Hankin said. 
 ''I am trying to find out what I am supposed to do and what our options are, but I really feel helpless,'' she said. 
 Public officials and parents say the increased demand at some schools is driven by a mix of new buildings, families deciding to stay in the city rather than move to the suburbs, and economic decisions to pass on private schools.
 Generally, schools with more applicants than seats use a lottery, though most give preferences to students with siblings already at the school.
 Jessica Lappin, a city councilwoman from the Upper East Side, said the waiting lists appeared to be significantly longer than they were at this time last year. For example, P.S. 290 had three dozen students on its list by the end of last March. ''We're still seeing results of a building boom in the area, and you have more parents choosing to stay in the area but not being able to afford private school,'' she said. ''As the week goes on, people are going to start to be more and more upset.'' 
 Other schools with long waiting lists include Public School 183 and Public School 6 on the Upper East Side, each with more than 50 students, and Public School 199 on the Upper West Side, with 47 students.
 The phenomenon is not restricted to schools in the wealthiest neighborhoods. In Brooklyn, some schools in Sunset Park and Bay Ridge have waiting lists, including 57 students at P.S. 105 and 47 at P.S. 169. Waiting lists have also become the reality in Corona, Queens, where middle-class immigrant families have moved in large numbers. Roughly 120 students in the neighborhood are on the waiting lists for four schools -- P.S. 28, P.S. 143, P.S. 89 and P.S. 14. 
 Maura Keaney, the director of external affairs for the Education Department, said that children on a waiting list would be offered a spot at another nearby school by the middle of May. Two new schools with 75 kindergarten seats each will open this fall in existing buildings in District 2 and 3 in Manhattan, and could absorb some of the children. Ms. Keaney added that children could stay on the waiting list at their neighborhood school even if their parents accept the alternate placement.
 ''We understand that for those families, this is a time of real anxiety,'' Ms. Keaney said, ''but we know that some of the waiting lists will shrink and some of them will go away completely'' as many students are accepted into gifted programs or choose private schools. 
 Parents and officials on the Upper West Side have said for months that schools there would face serious overcrowding unless the city opened up a new school building. ''It's just hitting us like ton of bricks, but there were people who predicted this months ago,'' said Gail Brewer, a city councilwoman. 
 But Education Department officials said that school buildings in the district as a whole were underutilized and that student enrollment should be distributed more evenly by changing local school zones. 
 Those decisions are made by the elected Community Education Councils in each district. The councils, which are made up of parents, are generally careful about zone changes because the issue is sensitive, though the District 3 council made some changes last year.
 The department also indicated on Tuesday that high school admission letters could be delayed because of a lawsuit filed by the United Federation of Teachers and the N.A.A.C.P. seeking to overturn plans to close several high schools. (Selective schools like Stuyvesant and Bronx Science have already notified students of acceptance.)
 This month, a judge ruled that the city should not distribute final high school admission decisions because it did not give students the option to choose schools that it proposed to close.

HEADLINE: More Sellers Put Homes on Market, but There Are Fewer Buyers

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
The volume of home sales is slumping even as the number of properties on the market is rising, which is putting new pressure on prices, according to economic data released Tuesday.
 The triple whammy of bad news stoked fears that the brief recovery in housing was finished and another dip had begun. If that proves to be the case, it could slow the broader economic recovery.
 ''The housing market may remain a noose around the neck of the U.S. economy for some time yet,'' Paul Dales of Capital Economics told clients. 
 Mortgage rates are near their postwar low, and the government is offering buyers a tax credit of as much as $8,000 if they will do a deal now. But the appeal of both inducements has proved faint this winter.
 Sales of existing homes fell 0.6 percent in February from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.02 million units, the National Association of Realtorssaid.
 The drop, which was roughly in line with analysts' predictions, came after a sharp decline in December and a more modest one in January.
 ''This winter has been brutal,'' said Michael E. Menatian, president of the Sanborn Mortgage Corporation of West Hartford, Conn. ''People were hunkered down, worried that things were going to get worse and petrified to make a big move.''
 The Realtors' association cited the winter weather as a reason for some of February's lackluster results, although sales were actually strongest in the storm-plagued Northeast and Midwest and weakest in the West. The South was down slightly.
 Sales volume has retraced about two-thirds of its upward swing since last spring, said Sal Guatieri of BMO Capital Markets Economics. Volume is only 7 percent above the level of February 2009, when many buyers expected the recession to develop into a depression.
 The only positive thing to say about February, Mr. Guatieri wrote in a research note, ''is that the rate of decline has slowed.''
 A smaller pool of buyers inevitably means that sellers have to settle for less. Home prices in January fell 0.6 percent from the previous month, the Federal Housing Finance Agency said in a separate report. The decline in December was revised downward to a 2 percent drop. 
 The federal index is now at a new low for this housing cycle, and roughly at the same value it had in the fall of 2004. The Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller Home Price Index, which uses a different set of data, is still modestly above its lows of last spring. The Case-Shiller numbers for January will be released next week. 
 If the market has truly turned down again, the respite was brief. After three years of declines, both sales and prices began stabilizing last year. One major reason was the tax credit. Originally due to expire Nov. 30, the credit sparked a mini-frenzy as buyers struggled to strike deals before the deadline. Congress then extended and broadened the credit.
 Many agents, lenders and brokers expect sales to pick up again, at least temporarily, as the credit's new deadline of April 30 approaches. ''Things are starting to loosen up,'' said Mr. Menatian of Sanborn Mortgage.
 More sellers are putting their homes on the market, doubtless hoping to lure buyers eager to take advantage of the tax credit. At the current sales rate, it would take 8.6 months for all homes on the market to find buyers, up from 7.8 months in January.
 A normal market has about six months of inventory. In 2008, the level hit a modern peak of over 11 months. If the many homes in the process of foreclosure make their way to market in the next few months, inventory levels could jump again, putting renewed pressure on prices.

HEADLINE: Path to Xenophobia Is Diverted by a German Mosque's Open Doors

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH

 BODY:
VOLKLINGEN, Germany -- Everything seemed to be in place for a protracted xenophobic row and attendant media frenzy in this depressed industrial town near the French border. 
 A Muslim congregation applied in November to build a minaret and three golden cupolas on the roof of the old movie theater it had converted into a mosque. The far-right party here in the state of Saarland, emboldened by last year's ban on minarets in Switzerland, seized on the issue, calling the proposed 28-foot minaret ''the bayonet of Islam.'' 
 But after a quick turn in the media spotlight, the pending furor fizzled out. A neighborhood group recently issued a statement with mosque leaders calling for ''peaceful and constructive'' cooperation, while the mosque's leadership agreed to temporarily shelve the plan for the minaret. 
 They will spend the rest of the year reaching out to the non-Muslim community, opening their doors to promote understanding before moving ahead. ''Whether it comes to building the minaret or not, we've started the dialogue and we're going to continue it,'' said Atnen Atakli, the mosque's chairman.
 Analysts say that strong social safety nets have kept intolerance toward Europe's Muslims from growing significantly through the economic crisis, at least so far, with the worst sparring coming between countries -- in particular Germany and Greece -- rather than within them. 
 ''Governments have been willing to cushion the blow and expand the deficits, so the debate has not heated up,'' said Justin Vaisse, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Center on the United States and Europe, who studies Muslims in Europe. ''You're not looking at a 1930s situation where a social crisis derives from an economic crisis.'' 
 Acrimonious debates and disputes over Islam -- particularly the most visible manifestations like women wearing head scarves, veils and burqas and the construction of mosques -- continue apace. But researchers have not seen a correlation between economic woes and Islamophobia. 
 ''The economic crisis hit the immigrant population, many of them Muslims, harder than it did the majority population,'' said Werner Schiffauer, professor of social and cultural anthropology specializing in Muslim populations in Europe at the Viadrina University in Frankfurt an der Oder. ''As they are dependent on welfare benefits, there was the accusation of blaming them, in a way, that Islam is responsible for a lax working morale.''
 Volklingen welcomed migrants, especially from Turkey, who came in the 1960s and '70s as guest workers in the industrial boom years. Now, the rusting ironworks known as the Volklinger Hutte are defunct, a Unesco landmark but also a constant reminder of better days. 
 The city's population shrank to just below 40,000 last year from over 48,000 in 1974. Migrants and their children and grandchildren now make up 12 percent of the populace, with Turks the largest group. For immigrants who have worked here for decades, raised families and are now retired, a small prayer tower did not seem too much to ask.
 ''All the churches here have big towers, and there are many churches in Turkey,'' said Ihsan Urgaci, 65, a retiree who has lived in Germany for 40 years.
 But many local Muslims, like Ridvan Carpar, said it was better not to press the issue. Mr. Carpar, 35, came from Turkey when he was 5 years old and works in a kebab stand across from the mosque, which itself is evidence of the city's changing face. Above the sign for Pasha kebabs, grimy letters on the facade still spell out ''Schreiner's Drugstore.''
 ''Until now, we've never had any problems,'' Mr. Carpar said. ''A mosque is a mosque, whether it has a minaret or not.''
 Mr. Carpar inadvertently echoed the same sentiment as Frank Franz, the state chairman in the Saarland of the far-right party, the National Democrats, which has two seats on the city council. ''A minaret has nothing to do with freedom of religion; it isn't necessary,'' Mr. Franz said. At a party meeting in Volklingen last month, red and white fliers declared, ''Thank you, Switzerland. Minaret ban here, too!''
 In November a Swiss referendum banning the construction of minarets passed with 57.5 percent of the vote. The Swiss minaret ban showed, Mr. Franz said, ''that the opinion of the people is not sufficiently respected in other parts of Europe.''
 The National Democratic Party -- which the government has tried unsuccessfully to ban as a neo-Nazi party -- may be represented on the city council in Volklingen, but their two seats are down from five before the last election in 2009, when the economic crisis was at its worst.
 So far, at least in Germany, the far right has not been able to capitalize on economic turmoil to gain a larger foothold. But the debate in Europe over visible symbols of its sizable Islamic population, with estimates ranging from between 15 million and 20 million in European Union countries, remains unsettled and fraught.
 The Dutch anti-Islam leader Geert Wilders had a strong showing in recent local elections in the Netherlands, just three months ahead of the June 9 national election. In France, Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front provoked outrage ahead of regional elections in southern France with a veiled woman standing in front of an Algerian flag in the shape of France, studded with minarets. 
 President Nicolas Sarkozy has led debates over French identity and the Islamic veil, which many experts say is a strategic move to head off challenges from the far right. But that backfired in the first round of regional elections, when voters for the National Front stuck with their party and Mr. Sarkozy had trouble motivating his own base.
 Volkingen's mayor, Klaus Lorig, from Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right Christian Democratic Party, who faces an election in September and came out against the minaret, has struck a more conciliatory tone.
 ''Purely as a matter of building code, it could be approved,'' he said. ''What I fear is that this effort, this attempt to come closer, that the delicate buds we've nurtured in the area of integration might be endangered if they insist on building the minaret.''

HEADLINE: Good Wines And No Attitude. Yes, It's True.

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
IT'S Friday night at Alphabet City Wine Company on Avenue C, and the juice is flowing. Two customers lounge on well-worn black vinyl chairs in what could pass for a graduate-school living room. Four more stand in front of a makeshift bar. Music streams from vintage KLH speakers, and Keith Beavers, one of the owners, is deep into his spiel. 
 ''Forget about the word 'super-Tuscan,' just try the wine,'' he tells a couple at a rustic wood table as he pours a 2006 Montaperto from the Tuscan producer Carpineta Fontalpino into their glasses. He's gesturing now as if he is at the pulpit, emoting to the masses, not just the six customers in his shop. 
 ''The super-Tuscan idea is so misleading,'' he said. ''Now everybody thinks super-Tuscans are these big huge things, but this is smoky and smooth, with a subtlety and complexity.'' 
 Sold! 
 Wherever interest in wine is rising, spirited voices in new shops like Mr. Beavers's are preaching the pleasures of good bottles. Eric Ambel, a musician and record producer who shops regularly at Alphabet City, likened the staff there to the clerks at record stores he frequented in the 1980s. ''They have the same knowing enthusiasm of the guys who tracked your penchant for Pacific Northwest garage rock or pre-CBS Telecaster hillbilly music,'' he said. 
 Like those stores of old, these new wine shops sustain self-reliant souls burning to share their passion for wine. In the process they are extending and improving this country's wine culture. They stimulate discussion, make more good bottles available to more people and, most important, offer by far the most useful resources for increasing the American public's confidence in its often uneasy relationship with wine: attentive ears and friendly voices.
 Americans today are bombarded with opportunities to learn about wine. New books approach the subject from every conceivable angle, culinary schools offer classes at all levels, and the Internet, well, it just won't shut up. But the most influential voice many people will hear belongs to their local retailer.
 Good wine merchants, like smart sommeliers, are part psychologist and part clairvoyant. They must listen carefully to translate the often inchoate desires of their customers into fulfilling wine experiences. Mr. Beavers puts it slightly differently. 
 ''I'm just a wacko,'' he said. ''I love getting questions from customers, and I just try to bring wine down to a human level.''
 The recent vintage of shops can be found in pockets of wine enthusiasm around the country, including DomaineLA in Los Angeles, Terroir Natural Wine Merchant in San Francisco and CoolVines in Princeton, N.J. But enthusiasm seems to burn hottest in New York City.
 Some merchants, like Mr. Beavers, are bringing their messages to neighborhoods that have never enjoyed the benefits of a good shop. Brooklyn's small fleet of boutique wine shops has grown in the last few years to include Dandelion Wine in Greenpoint, Thirst Wine Merchants in Fort Greene, T. B. Ackerson Wine Merchants in Ditmas Park and Juice Box Wine and Spirits in Windsor Terrace. In Dumbo, Blanc & Rouge opened in 2000, but in the last few years, under new ownership, it has significantly increased its selection and Web presence.
 In Queens, Table Wine recently came to Jackson Heights while Long Island City has gained Vine Wine and Hunter's Point Wines. And in Manhattan, by no means under-served by great wine shops, the armada has grown not only to include pioneering outposts like Frankly Wines in the triangle below Chambers Street, September Wines on the Lower East Side and Pasanella & Son near South Street Seaport, but shops devoted to single specialties, like Chilean wines at Puro on Grand Street, Spanish wines at Tinto Fino in the East Village, Italian wines at Enoteca Di Palo in Little Italy and California wines at California Wine Merchants in the financial district.
 The proprietors of these shops believe it's crucial to alleviate the anxiety of selecting a bottle. Lily Peachin, who opened Dandelion Wine in Greenpoint almost two years ago, called upon her years working as a bartender to help avoid the sterile atmosphere she finds in too many shops. At Dandelion, she went after a lived-in look, adding art and antiques, and placing a few barstools on the worn, crooked floor.
 ''I wanted to be kind of a non-wine shop wine shop,'' she said. ''There's soul here. You can tell good times have been had in the shop. You get that in restaurants and bars, but a lot of wine stores lack that.''
 It is important for her that her customers feel relaxed as they browse. As a bartender, she knew her customers' names and what they drank, and the value of the buyback in inspiring loyalty. She hopes to create the same relationship with her customers at Dandelion. 
 Of course, decor rarely matters to the committed or even the novice wine drinker if the wines are not inspiring. Ms. Peachin offers some excellent selections at a price range she tries to keep low in deference to her neighborhood. She has terrific lambruscos from Lini and good California gamays from Edmunds St. John, and for the adventurous, Cheville de Fer from Les Vins Conte, a fine, funky cot, or malbec, from the Loire Valley.
 Like almost all these shops, Dandelion emphasizes small producers rather than big brand names. It's a little less mainstream than Table Wine in Jackson Heights, where the guiding principle is simple: every meal can be enhanced by a bottle of wine. And Dandelion is not so esoteric as Thirst Wine in Fort Greene, which sells only bottles that fit the philosophy of what it calls ''slow wines,'' made as naturally as possible.
 None of these shops would dream of selling, say, Yellow Tail, the Australian mega-brand that has come to represent the sort of soulless mass-production bottles that people who care about wine are unlikely to find interesting.
 ''Our store is based on old-school human dialogue and developing trust,'' said Jonathan Walton, who works at Thirst in Fort Greene. ''If someone asks for Yellow Tail, we're not judgmental about it. We ask which one they're looking for and offer a few other options.''
 Those options might include a few small French producers in the Rhone Valley or Languedoc. Michael Yarmark and Emilia Valencia, the couple who own Thirst, were inspired by Kermit Lynch Wine Merchant, the retail shop in Berkeley, Calif. The owner, Kermit Lynch, is the pioneering importer who specializes in small, independent French producers, and Thirst carries many of Mr. Lynch's selections.
 Like the record stores of yore, most of these shops treasure their independence, both in terms of tastes and in their distance from the large mass-market distributors. Almost all, for example, refuse to post shelf-talkers, those little marketing aides supplied by distributors that include a score and a blurb from some nationally known critic. Instead, they write their own. They are fiercely partial to their own taste while recognizing the realities of a difficult economy and the spectrum of public tastes. And, all things being equal, their sympathy for the underdog is palpable.
 ''I like to buy wine from people who actually grow the fruit and make and bottle the wine,'' said Paul Huston, an owner of Hunter's Point Wines and Spirits in Long Island City. ''Over 90 percent of the stuff in here is actually grown by the people whose name is on the label.''
 Mr. Huston, a restaurant veteran whose resume as wine director includes Scalini Fedeli and the not-to-be-forgotten Arcadia, opened his shop in late 2006. While he recognizes that the public craves cheap wines, he has been unwilling to curtail a more ambitious vision. His front room is tightly packed with excellent inexpensive selections, but in the expansive rear of the shop he sells far more, including older vintages from France, California and Italy.
 ''Right now the lower end is crucial,'' he said. ''But if they don't see that we really know what we're talking about, that we offer a depth of vintages and a wild selection of spirits, then we can't compete.''
 Christy Frank, who opened Frankly Wines just over two years ago on West Broadway in Manhattan, was more interested in coexistence than competition. Just a few blocks away are well-established shops, including Tribeca Wine Merchants and one of the city's leading stores, Chambers Street Wines. 
 Ms. Frank, who left her job with a wine distributor to spend more time with her husband and children, had visited hundreds of shops and had a precise image of how to fill her 320 square feet.
 ''I wanted a generalist shop, crammed with everything you might find in a good textbook on wine,'' she said. She does not try to outdo Chambers Street in areas in which it excels, like Beaujolais and the Loire. But, textbook in mind, she offers excellent educational packages, like a case of wines that illustrate the different meanings of the term ''dry.''
 ''We listen and ask questions, like, 'Do you mean creamy, buttery dry or grapefruit dry,' '' she said. ''We take the time to help them understand what they really want so they can ask more definitively.''
 Small shops like Ms. Frank's are built on customer service, with the aim of encouraging return visits and, ultimately, building a cherished corps of regulars. This requires not just tolerance but an eagerness to discuss any aspect of wine, approached from any angle.
 ''I don't consider any question stupid,'' said Mr. Beavers of Alphabet City. ''The anxiety of walking into a wine shop is uncalled for.''
 Wine is, after all, about the pleasure it offers. Sometimes, it's in the glass you've poured for yourself, but as any host will tell you, more often it's what you have poured for your guests.
 ''What I find most fulfilling is not the big dollar sale but watching the incremental jumps that customers make as they elevate their interest,'' said Mr. Huston of Hunter's Point. ''Sometimes you can make a small difference in somebody's evening with the right bottle. I have no loftier ambition.''

HEADLINE: Europe Lets Google Sell Brand Advertising

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
PARIS -- The European Union's highest court on Tuesday gave Google broad latitude to sell advertising spots to rivals of trademarked brands when users do searches for names like Louis Vuitton. But it also said that the search engine might have to do more to protect brand owners from infringements.
 In a case brought by the luxury goods company LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the European Court of Justice said Google should not be required to block sales of brand names as advertising keywords. However, the judges said advertisers, or Google, could be liable for trademark violations in individual cases. 
 The case, based in Luxembourg, focused on the inner workings of Google's AdWords system, a business that provides the vast majority of the company's more than $23 billion in revenue. The system displays ''sponsored links'' when a user types a search term into Google. Google has faced similar lawsuits in the United States, but some have been settled and no clear precedents have been established.
 Lawyers said the court's decision could allow Google to liberalize its policy on the sale of trademarks as keywords in France and various other European countries where the company currently restricts the practice after adverse rulings in national courts. That would put those countries closer into line with Google's policies in Britain and the United States, where it allows rival marketers to bid on other companies' brand names.
 ''The big message for brand owners is they haven't got any choice but to keep doing what they've been doing, which is to police this and inform Google when something has been done wrong,'' said Jason Rawkins, a partner at the law firm of Taylor Wessing in London.
 But rather than ending the matter, the decision could give rise to a spate of new lawsuits, Mr. Rawkins and other lawyers said.
 The decision says Google is generally not liable for trademark infringement if it removes ads when brand owners complain that those trademarks have been violated by advertisers. But individual advertisers could be held liable if their ads are found to mislead consumers, the court said.
 Google could also be liable if its business practices were found to encourage trademark violations, the court ruled. For example, critics of Google's practice have complained about one of the company's services, which suggests potential keywords to advertisers, including terms like ''imitation handbags,'' which brand owners say encourage the sale of counterfeit goods.
 The European Court said national courts in the 27 member states of the European Union should decide on such cases.
 ''Advertisers using the service will now need to tread very carefully indeed,'' said Mark Blair, a partner at Marks & Clerk Solicitors in London. ''Today's ruling may to an extent ring-fence Google from claims by brand owners, but it will not close the door on future litigation in this area.''
 Google says selling branded keywords to competitors helps consumers, as when they are looking for product reviews or secondhand items on the Internet. It said the court had broadly endorsed its view.
 ''Our guiding principle has always been that advertising should benefit users, and our aim is to ensure that ads are relevant and useful,'' Google said. ''We will study the decision as we move forward in order to make sure that we continue to deliver advertising that is perceived as both valuable and relevant by our users.''
 But LVMH claimed victory, too, saying the court had strengthened the rights of brand owners online.
 ''This long-awaited decision will be welcomed by the business community as well as by consumers,'' LVMH said in a statement. ''It confirms and emphasizes the critical role played by trademarks in a dynamic economy to protect innovation and the investments carried out by businesses, and will avoid confusion on behalf of consumers as to the quality of the products and services they are buying.''
 Guy Salter, a spokesman for trade groups representing luxury goods companies in Italy, Spain, France and Britain, called the decision a ''victory for common sense.'' The decision ''upholds the logical conclusion that ownership of a brand name is the same no matter whether this is online or offline,'' he said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Want to Use My Suit? Then Throw Me Something, Mister

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- Just after dusk on Friday night, Tyrone Yancy was strutting through one of the more uncertain parts of town in a $6,000 custom-made suit. 
 He was concerned about being robbed, but not by the neighborhood teenagers who trotted out in the street to join him. The real potential for theft, as Mr. Yancy sees it, came from the strangers darting around him and his well-appointed colleagues in a hectic orbit: photographers.
 Mr. Yancy, 44, is a nursing assistant by profession. His calling, however, is as one of the Mardi Gras Indians -- a member of the Yellow Pocahontas tribe, to be exact -- the largely working-class black New Orleanians who create and wear ornate, enormous feathered costumes and come out three times a year to show them off. 
 He is also one of a number of Indians who have become fed up with seeing their photographs on calendars, posters and expensive prints, without getting anything in return.
 Knowing that there are few legal protections for a person who is photographed in public -- particularly one who stops and poses every few feet -- some Mardi Gras Indians have begun filing for copyright protection for their suits, which account for thousands of dollars in glass beads, rhinestones, feathers and velvet, and hundreds of hours of late-night sewing. 
 Anyone could still take their pictures, but the Indians, many of whom live at the economic margins, would have some recourse if they saw the pictures being sold, or used in advertising. (News photographs, like the ones illustrating this article, are not at issue.)
 ''It's not the old way of doing things, but the old way of doing things was conducive to exploitation,'' said Ashlye M. Keaton, a lawyer who represents Indians in her private practice and also works with them through two pro bono legal programs, Sweet Home New Orleans legal services, and the Entertainment Law Legal Assistance Project.
 The legal grounding of the strategy is debatable, the ability to enforce it even more so. But what may be most tricky of all is pushing the Indians themselves to start thinking about the legal and financial dimensions of something they have always done out of tradition.
 Mardi Gras Indians have been around for more than a century -- more than two, some say -- and are generally thought to have originated as a way to pay homage to the American Indians who harbored runaway slaves and started families with them. 
 The Indians come out and parade in full dress on Mardi Gras; on St. Joseph's Night, March 19; and on a Sunday close to St. Joseph's -- a tradition that arose out of the affinity between blacks and Sicilians in the city's working-class precincts.
 The 30 or so Indian tribes are representatives of their neighborhoods, and starting from home turf they venture out in their shimmering suits to meet other tribes on procession in the streets. Time was, these run-ins would often end with somebody in the hospital, or worse. 
 But over the past few decades, encouraged by the legendary Chief of Chiefs, Tootie Montana, the showdowns became primarily about the suits, and whose suit could out-prettify all the others.
 Indian suits, which in the old days were occasionally burned at the end of a season, have become stunningly elaborate and stunningly expensive, costing upwards of $10,000. For many Indians, it is a matter of principle that they make a new suit from scratch each year. 
 The copyright idea has been floating around for a while -- several of Mr. Montana's suits were registered years ago -- but Ms. Keaton began pursuing it more vigorously in 2006, when she was approached by John Ellison, a 52-year-old detailer in an auto body shop and a member of the Wild Tchoupitoulas. 
 Any photograph that focused on a suit protected by a copyright could arguably be considered a derivative work. The sale of such a picture (or its use in tourism ads, for example) would be on the merits of the suit rather than the photograph itself, and if the person selling it did not have permission, he could be sued. 
 But the idea is not so easy to put into practice. In American copyright law, clothing designs generally cannot be protected because they are more functional than aesthetic. Ms. Keaton argues that the suits, which can weigh well over 100 pounds, should be considered works of sculpture, not outfits.
 The Sweet Home organization held a workshop for Indians on the topic last fall, and is pressing them to fill out copyright forms for this year's suits. But there has not yet been a test case for the legal theory and it is unclear how one would fare.
 ''The Mardi Gras Indian costumes are pretty wild and not functional in the ordinary sense of the word, so that suggests that they might be copyrightable,'' Kal Raustiala, a professor at the law school of the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote in an e-mail message.
 ''That said,'' he added, ''lots of runway fashion is also way out there and not likely to fit anyone's ordinary idea of usefulness, yet it doesn't receive copyright protection.''
 Mr. Ellison filled out his copyright registration form on the spot, but later lost it, a testament to the difficulties of changing a culture.
 Christopher Porche West, who has been photographing Mardi Gras Indians since 1979, said he had heard these kinds of complaints for years. They are counterproductive, he said, given the relatively small amount of money he and other photographers earn from Indian portraits.
 ''What they really need to do is self-exploit,'' he said. If they want to make money from their culture, he said, ''they should find a way to commodify it and bring that to the market.''
 But words like ''commodify'' are foreign and even a little distasteful for many in this city, rather like finding tofu sausage in a gumbo. Indians do make a few hundred dollars here and there showing up at parties and concerts, and a few have tried, with disappointing results, to sell last year's suits on eBay. 
 ''Indian culture was never, ever meant to make any money,'' said Howard Miller, Big Chief of the Creole Wild West, the city's oldest tribe, and president of the Mardi Gras Indian Council. But neither should the culture be exploited by others. 
 ''We have a beef,'' he said, ''with anybody who takes us for granted.''

HEADLINE: In a Switch, Manhattan Lost People, Census Says

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Manhattan reversed a decade-long streak of population gains and lost residents last year, even as New York City and its metropolitan area lost fewer people to other places than at any time since at least 1990, according to census estimates released on Tuesday. 
 The population of Manhattan, which had grown by nearly 90,000 since 2000, dropped by about 2,500, according to the estimate, which is based on calculations as of July 1, 2009. While that drop is tiny, it contrasts with annual gains that peaked at 15,000 in the middle of the decade. 
 The biggest factor in the population change for Manhattan from mid-2008 was the disparity between the number of people who left the borough and the number who moved in from elsewhere in the country. The net loss of 22,000, which demographers attributed primarily to the recession and the financial crisis on Wall Street, was the biggest such disparity since 2002, when its size was attributed to the Sept. 11 terror attack. 
 ''Obviously the financial sector is hurting and not drawing the people in that it used to,'' said Andrew A. Beveridge, a Queens College sociologist who tracks demographic trends.
 As for metropolitan New York over all, about 110,000 more people moved out last year than moved in from elsewhere in the United States, according to the estimate, which is made on the basis of projected growth rates since the 2000 census.
 Only two years earlier, the loss was twice as high, and in the middle of the decade it approached 300,000 annually. In New York City, the loss was 77,000 last year compared with 171,000 in 2005. 
 The shrinking migration deficit reflected several factors. The city is considered a more attractive place to live, and fewer retirees may be leaving it because they delayed retirement after the recession took a toll on their savings or they were unable to sell their homes.
 The city registered a net gain of 57,000 immigrants from abroad, down from the decade's peak of 94,000 from 2000 to 2001. The decline mirrored a national trend.
 In Queens, for the first time this decade, more people moved in -- either from elsewhere in the country or from abroad -- than moved out. 
 New York City's population grew by 45,000 people from 2008 to 2009, a 23 percent increase in growth over the previous year and the third highest annual increase in the decade. The survey put the city's population on July 1 at 8,391,881.
 The latest estimates are a prelude to the 2010 census, which city officials expect to show a record population of 8.4 million. (As of this week, though, only 5 percent of city residents had returned their census questionnaires, which are due April 1.)
 From 2000 to 2009, the city's population grew by 384,000, or 4.8 percent. The city usually accounts for about two-thirds of the state's population growth.

HEADLINE: Health Care Overhaul Becomes the Law of the Land: In the Process, Pushing Back At Inequality

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT; E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
For all the political and economic uncertainties about health reform, at least one thing seems clear: The bill that President Obama signed on Tuesday is the federal government's biggest attack on economic inequality since inequality began rising more than three decades ago.
 Over most of that period, government policy and market forces have been moving in the same direction, both increasing inequality. The pretax incomes of the wealthy have soared since the late 1970s, while their tax rates have fallen more than rates for the middle class and poor. 
 Nearly every major aspect of the health bill pushes in the other direction. This fact helps explain why Mr. Obama was willing to spend so much political capital on the issue, even though it did not appear to be his top priority as a presidential candidate. Beyond the health reform's effect on the medical system, it is the centerpiece of his deliberate effort to end what historians havecalled the age of Reagan.
 Speaking to an ebullient audience of Democratic legislators and White House aides at the bill-signing ceremony on Tuesday, Mr. Obama claimed that health reform would ''mark a new season in America.'' He added, ''We have now just enshrined, as soon as I sign this bill, the core principle that everybody should have some basic security when it comes to their health care.'' 
 The bill is the most sweeping piece of federal legislation since Medicare was passed in 1965. It aims to smooth out one of the roughest edges in American society -- the inability of many people to afford medical care after they lose a job or get sick. And it would do so in large measure by taxing the rich.
 A big chunk of the money to pay for the bill comes from lifting payroll taxes on households making more than $250,000. On average, the annual tax bill for households making more than $1 million a year will rise by $46,000 in 2013, according to the Tax Policy Center, a Washington research group. Another major piece of financing would cut Medicare subsidies for private insurers, ultimately affecting their executives and shareholders. 
 The benefits, meanwhile, flow mostly to households making less than four times the poverty level -- $88,200 for a family of four people. Those without insurance in this group will become eligible to receive subsidies or to join Medicaid. (Many of the poor are already covered by Medicaid.) Insurance costs are also likely to drop for higher-income workers at small companies.
 Finally, the bill will also reduce a different kind of inequality. In the broadest sense, insurance is meant to spread the costs of an individual's misfortune -- illness, death, fire, flood -- across society. Since the late 1970s, though, the share of Americans with health insurance has shrunk. As a result, the gap between the economic well-being of the sick and the healthy has been growing, at virtually every level of the income distribution.
 The health reform bill will reverse that trend. By 2019, 95 percent of people are projected to be covered, up from 85 percent today (and about 90 percent in the late 1970s). Even affluent families ineligible for subsidies will benefit if they lose their insurance, by being able to buy a plan that can no longer charge more for pre-existing conditions. In effect, healthy families will be picking up most of the bill -- and their insurance will be somewhat more expensive than it otherwise would have been.
 Much about health reform remains unknown. Maybe it will deliver Congress to the Republicans this fall, or maybe it will help the Democrats keep power. Maybe the bill's attempts to hold down the recent growth of medical costs will prove a big success, or maybe the results will be modest and inadequate. But the ways in which the bill attacks the inequality of the Reagan era -- whether you love them or hate them -- will probably be around for a long time.
 ''Legislative majorities come and go,'' David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, lamented on Sunday. ''This health care bill is forever.''
 Since Mr. Obama began his presidential campaign in 2007, he has had a complicated relationship with the Reagan legacy. He has been more willing than many other Democrats to praisePresident Reagan. ''Reagan's central insight -- that the liberal welfare state had grown complacent and overly bureaucratic,'' Mr. Obama wrote in his second book, ''contained a good deal of truth.'' Most notably, he praised Mr. Reagan as a president who ''changed the trajectory of America.''
 But Mr. Obama also argued that the Reagan administration had gone too far, and that if elected, he would try to put the country on a new trajectory. ''The project of the next president,'' he said in an interview during the campaign, ''is figuring out how you create bottom-up economic growth, as opposed to the trickle-down economic growth.''
 Since 1980, median real household income has risen less than 15 percent. The only period of strong middle-class income growth during this time came in the mid- and late 1990s, which by coincidence was also the one time when taxes on the affluent were rising. 
 For most of the last three decades, tax rates for the wealthy have been falling, while their pretax pay has been rising rapidly. Real incomes at the 99.99th percentile have jumped more than 300 percent since 1980. At the 99th percentile -- about $300,000 today -- real pay has roughly doubled.
 The laissez-faire revolution that Mr. Reagan started did not cause these trends. But its policies -- tax cuts, light regulation, a patchwork safety net -- have contributed to them.
 Health reform hardly solves all of the American economy's problems. Economic growth over the last decade was slower than in any decade since World War II. The tax cuts of the last 30 years, the two current wars, the Great Recession, the stimulus program and the looming retirement of the baby boomers have created huge deficits. Educational gains have slowed, and the planet is getting hotter.
 Above all, the central question that both the Reagan and Obama administrations have tried to answer -- what is the proper balance between the market and the government? -- remains unresolved. But the bill signed on Tuesday certainly shifts our place on that spectrum. 
 Before he became Mr. Obama's top economic adviser, Lawrence Summers told me a story about helping his daughter study for her Advanced Placement exam in American history. While doing so, Mr. Summers realized that the federal government had not passed major social legislation in decades. There was the frenzy of the New Deal, followed by the G.I. Bill, the Interstate Highway System, civil rights and Medicare -- and then nothing worth its own section in the history books. 
 Now there is.

HEADLINE: Under Pressure, the White House Ponders How to Remake Fannie and Freddie

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Despite growing pressure from Congress to act quickly, the Obama administration is moving tentatively to develop a plan to reshape Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage-finance companies taken over by the government 18 months ago. 
 On April 15, the Treasury Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development will publish a list of questions seeking comment on the appropriate role of the government in housing finance, as well as the design of mortgage products and protections for consumers who use them. 
 The government has so far spent $126 billion bailing out Fannie and Freddie. Republican criticism over the absence of a plan for the institutions escalated when the White House released a budget in January that said only that the administration ''continues to monitor the situation.'' 
 Appearing before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, said the administration would ''take a fresh, cold, hard look at the core problems'' in housing finance and deliver a ''comprehensive set of reforms'' to Congress, but declined to specify a timetable. 
 The lack of specifics frustrated several lawmakers, one of whom, Representative Bill Posey, Republican of Florida, lashed out at Mr. Geithner, saying, ''We can't wait forever to find out.'' 
 Representative Spencer T. Bachus of Alabama, the top Republican on the committee, told Mr. Geithner, ''Without reform, the bailouts will not stop, the housing market will not find its footing, and the American economy will not recover.''
 Democrats, led by the committee's chairman, Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, said the process could not be rushed. ''You can't really tear down the old jail until you've built the new one,'' he said.
 Mr. Geithner suggested that the administration was waiting for the economy to stabilize before deciding on a plan. Fannie and Freddie back most of the nation's home loans and are managing the administration's $75 billion loan-modification program. 
 Next week, the Federal Reserve plans to complete a $1.25 trillion program to buy mortgage-backed securities, a major test of the recovery's staying power. If mortgage rates were to quickly rise afterward, the Fed might have to step back in. 
 ''I don't think there is a credible argument that we can abolish, put out of existence, these institutions today,'' Mr. Geithner said. 
 Mr. Geithner said that Fannie and Freddie did ''remarkably well'' in sustaining the secondary mortgage market for much of their history until the late 1990s, when they began to take on excessive risks and allow erosion in underwriting standards. 
 Mr. Geithner vowed in his written remarks that whatever form the overhaul takes, Fannie and Freddie would change. 
 ''Private gains will no longer be subsidized by public losses, capital and underwriting standards will be appropriate, consumer protection will be strengthened and excessive risk-taking will be restrained,'' he said. 
 Asked whether the government should play a continuing role in guaranteeing mortgages, Mr. Geithner told Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, that it was ''the central, existential question.'' 
 He added: ''There is a quite strong economic case, a quite strong public policy case, for preserving and designing, some form of guarantee by the government to help facilitate a stable housing finance market. But it can't be the one we have today.'' 
 Models for government support of housing finance in other countries ''can provide useful insights and examples to consider,'' Mr. Geithner said. Several countries have entities like Fannie and Freddie that guarantee and hold mortgages, though none on the scale of the United States. Elsewhere, governments underwrite mortgage insurance. 
 Not every wealthy country uses loan securitization to finance housing; some countries in Europe use so-called covered bonds, debt securities that remain on the issuer's balance sheet. 
 Mr. Geithner ruled out nationalizing Fannie and Freddie or creating several entities to compete with them. But he said it was worth considering privatizing the two with limited government guarantees for some of their loans. 
 He also mentioned a public utility model, in which the entities would guarantee mortgages without maintaining investment portfolios, thereby limiting the systemic risk they would pose. Mr. Geithner's predecessor, Henry M. Paulson Jr., had endorsed that model. 
 Other witnesses proposed a variety of solutions. Michael D. Berman, chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association, urged that the government guarantee mortgage-backed securities, but not the regulated entities that would issue them. 
 Vince Malta, a vice president for the National Association of Realtors, suggested that Fannie and Freddie be converted into government-chartered nonprofit entities that would be required to place any excess revenues into a reserve fund. 
 And Robert E. Dewitt, testifying for the National Multi Housing Council and the National Apartment Association, which represent the rental housing industry, called for ''a balanced housing policy that doesn't measure success solely by how much home ownership there is.''

HEADLINE: The Politics of the Health Overhaul

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Democrats Rejoice,'' by David Brooks (column, March 23):
 Mr. Brooks is right. The Democrats should proudly rejoice after their success in passing the health care reform bill. Congratulations to President Obama and his team for standing by what they believed to be right and necessary.
 The Republicans, on the other hand, should hang their heads in shame that they could not muster enough common sense to contribute to the most important piece of social legislation of this generation. 
 It is incredible that national health care reform has taken so long and been fought so bitterly. When the health care reform bill finally passed, I was reminded of a comment attributed to Winston Churchill: ''You can always count on Americans to do the right thing, after they've exhausted all the alternatives.''
 So Mr. Brooks may admire the energy of the people and the vibrancy of the marketplace. Good for him; I do, too. But people are even more energetic and the market they create is even more vibrant when they are in good health. Like other nations, we should recognize that health care is an investment in people, not in a market.
 Bill O'Reilly Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. March 23, 2010
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks bemoans runaway spending and questions the Democrats' ability to constrain it. But wasn't it the last Democratic president who put us on a path toward balanced budgets? And the last Republican president, working much of the time with a Republican-controlled Congress, who exploded the deficit and debt?
 Mr. Brooks notes that the health care bill ''feels like the end of something.'' Maybe that's true for those who take excellent insurance plans for granted, but for many Americans this is a major step toward the most fundamental form of equality: equal access to quality health care.
 Mr. Brooks is right to praise America's history of entrepreneurial freedom. Maybe now more Americans will take such capitalistic risks, knowing that they can take health insurance with them.
 Bill Dawers Savannah, Ga., March 23, 2010
 To the Editor:
 The passing of the health care bill is neither a softhearted, softheaded ''gift of charity,'' nor the end of the liberal agenda, as David Brooks suggests, but a solid and rational basis for a new beginning.
 For too long, Americans have been drunk and in denial on the magic elixir called the free marketplace. The real costs of health care were deflected by denying insurance coverage for many of the sick and the dying. As a society, we looked the other way.
 Now, by outlawing such strategies, we will have to face the true costs of health care, which will probably go up, as Mr. Brooks notes. Instead of strangling us, as Mr. Brooks contends, this will stimulate the needed reforms for economic and health care efficiencies that were avoided for so long in our fog of denial. As they say in treatment of alcoholism, the first step is admitting the need for help.
 Larry Deblinger Nyack, N.Y., March 23, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Every American should read and take to heart Bob Herbert's column ''An Absence of Class'' (March 23). The recent displays of hatred, incivility, racism and homophobia directed at supporters of the recently enacted health care bill strike at the heart of this nation's core values.
 Whether you support or oppose the details of the health care bill, what possibly justifies the venomous comments spewed from the mouths of protesters and their political leaders, knowing that the intent of the bill is simply to protect the health of all Americans?
 Robert C. Gottlieb New York, March 23, 2010
 To the Editor:
 The March 23 columns ''An Absence of Class,'' by Bob Herbert, and ''The Democrats Rejoice,'' by David Brooks, were a study in contrast.
 Mr. Herbert rightly denounced the recent shameful and despicable conduct of Republicans and the Tea Partiers as the vote for the health care bill approached. Mr. Brooks, instead, attempted to make the case that Republicans were responsible for the economic vigor of our nation.
 While many of those who owned the railroads and steel mills were doubtless Republican, it was the average Democratic laborer who drove the spikes to lay the rails and worked the mills.
 Lewis J. Hardee Jr. New York, March 23, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Health care reform was needed for two very important reasons: to insure millions of Americans currently without health insurance and to control ruinous cost escalations.
 Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, showed convincingly in ''The Real Arithmetic of Health Care Reform'' (Op-Ed, March 21) why claims that the new bill will lower the federal deficit are smoke and mirrors and not to be believed, and why that was not reflected in the C.B.O.'s recent evaluation of the costs of the bill.
 In ''Fear Strikes Out'' (column, March 22), Paul Krugman does not address the limitations of the C.B.O.'s report. But he does cite the health reform instituted in Massachusetts by Mitt Romney as a model for the bill passed by Congress.
 It has been widely reported that skyrocketing costs make the Massachusetts plan's continuation unsustainable in its present form. Mr. Krugman's cavalier pronouncements have increased my fear that the debt burden our country will shoulder under the new health programs will ruin us.

HEADLINE: Dozen Council Members Form a Bloc for Liberals

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Frustrated by what they say are plutocratic policies that have squeezed the neediest New Yorkers, the City Council's most liberal members are establishing a new bloc to champion a progressive agenda on housing, economic development, labor and civil rights issues.
 The new group, called the Progressive Caucus, is starting with a membership of 12, who are all Democrats, or almost one-quarter of the 51-member body. A formal announcement will be made at the Council's meeting on Thursday, said the two leaders, Councilman Brad Lander, a freshman member from Brooklyn, and Councilwoman Melissa Mark-Viverito of Manhattan, who is in her second term. 
 The creation of the group, which includes seven members just elected in November, is meant to send a message to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, its organizers said.
 ''The mayor has done some good things -- on the environment, on gun control,'' Ms. Mark-Viverito said. ''But there are some other issues where he hasn't done a good job, and he's lost sight of the poor, working class and middle class. So yes, this is a response because we don't feel the city is going in the same direction as the majority wants.''
 The caucus will be the first in recent memory to coalesce around ideology rather than racial or sexual identity, according to Council members. And by voting yes or no as a bloc, the caucus could establish a liberal litmus test for all Council members that could be easily tracked by future Democratic primary voters, who tend to skew left.
 The group also demonstrates the clout of the labor-backed Working Families Party, which supported most of the members. 
 In addition to the two leaders, the members are Annabel Palma, from the Bronx; Letitia James and Jumaane D. Williams, from Brooklyn; Margaret Chin, Rosie Mendez and Ydanis Rodriguez, from Manhattan; Daniel Dromm, Julissa Ferreras and James G. Van Bramer, from Queens; and Deborah Rose, from Staten Island.
 In an interview on Monday at Ms. Chin's office in Chinatown, the members said that their distaste with Mr. Bloomberg's successful push to rewrite term limits helped motivate them to organize. But more important, they said, was a desire to form a strategic alliance to accomplish their goals.
 The caucus is now working on a set of by-laws. But the group has already drawn up what it calls a statement of principles. These include creating an economic policy that puts a focus on living-wage jobs and paid sick days, strengthening rent regulations, pushing for more housing for the poor, emphasizing police accountability and community input in criminal justice, supporting same-sex marriage and pushing for more accountability in budgeting and contracts.
 ''This is not necessarily antagonistic toward the speaker,'' Mr. Lander said. ''But of course the goal is to raise these issues so leadership pays real attention.''
 When asked about the new caucus, a spokesman for the mayor, Stu Loeser, said: ''One reason Mike Bloomberg has been able to get so much done is he doesn't think that disagreeing with someone on one issue means you can't work closely with them on others. 
 ''We look forward to working with this new caucus on priorities we share, like the nation's biggest affordable housing program and the furthest-reaching sustainability program at any level of government anywhere.''
 Ms. Quinn, meanwhile, said in an interview that she did not view the caucus ''as a threat.'' By contrast, she said she anticipated agreeing with caucus members a vast majority of the time. 
 ''I am a progressive,'' Ms. Quinn said, ''and I have an incredibly long record as a progressive I am extremely proud of.''
 She later added: ''I support any and all efforts or movements to help members become more effective, and get more done. That's not a challenge to me; that's exciting to me.''
 But when asked about term limits being a factor in the group's formation, Ms. Quinn, who helped Mr. Bloomberg amend the term limits law, said: ''That's an issue that was dealt with in the last session. I assume that the caucus will focus on the issues of this session.''
 It is too early to tell whether other Council members will join, or whether some may react adversely. Indeed, caucus members say it is possible that centrist Democrats and the Council's five Republicans could form their own caucus.
 That kind of internal dynamism may turn out to be good for the Council, and even for Ms. Quinn, especially if she runs for mayor in 2013 and needs to tend to the liberal base of her party, said Kenneth Sherrill, a political scientist at Hunter College.
 ''If they stay cohesive, then they could become a party within a party,'' Professor Sherrill said. ''And for something as touchy as budget negotiations, they could be a strong organizational force. It's certainly something that's designed to get her attention, and that may be something that she welcomes.''

HEADLINE: Pakistan's War of Choice

BYLINE: By MICHAEL E. O'HANLON. 
Michael E. O'Hanlon is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

DATELINE: Peshawar, Pakistan 

 BODY:
 WHAT are Americans to make of all the good news coming out of Pakistan in recent weeks? 
 First, the Afghan Taliban's military chief, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, was arrested in a raid in February. Around the same time, several of the Taliban's ''shadow governors'' who operate out of Pakistan were captured by Pakistani forces. Last week, the C.I.A. director, Leon Panetta, announced that thanks in large part to increased cooperation from Pakistan, drone strikes along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border are ''seriously disrupting Al Qaeda,'' and one killed the terrorist suspected of planning an attack on an American base in December that caused the deaths of seven Americans. Meanwhile, Pakistan has mounted major operations against its own extremists in places ranging from the Swat Valley in the north of the country to Bajaur on the Afghan border to South Waziristan further south. Yes, extremists continue to do great damage, as at Lahore on March 14 when about 40 civilians were killed in bombings. But after traveling across the country in recent days as a guest of the Pakistani military, I was convinced that Pakistan has become much more committed to battling extremists over the last couple of years, as the country felt its own security directly threatened. 
 Things are complicated, as always in this fractious land. Pakistan's resolve is clearest against its own internal enemies. And while its will to pursue the Afghan Taliban has grown, its policies are changing incrementally, not fundamentally. It is rebuilding trust with America only slowly. And its obsession with India will continue to constrain its ability and willingness to act against the groups that threaten the NATO mission across the Afghan border. 
 First, though, give credit where credit is due. Pakistan has become deadly serious about its own insurgency, loosely referred to as the Tehrik-i-Taliban. Total Pakistani troops in the North-West Frontier Province, Baluchistan and the tribal areas now number about 150,000, up from 50,000 in 2001. In addition, there are 90,000 paramilitary troops of the Frontier Corps in the area, and they are far better equipped, paid and led than in years past. 
 As I toured the nerve center of the Pakistani military in Rawalpindi, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, the army's spokesman, recited an impressive list of statistics. The army now has 821 posts on the Afghan-Pakistan border, as opposed to just 112 manned by NATO and Afghan forces on the other side. Pakistan carried out 209 operations in 2009 of brigade size or larger (that is, involving at least 3,000 troops), twice as many as in the previous two years combined. Convoys bringing supplies for the NATO mission in Afghanistan used to be preyed on frequently by terrorists and thieves; but as a result of the improved security, NATO is now losing only about 0.1 percent of the goods it ships across Pakistan. 
 Carrying out all these operations has been very costly, though. The Pakistani military says it had some 800 soldiers killed in operations last year, in contrast with NATO's total losses in Afghanistan of 520. Thousands of Pakistanis have lost their lives in terrorist attacks, and several hundred village elders, critical figures in any efforts to pacify the tribal areas, have been killed as well.
 Most Pakistanis feel, with some justification, they have suffered all this as the result of American decisions and interests. Pakistan didn't experience suicide bombings until the overthrow of the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001. Pakistanis do not begrudge us that act of self-defense, but do expect us to appreciate the sacrifices they have made. And, while Pakistanis acknowledge American economic help, they consider the $17 billion or so that we have provided since 9/11 to equal only about half their total costs, direct and indirect, from the war on terrorism. 
 Still, Pakistan is hitting the terrorists hard. As a top commander of the Frontier Corps told me from his centuries-old fort here in Peshawar, since 2007 or 2008 he has known that there has been ''no turning back.'' This means ensuring that militants -- or ''miscreants,'' as Pakistanis like to say -- do not return to those areas that have been cleared in recent months.
 This won't be easy. Often, Pakistani military tactics amount to notifying the local population of a pending mission and asking people to leave before the assault. Afterward, the population is allowed to return -- but any extremists who had snuck out with the people can then try to sneak back in with them. 
 Pakistan also doesn't want to fight over too much of its territory at any one time. The other day I visited a camp for the displaced near here, with about 100,000 residents. Most fled from recent military operations in Bajaur and Khyber, near the Afghanistan border. Fortunately, the camp's previous residents, from Swat, were able to go home before the new influx. Conditions at the camp are tough but tolerable, partly because Pakistan has not launched additional operations recently. Islamabad's deliberateness makes Washington impatient at times, but there is a strategic logic to it.
 In the near term, any progress will be fitful. Pakistan seems unwilling to move much more of its army away from the Indian border, meaning a further delay before operations commence in North Waziristan -- home to the Haqqani network, a radical group headed by the Taliban commander Maulavi Jalaluddin Haqqani, which is believed to be behind some of the largest attacks in recent years. 
 I did not meet any Pakistanis who actually seemed to wish to see the Afghan Taliban back in power. But the country simply does not have the military capacity to make major moves against the Afghan fundamentalists. And, less understandably, Pakistanis tend to see Indian conspiracies behind what is happening in Afghanistan, and fear being trapped between their longtime nemesis on one side and an Indian puppet on the other. 
 At the headquarters of the Pakistani spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate, I was told that India was suspected of providing explosives to Tehrik-i-Taliban extremists through Afghanistan. Many Pakistanis claim that the Afghan government of Hamid Karzai is essentially a reincarnation of the old Northern Alliance from the Afghan civil war -- a union largely made up of ethnic Tajiks and Uzbeks and partly financed by India. (This despite the fact that Afghanistan's ministers of defense and interior are Pashtun, as is President Karzai.)Pakistanis wonder why India is building so many consulates in Afghanistan, and even Indian-subsidized health clinics are considered suspicious. 
 As he departed for a ''strategic dialogue'' this week in Washington, Pakistan's foreign minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, announced that ''it's time for the United States to do more.'' This isn't what America wants to hear from an oft-unreliable ally. But we must bear in mind that the Pakistani government rules one of the most anti-American populations in the world, and even its elites see us as oft-unreliable ourselves. Washington must stay realistic, and patient, about what can be expected of Pakistan.

HEADLINE: Manhattan Isn't Built for Speed, And Wednesdays Are the Worst

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
If you are thinking of driving in Manhattan on a Wednesday, perhaps to take in a Broadway matinee, think again: it is the most congested day of the week.
 Pretty much all of November is a slog, too. And when the United Nations is in session in September? Forget it. 
 Rainfall, parades and motorcades -- they all have their effect on traffic. And when calamity and Wednesdays collide, watch out: July 29, a Wednesday, was among the 25 worst traffic days last year. 
 It happened to include a torrential downpour -- not to mention a visit from Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, who crisscrossed Manhattan on a tour of the city, entourage in tow. 
 Traffic in Manhattan has a rhythm all its own, and, according to a new study by the city, it is not quite the constant gridlock that it seems. 
 Using data from the GPS devices in all New York City cabs, officials tracked the routes of tens of millions of taxi trips over the past two years. The result: a database of speeds and travel routes that can be broken down by minute, month and neighborhood. 
 ''It's like an M.R.I.,'' said Bruce Schaller, a deputy transportation commissioner who supervised the city's study. 
 For traffic planners, the data provides an entirely new resource for targeting their tweaks to the streetscape. Officials are already using the information to help improve traffic patterns along 34th Street. 
 But the trip data also offers a glimpse of the desires and frustrations of New Yorkers moving around their metropolis: where they want to go and the obstacles in their way. 
 To create a day-by-day look at the city's traffic, officials crunched GPS information from nearly every yellow taxi trip taken in Manhattan's business district -- from 60th Street to the Battery -- between November 2008 and October 2009.
 In that 12-month period, weekday traffic in the district moved at an average of 9.5 miles per hour -- about the speed of a farmyard chicken at full gallop.
 Thursday, Nov. 13 was the slowest weekday of the year studied, with an average speed of 7.5 m.p.h. -- about the speed of the typical jogger in Central Park. Excluding holidays, the fastest weekday: Monday, Sept. 28, at a speed of 11.7 m.p.h. 
 The four fastest days to drive in Manhattan, in order of average speed: New Year's Day, Christmas, Memorial Day and July 4. (Thanksgiving Day? Hindered, presumably, by the Macy's parade.) 
 On weekdays, speeds predictably peak between 5 and 6 in the morning (at a jaunty 16 m.p.h.), then decline sharply in the morning rush.
 Not so predictably, speeds then stay low all day, even midday when commuters are at work. Traffic barely improves until the evening rush wanes about 7 p.m., hovering around 9 m.p.h. for much of the day. 
 Officials blame the midday congestion on a high level of commercial deliveries, which can clog side streets and stop up intersections. The data has helped officials as they consider raising daytime street parking rates to ease traffic tangles in Midtown. 
 Traffic in most major cities, Mr. Schaller said, returns to normal between the morning and evening rush. But Manhattan's business district is far bigger and more dense than most. ''Walk around downtown San Francisco at 11 o'clock in the morning and there's not much going on,'' Mr. Schaller said. ''You go to SoHo, and it's really busy.''
 A sweeping thunderstorm rolled through the city on Aug. 19, also among the slowest 25 traffic days in the study period, knocking down trees and generating some of the worst storm damage in decades. On June 18, another congested summer weekday, more than an inch of rain fell.
 In previous eras, city planners had to rely on arbitrary test runs and data from the city's tunnels and bridges to measure traffic. Now, the taxi GPS machines put a vast amount of previously unavailable information at planners' fingertips. ''We've known what goes on along the edge of Manhattan, but we've never known what's inside the beast,'' said Janette Sadik-Khan, the transportation commissioner. 
 According to the data, cars are starting to move faster, partially because of New Yorkers' greater reliance on mass transit and a drop in traffic caused by the recession. From the fall of 2007 to last autumn, cars moved about 13 percent faster on weekdays. In the same period, the number of cars driving into Midtown from north of 60th Street fell to its lowest level in nearly 20 years, a trend that officials attributed to increased mass transit ridership.
 On a typical Tuesday night, about 13,000 cabs travel south from the Upper East Side to a destination between 14th Street and Canal Street; on Saturdays, about three times as many cabs (38,000 on average) make the trip. 
 Small changes in speeds also seem to have an outsize psychological impact on impatient New Yorkers. On weekdays, when few people expect a trip to go quickly, speeds in east Midtown average about 6.3 m.p.h. in the daytime. On Saturdays, the average speed is about 8.5 m.p.h. -- not an enormous difference, even though drivers report feeling more comfortable on weekends.
 Despite the line at the Macy's returns counter, January clocked in as the least-congested month of the year. November, hindered by the frenzy of Thanksgiving and holiday shopping, was the most congested. 
 And, as any political observer will tell you, diplomats really bring things to a standstill. United Nations General Assembly week, in late September, accounted for four straight weekdays when Manhattan traffic turned to sludge.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 30, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about a new study on traffic patterns in Manhattan based on data gathered by GPS devices on cabs referred imprecisely to the holidays that were excluded from calculations to determine the weekday with the fastest traffic during the period studied. While federal holidays were excluded, not all holidays were. (Yom Kippur, which was on Monday, Sept. 28, 2009, was included in the study. The report ranked that date as the weekday with the fastest traffic.)

HEADLINE: The Day After

 BODY:
It is worth pausing to dwell on what happened in the White House on Tuesday: President Obama, just over a year into a tumultuous presidency in which he was sometimes wrong-footed and often adrift, signed the most momentous social legislation in many years. 
 The health care reform law is an overdue and vital step in the construction of a social safety net, which began after the Great Depression and slowly moved forward -- often in a bipartisan manner -- until it was interrupted by the Republican Party's radical antigovernment fervor in the late 20th century. 
 It was a triumph for Mr. Obama and for the Democratic leadership in Congress. If Mr. Obama draws no other lesson, it is that his early and forceful personal engagement on big issues is indispensable. He waited a perilously long time to exercise his leadership on health care, but when he did, it paid off.
 It is important to keep that in mind because Mr. Obama's victory celebration had barely ended before people were asking, ''Now what?'' There was speculation, in some quarters, that the energy had been drained out of Mr. Obama and his Congressional allies by the struggle against a Republican Party whose only objective seemed to be to thwart the president, no matter his objective.
 But there is important business ahead -- lots of it. And while Mr. Obama deserves a break, he must build on this success, not rest on it.
 First and foremost is the economy, specifically the creation of jobs. Mr. Obama offered a budget plan in February that called for cuts in discretionary spending and should have brought major Congressional action on jobs in return. After the Easter break, Congress will likely extend unemployment insurance and offer some fiscal relief to states. That may be enough for the economy to squeak through 2010, but persistently high joblessness is a plague that Congress may not confront in a comprehensive way unless Mr. Obama forces the issue.
 He will also have to take the lead in improving the financial regulatory bills moving through Congress. Neither chamber's version is adequate to fix the problems that led to the financial meltdown, and the banking lobby is working hard to render them even less effective.
 Beyond jobs and financial reform -- near-term issues that will bulk large in the midterm elections -- there are longer-term issues. President Obama has promised to reform the country's education system, and to address climate change and oil dependency by transforming the way Americans produce and use energy. In his campaign, he talked about immigration reform and restoring the rule of law to terrorist detention policies. 
 These are lofty objectives, and Mr. Obama may not reach them all. But the health care victory shows that big goals can be achieved -- with Mr. Obama's personal intervention and sustained leadership. 
 With rare exceptions, the Republicans are not going to help. Anyone who thinks otherwise should consider what Senator John McCain of Arizona said on Monday: ''There will be no cooperation for the rest of the year.'' 
 As shocking as that is from a man who more than once presented himself as a candidate for president, it sums up the political reality that Mr. Obama faces. Still, he should be able to sell the public at the very least on creating jobs and restraining a rapacious financial industry. The nation's well-being depends on it.

HEADLINE: With a Little Star Power, the Top Brass Ask for Ideas

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
EXECUTIVES at Allstate, known, after their famous slogan, as ''the 'good hands' people,'' are looking for a few good advertising ideas -- and are making that clear in attention-getting fashion.
 Three top managers of the Allstate Corporation came to New York from the company's Northbrook, Ill., headquarters to make a presentation to senior sales executives from dozens of major media companies. They were joined by a surprise guest: Dennis Haysbert, the actor and Allstate spokesman.
 The message, delivered by the Allstate leaders on Wednesday under the title ''The New State of Allstate,'' was this: Help us advertise more effectively by developing, for all types of media, better ways to tell consumers that Allstate sells protection, not just insurance. 
 To encourage the submission of ideas, Allstate is setting up a Web site (AllstateIdeaPortal.com) to which potential media partners can send proposals.
 The meeting, at the Jazz at Lincoln Center Theater at the Time Warner Center, drew an estimated 200 sales executives from the likes of AOL, BET, CNN, Discovery Communications, ESPN, Google, NBC, The New York Times, Parade, Rainbow Media Holdings, Time Inc., Univision and The Wall Street Journal.
 Senior managers from the longtime Allstate agencies in Chicago that are part of the Publicis Groupe -- Leo Burnett, for creative, and Starcom, for media -- were also present.
 The meeting was not unprecedented, in that marketers like Ford Motor, General Motors, I.B.M., Nike and Unilever have made similar presentations. But it was out of the ordinary because of how far up on the organizational charts of Allstate and the media outlets those who attended could be found.
 The executives from Allstate making the 90-minute presentation were Thomas J. Wilson, chairman, president and chief executive; Mark LaNeve, who joined Allstate in October as chief marketing officer from G.M., where he had been vice president for sales, service and marketing; and Lisa Cochrane, vice president for marketing.
 ''Rarely do you have the senior-level involvement and orchestration that Allstate had this morning,'' said one media executive there, David S. Morris, chief client officer at CBS Interactive, part of the CBS Corporation.
 Another attendee, Dave Kupiec, said, ''What really struck me is that even though there were 200 people in the room, you felt you were getting to know the personalities of the people running the company and, by default, the company.''
 Even the participation of Mr. Haysbert worked, said Mr. Kupiec, executive vice president for sales and marketing at National CineMedia in New York. ''It could have been hokey,'' he said, but it became ''another way to bring us into the building of the Allstate brand.''
 Within an hour of returning to his office, Mr. Kupiec said, he and staff members in New York and Chicago were brainstorming ad ideas for Allstate.
 Allstate spent almost $273.6 million to advertise in major media last year, according to Kantar Media, a unit of WPP. That is less than rivals in the intensely competitive insurance category, among them Geico, Progressive and State Farm.
 One reason ad spending in the category has increased an estimated 125 percent in the last five years, to more than $3 billion, is to overcome the fact that insurance is a ''low engagement'' purchase for consumers, Mr. Wilson said, compared with something like the AppleiPad. ''If we launch a new product, we don't see people lining up at the door,'' he added. 
 Another reason there are so many insurance ads is a price war that has broken out, particularly for automotive policies, during the economic downturn.
 Allstate's goal is to ''fight the commoditization'' of insurance, said Susan Credle, chief creative officer at Burnett, and use marketing to increase sales and market share rather than wooing customers interested in ''cheaping out'' their insurance purchases.
 As part of what Mr. Wilson called Allstate's ''desire to win,'' he said the company was looking for ways to ''take risk'' in approaching consumers, adding, in a reference to his principal business, ''We've got billions of dollars of risk every day.''
 Mr. LaNeve illustrated that with an anecdote about an initiative at Allstate -- an Insights, Design and Innovation Center to develop additional products the company could sell. Mr. LaNeve said he told Mr. Wilson he was worried about the cost, and Mr. Wilson replied, ''We had a hailstorm in Indianapolis last week that cost us 60 million bucks. Don't sweat it.''
 ''At Allstate, we want to be known in your circles as the company where good ideas win and get funded,'' Mr. LaNeve said. 
 To stimulate the audience, the attendees got a sneak peek at a coming television commercial for Allstate on the issue of driving while distracted. The spot promotes a section of the Allstate Web site (allstate.com/xthetext) devoted to urging the public to ''delete text driving.''
 ''We are holding it back,'' Ms. Cochrane said of the spot, ''for a special partnership'' with a media company. 
 That the commercial was made for television does not mean Allstate is not interested in ideas for other media, she added, because ''Allstate needs to be everywhere with the consumer.'' Examples included Web video, sports sponsorships, smartphone applications, social media, online ads and print ads.
 Mr. Haysbert's role in the presentation included some jokes, a discussion of his acting career and intoning, with his inimitable delivery, the current Allstate slogan, ''Are you in good hands?''
 Asked afterward how he became involved with Allstate, Mr. Haysbert said one reason was, ''My parents have been Allstate customers for 51 years.'' 
 Mr. LaNeve said the last celebrity he worked with before Mr. Haysbert was Tiger Woods, who for many years was the Buick spokesman for G.M.
 ''Obviously, Dennis has worked out a lot better than that deal,'' Mr. LaNeve said, laughing.

HEADLINE: Attorney General Moves to Forefront Of Virginia Conservative Resurgence

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

 BODY:
RICHMOND, Va. -- In campaigning to become Virginia's attorney general, Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II made no secret of his conservative views, winning enthusiastic endorsements from the National Rifle Association and the National Coalition for Life. 
 But since taking office in January, Mr. Cuccinelli, a former state senator from Fairfax County, has surprised even his most ardent supporters with several high-profile legal actions that have ignited political firestorms extinguished only with help from Gov. Robert F. McDonnell, a fellow Republican more moderate in style if not beliefs.
This month, Mr. Cuccinelli instructed the state's public colleges to end policies that banned discrimination against homosexuals, spurring angry protests and forcing the governor to issue a statement that workplace discrimination is illegal.
 This week, Mr. Cuccinelli said he planned to sue the federal government over the health care reform law's requirement that everyone carry health insurance. 
 ''We are in the minority in Washington and here in Virginia because Republicans abandoned their core principles,'' Mr. Cuccinelli said as he accepted his party's nomination in front of a Revolutionary War-era yellow flag with a coiled snake and the words ''Don't tread on me'' that have become the symbol of the Tea Party movement. ''If you want an A.G. with a record of defending the Constitution as it was written,'' he said, ''I'm your candidate.''
 Mr. Cuccinelli is quickly and deliberately moving to the forefront of a conservative resurgence in Virginia, which just two years ago was hailed by Democrats as a symbol of their party's ability to capture the South.
 But his toughest challenge may be to position himself among his Republican peers.
 Outspoken and unwavering in his opposition to abortion and homosexuality and in support of property and gun rights, Mr. Cuccinelli is a purist among pragmatists. He stands out as a pugnacious culture warrior in a party more eager to court moderate and fiscal conservatives, and in a state whose governor hopes to portray himself as a consensus builder. 
 ''Ken was a tea partier before there was a Tea Party,'' said David B. Albo, a Republican delegate from Fairfax County and close friend of the attorney general. ''I tend to take my job responsibility as doing what a majority of my constituents want me to do. Ken sees his job as setting a path and trying to explain to his constituents that this is the way we want to go.''
 In recent weeks, though, some of Mr. Cuccinelli's hard stands have become a headache for Governor McDonnell. 
 Last week, the governor was left to respond to questions about his attorney general after an audio clip surfaced on the Web in which Mr. Cuccinelli, in a recorded telephone conversation. offered a legal strategy for testing the notion, popular among certain conservatives, that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States and therefore lacked eligibility to run for president. It was ''possible,'' Mr. Cuccinelli said, that a person could ''challenge'' a federal law as illegitimate because ''someone qualified to be president didn't sign it.'' 
 The governor quickly made clear that he had no doubts Mr. Obama was born in this country, and later so did Mr. Cuccinelli, in a statement that explained he had given a hypothetical answer to a question.
 Still, stylistic differences aside, Mr. McDonnell and Mr. Cucinnelli agree on many policy matters. (Both men declined to be interviewed for this article.)
 Mr. McDonnell has resisted legal protections for gay state employees, and in 2006 he described as unconstitutional part of an anti-bias order issued by the governor at the time, Tim Kaine, a Democrat.
 Nevertheless, Mr. McDonnell was blindsided and deeply annoyed by the legal opinion Mr. Cuccinelli issued to colleges about homosexuals. 
 ''I think it's fair to say that the governor and lieutenant governor are not happy that the attorney general opened this new front in the culture wars while they're focused on a terrible fiscal situation,'' said Larry J. Sabato, a political science professor at the University of Virginia. 
 Mr. Cuccinelli's action also jeopardized the governor's efforts to lure the defense giant Northrop Grumman, which has gay-friendly employee policies, to move to Fairfax County from Los Angeles, said a staff assistant to Mr. McDonnell who is not authorized to speak to the press and insisted on anonymity
 Some people did not see that as such a bad thing. 
 ''Ken is in tune with typical family people, people who work in this state,'' said Robert G. Marshall, a Republican delegate from Prince William County. Mr. Cuccinelli's popularity, he said, derives from his sharp legal mind and steadfastness to his principles regardless of what others think.
 ''When others make him seem controversial, it just raises his name recognition,'' Mr. Marshall said.
 Mr. Cuccinelli's former law partner, Chris Day, described him as headstrong and contrarian.
 Mr. Cuccinelli insisted that his law office phone extension and suite carry the number 13, to thumb his nose at superstitious people who think the number brings bad luck, Mr. Day said.
 When lawyers suggested that Mr. Cuccinelli replace his ''hideously purplish jalopy'' -- a 1999 Dodge Intrepid with more than 200,000 miles -- Mr. Cuccinelli refused. He preferred its more humble image. 
 As a lawmaker from one of the state's most liberal regions, Mr. Cuccinelli proudly described himself as ''the most aggressive pro-life leader in the Virginia Senate.'' He favored legislation granting legal rights to fetuses at conception and voted against a bill stating that contraception is not abortion. He also sponsored bills requiring regulations so strict they would have put most abortion clinics out of business. 
 More recently, he has been channeling the fears and frustrations many tea partiers feel toward the federal government. While campaigning last year, he told a crowd he was considering not registering his son for a Social Security number because ''it is being used to track you.''
 Still, Mr. Cuccinelli's rhetoric has had some subtle political upsides for the governor, burnishing his image as a moderate on social issues and softening the fallout from Mr. McDonnell's 1989 master's thesis in which he described working women and feminists as ''detrimental'' to the family and criticized government policies that support ''cohabitators, homosexuals or fornicators.''
 Noting that ''politics works in strange ways,'' Mr. Sabato, the political science professor, said, ''Mr. Cuccinelli is proving to be one of the most unusual statewide officials Virginia has ever had.''

HEADLINE: A Good Excuse to Stay Home From the Gym

BYLINE: By SARA ECKEL

 BODY:
WHEN Laurie Davis wakes up in the morning, she sometimes feels like skipping her workout. But two days a week, hitting the snooze button is not an option: she knows that at 7 a.m., Yvette Rose will ring the buzzer at her Manhattan apartment with hand weights and resistance bands in tow.
 ''Even when you don't want to get up and put your workout clothes on, there's just no excuse,'' said Ms. Davis, an account executive at a New York advertising agency. 
 Many people find that hiring a personal trainer who makes house calls is the only way to ensure they stick to their fitness goals. Although it may sound like a luxury, training at home has grown more affordable since the economy soured because more instructors are willing to strike deals. 
 There are plusses and minuses to an at-home workout. For the client, training in the living room means giving up commercial-gym amenities -- spinning rooms, saunas, the latest elliptical machine -- in exchange for privacy, convenience and, most important, an iron-clad appointment. 
 For the trainer, making house calls means not having to split fees with a gym or invest in a lot of equipment. On the down side, it can mean having to lug heavy weights and operate in spaces that may not be ideal for a vigorous workout.
 ''Every time you go in, you have to scout around and make sure there isn't stuff lying around or that the floors aren't sticky,'' Ms. Rose said. 
 Children and dogs can also be a problem. ''I've taught yoga classes where the client will be in a plank position, and her son jumps on her back,'' she added.
 Although the price for at-home training is usually about the same as for meeting a trainer at a gym -- in the New York area, it usually costs $75 to $225 an hour -- many personal trainers and yoga and Pilates instructors are hungry for work, so it is a buyer's market.
 Liz Neporent, president of Wellness 360, which manages residential gyms in co-ops and condominiums, said that since the downturn she has seen a sharp increase in the number of highly qualified trainers asking to get on Wellness 360's payroll, which offers steadier work but lower hourly pay than independent contracting. 
 ''It used to be like pulling teeth to get them to come,'' she said. 
 Many private trainers do not want to admit that they will lower their rates, but some clients are quietly passing on the word. Karen Hochman, editorial director of TheNibble.com, an online food magazine, said that her Pilates teacher gives her a half-price discount. Without it, she said, she would not be able to afford twice-a-week lessons in her Manhattan apartment.
 ''I'm grateful the recession has provided me with this opportunity, though I wish I could pay my teacher more,'' Ms. Hochman said.
 For Andrea Albicocco, meeting a personal trainer at the gym in her condominium in Hoboken, N.J., helped her get in shape for her wedding last fall. ''I'm the kind of person who doesn't push myself at the gym,'' she said. 
 Though Mrs. Albicocco had previously worked with trainers at a fitness club, she found the setting too public. ''I didn't like the way people were watching me,'' she said. ''You feel self-conscious while the trainer is showing you how to do it and pushing you.'' At her home gym, she was able to negotiate a rate of $65 an hour -- down from $75 -- by paying for 25 sessions up front, she said.
 Some people are able to afford at-home training by teaming up with a friend to share the cost. ''Trainers are realizing that they may not be able to charge their regular fee of $80 an hour for a solo session, but they can charge two people $50 an hour and train them together,'' said Neal Pire, a personal trainer from Ridgewood, N.J. ''So they are charging less per person, but they are also making more money.'' 
 There are challenges. Safety is an issue, which is why Amber O'Neal, who owns a fitness company in Atlanta called Cafe Physique, never sends a female trainer to a male client unless his wife is also a client and is home during the session. Ms. O'Neal focuses exclusively on sending trainers to people's homes -- she had owned a workout studio, but the weak economy prompted her to close it -- and said she often fields calls from men requesting female instructors.
 The more they insist, the more suspicious she becomes. ''There are times when you can tell that something is not right,'' Ms. O'Neal said. Cafe Physique also reserves the right to cancel a session at any time, and trainers are told they may abort a session if, for any reason, they feel threatened.
 Of course, students and trainees must also be mindful of whom they let into their homes, so Ms. O'Neal also runs background checks for all the trainers she hires.
 For those considering individual trainers, Mr. Pire recommends interviewing several candidates and getting referrals from their clients. ''Ask them, 'Did you ever feel uncomfortable having them over?' '' he said. ''They'll be honest with you. People are surprisingly forthcoming.'' 
 Ms. Neporent says that the trainer should also have liability insurance and certification from a well-known accrediting agency, like the American College of Sports Medicine, the National Strength and Conditioning Association or the Yoga Alliance. 
 At-home training can undermine an instructor's authority, some instructors say. Jonathan FitzGordon, a yoga instructor in Brooklyn, said he preferred meeting with clients in a rented studio space than their homes, though it costs him more. 
 ''When you bring me into your home and you're paying me, I'm more like a servant,'' he said. ''I don't play that role when you come to me.''
 Ms. O'Neal said that some clients want to watch television while working out. Her personal trainers can usually roll with it, she said, since many of them are high-energy multitaskers themselves. ''They'll say: 'Oh, you're watching ''The Tyra Banks Show.'' O.K., here's what we did last week,' '' Ms. O'Neal said.
 Of course, the gym has distractions, too. When Mrs. Albicocco was working with a trainer at her local gym, she said that she did not always have his full attention. ''I'd be in the middle of a training session, and people would be walking up and talking to him, and I'd think, 'Hey, I'm paying all this money -- talk to me.' ''

To the Editor:
 Re ''One Classroom, From Sea to Shining Sea,'' by Susan Jacoby (Op-Ed, March 19):
 The framers of the Constitution believed that, more than as a matter of tradition or convenience, states were best suited to meet the everyday needs of their citizens.
 Contrary to Ms. Jacoby's assertion, the purpose of education is not meeting ''the needs of a 21st-century nation competing in a global economy,'' but preparing young people to lead successful personal and professional lives and to become informed and caring participants in a democratic society. If education fulfills that purpose, it can't help but raise the economic status of the nation also. 
 Despite the errors made by state and local boards in managing schools, they are right more often than the federal government. Not because they are smarter, but because they are closer to the successes, failures and needs of their students and more affected by them.
 Anyone who thinks that the Department of Education or experts appointed to federal panels should be designing curriculum and tests for all -- or even any -- students should reflect for a moment on the failures of No Child Left Behind. Joanne Yatvin
 Portland, Ore., March 19, 2010
 The writer is a retired teacher, principal and district superintendent, still teaching prospective teachers at Portland State University and writing books for practicing teachers.
 To the Editor:
 Susan Jacoby hits the nail on the head in targeting decentralization as a barrier to improving public education. The United States has 14,000 school districts making individual decisions on curriculum, standards and assessment -- in contrast with other countries. No wonder American high school students rank 25th in math and 21st in science on international tests. 
 Making matters worse, most districts are controlled by elected school boards, consisting of people who frequently have no expertise in education other than the fact that they once attended school. A result? Many superintendents are fired for political reasons within five years. Imagine what corporate America would look like if chief executives were fired as quickly by their boards; no strategy would ever take hold.
 Structural changes are needed to make real progress in public education. Teaching algebra or grammar should look the same across the country.

 To the Editor: 
 Susan Jacoby's comment that a curriculum consensus should be ''reached by genuine experts'' reminded me of my experiences during my 31 years of teaching physics in a New York City public high school.
 The curriculum was gradually ''dumbed down'' over the years, and so were the state Regents exams. When I inquired as to why, I was told that certain topics were ''too difficult'' for the students. I had never found it to be so, and I continued teaching physics the way I had always taught it. I later discovered that those revising the curriculum had no physics background. 
 Ezra Silovitz
 Staten Island, March 19, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Susan Jacoby's argument is only the latest in a long line. Intellectuals on both the left and the right have for years had little use for local control of education. Yet in the opinion of home buyers, the school district is the most important local government boundary. 
 The reason has less to do with education (which, for a big country with lots of immigrants, is not so bad) than with the social capital that local public schools provide for their communities. This is economically important because it makes our work force more mobile, and mobility is an important American advantage. 
 Far from being relics of the agrarian past, school districts define our sense of community and contribute to the public's support for education.
 William A. Fischel
 Hanover, N.H., March 19, 2010
 The writer, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College, is the author of ''Making the Grade: The Economic Evolution of American School Districts.''
 To the Editor:
 Here's an American idea for American school reform: let's vote. Have the federal government create national standards for students and teachers and even design the dreaded national curriculum. Then, let individual schools (not districts, schools) vote as to whether they will use this national approach or not. 
 A vote would commit the school to that standard for at least five years. Parents can choose between schools that follow local or national standards. Over time, the benefits of a national approach should become apparent -- especially to the many families who move often. Local power-mongers won't be able to rail against the federal government's seizing control, and the national approach would have local competition against which to prove itself.
 We already have a patchwork system; this would be a politically viable way to start joining it together with common threads. Amanda Marks

HEADLINE: Shares Fall on Worries About Economy and Europe's Debt

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY and JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Shares on Wall Street pulled back from their recent winning streak on Wednesday amid concerns about debt problems in Portugal and disappointing home sales in the United States.
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 52.68 points, or 0.48 percent, to 10,836.15, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 6.45 points, or 0.55 percent, to 1,167.72. The Nasdaq composite index declined 16.48 points, or 0.68 percent, to 2,398.76.
 The euro slipped to $1.3338, from $1.3488 late Tuesday. It was the lowest level for the European currency since May, and continued a slide that began in November on concerns about rising debt levels in several European nations -- including Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain. 
 On Wednesday, Fitch Ratings announced it had downgraded its rating of Portugal's long-term foreign- and local-currency debt and that the outlook on the long-term debt was negative. The move reflected the fact that the Portuguese government's 2009 budget deficit had swelled to 9.3 percent of gross domestic product, well above the 6.5 percent the ratings agency expected, Fitch said. 
 Portugal will need to take ''sizable consolidation measures'' next year and withdraw fiscal stimulus this year if it is to meet the European Union's deficit target of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2013, Fitch said. 
 After the downgrade, Portugal's finance ministry tried to reassure investors by reaffirming its ''strong commitment to fiscal consolidation,'' while noting that Fitch found some things to praise, including the ''credibility'' of its budget plans.
 The downgrade for Portugal came a day before European Union leaders were scheduled to meet in Brussels to try to decide on an aid package for Greece, which has also been pummeled in the bond market by nervous investors. 
 Germany had indicated Tuesday that it might agree on a package financed in part by the countries of the euro zone, but only as a last resort. Berlin made clear that the Greek government would have to exhaust its ability to borrow, and that any rescue would have to involve the International Monetary Fund.
 On Wednesday, Wall Street also reacted to a report from the Commerce Department showing that sales of new homes weakened to a record low in February, dimming prospects for a swift recovery for the housing market. Over all, sales were down 2.2 percent from a month earlier, the department said.
 The department also reported that orders for durable goods rose 0.5 percent last month. While that was the third consecutive monthly increase, it was slightly lower than the 0.6 percent gain that economists had expected.
 Economists said that the economy's momentum was probably sustainable in the short term, but that it could weaken later in the year as government stimulus programs ended and restocking of inventories slowed. 
 ''Business decision makers, still uncertain about the long-term outlook for economic growth, are exercising caution with regards to capital spending,'' Cliff Waldman, an economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, wrote in a research note.
 Among the stocks that fell on Wednesday, Chevron tumbled 1.1 percent, to $73.93 as oil prices fell. Crude oil fell to $80.61 a barrel, from $81.91 on Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 The Treasury's 10-year note fell 1 12/32, to 98 4/32. The yield rose to 3.85 percent, from 3.69 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Rooting Out Career Bureaucrats to Plant a New Economic Formula

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Six months after his party's historic election victory, tumbling approval ratings and mounting troubles threaten to make Yukio Hatoyama end up as just another unpopular Japanese prime minister. But in at least one crucial area, political experts say his new government has surpassed its predecessors: challenging the nation's powerful and entrenched bureaucracy. 
 Since ending the Liberal Democrats' nearly unbroken 54-year grip on power in last summer's election, Mr. Hatoyama's Democratic Party has proclaimed its top mission to be changing the way the country is governed by a process that is commonly called ''escaping the bureaucracy.'' The aim is to make Japan's political system more responsive by ending more than a century of de facto rule by elite career bureaucrats at Tokyo's central ministries, and empowering democratically elected politicians instead. 
 It has already made considerable progress, say political experts, who caution that the battle is far from won. The Hatoyama administration has put teams of lawmakers in charge of daily operations at the ministries, which long ran Japan with backroom decision-making. It has centralized the appointment and promotion of top officials in the prime minister's office, and forced out recalcitrant top officials. 
 To put its imprint on spending decisions, the government will hold a second high-profile search for hidden waste in ministry budgets next month. The first one, last autumn, which cut some $7 billion in spending, offered an unprecedented public spectacle of Parliament members grilling squirming bureaucrats, turning the tables on the powerful pooh-bahs who had long called the shots.
 ''The bureaucrats created a very centralized system that has become out of date, and unable to react to the world's changes,'' Kazuhiro Haraguchi, the minister of internal affairs, said in an interview. ''We need a system that serves the people, not the bureaucracy and entrenched interest groups.'' 
 Predictably, these efforts have run into determined resistance, both from within the bureaucracy and from the outside. But they also enjoy wide support by the public, which seems to share a growing realization that clipping the bureaucracy's wings is the best way to restore a sense of direction to this seemingly rudderless nation. 
 This support appears to remain strong here even as Mr. Hatoyama's government has stumbled in other areas. Political financing scandals and a diplomatic rift with Washington over an air base in Okinawa have sent the prime minister's approval ratings skidding into the 30 percent range recently, down by half from when he took office. There is even talk that Mr. Hatoyama might step down if his Democrats fare poorly in upper house elections this July. 
 Political experts say that while past Liberal Democratic leaders, like the former prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, also pledged to assert more control over the ministry pooh-bahs, they made little progress. These experts praise the measures that the Democrats have taken so far, but say that they need to extend their control even further. 
 ''What is happening is nothing short of revolutionary,'' said Karel van Wolferen, a professor of comparative politics at the University of Amsterdam who wrote a 1995 best-selling critique of the Japanese system, ''The System That Makes Japanese Unhappy,'' which zeroed in on the unresponsive elite as a core national problem. ''A half year of Hatoyama has produced more change than an entire year of Obama.'' 
 Professor van Wolferen said the next big test would be whether the new government could wrestle control of the national budget from Japan's most formidable bureaucratic stronghold, the Finance Ministry. Other experts said the Democrats must also convince these career officials that the new order is here to stay, and will not just be reversed during the next change of government.
 The tradition of bureaucratic control goes back to Japan's dash to catch up with the industrialized West, a task it entrusted to career officials drawn from top universities rather than lawmakers, who were seen as too short-sighted and corruptible. These technocrats presided over Japan's phenomenal economic rise, but more recently have proved incapable of finding a new growth formula to end the stagnation and decline that set in after the burst of the property bubble in the early 1990s.
 One of the Hatoyama administration's first targets was the bureaucracy's long tradition of writing laws and making policy decisions, which were then rubber-stamped by Liberal Democratic lawmakers.
 One target is the Cabinet Legislation Bureau, a little-known agency that is empowered to interpret the Constitution, including Japan's often convoluted reading of the article prohibiting it from having a military. In January, the bureau's director general, a career bureaucrat, resigned after Mr. Hatoyama announced that the minister in charge of administrative reform, Yukio Edano, a lawmaker, would be replacing the director general as the bureau's chief spokesman.
 ''Before, politicians just left everything to the bureaucrats,'' said Masahiro Sakata, a former director general at the bureau who retired in 2006. ''Now, the Democrats are treating bureaucrats like an unnecessary hindrance.'' The director general who just resigned refused interview requests.
 In another assault on bureaucratic prerogative, the government submitted a bill last month that would create an agency in the prime minister's office to decide all job appointments involving top officials, which had been decided within each ministry. The bill would also greatly reduce the responsibilities of the administrative vice ministers, the top bureaucratic job in each ministry that had long been the actual center of ministry control.
 ''The bureaucracy's autonomy on personnel issues had been the source of their independence and ability to hold on to power,'' said Yoshito Sengoku, the minister of civil service reform and the government's point man for changing the bureaucracy. 
 There has also been resistance. According to some political experts, the most damaging counterattack has been the unending string of inquiries into the political parties' finances by public prosecutors, who are a part of the Justice Ministry. 
 Bureaucrats have also struck back with damaging leaks to the major news media, which have close ties with the bureaucracy through the ''press clubs'' of reporters permanently stationed in each ministry. 
 Mr. Haraguchi, the internal affairs minister, described how a flurry of negative stories suddenly appeared in major newspapers after he reassigned top bureaucrats in his ministry to different jobs -- something no minister, usually an elected politician, had ever done before. He said that he found the source of the leak, who would be passed over for future promotions.
 ''The leak was a way of striking back,'' Mr. Haraguchi said. ''What we are doing here is without precedent, and so many officials are uneasy.''
 Mr. Haraguchi said his intent was not to push aside ministry officials, but to get them to cooperate in a new era of political control. This slightly softer tone has been adopted by the entire government, including Mr. Hatoyama, who now talks of reducing dependence on the bureaucracy without alienating it.
 ''They have to temper what they're saying to be more effective,'' said Masayuki Yamauchi, a professor at the University of Tokyo who has written about politics. ''But the changes they are making will not be easily undone.''

HEADLINE: Japan, Struggling With Debt, Approves a $1 Trillion Budget

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- The Japanese government on Wednesday pushed a record 92.3 trillion yen ($1 trillion) budget through Parliament aimed at stimulating growth in the long-stagnant economy. It means another round of spending and adding to Tokyo's already substantial public debt.
 Also on Wednesday, the government said it would retain a significant stake in the country's extensive postal banking system, reversing the course of privatization efforts of previous administrations. 
 The nation's fiscal largess has long been supported by Japan Post, the country's biggest customer for Japanese government bonds. A de facto government guarantee on deposits made at the postal bank has attracted huge amounts: about 300 trillion yen, or more than the annual gross domestic output of France.
 Recent data shows the Japanese economy, the world's largest after the United States, is slowly emerging from its worst recession since World War II, as a global recovery sets off a rebound in exports, production and employment. But some economists worry about runaway government spending in Japan, which is already saddled with a public debt twice the size of its economy -- the worst ratio among industrialized countries.
 The government said it would issue a record 44 trillion yen in bonds to finance the budget for next year and cover for a sharp shortfall in tax revenue.
 The budget passed for the fiscal year starting in April would pay for Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama's ambitious stimulus agenda, including cash handouts to households with young children and income support for farmers.
 Mr. Hatoyama, who heads the Democratic Party, is looking to bolster both Japan's economy, which has been hit by deflation, and his slumping popularity before important elections this summer.
 ''Creating a virtuous circle in which a growth strategy spurs employment and demand will help combat deflation,'' Mr. Hatoyama said.
 In January, the ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut its outlook for Japan's sovereign rating, saying that Mr. Hatoyama appeared to have no plan to start containing the country's spiraling debt.
 Japan's fiscal spending is often doled out to pork-barrel public works projects, like dams on virtually every major river and mountainous roads to nowhere.
 Trying to remedy the unhealthy flow of finances, the former prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, started a privatization drive for Japan Post last decade. Under the plan, Japan Post's financial units were to be freed from government control by 2017, a centerpiece of structural changes meant to forge a more market-oriented economy in Japan.
 Though Mr. Koizumi's plans appeared to enjoy public support at the time, disastrous terms in office for his successors -- marked by recession and the global economic crisis -- have largely discredited his privatization agenda.
 In August, Mr. Hatoyama cast Mr. Koizumi's Liberal Democrats from power in a landmark election that ended a half-century of almost uninterrupted governance in Japan. The new administration soon began a review of the postal privatization process.
 Some within Mr. Hatoyama's administration have argued that privatizing Japan Post would lead to cutbacks in the financial services available in rural areas. For residents of some far-flung villages and tiny islands, the local post office provides the only access to banking services.
 But the move has also raised concerns that the huge state-affiliated entity could crowd out business at private banks.
 ''Reversing postal privatization means grave distortions will remain in the Japanese economy,'' said Satoru Matsubara, a professor of economic policy at Toyo University. ''The state will now be able to continue offloading bonds to Japan Post, and that will encourage reckless government spending.''
 ''Private banks will also suffer from unfair competition,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Scavenger Hunts For the Healthy

BYLINE: By ROLFE WINKLER and ROBERT CYRAN

 BODY:
As the list of America's problem banks balloons, healthy institutions are gearing up to capitalize on the misfortune of others. Just look at First Interstate BancSystem, the first bank to begin an initial public offering since before the financial crisis. It may use the proceeds to pick off failed rivals.
 The bank, based in Montana, raised about $130 million of capital after fees. While not a big public offering, it is rare -- no other bank has done so since 2007 -- and shows that distress in the sector may be creating opportunities for the healthy. With the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation expecting at least as many bank seizures this year as last year's 140, the supply of carcasses seems endless for canny vultures. 
 First Interstate's chief executive, Lyle R. Knight, salivated over the prospect during a recent investor presentation, saying he was ''particularly excited'' about F.D.I.C.-assisted transactions. And after the public offering raised his bank's tangible common equity 30 percent, to 6.4 percent of tangible assets, the 42-year-old family-owned lender has fresh capital to pounce.
 It may not seem like a lot of firepower. But First Interstate's low-risk, low-cost financing model, combined with its conservative approach to lending, means it probably has plenty of room to keep regulators comfortable. The IRA Bank Monitor, which rates all F.D.I.C.-insured institutions, grades the bank ''A plus'' based on low loan default rates and high risk-adjusted returns on capital, among other metrics.
 True, at $14.50 a share, the offering was priced near the low end of the range and below the preoffering book value of $16.73 a share. The discount could reflect the bank's relatively high level of good will and its Class B shares, which give control to the bank's family owners. But the 8.3 percent gain on the first day of trading means investors see some opportunity.
 First Interstate may appeal to those interested in the bank failure trade. Shares of other publicly listed institutions that bought collapsed banks from the F.D.I.C. also have jumped. Those of Ameris Bancorp, for one, have surged 86 percent since it announced a second acquisition of a banking carcass in November. To the victors go the spoils.
 Brewing Dividends
 Starbucks finally conceded growth is slowing. The coffee company announced its first dividend, almost two decades after going public, suggesting it's finding fewer places to spend. Returning cash is a welcome sign of maturity. Yet Starbucks hasn't entirely shaken its sprawl addiction.
 It looks as though Starbucks learned from the crisis. Demand for upscale coffee has suffered over the last two years. Same-store sales fell. The company shut several hundred shops and slowed the opening of new American ones in favor of international expansion. It cut costs by nearly $600 million.
 The ubiquitous brewhouse has perked up again. Sales at locations open at least 13 months turned positive in the first quarter for the first time in two years. Payouts to shareholders signal still more confidence.
 But Starbucks's willingness to return cash to shareholders may be more tepid than it looks. The company has promised about $700 million in the form of dividends along with a new buyback program. That's nice, but Starbucks has more than $1.3 billion of cash on its balance sheet and should generate about $1.6 billion more from operations this year. Although it's not a perfect comparison because McDonald's uses more franchises, the hamburger chain pays out about twice as much of its cash flow to shareholders.
 More Starbucks stores are planned overseas, where profitability has been slim. And the company is pushing into new areas. Instant coffee has been introduced, and it's selling a sub-brand, Seattle's Best Coffee, in fast-food outlets.
 These investments could well pan out; the chief executive, Howard Schultz, has a good track record. But pursuing so many disparate initiatives seems more apt to result in diluted returns. Handing back more cash would force Starbucks to focus its efforts. And the result might be a stronger and tastier brew for shareholders.

HEADLINE: A Strange Brew May Be a Good Thing

BYLINE: By MALIA WOLLAN

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO
 NAOMI MOST, a devoted brewer of a fermented tea called kombucha, keeps her ''big momma'' in the garage. The big momma in question is a 20-pound pancake of gelatinous and, well, rather gross-looking bacteria and yeast floating atop a vat of kombucha, a drink that enthusiasts tout as a tonic for digestion, hair loss and all manner of bodily ailments.
 It's not for everyone.
 ''I live with my boyfriend and he finds it really weird,'' said Ms. Most, 30, a manager for a nonprofit group in Palo Alto, Calif. ''He doesn't like the smell.'' 
 Looks and aroma notwithstanding, kombucha is gaining popularity among those who favor organic beverages, and it is showing signs of turning into a gold mine for some companies. While the poor economy and worries about health and the environment have diminished the national thirst for soda and bottled water, sales of kombucha and other ''functional'' juices in the United States topped $295 million last year, up 25 percent over a two-year period, according to SPINS Inc., a market researcher. 
 In 2009 Americans bought more than a million bottles of GT's Kombucha, the leading commercial variety made by Millennium Products. The chief executive, G. T. Dave, started the company as a teenager in his parents' kitchen in Beverly Hills, Calif., but the drink has grown beyond the mom-and-pop scale. Recently major companies like Red Bull and Honest Tea (of which Coca-Cola owns 40 percent) began distributing their own brands.
 In the Bay Area, many fans have taken to making their own kombucha, trading recipes and selling good brews. Craigslist, for example, is full of those selling fermented patties. Several foodie groups organize regular swap meets for fermented cultures.
 To make kombucha, brewers rely on what's called a starter -- a bit of already fermented tea--passed between makers and referred to reverentially as ''the mother.'' Once the mother is added to sweetened tea and allowed to sit in a glass jar unrefrigerated for 7 to 14 days, a glop known as a symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast grows over the surface.
 This ''mother'' will expand and split into smaller patties called ''babies,'' which brewers often give to friends or sell online. ''I have kombucha babies available in several different types of tea (pu-erh, oolong, white tea, some others),'' reads a post by Ms. Most on the Kombucha Exchange, an online forum catering to kombucha brewers worldwide who want to exchange recipes, fermentation techniques and viscous offspring.
 Ms. Most gives her babies away free with an explainer pamphlet. Similar offers can be found from Argentina to Luxembourg.
 The rise in kombucha's popularity is part of a larger trend in ''probiotic'' foods containing bacteria, which some studies suggest benefit digestion and boost the immune system. 
 ''It's become incredibly trendy lately in the 20-to-30-something, foodie, intelligentsia set,'' said Dr. Daphne Miller, a family practitioner and professor of nutrition and integrative medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. ''Kombucha is like their Coca-Cola.''
 Kombucha is said to have originated in ancient China, but various forms of fermented tea exist in many countries, said Dr. Miller, who traveled the world researching healthy traditional diets while writing her book, ''The Jungle Effect.'' Some medical professionals, however, think the drink is dangerous.
 Dr. Andrew Weil, a doctor and leader in alternative health writes on his Web site: ''I don't recommend kombucha tea at all. I know of no scientific studies backing up the health claims made for it.'' He goes on to warn of home brews contaminated with aspergillus, a toxin-producing fungus, and cautions pregnant women, the elderly, children and anyone with a compromised immune system against drinking it.
 This most recent growth in popularity is actually the tea's second act in the United States. In the early 1990s, before commercially bottled varieties were available, the drink became popular with health food enthusiasts and those with H.I.V. and AIDS who believed it would help compromised immune systems and increase T-cell counts. Several mail order companies shipped ''mothers'' across the country. 
 In 1995, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a report linking kombucha to the death of an Iowa woman and the illness of another woman. Both experienced severe metabolic acidosis, excessive acid buildup in the body that health officials thought may have been related to their daily use of kombucha. Though the federal center did not definitively cite the tea as the problem, the incident put a damper on kombucha consumption. 
 But kombucha has cycled back into vogue. The tipping point in the tea's return came around 2003 or 2004, pushed by the low-carbohydrate craze that had those people on the Atkins diet looking for a healthy, fizzy drink to replace sugary soda and juice. 
 In 2003, orders for GT's Kombucha surpassed the company's production capabilities. The next year Whole Foods supermarkets began distributing the tea nationally. 
 These days in college towns and cities like Portland, Ore., around the country small-batch kombucha brewing has become something of a cottage industry.
 The Bay Area has at least a half-dozen kombucha start-ups, selling their products at farmers' markets, health food stores, yoga studios, on blogs and on Twitter. Flavors range from cayenne and mango to fennel and watermelon jalapeno. It's not uncommon to overhear people talking about their devotion to the products, all of which prompted a San Francisco food blogger, Tamara Palmer, to say recently that kombucha was on its way to becoming ''the new bacon.''
 But the drink's standing as the cure-all of the moment was not the attraction for some.. 
 Lev Kilun, 51, was an unemployed telecommunications engineer when he bought his first bottle of kombucha several years ago. He immediately recognized the distinct effervescent tang. ''I called it tea kvass,'' said Mr. Kilun, who emigrated in the late 1980s from what is now Uzbekistan. ''In Russia it was very popular. It was like an old women's drink. My grandmother used to make it.''
 Seeing a business opportunity and feeling something akin to a birthright, Mr. Kilun started his own company, Lev's Original Kombucha. He now bottles and sells six flavors brewed with green tea and distributes kegs to restaurants and cafes around the Bay Area. Mr. Kilun says the tea is thought to help cure a hangover, which he says makes for brisk sales in liquor stores.
 Kombucha's popularity has also attracted home brewers. Tim Anderson, founder of a 3D printer technology company, moved from Boston to Berkeley, Calif., with his ''mother'' -- passed on to him from a friend who got it, as the story goes, from gypsies in Russia.
 Mr. Anderson, an advocate for all things do-it-yourself, made step-by-step kombucha brewing instructions complete with videos for Instructables.com (one of over 200 tutorials he has made on everything from tire sandals to wheelchair shopping carts). Nearly 60,000 people have viewed the kombucha guide to-date, according to the site's page-view statistics. 
 ''I'm surprised people would pay to get this stuff,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''The kind you can buy tastes vinegary and dry, whereas the one you can make yourself is so incredibly delicious.''
 Mr. Anderson has given kombucha culture to dozens of friends and strangers. Recently he put out a call to get some back after he neglected his brew and let the fermented patty dry out. ''You can't go around saying you killed your mother,'' he said. ''It freaks people out.''

HEADLINE: General Who Shaped Iraq War Works to Salvage Its Legacy

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS and THOM SHANKER; Steven Lee Myers reported from Baghdad, and Thom Shanker from Washington.

 BODY:
JOINT SECURITY STATION LOYALTY, IRAQ -- In the muddled aftermath of Iraq's election, the American commander here, Gen. Ray Odierno, landed at this base on the edge of Baghdad and reviewed the plan to close it. 
 An Iraqi police division has moved its headquarters to the base, once the fortified enclave of Americans alone. The outcome of Iraq's election, the torturous effort to form a new government, remained in doubt, but the withdrawal of American troops in this part of the country -- ''the thinning'' of them, as the general put it -- proceeded, seemingly irrevocably.
 ''How we redeploy, how we turn this over,'' General Odierno told the officers who gathered to brief him in a room crowded with flat-panel television screens and wallpapered with maps, ''will go a long way to determining how this turns out.'' 
 ''This'' is the end of the war in Iraq, a conflict that General Odierno has shaped as much as any other American commander. 
 From the 2003 invasion to the capture of Saddam Hussein, from the bloodiest days of sectarian carnage to the counteroffensive known as the surge, he has served the administration that started the war and now the one whose president campaigned to end it. 
 As the senior American officer in Iraq since the fall of 2008, he has struggled against popular anger and apathy at home and fought internally for Iraq's share of materiel increasingly flowing to Afghanistan. Ultimately, he is laboring to salvage the legacy of a deeply unpopular war. 
 ''People have to get past why we came here,'' he said in an interview after his briefings, referring to the bitterly disputed reasons for invading Iraq seven years ago this month.
 ''You have to stay away from that argument and understand we're here,'' he went on. ''We have an opportunity. It could be better not only for the United States, but for overall stability in the Middle East. And we should take advantage of that.''
 Results from an election considered crucial to Iraq's democratic evolution suggest a potentially explosive split in power, but General Odierno said he would meet President Obama's deadline to reduce the number of American troops in Iraq to 50,000, from 98,000 today, by the end of August. Among those expected to leave Iraq then is the general himself.
 As the officer who must carry out Mr. Obama's order to ''responsibly withdraw from Iraq,'' General Odierno plays a role that is changing over time: from a commander who ran military operations across the country to one who now must give way to local security forces -- even as he exerts influence behind the scenes. In the months ahead, the general said, he anticipates that he will focus less on combat missions and more on trying to build Iraq's still feeble security, political and economic institutions. That, he said, will require a sustained effort extending beyond the troop withdrawal.
 During a visit to Washington before the election, the general said he was advocating the establishment of an Office of Military Cooperation within the American Embassy in Baghdad to sustain the relationship after the Dec. 31, 2011, deadline for withdrawing all American troops. He expressed doubts that the Iraqi government would request the presence of American ground forces after the deadline, although the bilateral treaty leaves open the possibility.
 ''We have to stay committed to this past 2011,'' he said. ''I believe the administration knows that. I believe that they have to do that in order to see this through to the end. It's important to recognize that just because U.S. soldiers leave, Iraq is not finished.''
 Or as Col. David M. Miller, commander of the 10th Mountain Division's Second Brigade, told the general as he described plans to keep financing water and greenhouse projects on Baghdad's outskirts even after his troops pulled back to a more remote base in the desert: ''We're not just cutting and running.'' 
 General Odierno has now been in Iraq for 45 of the 84 months of the war, a period of his career that parallels the uneven narrative of the conflict, for better and worse.
 His tactics as commander of the Fourth Infantry Division in Salahuddin in the months after the invasion in 2003, which were criticized as overly aggressive, created a public impression of him as a heavy-handed, even brutish, leader. 
 Thomas E. Ricks, the military writer who has waged what amounts to an argument of years with the commander, stridently criticized General Odierno's first tour in Iraq for what he said were ogre-like tactics and bitingly called him ''Shreko'' in an online column last month. 
 Many people dispute such characterizations, portraying him as a skilled commander who helped devise and then carried out the counterinsurgency strategy that, with the increase in soldiers that President George W. Bush announced in January 2007, helped stem the sectarian violence. The senior commander at the time, Gen. David H. Petraeus, received most of the public attention, but officers and analysts say that General Odierno made the strategy a success.
 ''Petraeus fought the war 'up,' but Odierno fought it 'down,' since he was responsible for implementing the new counterinsurgency strategy, which he did very, very well,'' said John A. Nagl, an Iraq veteran who now is president of the Center for a New American Security, a nonpartisan policy institute in Washington. He said General Odierno's contributions remained ''underappreciated.''
 General Odierno navigated the transition from the Bush administration to the Obama administration far better than his counterpart in Afghanistan, Gen. David D. McKiernan, who was forced into retirement in May 2009 because President Obama and the Pentagon leadership felt he had not done enough to reverse the drift in a war long overshadowed by Iraq.
 The Obama administration's focus on Afghanistan has created tensions behind the scenes as General Odierno has lobbied to keep as many troops and weapons as possible, while still reducing the force here to meet Mr. Obama's planned withdrawal. 
 In secret video-teleconferences at the Pentagon, he has animatedly resisted the transfer of too many intelligence drone aircraft, essential for surveying the battlefield and defending American and Iraqi forces when necessary. 
 ''His argument is: 'I still have a job today. I still have this geography to cover. I have to manage the risk,' '' a senior Department of Defense official said, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to discuss the classified strategy sessions. ''He's like a pit bull on a poodle. He's just not going to let go.'' 
 In two recent interviews, though, General Odierno acknowledged that he was preparing for a day when the Iraq campaign -- and his role in it -- ended. Asked if the war in Iraq was effectively over, he replied with some hesitation, then at length.
 ''War is a very different concept,'' he said. ''This is a -- I call it more of an operation, not a war. We won't know if we were successful, as I said the other day, for 3, 5 or 10 years. And successful will be what the government of Iraq does with what we've given them, and how we continue to support them and the relationship that we develop with them post-2011.''
 By the time he leaves, he will have spent more than four years in Iraq, like tens of thousands of soldiers, at great personal cost. 
 In 2004, his son, Lt. Anthony Odierno, lost an arm when a grenade slammed into his Humvee while he was on a patrol in Baghdad. 
 Family members do not discuss it publicly, although the experience no doubt deepened their commitment to wounded soldiers. The general's wife, Linda, put the family's golden retriever, Tootsie, through a special program to be trained as a ''therapy dog,'' and they regularly visit troops at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.
 General Odierno's remarks to soldiers at the base here suggested that each casualty affected him deeply. 
 In a recent meeting with the Second Brigade's commanders, General Odierno brought up an accident the day before that had killed two soldiers. Their armored vehicle rolled over, possibly as a result of reckless driving. ''It's a waste,'' he told the officers. 
 He later pinned Purple Hearts on two soldiers wounded when a rocket-propelled grenade struck their guard post. 
 ''Even when you are a general,'' he told dozens of soldiers attending the medal ceremony, ''this business is very personal.''

HEADLINE: How Immigration Is Changing the Face of America

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I couldn't agree more with Thomas L. Friedman's pro-immigration stance in ''America's Real Dream Team'' (column, March 21), which noted the number of children from immigrant families among the Intel Science Talent Search winners this year. 
 Many of my 38 years with Citibank were spent living and working in Asia. In those years, many of the company's best business ideas -- and more important, many of our top executives -- came from Asia.
 If there's any truth to the idea of American ''exceptionalism,'' much of it derives, in my view, from our immigrant heritage and the cultural and intellectual nourishment that diversity contributes to our society. Peter Howell
 Nantucket, Mass., March 21, 2010
 To the Editor:
 I am a scientist made unemployed by legal immigration, so I oppose Thomas L. Friedman's support of opening the doors further. There are too many scientists with Ph.D.'s in many fields in the United States. Without stricter immigration policies, the oversupply of Ph.D.'s just gets worse and worse, with the result that in some fields immigrants are being given a large fraction of the jobs. These are science jobs that Americans want, are applying for and are being turned away from.
 It is harmful to trumpet the rest of the world's students who are being given our jobs as ''America's Real Dream Team.'' Let's make sure American scientists can stay a part of the American Dream Team! Stuart Taylor
 Los Angeles, March 21, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Why are so many of the Intel Science Talent Search winners this year from immigrant families? Where were the children from families who have been resident in America for two, three or more generations? What has happened to the spark that ignited the determination and success of those early immigrants? 
 Both newcomer and ''old-timer'' families should be represented among our most gifted student populations, and if they're not, educators should be taking notice and recommending remedial action. Bonnie B. Good
 Toronto, March 23, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Another reason for Thomas L. Friedman and the rest of us to be inspired and encouraged by the Intel competition is the number of finalists who happen to be female (including the winner and 4 of the top 10). David Hill

HEADLINE: With Greece Struggling, Europe Looks Uneasily at the I.M.F.

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
PARIS -- With Greece facing a looming deadline to roll over $27 billion in debt, the countries of the euro zone are arguing nastily among themselves about whether and how to toss Greece to the tender mercies of the International Monetary Fund.
 The dispute is partly about money, but it is even more about politics and pride, and it is being conducted in the shadow of another potential crisis in Portugal, whose debt was downgraded on Wednesday.
 The euro zone has no settled mechanism for dealing with these debt crises, and the search for one is generating tensions between France and Germany, between the European Commission and its member states, and even internal political frissons in Germany and, especially, in France. There President Nicolas Sarkozy, just battered by voters in regional elections, does not want to see a possible Socialist rival, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the monetary fund, riding to the rescue of Greece.
 Berlin's resistance to a European solution, however, is giving Paris little choice. 
 A fund rescue poses an affront to European pride, given the United States' important role in the fund. But European taxpayers, and not only Germans, are reluctant to bail out the Greeks, and creation of a European version of the fund is considered too complicated and in any case could not be arranged in time.
 The maneuvering is taking place before a European Union summit meeting beginning Thursday in Brussels. There, the Greek prime minister, George A. Papandreou -- who is making painful budget cuts at home -- wants a specific European promise of help to arrange financing at rates closer to the prevailing market rates of around 3 percent than the 6 percent or more the financial markets are demanding. 
 Germany, deeply concerned about becoming the answer to the debt problems of all of Europe's endangered economies, wants Greece to pay a penalty for its former profligacy. But without a firm promise of European assistance, Mr. Papandreou has threatened to go to the monetary fund. Berlin's answer has been, essentially: go right ahead.
 Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, is facing growing domestic political pressures and has all but ruled out any specific European plan at this meeting, promising only that Berlin will not let Greece default. She has also suggested that countries that consistently break the rules should be tossed out of the euro zone.
 While Mrs. Merkel, with support from the Dutch and the Italians, is pushing Athens to the monetary fund, the French are arguing for a European solution. Paris is supported by most of Europe's prominent officials: the European Commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso; Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of a group of euro zone finance ministers; and, more quietly, the head of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, who has said that the fund's involvement is not appropriate. 
 But a European solution without Germany is nearly impossible, so France is softening its position on the fund. Germany and France have already squabbled loudly over their respective economic strategies. France has urged Berlin to increase domestic consumption in the interest of European solidarity, while Germany has criticized France for building up too much debt.
 Europe and Greece would like Athens to have time to carry out its fiscal adjustment without damaging its weak economic growth, so that the private sector can continue to finance the debt at moderate interest rates, said Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive of Pimco, the large investment company. With the Europeans split over what to do, Mr. El-Erian said, ''the markets are losing clarity, and the Greeks are under pressure again.''
 The most logical outcome, he said, would be to involve the monetary fund, with euro zone countries as co-financiers. ''The Europeans will have to swallow their pride to go outside the family,'' Mr. El-Erian said, ''and they will need the I.M.F. to be a more objective evaluator'' of Greek efforts to cut public spending.
 But even here, experts point to potential pitfalls. ''The sums involved are quite large, and no one knows quite how much of that gap the I.M.F. can fill,'' said Philip Whyte, an economist at the Center for European Reform in London. ''Even 10 or 11 billion euros would be a big help,'' he said, but it would need to be supplemented by some form of European loan, bilateral or collective, particularly with Greece needing to roll over an additional $44 billion later this year. 
 But the fund's involvement remains ''neuralgic'' for the Europeans, partly because Europeans think the fund is overly dominated by Washington, and also because ''if they can't come up with a European solution, they think it will undermine the credibility of the euro zone as a whole,'' Mr. Whyte said. 
 Christophe Barbier, the editor of the French weekly L'Express, said that going to the fund would be seen as a humiliation. ''The I.M.F. is for Somalia, Mauritania, not for Europe,'' he said. ''When it's a country on the periphery, Iceland or Hungary, why not? But Greece, it's the euro! Greece, it's the mother of all European democracies. It's a question of pride, and of civilizations.''
 Pride is also a serious factor for internal politics, Mr. Barbier noted. With Mr. Sarkozy battered by regional elections and his re-election as president in 2012 no longer a given, there is a new focus on Mr. Strauss-Kahn.
 The intertwined issues of Greece and French politics are obviously sensitive. Mr. Strauss-Kahn's spokesman, contacted by e-mail, said that the managing director was too busy to be interviewed, that ''he's also said about all he'll say on Greece,'' and that other fund staff members were too busy to be interviewed, even on background.
 One reason is that any solution to Greece's problems will lay the groundwork for possible bailouts of Portugal, Spain and Italy, since they, in differing ways, share Greece's problems of high debt, high wages, low growth and low productivity. But Greece alone, though it is a small part of the euro zone economy, is daunting. 
 ''The Greece situation is really severe, and Greece is asking both the I.M.F. and the E.U. to take a huge risk,'' said Charles Calomiris, professor of finance at Columbia Business School. The break in interest rates it is seeking would represent ''a subsidy of several billion euros for a couple of years, and that's not a lot, just a postponement for breathing room'' on the $150 billion it will need over two years -- and that money must be repaid.
 But for Greece to accomplish that, Mr. Calomiris said, would require a much larger cut in spending than what is currently contemplated: up to 25 percent over three years, unless Greece can make big advances to limit tax avoidance and corruption, and shrink the black economy. 
 To steady their own ships, Portugal, Spain and Italy will also have to endure considerable pain. ''It will test all these countries,'' he said. ''What an irony that a pact designed to unite France and Germany is dividing them.''

HEADLINE: Harold W. McGraw Jr., 92, Chairman of McGraw-Hill

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT

 BODY:
Harold W. McGraw Jr., who as leader of McGraw-Hill, his family's publishing business, helped build it into a billion-dollar enterprise in the 1970s and '80s, died on Wednesday at his home in Darien, Conn. He was 92 . 
 His son Harold W. McGraw III, who is now chief executive of the company, announced his father's death, attributing it to natural causes. 
 Mr. McGraw's leadership at McGraw-Hill was far from a simple matter of inheriting and minding the family store. He played a significant role in its growth and survival as an independent and diversified company in the last half of the 20th century, withstanding a bitter takeover attempt by American Express. 
 Though McGraw-Hill lacked the prestigious trade book department of rivals like Random House and Doubleday, it remained one of the largest publishing conglomerates in America when Mr. McGraw became chief executive in 1975, reporting gross revenue of about half a billion dollars. In his eight years in the post, McGraw-Hill's revenue more than doubled and its earnings per share more than tripled, the company said. 
 Self-effacing, formal in bearing and courteous in an old-fashioned way, Mr. McGraw seemed an unlikely candidate to climb to the top of the corporate ladder. He was the eldest son of the only second-generation member of the family who had never run the company. The man he worked for in the book division, Edward E. Booher, thought little of his abilities. ''It just never occurred to me that Harold would one day be my boss,'' Mr. Booher told Fortune magazine. 
 Yet in 1968, Mr. McGraw succeeded Mr. Booher as president of McGraw-Hill Book Company, which had been founded in 1909 when Mr. McGraw's grandfather James H. McGraw and John A. Hill, owners of separate publishing companies, merged their book departments.
 By the late 1960s, the house had become the top-ranked publisher of textbooks for colleges and elementary and secondary schools. Among its best-known texts is ''Economics,'' by Paul A. Samuelson. In 1966, it acquired Standard & Poor's, the financial rating service, adding it to a number of companies. 
 While Mr. McGraw was running the book division, McGraw-Hill drew publicity when it paid a $765,000 advance for what was portrayed as a memoir by Howard R. Hughes, the reclusive billionaire, said to have been taped by Clifford Irving, a novelist. It turned out to be a fraud and was never published. 
 In 1974 Mr. McGraw took over as president of the parent company, whose name had been changed to McGraw-Hill Inc. (It is now the McGraw-Hill Companies) He succeeded Shelton Fisher, who had led the company through a period of expansion, including the move of its headquarters from West 42nd Street in Manhattan, near Times Square, to a sleek steel and glass tower on the Avenue of Americas, near Rockefeller Center. 
 Mr. McGraw subsequently became chief executive and chairman, guiding the company through a period of growth, with revenues surpassing $1 billion in 1980 for the first time. 
 A pivotal moment of his tenure came in 1979, when American Express began one of the bitterest takeover attempts in Wall Street history. On a January evening, James D. Robinson III, the chairman of American Express, and Roger Morley, the president, came to Mr. McGraw's office and presented an offer of almost $1 billion for McGraw-Hill, with an initial bid of $34 a share for its stock, then trading at $26. The offer was later raised to $40.
 Mr. McGraw listened politely but was said to have been furious. A few days later, Newsweek reported, ''his face streaked with perspiration, his voice trembling with emotion, the chairman of McGraw-Hill formally presented his board's unanimous rejection.'' 
 Mr. McGraw publicly condemned American Express. It ''lacks the integrity, morality and sensitivity'' to merge with McGraw-Hill, he said, adding that the offer was ''illegal, unsolicited and improper.'' 
 A corporate drama ensued, featuring secret meetings, public name-calling, simmering family rivalries and threatened lawsuits and countersuits. In one instance, American Express representatives followed a family stockholder to a dental appointment in the hope of inducing him to sell.
 Mr. McGraw persuaded family stockholders to vote against the merger. The battle cost McGraw-Hill $3.4 million and American Express $2.4 million. 
 Mr. McGraw's critics argued that McGraw-Hill would have been better off financially as part of American Express and wondered what a professional manager who was not part of the family would have done. Barron's magazine suggested that the stockholders had gotten ''a raw deal,'' though 10 years later Robert M. Bleiberg wrote in his Barron's column that ''we owe Harold W. McGraw Jr. a forthright (and belated) retraction.'' 
 The episode gave Mr. McGraw and McGraw-Hill greater prominence on Wall Street. ''At least people know who we are now,'' he said. ''Three or four years ago we did a name-recognition survey, and somebody answered that McGraw-Hill was a small town north of Boston where a Revolutionary War battle was fought.''
 Harold Whittlesey McGraw Jr. was born in Brooklyn on Jan. 10, 1918, the grandson of James H. McGraw, McGraw-Hill's founder, and the elder of two sons of Harold Whittlesey McGraw, a former vice president of the company, and the former Louise Higgins. Mr. McGraw's younger brother, William, died in 2006. 
 Harold Jr. grew up steeped in the lore of his family's business, hearing much of it from his grandfather James H. McGraw, who had been a rural schoolteacher in western New York before entering the publishing business in the 1880s.
 After attending the Lawrenceville School and nearby Princeton University, graduating in 1940, Mr. McGraw was a captain in the Army Air Forces during World War II. He briefly worked in advertising and book retailing before joining the book division of the family business in 1947 as a sales representative.
 In 1940, he married Anne Per-Lee. She died in 2002. Besides his son Harold, who is known as Terry and lives in Darien, Mr. McGraw is survived by another son, Robert, of Greenwich, Conn., who serves on the company's board; a daughter, Suzanne McGraw, also of Darien; eight grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Another son, Thomas, died in 2006.
 Mr. McGraw retired as McGraw-Hill chairman in 1988, at 70, the mandatory retirement age he had imposed. He served for 25 years on the board of Princeton University Press, 16 as president, and gave large sums to the university, literacy programs and public libraries. 
 He had the title of chairman emeritus, a post that came with an office at McGraw-Hill's headquarters and that allowed him to stay abreast of its activities.
 ''If you stop me in the lobby for a chat, you'll make my day,'' he told his colleagues. ''If you stop by the office for some advice, you'll make my week.''

HEADLINE: After Health Vote, Democrats Are Threatened With Violence

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; Charlie Savage, Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Robert Pear and Janie Lorber contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Democratic lawmakers have received death threats and been the victims of vandalism because of their votes in favor of the health care bill, lawmakers and law enforcement officials said Wednesday, as the Congressional debate over the issue headed toward a bitter and divisive conclusion.
 Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland and the majority leader, said at least 10 House members had raised concerns about their personal security since Sunday's climactic vote, and Mr. Hoyer characterized the cases as serious.
 At least two Congressional district offices were vandalized and Representative Louise M. Slaughter, a senior Democrat from New York, received a phone message threatening sniper attacks against lawmakers and their families. 
 Ms. Slaughter also reported that a brick was thrown through a window of her office in Niagara Falls, and Representative Gabrielle Giffords, Democrat of Arizona, said Monday that her Tucson office was vandalized after the vote. 
 The Associated Press reported that the authorities in Virginia were investigating a cut propane line to an outdoor grill at the home of a brother of Representative Tom Perriello of Virginia, after the address was mistakenly listed on a Tea Party Web site as the residence of the congressman. Representative Bart Stupak, Democrat of Michigan and a central figure in the measure's abortion provisions, reported receiving threatening phone calls. 
 Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the highest-ranking black lawmaker in the House, said he received an anonymous fax showing the image of a noose.
 As they prepared to leave Washington for a two-week recess, House Democrats met with Capitol Police and representatives of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to get advice on security issues, and they pressed Republicans to join them in renouncing threats and violence. 
 ''What we want to be sure is that people know that these threats have no place in our country,'' Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. ''We have a legitimate disagreement. We have passed landmark legislation, and there are strong differences of opinion about it. Our Constitution allows us to have a lively debate in that regard, and that does not include threats to violence.''
 Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, spoke out against violence but encouraged Americans to continue to find ways to counter the legislation. ''I know many Americans are angry over this health care bill, and that Washington Democrats just aren't listening,'' Mr. Boehner said in a statement. ''But, as I've said, violence and threats are unacceptable. That's not the American way. We need to take that anger and channel it into positive change.'' 
 Republicans also noted that their members have received threats in the past and that Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, was recently the target of abuse when he blocked added unemployment benefits. 
 Still, the dark and personal tone of the final stages of the health fight could complicate Republican efforts to maintain their attacks on the legislation if they are seen as inciting an undue level of outrage and, conversely, could bolster Democrats if opponents of the measure are seen as breaching the boundaries of civility.
 The reports of threats, coming after a tense weekend when protesters hurled racial and homophobic slurs at Democrats and spit on one congressman, left many Democrats shaken.
 Paul Bresson, a spokesman for the F.B.I., said the bureau was aware of several threats against members of Congress and was investigating them jointly with the Capitol Police, which handles security for Congress, and local law enforcement agencies. He declined to say how many cases there were or to describe them in detail. ''We are looking at them and taking them very seriously,'' Mr. Bresson said.
 Democrats also raised questions about some of the imagery and phrases being employed by Republicans against the Democratic architects and backers of the measure, noting that a Republican National Committee Web site urging supporters to fire Ms. Pelosi has her surrounded by flames. A Facebook page of Sarah Palin singling out Democratic members for defeat because of their votes defines their districts by the crosshairs of a weapon's sight.
 Republicans dismissed objections to the imagery. ''The message of our Web site is clear, it is time to put Nancy Pelosi out of a job,'' said Katie Wright, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee.
 In the Senate, Democrats sought to finish changes to the new health legislation by plowing through dozens of Republican efforts to change the measure and force a second House vote.
 Senate Democrats accused Republicans of delay tactics and of forcing the cancellation of unrelated committee sessions over anger about the health measure. 
 Senators Carl Levin of Michigan and Claire McCaskill of Missouri were furious that Republican objections prevented hearings Wednesday on the Pentagon budget and the training of Afghan police officers.
 ''The obstruction has become mindless, it's become purposeless,'' Mr. Levin said.
 Republicans offered numerous proposals to highlight what they see as flaws in the health law and to force Democrats into taking politically difficult votes. One amendment, proposed by Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, would prohibit coverage of Viagra for child molesters. 
 The Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said the passel of amendments showed Republicans were ''putting roadblocks in front of anything that we do to try to improve health care for America.''
 ''How serious could they be, offering an amendment dealing with Viagra for rapists?'' Mr. Reid asked. 
 On Wednesday night, the Senate voted, 57 to 42, to kill the amendment. As midnight approached, Senate Democrats had voted down more than 20 Republican amendments, preventing any changes to the bill and keeping it on track to final passage. 
 Republicans said they would not curtail their campaign against the measure even if the changes pass the Senate and become law. ''We've fought on behalf of the American people this week -- and we'll continue to fight until this bill is repealed and replaced with common-sense ideas that solve our problems without dismantling the health care system we have,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, the Republican leader. 
 One day after he signed the health measure into law during a festive East Room ceremony, President Obama held a far different ceremony on Wednesday: a closed-door Oval Office session where, in the presence of 13 anti-abortion Democrats including Mr. Stupak, he put his signature to an executive order barring federal financing for abortion. The order helped secure House passage of the bill by securing the votes of Mr. Stupak and others. After Mr. Obama signed it, at 2:34 p.m., the White House released an official photograph -- the only coverage of the event.
 White House officials also held a conference call with reporters to argue for the clear constitutionality of the new health insurance law based on court precedents, and one called lawsuits being initiated against it by attorneys general around the country ''completely without merit.''

HEADLINE: Despite Draft Effort, Republican Rejects Primary Run to Oppose Gillibrand in Fall

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO; David M. Halbfinger contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Dan Senor, a private equity executive and former military adviser to President George W. Bush, has decided not to challenge Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand in the election this fall, he said in an interview on Wednesday.
 Mr. Senor, 38, was considered the leading Republican in a field of relatively low-profile possible candidates, and had drawn expressions of support from a growing list of party leaders, including former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, who urged him to enter the race.
 Mr. Senor said that after studying a potential campaign, he concluded that ''it just wasn't the right time for me in my business life and, more importantly, my family life.'' He pointed to his two young sons and his work as a founder of an investment firm, Rosemont Solebury Capital Management. 
 ''My family would have to endure an absentee father,'' he said. As for his work, he said, ''I would have had to unwind myself from the business.''
 Mr. Senor said his decision was not based on the professional future of his wife, the CNN anchorwoman Campbell Brown. If he were to run, many speculated, Ms. Brown might need to recuse herself from her on-camera role, in which she frequently covers politics.
 A person familiar with the situation said CNN had given Ms. Brown and Mr. Senor ''lots of time and space to work this out.''
 Mr. Senor's explanation for staying out of the election echoes that of Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the publisher of The Daily News, who had cited his small children and hectic work schedule for not running.
 Indeed, deciding not to oppose Ms. Gillibrand, a Democrat whom Gov. David A. Paterson appointed to the seat last year, has become a trend. Harold E. Ford Jr., a former Tennessee congressman, chose to remain on the sidelines after a very public flirtation with challenging Ms. Gillibrand for the Democratic nomination. 
 Speaking of Mr. Senor's decision, John Faso, who had encouraged his candidacy and was the Republican candidate for governor in 2006, said, ''It think it's unfortunate.'' He said he believed that Mr. Senor had realized that putting together a winning campaign would have required an earlier start. 
 ''Looking at these things from the outside,'' Mr. Faso said, ''having run statewide twice, it always is a lot easier to talk about it than to do it.'' 
 So far, three Republicans have said they will run: Bruce A. Blakeman, who dropped out of the New York mayoral race last year; David Malpass, a former economist at Bear Stearns who worked in the Reagan administration; and Joseph J. DioGuardi, a former member of the House. 
 Political aides to Ms. Gillibrand had signaled that they would attack Mr. Senor for his work as a military adviser in Iraq, where he served as the chief spokesman for the coalition government after the American-led invasion in 2003. But Mr. Senor said his decision was not based on anything he had detected in public polls, or worries about losing.
 ''This is a winnable race,'' he said. 
 Mr. Senor said he had looked forward to debating the issues of ''skyrocketing taxes and spending,'' President Obama's health care legislation and a ''troubling'' American foreign policy, which he said had left Democrats politically vulnerable.
 According to those close to Mr. Senor, he had begun to line up a network of financial contributors, including Paul Singer and Roger Hertog, two prominent New York Republicans, as well as many supporters of the 2008 presidential campaign of Mitt Romney, a former Massachusetts governor.
 Mr. Senor spent Tuesday night and Wednesday morning letting those supporters know he would not be a candidate, these people said.

HEADLINE: Times Co. Settles Claim In Singapore

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
The New York Times Company has settled a claim by leaders of Singapore's government that they were smeared by an Op-Ed piece in The International Herald Tribune, publishing an apology in The Herald Tribune on Wednesday and paying about $114,000 to the leaders. 
 Last month, The Herald Tribune, wholly owned by the Times Company, published a column by Philip Bowring that referred to ''dynastic politics'' and listed the leaders of many countries, including Lee Hsien Loong, the prime minister, and his father, Lee Kuan Yew, a former prime minister. That column has been removed from the paper's Web site.
 The case stems from a similar one in 1994, when Mr. Bowring, a former editor of The Far Eastern Economic Review and a freelance contributor to The Herald Tribune, wrote a column in The Herald Tribune that also referred to ''dynastic politics'' in East Asian countries, including Singapore.
 In that case, three of the country's leaders threatened legal action: the elder Mr. Lee, who was prime minister from 1959-90 and remained a power in government; his son, who was a deputy prime minister at the time; and Goh Chok Tong, the prime minister at the time. 
 The Herald Tribune, then co-owned by the Times Company and The Washington Post Company, published an apology saying that it had implied that the younger Mr. Lee owed his job to nepotism, and the paper and Mr. Bowring promised not to do so again. According to some news reports, the paper also paid a financial settlement. 
 Singaporean leaders have a history of taking the offensive against news organizations for language that would be legally protected -- or even considered relatively innocuous -- in the United States, threatening legal action or restricting the sales of publications. They have won apologies and monetary payments in several of those cases.
 On Wednesday, The Herald Tribune published an apology to the same three leaders that referred to the 1994 agreement and said that Mr. Bowring's recent column ''may have been understood by readers to infer that the younger Mr. Lee did not achieve his position through merit.'' It added that ''this inference was not intended.''
 A lawyer for the three men, Davinder Singh, said that The Herald Tribune and Mr. Bowring had agreed to pay them 160,000 Singapore dollars, equivalent to about $114,000 in United States dollars, in addition to legal costs. 
 Refusing to make any statement beyond the apology, the Times Company would not confirm or deny the monetary settlement.
 ''Nobody in most of the world would bat an eye about'' such a piece, said Stuart D. Karle, a former general counsel of The Wall Street Journal, who has handled disputes with Singapore's leadership but was not involved in this case. But in that country, he said, there is often ''the presumption that there's a hidden message'' about nepotism or corruption in news coverage, and if that turns into a libel case, a news organization faces ''a near-certainty of losing.''

HEADLINE: China, Holding Upper Hand, Says It Will Not Adjust Policy on the Exchange Rate

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Despite mounting pressure in Congress for the Obama administration to declare China a currency manipulator, the Chinese government is giving no indication that it will change its exchange rate policy. 
 After meeting with officials at the Treasury and Commerce Departments on Wednesday, China's deputy commerce minister, Zhong Shan, told reporters, ''The Chinese government will not succumb to foreign pressures to adjust our exchange rate.'' 
 Mr. Zhong reiterated a statement this month by the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, who said he did not believe the currency, the renminbi, was undervalued. 
 ''It is wrong for the United States to jump to the conclusion that China is manipulating currency from the sheer fact that China is enjoying a trade surplus,'' Mr. Zhong told reporters in a meeting at the Chinese Embassy. ''Besides, it's wrong for the United States to press for the appreciation of the renminbi and threaten to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese experts. This is unacceptable to China.''
 Mr. Zhong said that ''the basic stability of the renminbi'' was generally beneficial, because ''a great surge in the value of the renminbi would hurt the economies of developing countries, especially the least-developed countries.''
 Mr. Zhong's visit to Washington comes weeks before an April 15 deadline for the Treasury to deliver its semiannual report on foreign exchange. Many economists believe that China has deliberately undervalued its currency to support its export-oriented economy. 
 China's position has raised the ire of members of both parties in Congress, who say that the exchange-rate problem is holding back job growth in the United States. Two senators, Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, have introduced legislation that would effectively compel the Treasury to cite the Chinese currency for ''misalignment.'' 
 The Treasury has not found China to be manipulating its currency since 1994, making the argument, among others, that manipulation involves intent. Successive administrations have argued that it would be more fruitful to convince China that its interests would be served by allowing the renminbi to appreciate, a move that could stimulate domestic consumption in China and help wean its economy off a reliance on American consumers. 
 With unemployment near 10 percent in the United States, Congress has seemingly run out of patience with that argument. 
 ''We're fed up,'' Mr. Graham said on Tuesday. ''China's mercantilist policies are hurting the rest of the world, not just America. It helped create the global recession that we're in. The Chinese want to be treated as a developing country, but they're a global giant, the leading exporter in the world.'' 
 The Senate bill would let the Commerce Department retaliate against currency misalignment by imposing duties or tariffs. ''The only thing that will make China move is tough legislation,'' Mr. Schumer said.
 The two senators pointed to a new study by the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-backed research organization, saying the growing trade deficit between China and the United States resulted in the elimination or displacement of 2.4 million American jobs between 2001 and 2008.
 House leaders have taken a less combative stance. At a Ways and Means Committee hearing Wednesday, its chairman, Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said of the currency policy: ''Like so many other trade issues, it gets caught up in the polarization that grips trade issues -- free trade vs. protectionism -- a grip that I have believed harmful and reject.'' 
 Similarly, the top Republican on the committee, Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, said it would be better for the United States to work through the Group of 20 meetings and the International Monetary Fund to persuade China to reform its banking and financial sectors, open its markets and improve protection of intellectual property. 
 ''Focusing on the currency valuation issue to the exclusion of the others is more likely to lead to collective frustration than to any improvement in the health of the critical U.S.-Chinese economic relationship,'' Mr. Camp said.
 Niall Ferguson, a historian at Harvard, told the committee that the way the renminbi is currently valued held back the economic recovery by artificially raising the price of American exports; contributed to a ''dangerous overheating'' of China's economy; risked unleashing a ''protectionist backlash''; and made it ever-harder for China to revalue the currency, because the value of its foreign reserves would diminish.
 But he urged the United States to ''pursue currency realignment on a multilateral rather than solely on a bilateral basis.''

HEADLINE: After Health Care Win, Democrats Put Financial Overhaul at Top of Agenda

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Buoyed by passage of landmark health care legislation, the Obama administration and Democrats in Congress said Wednesday that an overhaul of financial regulations was the next legislative priority.
 The legislation appeared to be gaining momentum, as two crucial Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee, Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and Bob Corker of Tennessee, said they expected the overhaul to pass this year even though they had concerns about some provisions.
 A Democratic strategy appeared to be emerging: expressing confidence that the measure would pass and urging Republicans to help shape legislation that they could support, rather than trying to block it. 
 ''When we come back from recess, the No. 1 issue for the U.S. Congress will be this bill in the United States Senate,'' Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the Democratic chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said after meeting at the White House with President Obama.
 The House voted along party lines in December to approve a regulatory overhaul similar to one proposed by the White House last summer.
 Described as the most sweeping change in financial rules since the Depression, the legislation would create a council to detect and avert serious risks to the financial system.
 It would also expand the Federal Reserve's oversight over the largest and most interconnected financial companies, create an agency to regulate mortgages and credit cards, and regulate many of the over-the-counter derivatives that helped bring about the 2008 financial crisis.
 The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, who was at the White House meeting, said that Democrats were emboldened after Sunday's health care vote by the House.
 ''There are Republicans I serve with in the Senate who frankly don't want to just say 'no policy' when it comes to major legislative initiatives,'' Mr. Dodd said. ''And they would like to be part of this debate and offer constructive ideas to this proposal.'' 
 He added: ''So I'm much more optimistic. In light of what happened on health care, I think, frankly the outcome there I think has strengthened our hand in reaching out to people who would like to be part of the solution.''
 The health care vote even prompted Mr. Frank to make a quip about the financial overhaul. ''There are going to be death panels enacted by the Congress this year -- but they're death panels for large financial institutions that can't make it,'' he said. 
 Mr. Dodd's committee sent the bill to the full Senate on Monday on a party-line vote, after Republicans decided it would be better to bring their amendments to the floor of the Senate and not try to hold up the bill in committee.
 In contrast to the economic stimulus and the health care overhaul, where the White House outlined broad goals but largely left it to Congress to shape the legislation, the administration has been intensely engaged in drafting the legislation. 
 ''The president expects that we will finish financial reform in the next couple of months, certainly by the time we mark the second anniversary of the financial collapse in the early fall,'' Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said.
 The administration has been trying to make it difficult for the Republicans to vote no by tapping into populist resentment over the bank bailouts. ''People are going to have an opportunity to weigh in on behalf of the banks or on behalf of consumers,'' Mr. Gibbs said. ''And I'll let their vote on that dictate which side of that ledger they feel most comfortable on.''
 The Democratic momentum appeared to be occurring amid a split in the Republican ranks.
 Mr. Corker, who had negotiated with Mr. Dodd after an earlier round of talks between Mr. Dodd and the top Republican on the committee, Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, fell apart, said in a statement that ''our hand has been weakened now that the bill has left the committee on a party-line vote,'' calling it ''a strategic error.'' 
 The comments were an implicit criticism of Mr. Shelby, who met with Republican members of the committee in the afternoon to plan strategy. 
 The legislation that the Senate will take up after a two-week recess has critics on both sides.
 While it would lead to higher capital requirements, stricter regulation and new limits on risk-taking by banks, it would not break up any large banks, as some critics from the left have urged.
 Republicans and business associations have raised other objections. They are concerned about the scope of authority for the new consumer agency, as well as new rules governing the trading of derivatives and provisions intended to end the ''too big to fail'' phenomenon.
 The United States Chamber of Commerce has spent $3 million on an advertising campaign opposing the consumer agency. 
 In a sharply worded speech to the chamber on Wednesday, the deputy Treasury secretary, Neal S. Wolin, criticized the campaign.
 ''That campaign is not designed to improve the House and Senate bills,'' he said. ''It is designed to defeat them. It is designed to delay reform until the memory of the crisis fades and the political will for change dies out.'' 
 R. Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the chamber, later issued a statement accusing Mr. Wolin of ''political grandstanding and distortion of facts.''

HEADLINE: New Home Sales Weaken in February

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Sales of new homes weakened to a record low in February, dimming prospects for a swift recovery for the housing market.
 Over all, sales were down 2.2 percent, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 308,000. Economists had forecast a 1.9 percent rise.
 Those numbers followed a similarly bleak report on Tuesday that showed sales of existing homes dropped in February, despite a generous government tax credit meant to lure buyers. 
 Taken together, the bleak data resurrected concerns that the market could fall into another downturn, with new downward pressure on prices as the supply of homes increases but demand dwindles. 
 ''It was dismal no matter how one tries to slice and dice it,'' Joshua Shapiro, an economist for MFR Inc. wrote in a research note. 
 Sales of new homes have now fallen 23 percent since October. Sales rose at a rapid pace last fall as buyers rushed to take advantage of an $8,000 tax credit before its original expiration date. The credit has since been extended to April 30, but so far there has been no evidence of a buying frenzy. 
 Mr. Shapiro said he expected the credit to bolster sales somewhat over the next several months. But beyond that, the forecast is murkier. Weaning the housing market from the tax credit ''is going to be a difficult process,'' he wrote.
 The drop in February was partly the result of stronger results the previous month: the government said sales reached a rate of 315,000 units in January, better than the 309,000 rate originally forecast. Economists said a series of snowstorms in February may also have contributed to the decline, though they reiterated that the underlying data was still weak.
 A separate report on Wednesday showed businesses continued to ramp up spending on durable goods in February, raising hopes that a vigorous rebound for manufacturing may help drive a turnaround for the United States economy.
 Orders for long-lasting goods rose 0.5 percent in February, the Commerce Department said, fueled in part by greater demand from abroad and inventory restocking. 
 But a closely watched measure that excludes volatile aircraft and military orders fell 0.6 percent, suggesting a fast-paced resurgence in orders may be slowing slightly. Severe winter weather may have also hampered growth, economists said.
 Paul Dales, an economist for Capital Economics in Toronto, said the results were ''further evidence that manufacturers are enjoying a healthy recovery.'' 
 Manufacturing activity has grown briskly since last summer, accompanies by a steady rise in business confidence. Durable goods orders have increased for three consecutive months now, and they rose 3.9 percent in January. They were nearly 8 percent higher than the levels of February 2009.
 Economists said that momentum was probably sustainable in the short term, but could weaken later in the year as government stimulus programs end and restocking slows.
 ''Business decision makers, still uncertain about the long-term outlook for economic growth, are exercising caution with regards to capital spending,'' Cliff Waldman, an economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, wrote in a research note.
 A surge in exports has helped prop up orders. The cheap dollar has made American products more appealing overseas, bolstering demand.
 But some sectors continue to lag. Transportation fell 0.7 percent in February after a drop in car orders. Analysts said that may have been related to Toyota's decision to halt production at several plants after widespread concern over the safety of its vehicles.

HEADLINE: Switch Banks? You Might Find There's a Perk in It for You

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
THIS should be a golden age for banks that want to persuade people to ditch their checking accounts and start fresh elsewhere.
Fees became so high that the federal government stepped in to regulate overdrafts. Interest rates have fallen so low that many banks refuse to pay interest to many checking account customers.
And bank failures have become such a regular occurrence that Fridays in the industry are no longer an excuse to go home early. 
Instead, people hang around to chew over the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's bank seizure announcement on what has become known as ''Bank Fail Friday.''
Amid all of this, you would think people would be switching right and left. And you would be wrong.
Roughly 10 to 15 percent of households move their checking account from one bank to another each year, a figure that hasn't changed substantially in recent years, according to several industry consultants and market researchers.
So why do people stick around? For at least three main reasons, all of them flawed.
The Need for a Branch
Some people simply won't do business with a bank that has no branches or none nearby. And it all starts with opening the account.
''The vast majority of people want to come in and sit down and talk about how they want to bank,'' said Mark Hogan, who runs the East Coast branch network of Bank of America, which has just over 6,000 branches, more than any other bank in the United States. And you can't have that face-to-face initial meeting unless your bank has a branch near you.
Other people are worried about cash flow. If they make frequent deposits with actual checks, they want to be able to show up in person and get the paper processed quickly. People who live far from a branch or need to mail in deposits could wait several days before having access to that money.
USAA Bank has solved this by letting customers snap pictures of checks with their Android phone or iPhone and submit deposits that way. ING Direct is introducing a similar system later this year. PerkStreet Financial allows customers to send them overnight free from any United Parcel Service store.
But for all these solutions, many customers still yearn for a physical building. During the 2008 financial crisis, ''people saw lines outside of some institutions, and people liked knowing they could go to a branch and get their money out,'' said Aaron Fine, a partner and retail banking specialist at Oliver Wyman, a consulting firm. ''With an online bank, what are you going to do, drive to their headquarters?''
The answer, of course, is no. If your bank failed, the F.D.I.C. would make sure you received your money within its coverage limits. But most people aren't thinking that way.
''You could ask whether people need the branch physically or whether it's really just in their mind that they want it to be there,'' Mr. Fine said. ''And I think it's more the latter.''
Avoiding A.T.M. Fees
Many people bank at branches closest to their home or office, not because they ever go inside the branch but because they want to avoid paying fees each time they take out money from another bank's machines.
This, too, may be misguided. Many online banks will reimburse all or most of the A.T.M. fees that other banks levy each month. Both ING and PerkStreet take another approach, contracting with a network of A.T.M.'s that, they claim, gives their customers access to far more locations with fee-free machines than the major banks themselves offer.
The dollar or two here or there seems not to bother many younger consumers, according to Robert Hedges, the managing partner of Mercatus, a private equity and consulting firm focused on retail banks. ''They don't remember a time when it wasn't there,'' he said. ''And they pay little fees for things all of the time, like on iTunes.''
Automated Payments
That same comfort with technology may lead some consumers to feel stuck with their current bank. After all, if they've set up enough automated monthly bill payments, they believe, it would simply take too long to turn them off, then turn them on again with another bank.
Indeed, tracking down all of your billers and making the changes could easily take a couple of hours. Then, you would need to worry about whether the change will go through instantly. If it doesn't, and some billers still draw on the old account for another month or two, you need to leave money behind with the old account.
Meanwhile, you must move money into the new account to start the bills flowing from there.
''Once you understand that 60 to 70 percent of the population is living paycheck to paycheck, the bottom line is that you can't move the account if you don't have extra cash to leave behind for two months,'' said Hank Israel, a director with Novantas, a consulting firm.
One solution is to turn off automated payments for a few months until your new account is up and running.
The Case for Switching
So why would someone jump through all of those hoops? Banks are making a more aggressive case for switching. A number of community banks offer 3 or 4 percent interest on deposits if you're a heavy debit card user. Search for them at checkingfinder.com.
ING Direct, meanwhile, preaches simplicity with its Electric Orange checking account: No minimum balance, interest on deposits and a line of credit in lieu of expensive overdrafts.
PerkStreet's pitch, meanwhile, is a rewards program that gives debit card users about 1 percent of their spending back in the form of gift cards, far more than most standard bank debit rewards programs pay.
Dan O'Malley, PerkStreet's chief executive and a former bricks and mortar banker at Capital One, said this was only fair. ''People who don't want to walk into a branch should be getting a better deal,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Marching on the Moneymen

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE and LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
When the city of Los Angeles started looking into its complex financial contracts with banks earlier this year, some council members turned to an unusual corner for financial advice: labor unions.
 Turns out that union leaders had amassed an armory of research on derivatives, mortgage foreclosures and even Wall Street pay as part of their effort to hold bankers accountable for the economic pain they helped cause in Los Angeles and across the country. 
 Unions have criticized Wall Street before. But their attacks have taken on a new shape, both in ferocity and style, over the last 18 months, ever since the federal government doled out billions of dollars in bank bailouts. 
 Why? Labor leaders say the fortunes of banks and unions are linked more than people realize. Wall Street manages union pension portfolios worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Much of that is invested in financial institutions, giving unions a loud voice as shareholders. 
 Then there are all the unionized workers whose fates are indirectly shaped by the world of high finance. The jobs of hundreds of thousands of union members, like police officers and teachers, have been threatened by municipal budget cuts, made worse in some cases by exotic investments gone bad. 
 More abstractly, union leaders are framing their fight against Wall Street as a symbolic one, underscoring America's large disparities in wealth and wages.
 ''Many unions see that they need to be responsible for not just members' needs at the bargaining table, but other hardships in their lives, like foreclosures and high mortgage costs,'' said Peter Dreier, a political science professor at Occidental College in Los Angeles.
 Unions are holding up many of their own members as victims of the banks' bad bets, like subprime mortgages, and are providing a steady stream of research in an effort to demystify the exotic financial products that they say are harming dozens of cities. Unions have also helped underwrite Americans for Financial Reform, a prominent group pushing for further bank regulation.
 Labor leaders were among the first to call for the resignation of Bank of America's chief executive, who did retire months later. Unions issued a scathing report on bank bonuses, months before the federal pay czar presented his findings, and they criticized Goldman Sachs's bonus pool just before the bank said its chief would receive only stock.
 This month, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the nation's main labor federation, has organized 200 protests nationwide to publicly shame bankers, calling for new taxes on bankers' bonuses and on speculative short-term financial transactions -- in the hope of collecting tens of billions of dollars to finance a job creation program. 
 ''They played Russian roulette with our economy, and while Wall Street cashed in, they left Main Street holding the bag,'' Richard L. Trumka, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, said last Friday at a rally in Philadelphia. ''They gorge themselves in a trough of taxpayers' dollars, while we struggle to make ends meet.'' 
 Labor is directly at odds with Wall Street on unionization drives and many other matters. Banks and private equity firms own stakes in many businesses that unions would like to unionize, like nursing home chains and food service companies. Labor groups like the Service Employees International Union and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. are pressuring financial companies not to oppose union membership drives. 
 It is hard to know for certain whether the unions' efforts have affected decisions made by Wall Street firms. But for cities like Los Angeles, feeling the squeeze of lower tax receipts, the service employees' pressure campaign seemed to have had an impact.
 ''They knew more about our own water deal than I knew,'' said Richard Alarcon, a Los Angeles councilman, referring to an interest-rate swap between the city's water system and the Bank of New York Mellon that converted the system's variable-rate bonds into bonds with a fixed rate. ''They also knew the dynamics of swap deals, and they were very helpful.''
 As the city faces a deficit of nearly $500 million, the council was unhappy that Los Angeles would have to pay Bank of New York millions of dollars a year.
 ''Our members don't like it any more than other Americans when cities have less firefighters, less teachers or less police officers,'' said Andy Stern, president of the service employees' union.
 The labor protests against the banks sometimes have murky targets. This month, service employees joined community leaders on the City Hall steps in Oakland, Calif., to denounce Goldman Sachs for arranging interest-rate swaps that have the city paying the bank millions a year. 
 After that rally, union leaders led a march to a local Citigroup branch. Goldman declined to comment, but a Citigroup representative scoffed. 
 ''We weren't even involved in those deals,'' said Alex Samuelson, a Citigroup spokesman. ''We were just a symbolic place to go and rail against Wall Street. You can't go to a Goldman Sachs branch.''
 Many bankers criticize the protests, saying they make lots of noise but often accomplish little. Steve Bartlett, president of the industry's Financial Services Roundtable, who has been the target of several union-led protests, including one outside his home on a Sunday morning, said, ''Protests can be misguided or even damaging to your cause.''
 While union leaders say they are championing the concerns of Main Street, their antibank campaign has certainly advanced some of labor's longtime objectives, like unionizing workers. 
 For instance, the S.E.I.U. has pressed several banks and private equity firms to agree to allow card check -- a process that makes unionization easier -- at companies in which they own stakes. 
 Service employees officials say they urged Goldman Sachs, which owns part of the food service company Aramark, to get Aramark to accept card check and not oppose an organizing drive. In December, the union's president, Mr. Stern, even met with Goldman's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, about universal health care and other labor-related issues.
 Labor unions are using some of their members' hard-luck stories to frame their battle as one between the haves and the have-nots, and in some cases that tactic is advancing the unions' traditional goals in contract talks. 
 In February, for example, the service employees' union publicized that one of its members cleaned the office of U.S. Bank's chief in Minneapolis. That janitor, Rosalina Gomez, was facing foreclosure, and the union publicized that U.S. Bank had purchased her home in the foreclosure.
 Steve Dale, a spokesman for the bank, said the union was attacking U.S. Bank even though JPMorgan Chase was the bank servicing Ms. Gomez's mortgage. U.S. Bank, he said, was just the trustee, holding the loan for a mortgage bond.
 ''We did not service the loan,'' Mr. Dale said. ''We did not originate the loan, and we were not the financial entity that placed it into foreclosure. Do you understand what a trustee does?''
 That aside, when the union threatened to have Ms. Gomez approach U.S. Bank's chief, Richard K. Davis, at an awards luncheon, the bank rushed to set up a meeting between Ms. Gomez and JPMorgan. Fifty union supporters were at the site of the luncheon to conduct a silent vigil, with several reporters on hand.
 Also at that time, the union was in contract negotiations with Ms. Gomez's employer, the janitorial company that cleans U.S. Bank's headquarters. Javier Morillo-Alicea, a leader of the union's Minneapolis local, said its effort to embarrass the bank helped persuade the cleaning company to reach a contract that raised wages and provided better health insurance for the janitors.
 ''We put a lot of pressure on the bank,'' he said, ''and that led to a really good contract settlement in a tough economy.''

HEADLINE: How to Self-Diagnose Your Financial Health

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
YOU probably get an annual physical. Your doctor will ask about your concerns, take your blood pressure and 30 minutes later you're out of the paper gown and off to work -- maybe with a new prescription for Lipitor.
A similar annual checkup takes place in another type of practitioner's office: financial planners. But instead of analyzing your good and bad cholesterol levels, a planner may evaluate your good debts (mortgage) and bad debts (credit card). And instead of testing your reflexes, they may look at your savings and assess your ability to respond to a financial emergency.
''A lot can happen in a year,'' said Andrew V. Tignanelli, president of the Financial Consulate in Hunt Valley, Md. ''Markets change, phone numbers change, beneficiaries change, tax laws change and your life changes.''
With that notion in mind, we asked planners what they ask their clients during their annual financial physicals. Their questions can help you diagnose your financial situation: 
Is your net worth growing?
Your net worth is one of the best barometers for measuring financial health, and it provides an easy way to detect whether a longer-term problem may be emerging, several planners said. To make the calculation, you simply subtract what you owe (your liabilities) from what you own (your assets). So even if your assets are not growing, your net worth will improve if you are paying down debts. There are tools and calculators on the Web that can serve as a guide, like one at Mint.com, which can be linked to most of your accounts and provide real-time updates. (Not that you want to obsess over this number. You just want to measure your progress each year).
''One of the quickest ways to take the financial temperature of a client is to track their balance sheet from year to year,'' said Walt Mozdzer, a financial planner in West Des Moines, Iowa. ''If you track the client's net worth progression, you can quickly tell if they are saving money, living within their means and/or more likely be on track to reaching their financial goals.''
A decline in net worth isn't always a bad thing, but you want to understand why it has dropped, explained Cheryl Krueger, a financial planner in Chicago. ''Are your assets lower because you're spending more than you're earning or because of an external factor like a market downturn? Are your debts increasing or decreasing?''
Increasing debts may be O.K. if you are advancing your education or starting a business, she added, but obviously not if you are simply spending to keep up with the Joneses.
How are your ratios?
Several experts also recommend looking at a few crucial numbers, or ratios: your debt-to-income ratio, your savings rate and emergency funds.
''It begins to give us a good snapshot and longer-term trend of what is happening in their financial lives and whether changes need to be implemented,'' said Patrick Collins of Greenspring Wealth Management in Towson, Md. ''We set a target for each one of them.''
The targets will vary depending on where one is in life. Younger people should dedicate no more than 30 percent of gross income to pay for all debt (car payments, mortgage, student loans, revolving debts), he said, and that should gradually decline to zero by the time they are ready to retire. As for savings, he said, everyone should aim to save 15 percent of their salaries, while empty-nesters preparing for retirement should rev up their savings to 20 to 25 percent. Understandably, you may miss these targets when you are struggling to pay for your children's college or saving for a home (especially on the coasts). Meanwhile, your emergency fund should contain about six months of expenses in cash, Mr. Collins said, while retirees should set aside one year's worth of fixed expenses.
Are you spending more than you earn?
Using an automated service is probably the easiest way to track spending. Many experts recommend using one of the popular programs like Quicken or online services like Mint.com, Wesabe.com or YouNeedABudget.com. Obviously, if you are living on a fixed income, this becomes even more important -- establishing monthly spending targets makes it easier to track.
''The problem with most people's finances is that they talk about it, but they never consolidate and organize their financial data in an easily manageable way so that they can know at any given time exactly where they stand,'' said Bedda D'Angelo, president of Fiduciary Solutions in Durham, N.C.
What has changed in your life in the last year?
Big life events can disrupt even the best strategies. Getting married, having a child or even becoming eligible for Social Security or Medicare will require that you make many financial decisions.
''The main question here is really, 'What has changed in my life that may change items in my financial plan?' '' said Rick Kahler, a financial planner in Rapid City, S.D. ''A person may need more or less insurance, update their estate planning, switch investment philosophy, save more or less for retirement.''
Are you still adequately insured?
Evaluating the costs and amounts of your homeowners', renters' and auto insurance policies should be an annual or biannual exercise. Consider raising your deductibles because that can lower your premiums. You might be able to lower your costs further by picking up an umbrella policy, which provides additional liability coverage, said Steve Podnos, a financial planner in Merritt Island, Fla. To do this, you would lower your liability coverage on all of your other policies to the minimum required by the umbrella policy, and then use the umbrella policy to pick up the difference, he said. This is especially important for families with teenagers.
''As kids turn 16 and begin driving, the family liability skyrockets,'' Mr. Podnos said. ''Anybody of any means should probably have an umbrella policy. It's the cheapest coverage you can get in terms of millions of dollars of coverage per premium dollar.''
Next, turn your attention to disability and life insurance coverage. Do you have enough? Too much? A good rule of thumb: about 20 times salary for life insurance (for one or both spouses) minus any other resources you may have. If you are approaching retirement, you might consider dropping some or all of your disability or life insurance coverage if you have it (and maybe swapping it for a long-term care policy).
''Once you hit your 60s, disability insurance is expensive,'' Mr. Podnos said. You are paying a premium for what will amount to only a few years of coverage, since most policies stop paying at age 65 or shortly thereafter.
Do you need to make any changes to your estate plan?
Start by making sure the beneficiaries you have named -- on things like your retirement accounts or your life insurance policies -- are up to date. You also want to review the people you have named as guardians for your children, executors, trustees and those with powers of attorney.
''Are they still the best choice for the job?'' asks Jon P. Beyrer, a financial planner in Solana Beach, Calif.
Estate planning documents like wills and trusts also need to be reviewed and possibly updated. (Did you buy anything this year that needs to be transferred to your revocable living trust?) And given the uncertainty surrounding the estate tax, families with taxable estates need to make sure their documents are written to account for that uncertainty.
''If it's more than five years old, it needs to be looked over by an attorney,'' Mr. Podnos added. Also make sure your advance health care directives and health care proxies or medical powers of attorney are in place.
How are you sleeping? Does your portfolio require any maintenance?
The economic collapse reminded many investors that they tend to overestimate their tolerance for risk and volatility. That is why several planners suggest asking whether you can meet your goals with fewer risky investments like stocks. This is also the time to see whether your portfolio requires rebalancing to your target asset allocations, which many planners recommend doing at least annually. As you get closer to retirement, financial planners also begin to project whether your portfolio and other sources of income can sustain your current lifestyle. If you are off track, you need to consider incorporating potential solutions to make up for the shortfall.
Have your outlook or goals changed? Are you happy?
At its core, financial planning is not simply about money. It is about finding the best way to finance what you want out of life, whether that is spending more time with family and friends or traveling. And planners use their annual checkups to help clients make sure they are doing that.
''We encourage people to ask themselves what they can do to be happier and better off a year from now, whether that is saving more money, paying off debt, changing careers or doing more charitable work,'' said Dan Serra, a financial planner in Plano, Tex. ''It's a mix of evaluating life and money.''

HEADLINE: Escaping From Poverty

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
Before I ask for a drumroll and reveal ''the secrets'' of fighting poverty, a bit of background:
 For a quarter-century after World War II, the United States made great progress against poverty. Then in the 1970s, we fumbled. Over the last 35 years, our economy has almost tripled in size, but, according to the United States Census Bureau, the number of Americans living below the poverty line has been stuck at roughly 1 in 8.
 One reason is that wages for blue-collar and other ordinary workers peaked in the early 1970s, after adjusting for inflation, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A second is the breakdown in the family and the explosion in single-parent households. A third is the quintupling of incarceration rates beginning in 1970, making it harder for impoverished young men to play a role in families or get decent jobs. 
 When those factors converge -- a young woman with a 10th-grade education trying to raise a couple of kids as a single parent -- poverty proves almost inescapable. Often the cycle is transmitted from generation to generation.
 Still, there's a reason for hope: We're getting a much better handle on what policies can overcome poverty. We're now seeing more experiments, modeled after randomized drug trials, that measure carefully whether an approach works and how cost-effective it is. Partly this reflects the rise of economists (at the expense of political scientists and do-gooders) and the rigor they pack in their briefcases.
 ''To make a difference, we have to do things that actually work,'' said Gordon Berlin, the president of MDRC, a research organization that pioneered the use of randomized trials to evaluate poverty-fighting strategies. ''In the last 15 to 20 years, we've begun to build a compelling body of evidence that policy makers and program operators can act on.''
 Here's a peek at some of the interventions that seem to make a difference (and there are many more):
 High-quality early childhood programs, before kids get behind. Much-studied examples include the Perry Preschool program in Michigan in the 1960s and the Abecedarian Project in North Carolina in the 1970s. Both worked with impoverished children who had much better outcomes than control groups. For example, those who had been through the Perry program were -- as adults, decades later -- only half as likely to go on welfare and much less likely to be arrested.
 Intensive efforts in the ninth grade (which is well known as education's Bermuda triangle, swallowing up poor students). A program called Talent Development in Philadelphia gave ninth graders a double dose of math and English and reduced absenteeism and significantly improved performance for at least the next couple of years. Tentative results suggest it is also improving high school graduation rates.
 Career academies. These keep students engaged in high school by teaching around career themes and partnering with local employers to give kids work experience. Eight years of follow-up research suggests that graduates are more likely to hold jobs and earn more money. 
 Jobs programs. One of the most successful is the ''jobs-plus'' demonstration, which trains people living in public housing to get jobs and gives them extra incentives to keep them. Participants thrive -- and the gains continue even years later, after the program ends. 
 The two most important interventions seem to be education and jobs. Schooling programs pay off from early childhood all the way through community college. And jobs programs lift entire families: even though one might worry about children getting less supervision with parents working, studies suggest that children then do better at school. 
 All this underscores a long-term cost of this recession: there are cuts in both education and schooling, harming the two most effective stairways out of poverty. That's tragic, and I hope we consider schooling and jobs every bit as important as our multibillion-dollar surge in Afghanistan. 
 In effect, what's needed to overcome poverty in part seems to be a change of culture, to break self-destructive behaviors -- resignation to unemployment, self-doubt, alcohol and drug abuse, disintegrating families, lack of engagement in children's education -- that create self-replicating cycles of poverty. The Harlem Children's Zone Promise Academy, a charter school where third graders from a disadvantaged neighborhood outperform their peers around New York City and New York State, offers a shining example of what is possible. 
 This wave of research suggests that there's no magic bullet, that helping people is hard, and that even when pilot programs succeed they can be difficult to scale up. But evidence also suggests that we increasingly have the tools to chip away at poverty. We know what to do if we just can summon the political will.

HEADLINE: Facing Competition, General Mills Lowers Forecast

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The cereal maker General Mills forecast full-year earnings below Wall Street expectations on Wednesday and may face more competition as consumers grow more willing to dine out, sending its shares lower. 
 Packaged foods makers have benefited as consumers stayed home to save money. Kendall J. Powell, the chief executive of General Mills, said that trend accelerated during the recession, though consumers had been eating more meals at home for the last several years.
 ''The new norm is they have shifted more in favor of food at home,'' Mr. Powell said in an interview.
 Aggressive price cutting in the food industry by retailers could also pressure companies like General Mills, who have been able to hold on to much of the increases they took when commodity prices increased in 2008.
 General Mills, which also makes Yoplait yogurt and Progresso soup, posted a profit of $332.5 million, or 96 cents a share, for the third quarter that ended Feb. 28, compared with $288.9 million, or 85 cents a share, a year earlier.
 Excluding one-time items, earnings were 97 cents a share. Analysts on average had forecast 93 cents, according to Thomson Reuters.
 For the year, General Mills raised its earnings view to $4.57 to $4.59 a share, excluding one-time items. That compares with its previous forecast of $4.52 to $4.57, and with analysts' estimates of $4.60.
 Overall sales rose 2.6 percent to $3.63 billion, slightly higher than the $3.62 billion that analysts had expected.
 Retail sales of the company's signature cereals rose 6 percent in the United States, General Mills said. The company had lower sales of Progresso soup, which led to flat volume and pushed sales in its meals division down 2 percent. Lower sales of soup have a larger effect on volume, which is measured in pounds, because cans of soup weigh more than boxes of cereal.
 The soup season was also weak for the largest competitor, Campbell Soup, which blamed discounting by competitors, like those that make frozen meals.
 Shares of General Mills fell $1.39, or 1.89 percent, to $72.18.

HEADLINE: Start Saving Early, And Keep an Eye On Shifting Needs

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
EVEN economic oracles would have trouble predicting their retirement needs with a high degree of precision.
But most Americans face that task anyhow, without having the slightest idea about what the future holds. Using sophisticated calculators and other tools can help, but they're only as good as the assumptions you feed into them -- about future earnings, how your portfolio will perform over time, the inflation rate, your tax bracket and more.
Yet we all yearn for some degree of certainty.
''That is why people are so disenchanted,'' said Milo M. Benningfield, a financial planner in San Francisco. ''Financial planning is being sold to them, and they see it as a purely quantitative process using variables over which they don't have the least bit of control. And that breeds cynicism.'' 
Throwing up our hands and doing nothing is not an option. So several financial planners are recommending a not-so-radical approach, one that is simple in theory but challenging in practice: formulate a reasonable savings plan early on, but one that doesn't require you to suspend your life until retirement. And instead of getting caught up in assumptions or being overwhelmed by market uncertainty, focus on the things you can control and make continual adjustments over the course of your career.
''It's not in the least an attempt to predict what will happen,'' Mr. Benningfield added. ''It's a way of creating a flexibility, a mind-set to handle multiple conditions.''
Part of that flexibility may require rewiring our brains into rethinking what retirement even means. Is it a date? A lifestyle? Escaping a job you despise? The odds of reaching that theoretical place successfully, whatever it means to you, have little to do with forecasting and a lot to do with behavior -- namely, the financial decisions you make at crucial points in your career, several of which are highlighted below.
Early Career
When you are starting out, focusing on your savings engine -- your career -- and forming healthy financial habits may be more important than meeting an arbitrary savings target. People who are happy in their jobs are arguably more likely to succeed in them. And the more you earn, the easier it will be to save over the long run. Transitioning to something new is easier, of course, when you're still unencumbered.
''Often times, the myopic answer is to save x percent of your compensation,'' said Timothy J. Maurer, a financial planner and co-author of ''The Financial Crossroads.'' But people 25 to 35 are currently ''in the window'' where they can choose to do exactly what they want to do for a living. ''And if that requires sacrificing savings,'' he said, so be it.
But if you are already on a steady career track, start by establishing an automatic savings plan (ideally, financial planners would have you save at least 15 percent of your income), and paying off debt.
''The best you can do is to live on less than you make and save religiously,'' said Frank Armstrong, founder of Investor Solutions in Coconut Grove, Fla. ''There is no substitute for starting early, and there is no substitute for getting rid of consumer debt. There is no imaginable investment that will outperform that.''
Even relatively modest savings can amount to an impressive nest egg, he said. For instance, if you started saving $5,000 a year in an Individual Retirement Account at age 25, it would grow to nearly $604,000 over 40 years (assuming a 5 percent real return).
The trick, of course, is to achieve some sort of balance. ''I don't want 20-year-olds to say, 'My dream is to go to Paris, but I can't because I have to put aside $100,' '' Mr. Benningfield said, adding, with a chuckle, that it might discourage future Hemingways. ''Sometimes deferring gratification temporarily could mean deferring it forever. Mortality, disability, divorce, kids, mortgage, all of that stuff may get in the way.''
Midcareer
By now, you probably own a home, have a couple of children and may be contemplating a move, an extension to your home, another car or other creature comforts. ''Almost everyone needs to reprioritize, whether you are making $50,000 or $500,000,'' Mr. Benningfield said, ''because almost everyone is reaching beyond their grasp.''
This is also the time when the need to pay tuition costs tends to eclipse your retirement saving goals. Too many people ''end up getting sucked into a situation where their children's education becomes their primary objective in life,'' Mr. Maurer said. ''And this is one of the ways people fail on the amount of retirement savings they can do.''
He recommends that parents establish a ''family education policy'' that lays out what they will and will not pay for. That might mean tuition for a state university in their state, while the child will be responsible for anything additional. This, he says, is ultimately cheaper for graduates than having to bail out their parents later should they run out of retirement money.
Once you hit your 50s, you should also begin to consider the costs of long-term care insurance, compared with covering the potential costs on your own. ''There are going to be a lot of changes occurring in the next few years,'' said Cicily Maton, president of Aequus Wealth Management Resources in Chicago. ''I don't know if any of us have any confidence that people will be receiving benefits of Social Security and Medicare without some major changes. As a society, something has to give.''
When you're 10 or 20 years away from retirement, you should also make a couple of calculations that will show whether you are saving enough (think of it as a reality check). Start by listing your current monthly expenses, excluding the items that you won't be paying for in retirement, like a mortgage, child care or tuition. Add them up for a rough idea of how much it costs you to live each year. Then, figure how much will be covered by Social Security, pension or any other income sources each year -- and subtract that from your annual budget. That's how much you'll need to cover from your own savings.
You can generally withdraw about 4 percent each year from a diversified portfolio, including adjustments for inflation, without running out of money. So if you need, say, another $50,000 a year, that means you'll need to save about $1.25 million. Use a simple retirement calculator to see if your savings rate and expected return will get you there, realizing that anything -- like high inflation or medical costs -- can throw you wildly off track. Tweak your savings accordingly.
''The next big question is, 'How volatile is my portfolio, and what is the rate of return I need to be making?' '' said F. John Deyeso, a certified financial planner in New York. ''You want to be sure your savings aren't in jeopardy.''
That may mean reducing your stock allocation and redirecting that money into fixed-income investments (your specific allocation will depend on how far away retirement is, your personal goals and tolerance for risk). And make sure you're truly diversified across all asset classes.
''The S.& P. had a lost decade,'' said Mr. Armstrong, referring to the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index's essentially flat return over the last 10 years. ''But we had about an 8 percent return in our equity portfolio, and it's not because I'm a genius. It's because we diversified around the world, in commodities futures, real estate, foreign and domestic, emerging markets and small companies, foreign and domestic, with a severe value tilt. It doesn't work every year, but cumulatively, you win big.''
Mr. Maurer is a fan of incorporating so-called risk managers into your portfolio, or funds that try to cushion the blows when the market drops (like First Eagle Global, IVA Worldwide and Ivy Asset Strategy). ''If you're a traditional asset allocator, you could try integrating risk managers into your portfolio as satellites designed to provide a stabilizing force in your portfolio,'' he added.
Late Career
Financial planners recommend that once your retirement is on the horizon -- particularly when it's less than five years away -- you put into words, and perhaps on paper, what the term itself means to you. Most people think of retirement in linear terms, or something with a start date. But now that individuals are increasingly responsible for financing their own way over longer periods of time -- and with less help from pensions and governmental safety nets -- some people are phasing into retirement over many years.
''This perceived future date of retirement puts an awful lot of pressure on that day, on your life and on your savings,'' said Mr. Maurer, who instead recommends considering part-time work around a hobby or another passion and scaling that down over time.
Once you have a better idea of what will fill your days, you need to estimate how much that life will cost. ''Soon-to-be-retirees should make a detailed review of their cash flow,'' Mr. Benningfield said. ''Better to face reality now and start contemplating alternative strategies like moving to a lower-cost area or working part time.''
For many people, this is also the last chance to catch up on savings. At the same time, you need to reconsider your asset allocation and begin positioning your portfolio for another economic storm, which may include setting aside larger cash reserves or shorter-term bonds to cover your expenses for several years. That way, you won't have to sell your stocks while they're down.
And before you retire, try to live on your anticipated budget for a prolonged period of time. ''This is a great strategy for people to employ whether they are all about having a set retirement date or having a phase-in period,'' Mr. Maurer said. ''It still makes sense for everybody to do this.''

HEADLINE: Consumers' Champion Wages Her Own Crusade

BYLINE: By JODI KANTOR; Ben Werschkul contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Ask Elizabeth Warren, scourge of Wall Street bankers, how they treat consumers, and she will shake her head with indignation. She will talk about morality, about fairness, about what she calls their ''let them eat cake'' attitude toward taxpayers. If she is riled enough, she might even spit out the Warren version of an expletive. 
 ''Dang gummit, somebody has got to stand up on behalf of middle-class families!'' she exclaimed in a recent interview in her office here.
 Among all the dramatis personae of post-financial crisis Washington, there is no one remotely like Ms. Warren, 60, who has divided the town between those who admire her and those who roll their eyes at her. 
 She is an Oklahoma native, a janitor's daughter, a bankruptcy expert at Harvard Law School and a former Sunday School teacher who cites John Wesley -- the co-founder of Methodism and a public health crusader -- as an inspiration. She brims with cheer, yet she is she is such a fearsome interrogator that Bruce Mann, her husband, describes her as a grandmother who can make grown men cry. Back at Harvard, Ms. Warren's teaching style is ''Socratic with a machine gun,'' as one former student put it. In Washington, she grills bankers and Treasury officials just as relentlessly.
 Ms. Warren has two roles here: officially, as head of Congressional oversight for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and unofficially, as chief conceiver of and booster for a new consumer financial protection agency. Fusing those projects and her academic work, she has become the most prominent consumer advocate in years. 
 In a blitz of television appearances, she offers a story of how 30 years of deregulation has rewarded the financial industry but led to abusive practices and collapses that have hurt ordinary Americans -- the same taxpayers who are paying for bank bailouts.
 Ms. Warren's climactic hour begins now: three years after she hatched the idea for the agency, the White House has backed it, the House of Representatives has approved it and it is a top Democratic priority in the Senate. 
 Many fans, including Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, hope Ms. Warren will run it. But even if the agency is approved, it might be far weaker than what she envisioned, thanks to fierce opposition from the financial industry.
 Critics argue that such an agency, which would regulate mortgages, credit cards and nearly all other loans to consumers, would tighten credit in an already tight market, stifle innovation and hurt small businesses.
 They have another objection as well: to Ms. Warren herself. As one administration official acknowledged, the prospect of her running the new agency may be an impediment to its creation because of her crusading style, her seemingly visceral loathing of financial services companies and her expansive way of interpreting assignments. 
 '' 'Loose cannon' would be an appropriate term to apply in her case,'' said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research and a Warren supporter.
 The defining event of Elizabeth Warren's life may have taken place before she was born, when a business partner ran off with the money her father had scraped together to start a car dealership. She arrived a few years later, in 1949, another mouth for a strapped family to feed. But she used that mouth to talk her way into a debate scholarship at George Washington University at age 16. 
 She became a speech therapist, then a lawyer -- she hung a shingle and did wills and real estate closings -- then a part-time law instructor, and finally a leading scholar of bankruptcy. Her research helped change the stereotype of bankrupt people as feckless deadbeats: many, she showed, are middle-class workers upended by divorce or illness.
 While Ms. Warren was building her career, her father became a maintenance man and her three older brothers back in Oklahoma worked in construction, car repair and the oil fields. Among them, they have endured all manner of financial crisis, including foreclosure, according to Ms. Warren's husband.
 ''I learned early on what debt means, how vulnerable it makes people, what the security of owning a home means,'' Ms. Warren said, her eyes welling. Even today, said Ms. Warren's daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi, her mother is so frugal that she eats shriveled grapes out of the fruit bowl. 
 Six years ago, Ms. Warren was one of the few guests at a Harvard Law School faculty reception for Barack Obama, an alumnus then running for a United States Senate seat in Illinois. He greeted her with two words: ''predatory lending,'' signaling he knew her work. He began to talk about dicey mortgages and abusive credit products and their shattering effect on families, Ms. Warren recalled. Finally, she cut him off. 
 ''You had me at 'predatory lending,' '' she said. A few years later, Mr. Obama was promoting her idea for a consumer agency on the presidential campaign trail. 
 Meanwhile, in October 2008, Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, called out of the blue and asked Ms. Warren to head Congressional oversight of the bank bailout. It was a vague job, sketched out in a hurry, but she interpreted her mandate aggressively. Instead of issuing standard monthly reports, she turned them into independent research projects, bulletins and videos asking pointed questions about Treasury's treatment of the banks.
 At the same time, banking lobbyists and other business-financed groups threw their weight against the consumer agency proposal -- and they complained about Ms. Warren as well. (Wayne Abernathy, a lobbyist for the American Bankers Association, declined to comment for this article but recently asked if the TARP oversight panel had become ''the new Warren commission.'')
 ''She comes at the world from the perspective that she knows what's good for people,'' said Douglas Baird, from University of Chicago Law School, who said he shared Ms. Warren's concerns but not always her views. ''She starts with a skepticism of markets and a skepticism of the ability of consumers to make sensible choices.''
 The TARP project also complicated Ms. Warren's ties to the Obama administration. The president lights up when her consumer protection ideas are discussed, according to Diana Farrell, deputy director of the National Economic Council. Likewise, David Axelrod, a White House senior adviser, effused about Ms. Warren in an interview by phone, using the word ''passionate'' over and over. 
 Her relationship with Treasury is chillier. In private, she has worked closely with some officials there on regulatory reform. But in her oversight role, she pounds the agency, leading some to accuse her of showboating or breeding cynicism about a program functioning better than many expected.
 ''I'm a thorn in this administration's side as much as in the last administration's side,'' she said. 
 She will not comment on whether she might head the agency, for the same reason administration officials will not. ''What we're trying to do is build an institution that's over and above any individual,'' Ms. Farrell said. 
 Ms. Warren does say that if she and the administration lose on the agency's passage, she'd like them to lose big -- to force lawmakers, as she puts it, to leave ''lots of blood and teeth'' on the floor. 
 If that happens, Ms. Warren will still have her own platform, starting with her nearly constant stream of television appearances. Hosts and cameramen love her: she has the friendly face of a teacher, the pedigree of a top law professor, the moral force of a preacher and the plain-spoken twang of an Oklahoman.
 ''This is America's middle class,'' she recently said on ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart.'' ''We've hacked at it and pulled at it and chipped at it for 30 years now, and now there's no more to do. We fix this problem going forward, or the game really is over.''
 ''When you say it like that and you look at me like that, I know your husband is backstage, I still want to make out with you,'' Mr. Stewart responded.
 If no agency or government post materializes, Ms. Warren says she will happily return to Harvard. Others expect her to do more, including Eliot Spitzer, the former New York governor who has come to know her through their shared interest in consumer advocacy.
 ''Plan B is to become Ralph Nader,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Fight Is Over, the Myths Remain

BYLINE: By BRENDAN NYHAN. 
Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist, is a health policy researcher at the University of Michigan.

DATELINE: Ann Arbor, Mich. 

 BODY:
 AT the White House signing ceremony for health care legislation on Tuesday, President Obama declared, ''In a few moments, when I sign this bill, all of the overheated rhetoric over reform will finally confront the reality of reform.'' For Democrats nervous about political fallout from the bill in the November midterm elections, it's reassuring to imagine that the myths about the legislation -- that it provides free coverage to illegal immigrants, uses taxpayer money to subsidize abortions and mandates end-of-life counseling for the elderly -- will be dispelled by its passage.
 But public knowledge of the plan's contents may not improve as quickly as Democrats hope. While some of the more outlandish rumors may dissipate, it is likely that misperceptions will linger for years, hindering substantive debate over the merits of the country's new health care system. The reasons are rooted in human psychology. 
 Studies have shown that people tend to seek out information that is consistent with their views; think of liberal fans of MSNBC and conservative devotees of Fox News. Liberals and conservatives also tend to process the information that they receive with a bias toward their pre-existing opinions, accepting claims that are consistent with their point of view and rejecting those that are not. As a result, information that contradicts their prior attitudes or beliefs is often disregarded, especially if those beliefs are strongly held. 
 Unfortunately, these tendencies frequently undermine well-intentioned efforts to counter myths and misperceptions. Jason Reifler, a political scientist at Georgia State, and I conducted a series of experiments in which participants read mock news articles with misleading statements by a politician. Some were randomly assigned a version of the article that also contained information correcting the misleading statement. 
 Our results indicate that this sort of journalistic fact-checking often fails to reduce misperceptions among ideological or partisan voters. In some cases, we found that corrections can even make misperceptions worse. For example, in one experiment we found that the proportion of conservatives who believed that President George W. Bush's tax cuts actually increased federal revenue grew from 36 percent to 67 percent when they were provided with evidence against this claim. People seem to argue so vehemently against the corrective information that they end up strengthening the misperception in their own minds.
 The debate over health care reform, which was marred by false and misleading claims about the plan's contents, provides a case study in how difficult it is to correct widely held misperceptions. Democrats cite various reasons to think that public understanding of the plan will improve in the aftermath of its enactment, but none of them are particularly persuasive.
 First, some Democrats have suggested that politicians and others responsible for the spread of false information will be discredited when their doomsday predictions fail to materialize. Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey predicted on Monday that ''when this bill goes into effect, and none of the things Republicans warned about begin to happen -- none of the death panels, none of the government takeover, none of the socialism -- Republicans will have no credibility.'' 
 This is too optimistic. While some provisions of the plan will start before November, the most far-reaching changes won't take effect until 2014. False claims about the contents of the bill will just morph into harder-to-debunk predictions about the consequences of reform. We've seen this happen already with Sarah Palin's claim that her parents and baby would ''have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel.''' After this claim was widely discredited in the press, some conservative pundits retreated to claims that future rationing of health care would amount to ''de facto death panels.''
 In addition, some have suggested that personal experience will change Americans' beliefs about health care reform. But that reality will also take a long time to arrive for most voters. It will be years before many people experience substantial changes in how their health care is paid for or delivered. Even after the insurance expansion is complete, it's not clear that direct contact will correct the public's mistaken beliefs -- remember the town hall participant who told a Republican congressman last summer to ''keep your government hands off my Medicare''?
 Finally, the ''fog of controversy,'' in the words of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, is unlikely to lift. With Republicans already arguing for the plan's repeal, health care will play a major role in the midterms and the 2012 presidential campaign. The endless debate over reform will surely spawn new myths among voters already disenchanted with President Obama and the state of the economy. 
 In the end, access to health care may increase, but the plague of misinformation won't be cured any time soon.

HEADLINE: Ending an Upbeat Day, Investors Take Profits and Shares Give Up Gains

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Never turn your back on the stock market.
 Just when it seemed Wall Street was on track for one of its best days of the month on Thursday, the enthusiasm all but evaporated.
 The Dow Jones industrial average flirted with triple-digit gains at one point, but a strengthening dollar helped obliterate virtually all the day's gains in the final hour of trading.
 After the tumultuous finish, analysts were struggling to make sense of the day's movements. 
 ''I don't think there's anything to read into it,'' said Dan A. Faretta, senior market strategist for the LaSalle Futures Group. Mr. Faretta said investors were growing leery of a recent rise in stock prices and seized the moment to take profits.
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended trading with a slight gain -- 5.06 points, or 0.05 percent -- to 10,841.21. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 1.99 points, or 0.17 percent, to 1.165.73, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 1.35 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,397.41.
 Stocks surged for most of the day as Greece and Dubai moved closer to resolving deficit issues, tempering worries that debt troubles might spread to other countries. 
 But a late-afternoon rise in the dollar helped spur a drop in commodity prices, pushing shares of materials and energy companies sharply down.
 The price of oil fell 8 cents, to $80.16 a barrel, sending Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, down 2.3 percent, to $60.76, and Exxon Mobil down 0.3 percent, to $66.30. 
 As the price of raw materials fell, shares of International Paper declined 3.8 percent, to $25.21; United States Steel dropped 1.8 percent, to $62.37; and Alcoa fell 1.5 percent, to $14.11.
 Traders were unnerved by a tepid Treasury auction on Thursday, which resurrected worries that the nation might face difficulty financing big expenditures like health care and expanding unemployment benefits. Demand for seven-year government debt was weak, leading to slightly higher interest rates and a drop in prices.
 The Treasury's 10-year note fell 7/32, to 97 29/32. The yield rose to 3.88 percent, from 3.85 percent late Wednesday.
 In recent months, deficit worries have widened to relatively stable countries like the United States. As they try to emerge from the downturn, governments are increasingly facing questions about whether they can afford big-ticket stimulus plans.
 ''Is there enough buying out there to fund these deficits?'' said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist for Bell Curve Trading. ''That's the big dark cloud on the horizon.''
 Concern that unwieldy deficits in Greece and Dubai would undermine the global recovery eased somewhat on Thursday.
 In addition, the government of Dubai pledged to provide its main investment vehicle, Dubai World, with $9.5 billion to help the firm restructure its debt.
 In November, a debt crisis in Dubai sent global shockwaves when Dubai World announced that it would need to renegotiate $26 billion in debt, raising the possibility of default.
 Dan Alpert, managing partner of Westwood Capital, said concerns about foreign debt would continue to hurt financial markets in the short term.
 ''The notion that we're going to have worldwide hyperinflation because of these imbalances is not happening,'' Mr. Alpert said. ''But when people start reading about strikes and riots in the streets, that's when the markets start getting nervous.''
 Signs of stability for Greece and Dubai initially helped quell concerns about the European monetary union. But by day's end, the euro had weakened 0.2 percent against the dollar, to $1.3291, after hitting its lowest levels since May on Wednesday.
 Investors in the United States got some reassurance from a report showing that the number of people filing first-time unemployment claims dropped more than expected last week.
 Jobless claims declined 14,000, to 442,000, better than the 6,000 drop predicted by economists. Much of the decline, however, was the result of an adjustment in how the number is calculated.
 America's high jobless rate, which stood at 9.7 percent last month, remains a central obstacle to the stock market's growth, analysts say. But a report on employment in early April could offer some clarity.

HEADLINE: Average Con Ed Bill to Rise by $10 Over 3 Years

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The monthly power bill for a typical New York City household will rise by more than $10 over the next three years under a new rate plan approved by regulators on Thursday. 
 The state's Public Service Commission voted unanimously to allow Con Edison to raise its rates for electricity by about 4 percent annually for three years, beginning next month. The plan was intended to add $420 million to Con Edison's annual revenues, on average, over the three years. 
 Con Ed estimated that the increases would raise a typical household bill, now about $84 a month, to more than $94 a month in 2012. The first annual rise, to take effect on April 1, would be the biggest of the three and would add $3.63 to the bill for a residential customer who uses 300 kilowatt hours of electricity per month. 
 Garry A. Brown, the Public Service Commission chairman, said in a statement that the commissioners ''are always concerned about the impact of any rate increase on ratepayers, especially in these extraordinarily difficult economic times'' but deemed the increases necessary. In a statement, Con Ed said that about 30 percent of the rate increase would go to pay the company's rising taxes. Much of the rest would pay for investments in its distribution network ''to maintain system readiness and operating reliability,'' Con Ed said.
 But the commission announced that Con Ed's customers would receive a one-time rebate of $36.4 million from the company to pay them back for its unauthorized overspending on such improvements in the past. Residential customers will receive credits of $5.35 each in bills that arrive in August or September, the commission said.
 Separately, the commission notified Con Ed that it planned to seek penalties of up to $1 million for a gas explosion in April in Floral Park, Queens, that leveled a two-story house and killed a woman who lived in it. A Con Ed spokesman said that it believed an employee who responded to a report of a gas leak at the house had followed approved procedures, but he added that the company has ''completely revamped our responses to gas leaks and we now coordinate with the Fire Department on evacuations and venting manholes.''

HEADLINE: A Fair Shrinks, but Still Wanders Far

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
It remains to be seen if we're living in the twilight of the art fairs. But lately these bellwether organisms have been shifting shapes, changing locations, shrinking or even ceasing operations. In addition, organized clusters of gallery exhibitions, like that of the Asian Art Dealers concluding this weekend, are gaining ground. 
 The New York Arts of Pacific Asia Show is not going quietly. Last year it moved from its first home -- the 69th Regiment Armory on Lexington Avenue -- to 7 W New York, a generic Merchandise Mart space on 34th Street, opposite the Empire State Building. The ceiling is lower, the walls more solid and the participants have dropped by a third over the last four incarnations. But in its 19th year, it is still the place to see a staggering variety and amount of art produced by cultures stretching from India to the Pacific Islands and from Vietnam to the Himalayas. 
 The fair's smaller size may make its still considerable sprawl easier to take in. If you want mostly museum-quality pieces, your time is probably better spent going around the Asia Week gallery exhibitions. But if you like to browse, sort, compare things and possibly even buy something, this fair, where many prices hover under $1,000, has much to offer. 
 The main modes of presentation are three. First there is cabinet-of-curiosities eclectic -- mixing cultures and types of objects to dizzying effect -- which you can stabilize by focusing on one amazing thing. At Asiantiques, for example, I spent some time with a large yellow stone from Qing dynasty China carved with an intricate landscape full of Buddhist sages called arhats clambering about. 
 At the other extreme -- and equally plentiful -- is sharp-focus high-density presentations of a few things, often small and exquisite. Among these are the snuff bottles and jade carvings at the Asian Art Studio; the silver jewelry at Chinalai Tribal Antiques, a tour that touches down in about 10 countries; and the onslaught of stands and lids for Chinese porcelain, hand-carved in often exotic woods, at Fleurdelys Antiques. 
 There are more restrained displays, like a case devoted mostly to Khmer bronzes from the 9th to 13th centuries at Buddhist Art or the gilt bronze Jain altars at Hardt & Sons. There are marvelous textiles and garments at Moke Mokotoff, John Ruddy, Judith Rutherford and especially Jon Eric Riis, where a display of Chinese court robes is in full cry. Don't miss the boldly geometric West Persian sofreh, used as presentation rugs, from around 1900 at Alberto Levi and the modest yet intricately embroidered cloths called Kanthas from India at Joss Graham. 
 As in previous years, Nankai offers a large and illuminating display of Vietnamese ceramics that provide a wonderful account of the deftness with which that country's artists borrowed forms and glazes from other cultures, almost always with a distinctively understated, even retiring beauty. Jonathan Tucker and Antonia Tozer have arrayed their booth with sculptures of Buddha and his devotees from South and Southeast Asia (especially Thailand), including a gently worn 11th- or 12th-century Vietnamese sandstone relief of a serene Sarasvati in lotus pose with a lotus bud in each hand. I recommend rifling through the bin of Mughal drawings and paintings at Jeremy Knowles, next door.
 At Thomas Murray, where the ''shamanic-inspired art'' of ''the tribal minorities of Asia'' predominates, one wall roams the region with a few dozen masks, most of them irresistibly direct in emotional expression and their ingenious use of modest materials. A haunting Iban ghost mask from Borneo is simply a carved piece of plate fungus whose sad-sack face results from the addition of three holes and some well-placed swipes of black and white pigment. A gaudy, painted wood Kenyah-Kayan mask, also from Borneo, depicts the spirit of the hornbill, but also calls forth that of Montgomery Burns of ''Simpsons'' fame. 
 Masks from Java, Nepal and Madura impress. The Evenk of Siberia contribute two simple but evocative masks made of pounded, punctured and painted metal. 
 A similar economy of means is found at Eleanor Abraham in a terra-cotta urn with a schematic face from the Swat Valley in Pakistan and the second or first century B.C. 
 In the minority, and providing respite, is the third type of presentation: sparse arrangements that bespeak a certain excellence all on their own. At Maria Kiang, an imposingly large Western Han dynasty bronze horse exudes high, almost Pixar levels of animation, and a small Western Han bronze bull wags its head in cheerful stubbornness. Equally unruffled are the five Edo screens at Helena Markus, many of them shrouded in flat, gold clouds that add both mystery and decorative punch.
 Anavian has, as usual, an exceptional display of ceramic vessels from Iran and Iraq, plus a few elegant muskets. The standout here is a rare four-handled storage jar from 13th- or 14th--century Iran, its pale turquoise glaze underpainted with black spirals similar to the ''horse eye'' motif of Japanese Seto ware. But nearly everything else is deserving of careful attention.
 Two large, extraordinarily wild-looking Wagumi-style Ikebana baskets made of strips and sections of bamboo jump out at Flying Cranes Antiques. One is by Yufu Masataka, a 20th-century master of the form; the other is attributed to one of his students. It's not clear if they should be in museums or cages, but special treatment is definitely in order.
 The New York Arts of Pacific Asia Show runs through Sunday at 7 W New York, 7 West 34th Street; newyorkartsofpacificasiashow.com.

HEADLINE: City's Unemployment Rate Fell Last Month to 10.2%

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
New York City's unemployment rate dipped again in February, raising hopes that the effects of the long recession are waning and the pace of hiring may pick up soon. 
 The city's official unemployment rate was 10.2 percent last month, down from 10.4 percent in January, the State Department of Labor reported on Thursday. That was still significantly higher than the national unemployment rate, which was 9.7 percent in February. 
 The number of private-sector jobs in the city rose by 8,100 last month, but that was less than half the average gain over the previous 10 Februarys, said James Brown, an analyst with the Labor Department. Mr. Brown said the city's construction and finance industries ''both suffered significant job losses in February.'' But that weakness was offset by hiring in business services, like law and accounting, and in leisure and hospitality.
 Since the recession took hold in the New York metropolitan region in 2008, the city has lost a total of 167,500 jobs, said Barbara Byrne Denham, chief economist with Eastern Consolidated, a real estate investment services firm in Manhattan.
 The construction industry has been one of the weakest areas. Work has stalled on more than 575 building projects in the city, Ms. Denham said.
 Though there are signs suggesting that the economy is on the mend, she said, ''the city will likely see a few more months of job losses that could put the cumulative loss at just under 200,000 jobs.'' 
 The state's unemployment rate held steady in February at 8.8 percent, the Labor Department said. Statewide, the number of people working in the private sector inched up to 6.99 million, an increase of 8,100.
 ''New York State's labor market continues to improve,'' said Peter A. Neenan, director of the department's Division of Research and Statistics. ''We've now added jobs for two consecutive months, and the state's unemployment rate has leveled off. However, following previous recessions, it has taken the state about five years, on average, to regain all of the jobs lost during a downturn.''
 In another sign of an improving labor market in the state, the federal Labor Department reported on Thursday that the number of new claims for unemployment benefits in New York fell last week by more than 4,100, a bigger decline than in any other state. 
 Still, nearly 845,000 New York residents were unable to find jobs last month, and more than 607,000 of them were collecting unemployment benefits.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Europe Agree to Expand Open Skies Pact, Predicting More Traffic

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER and NICOLA CLARK; James Kanter reported from Brussels and Nicola Clark from Paris.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- The European Union and the United States agreed Thursday to expand a three-year-old accord that allows airlines to operate more freely across the Atlantic. 
 The move will increase access to each other's markets and narrow differences over environmental regulations, but industry executives were disappointed that no agreement was reached to remove the remaining barriers to foreign ownership and control of airlines. 
 Siim Kallas, the European Union transport commissioner, hailed the agreement as a ''major step forward'' that would remove ''constraints on foreign investment and market access that have been holding back the development of the most important aviation market.'' Mr. Kallas said he would seek approval by the bloc's 27 transport ministers and the European Parliament by the end of June. 
 The preliminary deal reached Thursday builds on a ground-breaking March 2007 ''open skies'' pact that since 2008 has allowed any European or American airline to fly between any two airports in either region -- a move that has significantly increased competition in the $18 billion trans-Atlantic market. It comes after years of negotiations between European officials and their counterparts from the Transportation Department.
 Under the terms of the agreement reached Thursday, the United States said it would seek to ease restrictions that currently limit foreign ownership of voting stock in American carriers to 25 percent. But the issue still faces significant opposition in Congress and from labor groups that are concerned about the effect of such a change for an important sector of the United States economy.
 Washington also agreed to give European carriers new commercial opportunities to fly between the United States and third countries in the future, once existing European restrictions on airport noise pollution were lifted.
 At a briefing in Brussels, the chief negotiators for Europe and the United States acknowledged butting up against existing laws that limited how much they could achieve during the talks.
 ''There are some things that weren't possible,'' said John R. Byerly, the United States deputy assistant secretary for transportation affairs. ''We have to respect the abilities of each side to move forward as it can.''
 Mr. Byerly acknowledged there was no timetable for changing American legislation on foreign ownership, and Daniel Calleja, the chief negotiator for the European Commission, said there was no timetable for changing the noise laws in Europe. ''We are not putting deadlines on the work of our legislators,'' Mr. Calleja said.
 The European Union has predicted that the provisions in the agreement could increase annual trans-Atlantic traffic by as much as 26 million passengers, to about 75 million by 2013, and generate up to 12 billion euros in economic benefits, like lower fares for consumers.
 Airlines, however, criticized the deal, particularly over ownership issues.
 ''It is disappointing that, at this critical time, we did not make significant progress on the issue of ownership,'' said Giovanni Bisignani, the director general and chief executive of the International Air Transport Association.
 ''The long-term financial sustainability of the industry is dependent on normal commercial freedoms,'' he said. ''I urge both governments to keep this on the radar screen for urgent follow-up.''
 British Airways, which called on Britain in 2007 to scuttle the accord if the United States failed to concede on ownership limits, expressed dismay that those limits would remain in place for the foreseeable future. 
 ''We call on both sides to honor the firm commitments they have made in this agreement to further liberalization, and to redouble their efforts going forward,'' it said.
 Under the terms of the second-stage agreement, the United States did agree to further open its aviation market. For instance, European Union carriers gained greater access to travel by American government employees, which had previously been restricted under a policy called ''Fly America.''
 In an apparent change of tone, Washington also agreed to explore ways that a proposed American trading system for carbon emissions could interlink with an existing European system, which includes aviation. But the two sides also agreed to continue negotiations toward a global approach to aviation emissions regulation under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organization, an arm of the United Nations.
 The subject of emissions trading was deliberately left out of the 2007 open skies deal. The administration of President George W. Bush was opposed to Europe's plans to include aviation in its emissions trading program starting in 2012, arguing that the European program was probably illegal under international conventions governing civil aviation.
 The accord signed Thursday contains a road map for discussions on greenhouse gas emissions, which signals that the United States is backing away from the aggressive attitude of the Bush administration, European Union officials said.
 The accord underlines that Washington ''is showing more emphasis on cooperation rather than legal challenges,'' Mr. Calleja said.
 ''Today's agreement strengthens our already close aviation relationship with our European partners,'' the United States transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, said in a statement. ''President Obama promised European leaders that we would reach an agreement this year, and today we fulfill that promise.''
 Analysts said the deal reached Thursday was a pragmatic one that at least guaranteed that the terms of the 2007 accord remained in place indefinitely.
 ''The two sides have come together in a sensible way, keeping the fundamental elements of the original agreement in place and enhancing them,'' said Jeffrey N. Shane, a partner with Hogan & Hartson in Washington and a former Transportation Department under secretary who helped negotiate the 2007 accord. ''This ensures that we will continue to enjoy the benefits of a liberalized trans-Atlantic aviation market.''

HEADLINE: Vivian Blake, 54, Founder Of Jamaica Drug Gang

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS; Ross Sheil contributed reporting from Kingston, Jamaica.

 BODY:
Vivian Blake, a former top leader of the Jamaican Shower Posse, which United States prosecutors say was responsible for more than 1,400 drug-related killings in this country in the 1980s, died Sunday night in Kingston, Jamaica. He was 54.
 Mr. Blake died after being brought to the University Hospital of the West Indies complaining of breathing problems, said Ruel Rainford, the senior director of administration and operations. He said an autopsy was planned. Mr. Blake's daughter, Dominique Blake, said he had been suffering from kidney failure and diabetes. 
 Since his release from prison in the United States 14 months ago, Mr. Blake had been living in Jamaica and writing a screenplay about his life, said his lawyer, George Soutar. 
 Mr. Blake, who grew up in poverty in West Kingston, earned a scholarship to St. George's College, a private high school in Jamaica. He first traveled to New York as part of a cricket team in 1973, and stayed there, establishing the American affiliate of the Shower Posse in Brooklyn.
 There are differing accounts of how the gang got its name. Many believe it was derived from a 1980 campaign speech by Edward Seaga of the Jamaican Labor Party, who promised ''showers of blessings'' in economic opportunity for Jamaicans. The gang was widely seen as aligned with Mr. Seaga's party. Another version contends that the name came from the way the gang would spray its victims with bullets.
 In the United States, Mr. Blake developed a marijuana and cocaine distribution network that spanned major cities from Miami to New York to Los Angeles and even reached as far as Anchorage. A warrant for his arrest was first issued in 1988 after he and other members of the gang were accused in the November 1984 killing of five people in a Miami crack house. Mr. Blake escaped arrest by hopping on a cruise ship in Miami bound for Jamaica, according to a 2008 profile of the Shower Posse on the BET series ''American Gangster.''
 While fighting extradition in Jamaica, Mr. Blake established a nightclub, motorbike rental agency and a loan company. Another arrest warrant was issued, and in 1999, he was extradited to Miami. As part of a deal to avoid trial, he pleaded guilty to racketeering, criminal conspiracy and drug possession while admitting his leadership role in the gang.
 ''But what he never admitted to was his responsibility in personally killing anybody,'' said his lawyer at the time, David Rowe. ''I think he always felt above the fray.'' Ms. Blake said her father had shielded her and her older brother, Duane, from his activities. ''It wasn't until a couple years back that I started to learn things in detail,'' she said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
 ''There was not one day in my life I did not speak to him,'' said Ms. Blake, who won an N.C.A.A. title in the 4-x-400-meter relay while attending Pennsylvania State University and who now directs Black Knight Investments, the loan company modeled after the one her father started, while training to make the Jamaican Olympic team. Her brother chronicled their father's life in a 2003 book, ''Shower Posse: The Most Notorious Jamaican Crime Organization.''
 ''We are definitely saddened, as with any death,'' said Dr. Peter Phillips, a former Jamaican minister of national security, ''but I think it would do Jamaica well to examine his own admissions in his establishment of high-level criminal organizations in Jamaica.''
 Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the extradition of Christopher Coke, the current Shower Posse leader, on charges of drug distribution and firearms trafficking. 
 Besides his two children, Mr. Blake is survived by his wife, Valerie, and four grandchildren.

 BODY:
An A.I.G. Lesson
 From Wisconsin
Wisconsin's insurance watchdog is requiring holders of credit-default swap contracts written by Ambac Financial, the troubled bond insurer, to take losses. It suggests what might have been done with the American International Group in different circumstances. 
 Ambac got into trouble selling protection on what proved to be bad mortgage-backed bonds. As those bonds have deteriorated, the buyers of that protection have been demanding payments -- and receiving them in full, to the tune of $120 million a month. The problem for the regulator was that the cash outflow was on track to drain Ambac dry, leaving other policyholders with no protection. Since Ambac also insures many municipal bonds, the fallout could have been felt across the United States. 
 So Sean Dilweg, the Wisconsin insurance commissioner, is pushing the troubled swap contracts and some other losing policies into a segregated account that his department will try to wind down. Meanwhile he has secured court approval to halt the payouts Ambac has been making. 
 Part of the plan is to cut a deal with those protection buyers. Mr. Dilweg expects they'll get cash worth about 25 cents for each dollar of coverage. They'll also receive so-called surplus notes that could eventually yield more. Some holders of the swap contracts won't be happy. They thought they had payment priority. But others, including some banks like Citigroup, are going along with the deal because they've already written off much of their exposure. 
 New York's former insurance regulator, Eric R. Dinallo, similarly negotiated big haircuts with swaps counterparties of monolines he regulated. But A.I.G.'s counterparties were paid out in full after the government's 2008 bailout. The reasons include the complexity of the giant financial and insurance conglomerate and the fact that the Treasury and A.I.G.'s various regulators lacked the legal power to dictate a wind down. 
 Bills working their way through Congress are meant to give regulators that kind of power. Had they had it in 2008 -- and the guts to take control of A.I.G.'s huge book of bad assets at the peak of a financial panic -- the course of the bailout, and even the crisis, might have been different. 
 Dubai May See Dawn 
 Dubai may be close to ending its nightmare. As part of the proposal to restructure debts of $23.5 billion at the emirate's flagship company Dubai World and its subsidiary Nakheel, the government is offering to convert more than $10 billion of loans it has made to the group into equity and inject $9.5 billion of new money. Lenders could still face some losses, but it could have been much worse. 
 The Dubai government is offering to recapitalize Dubai World by swapping $8.9 billion of loans into equity and injecting up to $1.5 billion to finance working capital and interest payments. Creditors will get back 100 percent of their original principal through the issuance of new debt.
 At Nakheel, the developer of Dubai's palm-frond artificial islands and the like, the government will swap $1.2 billion of loans for equity, giving it 100 percent ownership of the group. It will also inject $8 billion of fresh cash, mostly to finance the completion of construction projects. In return, the unit's creditors will get their principal back in full over an unspecified period. Holders of Nakheel's bonds maturing in 2010 and 2011, which amount to $1.7 billion, will be fully repaid on time. 
 The outlined proposals, however, don't paint a full picture. The government has not revealed the interest rates it will offer creditors. Anything less than what they now receive would amount to a loss. Nor has Dubai said whether promised sales of assets will include crown jewels like Dubai World's $6.3 billion stake in the DP World ports operator. 
 Investors also need to be convinced that the proposals will be sufficient to ensure that Dubai World and Nakheel are solvent. The emirate, led by Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, is still being secretive about the full scale of both entities' debts. 
 Despite these omissions, Dubai's restructuring plan looks promising. The emirate needs all 97 banks involved to approve the deal to keep the process out of court. Some banks might have hoped for a more comprehensive bailout. But it would be risky to vote the plan down because Dubai might withdraw its promised financial support, leaving creditors with little but sand once again.

HEADLINE: EnergyStar Program Audit Finds Fraud Vulnerability

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Does a ''gasoline-powered alarm clock'' qualify for the EnergyStar label, the government stamp of approval for an energy-saving product?
 Like more than a dozen other bogus products submitted for approval since last June by Congressional auditors posing as companies, it easily secured the label, according to a Congressional report to be issued Friday. So did an ''air purifier'' that was essentially an electric space heater with a feather duster pasted on top, the Government Accountability Office said. 
 In a nine-month study, four fictitious companies invented by the accountability office also sought EnergyStar status for some conventional devices like dehumidifiers and heat pump models that existed only on paper. The fake companies submitted data indicating that the models consumed 20 percent less energy than even the most efficient ones on the market. Yet those applications were mostly approved without a challenge or even questions, the report said.
 Auditors concluded that the EnergyStar program was highly vulnerable to fraud. 
 Maria Vargas, an official with the Environmental Protection Agency, which runs the program with the Energy Department, said the approvals did not pose a problem for consumers because the products never existed. There was ''no fraud,'' Ms. Vargas emphasized. She said she doubted that many of the 40,000 genuine products with EnergyStar status had been mislabeled.
 But in anticipation of the report's release, the Energy Department has issued two statements in recent days pledging to strengthen the program.
 Yet auditors found problems beyond the approval of nonexistent products. They determined that once a company registered as an EnergyStar partner, it could download the logo from the government's Web site and paste it on products for which it had not even requested approval. 
 The report is only the latest in a series involving the 18-year-old EnergyStar program, which was set up to guide the public on energy-efficient choices that could both save people money and help reduce the nation's runaway energy consumption. 
 Watchdogs within the Environment Protection Agency and the Department of Energy have reported in the past that Energy Star has taken some claims of energy efficiency on faith. Yet the new study suggests that it often does so on remote control.
 Congressional auditors said they were told by EnergyStar officials that some of the approvals, including the one for the gasoline alarm clock, had been issued by an automated system and that the details had probably never been reviewed by a human being.
 Ms. Vargas added that the automated system that green-lighted the clock was only a preliminary ''screen'' to evaluate energy figures submitted by manufacturers and to cut out products that did not qualify. Every product that is certified is reviewed by a human being, she said.
 But Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who requested the accountability office study, said in an interview, ''I don't think I'd admit that.'' 
 If a government employee or contractor examined the comical picture submitted of the space heater with a feather duster, or read the description of the gas-powered clock -- with dimensions suggesting it was the size of an electric generator -- ''and red flags didn't get raised, that's a really troubling commentary,'' Ms. Collins said.
 She said the ease with which the auditors had fooled the program suggested that consumers and agencies that rely on the logo were paying extra for products that might not actually save energy. ''This program is extraordinarily easy to defraud,'' she said. 
 Ms. Collins also noted that the economic stimulus bill included hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks for people who buy EnergyStar products and that many government agencies were required to choose EnergyStar products if they were available. 
 In effect, people ''are ripped off twice,'' as consumers and as taxpayers, she said.
 Previous reports have suggested that the EnergyStar label is not always a complete or useful guide to the best consumer choices. Last October, for example, the inspector general of the E.P.A.said that 100 percent of the computer monitors that carried the EnergyStar logo had indeed met requirements. But so did 80 percent of the monitors that did not have the logo; the manufacturers had apparently not sought approval. For computer printers, 95 percent of the ones with the logo qualified, but so did 60 percent of the ones that did not have the logo. 
 And some consumer products lacking EnergyStar approval consumed less energy than those that had it, the audit found. 
 And the inspector general of the Energy Department reported the same month that EnergyStar claims were not ''accurate or verifiable'' for many products. The program requires manufacturers of windows and fluorescent lights to get their products certified by independent laboratories. But companies that make refrigerators, washing machines, dishwashers, water heaters and room air-conditioners, in which efficiency is far more critical because they gobble more energy, need only check a box on a form to be certified. 
 The Energy Department has promised to set up a system of independent verification for all products. Last week, it said it would begin testing refrigerators, freezers, clothes washers, dishwashers, water heaters and room air-conditioners. In October 2008, Consumer Reports magazine reported it had tested refrigerators built by LG of South Korea and found that they were not nearly as efficient as the maker claimed. LG eventually agreed to modify the machines already sold to reduce electricity consumption and to reimburse customers. Last week, the Energy Department said it had found a Samsung refrigerator that did not comply.
 The Energy Department does spot check some items with the EnergyStar logo, but mostly the ones that do not use much power in the first place. The department recently announced that several models of compact fluorescent lamps would have to remove the EnergyStar logo because they were not durable enough. It has conducted spot checks on regulated appliances that do not carry the logo and determined that some cannot be legally sold because they do not meet minimum efficiency standards. 
 The audit to be released Friday did not set out to test any products but focused solely on testing the certification process by submitting bogus products.
 Gene Rodrigues, the director of customer energy efficiency at Southern California Edison, suggested that the EnergyStar label suffered from its appeal to manufacturers. ''It may be that their ability to properly manage the brand suffered at the fringes,'' he said of the program's overseers. 
 He argues that a strong federal certification program is vital. ''What we in the program industry are looking for is for this to be a wake-up call to whip them into shape,'' he said.
 In another sign that Energy Star is not dotting its i's, program officials told the auditors that they sought to assure honesty by warning corporate applicants on some of its paperwork that intentionally submitting false information is a crime, under Title 18 of the United States Code. 
 But it is a crime under Title 19, not 18, and the warning does not appear on all of the relevant forms, the report said.

HEADLINE: Council Approves Legislation to Hold Process Servers Accountable

BYLINE: By KAREN ZRAICK

 BODY:
It is a fairly unglamorous and lightly regulated task: serving legal papers to people who have been sued. Debt collection agencies and lawyers often farm out the work to private companies, which deliver the papers in person or by mail. They are known, in legal parlance, as process servers. 
 But, according to the City Council, too many of them have been shirking their duties. So on Thursday, the Council overwhelmingly passed a bill that aims to stop what members called a growing and alarming trend: instances in which the papers never reach their intended destination, leaving people unaware that they are being sued.
 The legislation will require process servers to use a Global Positioning System to record the date, time and location of every service and to pass a test to get a license from the Department of Consumer Affairs. Process servers will also have to buy bonds to cover unpaid fines and judgments, a provision that Councilman G. Oliver Koppell, who abstained from the otherwise unanimous vote, criticized as too onerous for small businesses.
 Problems arise because once unknowing debtors do not respond to lawsuits, the suits are sent to Civil Court, where a judge can freeze the debtors' bank accounts and garnish their wages. 
 ''Tens of thousands of New Yorkers are being sued for old debts which they may or may not owe,'' said the bill's lead sponsor, Councilman Daniel R. Garodnick. ''Yet they are only learning they have been sued after they have lost and found that their bank accounts were frozen.''
 Chad Marlow, a spokesman for the state and national associations of process servers, said the sector recognized the problem and had come to support the bill, after tussling with the Council over licensing requirements.
 ''It's a very good step,'' Mr. Marlow said. ''We recognize that we had bad actors in our industry and that we needed to partner with government to get rid of them.'' 
 A 2008 study by MFY Legal Services, a nonprofit law firm, found that fewer than 10 percent of consumer debtors in the boroughs outside Manhattan showed up to their court hearings, raising questions about notification procedures. 
 It is an issue that has become more pressing as the recession has sent more families into debt, council members said. Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo has also been investigating improprieties in the industry. In April, his office filed suit against a process server agency on Long Island, alleging that servers had filed false affidavits. In addition, a class-action lawsuit filed in Manhattan in December alleges wrongdoing by process servers and debt-collection companies.

HEADLINE: Tentative Deal Is Reached For 2 Trade Center Towers

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI; Colin Moynihan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Port Authority, government officials and the developer Larry A. Silverstein reached a tentative agreement Thursday that would allow for the construction of two new skyscrapers at ground zero with up to $1.6 billion in public financing and subsidies.
 Under the deal, which would end a 16-month stalemate, the Port Authority would provide about $1 billion in financing for the first tower -- a 64-story building constructed by Mr. Silverstein on Church Street with as much office space as the Empire State Building. It is expected to be completed in 2013. 
 If Mr. Silverstein was able to raise $300 million in cash and secure leases from corporate tenants for about 400,000 square feet of space for a larger second tower, the city, the state and the authority would provide up to $600 million in financial assistance for that building, also on Church Street. If he could not get the financing and leases, he would build a five-story structure there by 2013 for shops and mechanical elements and leave the tower, to be built above it, for later.
 A third planned Silverstein tower, at the northeast corner of the site, would be delayed indefinitely, although the foundation would be built so the property did not remain a hole in the ground.
 In return for the financing, Mr. Silverstein agreed to share profits from the first building, if it is successful, and to forgo development fees on the second building until public funds for that building are repaid.
 ''Our main goal,'' Christopher O. Ward, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said, ''is to ensure that the Port Authority has the capital capacity to do critical transportation projects, while at the same time restoring Lower Manhattan to its proper place.''
 The authority has cut its capital budget by $5 billion in recent months because of falling toll and airport revenues, and some critics have questioned the wisdom of public investment in speculative commercial space in a weak real estate market. 
 ''I'm glad the stalemate appears to be over, but I'm not convinced that this is the best deal for the city,'' said Jonathan Bowles, director of the Center for an Urban Future, a nonpartisan research group. ''It's far from clear to me that public money should be used to build two office towers. If the market does not support these buildings, why should government step in?''
 Mr. Silverstein, who leased the trade center from the Port Authority only six weeks before it was destroyed in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, has clung tenaciously to the site, vowing to rebuild as a matter of national pride. ''Today's agreement between my company and the Port Authority will accelerate the rebuilding of the World Trade Center,'' he said in a statement. ''This is great news for New York.''
 At the end of Mr. Silverstein's 99-year lease, his buildings would revert to Port Authority control. 
 Under a 2006 agreement, Mr. Silverstein was to build three huge office towers along Church Street with a combination of tax-free bonds, insurance money and private financing. As part of that deal, the Port Authority took control of the flagship project, the 1,776-foot Freedom Tower, now called 1 World Trade Center, which is already under construction, with steel girders rising 230 feet above the street. 
 Until now, Mr. Silverstein and his investors have put little of their own money in the venture. But he has earned well more than $150 million in development fees over the past eight years. 
 With the credit market virtually shut down in the recession, Mr. Silverstein was unable to obtain financing or corporate tenants. (The Port Authority and the city had agreed to lease about 60 percent of his first tower.)
 Last year he proposed a deal that the Port Authority said would have cost about $3.5 billion in public assistance. In the last year, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has backed Mr. Silverstein's optimistic forecast of a rebounding real estate market and urged construction of at least two of the Silverstein towers as a way to sustain momentum at the site.
 On Wednesday night, Gov. David A. Paterson called Mr. Silverstein, who has a reputation as an inexhaustible negotiator, to ask him to stop bargaining and accept the deal. On Thursday morning, Mr. Bloomberg did the same. 
 Ultimately, the city, state and Port Authority each agreed to contribute, if needed, $200 million for the second Silverstein tower. To varying degrees, pushes to limit public subsidies for the buildings have come from authority executives, city officials and New Jersey's new governor, Christopher J. Christie, who together with Mr. Paterson oversees the Port Authority.
 Mr. Christie said in a statement on Thursday, ''While I am heartened and supportive of the broad outline that is leading to the conclusion of negotiations between the parties, I remain steadfast that any final agreement protect the taxpayers, commuters and toll payers of New Jersey and New York.'' 
 Mr. Bloomberg, asked about the public investment during a news conference to announce the deal, said: ''The only way we're going to have tax revenues to pay our police officers, to pay our firefighters, is to have economic development. The worst thing we can do in tough economic times is leave a big hole in the ground.''
 At its meeting on Thursday, the authority's board authorized Mr. Ward, the executive director, to negotiate a final document over the next 120 days. In a private session before the public meeting, the board insisted that Mr. Ward get strong language limiting Mr. Silverstein's development fees while public money was at risk in the second tower and providing the authority with a percentage of any profits coming from the first building.
 If the real estate market rebounds as quickly as he and Mayor Bloomberg predict, Mr. Silverman may be able to get tenants and private financing for his second tower and avoid using the $600 million in public money.

HEADLINE: The Future: A More Watery New York

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
Abandoned neighborhoods. Boarded-up harbor facilities. An oil refinery submerged under several feet of brackish water. The Statue of Liberty slowly sinking into the sea. 
 ''Rising Currents: Projects for New York's Waterfront,'' a new show at the Museum of Modern Art, reflects a level of apocalyptic thinking about this city that we haven't seen since it was at the edge of financial collapse in the 1970s, a time when muggers roamed freely, and graffiti covered everything. 
 Organized by Barry Bergdoll, the Modern's curator of architecture and design, the show is a response to the effects that rising sea levels are expected to have on New York City and parts of New Jersey over the next 70 or so years, according to government studies. The solutions it proposes are impressively imaginative, ranging from spongelike sidewalks to housing projects suspended over water to transforming the Gowanus Canal into an oyster hatchery. 
 Yet the show is no crackpot fantasy. Based on a two-year research project by the engineer Guy Nordenson, the landscape architect Catherine Seavitt and the architect Adam Yarinsky, it builds on recent municipal efforts to create a greener New York, from bike lanes to the construction of the new Brooklyn Bridge Park. Its vision of ''soft infrastructure,'' which would replace much of the city's aging concrete waterfront with a more porous blend of land and sea, is the most coherent model we have for a sustainable city in the current century -- as well as one that would radically transform New York's Manhattan-centric identity by reorienting the city around its harbor.
 One of the first things you see in the show is a provocative series of images of Lower Manhattan in 2080. The Freedom Tower has (just?) been completed and dominates the downtown skyline. Many of Battery Park City's towers, which were built on landfill produced by the construction of the original World Trade Center, are gone. A swath of green extends from the water's edge halfway up to Wall Street. At first glance, it looks like a sci-fi disaster flick.
 The elegance of this design, by Architecture Research Office, is in the way it manages to marry a wholly new landscape to Lower Manhattan's irregular pattern of streets. A series of bays proposed for the worst flood zones are carved out of the west side, creating a richly crenelated pattern along the island's coast. Delicate strips of restored wetland extend out into the water to attenuate waves, as if other parts of the city's grid were dissolving. 
 More radical, however, is the way the team has completely redesigned a typical Manhattan street. The asphalt has been ripped up and replaced with a perforated ''green'' cast-concrete surface designed to absorb rainwater. Sewer, water, gas and electric pipes are enclosed in waterproof vaults beneath this new skin, which can be removed for repairs. 
 A general interest in re-examining parts of the urban fabric that we take for granted, like streets, piers and canals -- as opposed to the more familiar desire to create striking visual objects -- is one of the main strengths of the exhibition. A team led by Matthew Baird Architects, for example, has focused on a huge oil refinery in Bayonne, N.J., that, if current estimates hold, will be entirely under water before our toddlers have hit retirement age. Rather than taking the predictable and bland route of transforming the industrial site into a park, the team proposes a system of piers that would support bio-fuel and recycling plants, including one that would produce the building blocks for artificial reefs out of recycled glass.
 Those large, multipronged objects, which the architects call ''jacks,'' could be dumped off boats in strategically chosen locations, where their forms would naturally interlock to create artificial reefs once they settled at the bottom of the harbor. The jacks are magical objects, at once tough and delicate, and when you see examples of them from across the room at MoMA, their heavy legs and crushed glass surfaces make them look almost like buildings. 
 But here again, what's really commendable about the design is the desire to look deeper into how systems -- in this case, global systems, both natural and economic -- work. According to Mr. Baird's research, the melting of the ice cap could one day create a northern shipping passage that would make New York Harbor virtually obsolete. The manufacturing component of the design is meant as part of a broader realignment of the city's economy that anticipates that shift.
 Because the contributors to this show are young and relatively untested (they are mostly in their late 30s and early 40s), there are some slightly hokey elements. A team led by Kate Orff of SCAPE/Landscape Architecture re-imagines the heavily polluted Gowanus Canal as an oyster nursery, in an effort to turn back the clock to a time when New York was an oyster capital of the world. 
 Oddly, the proposals that are most architectural in their approach often don't hold up as well as those that focus more on big infrastructure issues. NArchitects proposes a series of artificial islands that extend like fingers out into the harbor near the Verrazano Bridge, supporting suspended housing blocks. Channels are dug between the fingers into Sunset Park, Brooklyn, to obscure further the boundary between land and sea. The design is a nice counterpoint to the most brutal large-scale infrastructure and housing projects of Robert Moses-era New York. But the drama of suspending the structures from above doesn't read clearly enough in the design, and the effort seems wasted.
 Still, the value of the show has more to do with the story it tells as a whole rather than with any of the individual chapters. A healthy museum architecture department explores the kinds of ideas that are rarely addressed in the back and forth between government bureaucrats and bottom-line developers that characterizes most large-scale design projects. This is particularly true in an age that more and more seems to abhor creative risks of any kind. 
 The MoMA show asks us to rethink what the city could be, and in doing so nudges us away from a parochial mentality that tends to cling to the city's past greatness rather than embracing -- and facing up to -- its future. If the show has a flaw, it is that it should push even harder.
 ''Rising Currents: Projects for New York's Waterfront'' continues through Oct. 11 at the Museum of Modern Art; (212) 708-9400, moma.org.

 CORRECTION:
An architecture review on Friday about ''Rising Currents: Projects for New York's Waterfront,'' at the Museum of Modern Art, misspelled the surname of an architect who took part in a research project on which the show is based. He is Adam Yarinsky, not Yarinksy. The review also omitted a firm that was a partner in the design shown in a series of images of Lower Manhattan in 2080. Besides Architecture Research Office, dlandstudio also developed the design.

HEADLINE: Audit Faults 'Honor System' For Aid to City's Homeless

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN and C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration has done a poor job of monitoring nonprofit agencies that provide services to the homeless, doling out more than $152 million in ''handshake deals'' in 2008 to providers that did not have contracts, according to an audit released on Thursday by John C. Liu, the city comptroller.
 The lack of contracts makes it nearly impossible, the report said, to adequately assess how providers are spending the city's money. Besides poor financial control, the audit also said the city failed to determine if providers were meeting their goals for moving the homeless into permanent housing. 
 The city's Department of Homeless Services had no contracts with providers that control more than half of the nearly 10,000 units used to house homeless families, according to the audit. Since then, the percentage of units that are covered by a contract has increased slightly, to about 60 percent in January, the audit found. 
 The report said that the city department relied too much on social service agencies, in what was tantamount to an honor system, to disclose how many days the units they provided for the homeless were actually occupied. As a result, there was no accurate way, the audit said, to determine if the agencies were entitled to the money they received. 
 Indeed, the audit found several instances of double billing, and more than $953,000 in questionable payments.
 ''Who would go into business on an 'honor system'?'' said Mr. Liu, who was joined at a news conference outside his office at 1 Centre Street by Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, and several advocates for the homeless. ''This current honor system engaged between the agency and service providers is simply bad business practice. The City of New York is getting the raw end of this deal: poor management and no accountability.''
 The audit's findings echo past audits and reports of shoddy management practices by the Department of Homeless Services, and undermine Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's promise after one such report in 2003 to do a better job of entering into contracts. 
 The audit also comes as the Bloomberg administration, as part of an overall belt-tightening, has proposed cutting services to alleviate homelessness, an issue that has bedeviled the mayor since he took office. Though Mr. Bloomberg vowed in 2004 to cut the city's homeless population of 38,000 by two-thirds within five years, the population remains virtually unchanged.
 The proposed budget of $329 million for the Department of Homeless Services for the next fiscal year is $11 million less than the current one, and roughly 11 percent less than in the fiscal year 2008.
 ''These findings are disconcerting on many levels,'' said Judith Goldiner, supervising attorney with the Legal Aid Society's law reform unit. ''By failing to adequately monitor providers, D.H.S. has shortchanged the city's homeless, and taxpayers throughout the city. Such waste is unacceptable in any climate, and it is even more harmful during a time of economic strife.''
 But Bloomberg administration officials vigorously defended their policies. They said that the audit revisited a longstanding philosophical tug of war between the contracting approach favored by many social service agencies -- which the administration said was too rigid and took too long -- and its preferred per-diem approach, which the administration said was more flexible in dealing with short-term emergencies.
 ''This is not news,'' Robert V. Hess, the city's commissioner for homeless services, said in an interview. ''This debate has been going on for years.'' 
 Mr. Hess explained that the city had entered into no-contract deals because ''it's the only legal way we can add to our immediate need for additional capacity.'' He added: ''We come to an agreement with a landlord about a price per night; and we pay that as a billing rate. It's the only way we can add capacity quickly.'' 
 City officials noted that Mr. Liu's predecessor, William C. Thompson Jr., conducted a similar audit in 2003 that criticized the Bloomberg administration's practices. Mr. Thompson went to court last October over a specific contract in the Bronx, just as he was entering the home stretch of his unsuccessful bid to defeat Mr. Bloomberg in the November mayoral election. The current audit began under Mr. Thompson.
 ''We look forward to working with Comptroller Liu to find a better legal way to expedite shelter procurements and not leave the most vulnerable men, women, and children out in the cold because of bureaucratic red tape,'' Mr. Hess said.
 Beyond the findings related to the debate over noncontracts, the audit said that the city did not get people out of temporary housing fast enough. On average, homeless families spend about nine months in transitional housing.
 In 2008, more than 90 percent of service providers did not meet their goals for moving people into permanent homes, the audit said. Sixty-two percent of those who were living in one temporary center in the Bronx stayed for more than nine months, at a cost of $4.3 million. One person stayed for six and a half years.
 The audit also described unsanitary conditions in apartments, with cockroaches, dirty mattresses and mold-covered hallways. Such findings mirrored the results of previous audits. The audit included photos of poor conditions that investigators said they found at several buildings, including one at 1173 Walton Avenue in the Bronx.
 Mr. Hess said that the conditions at 1173 Walton Avenue and other buildings, which were made known to the agency last summer, were now being addressed, with inspections every two weeks, versus a ''bit longer'' previously.
 ''These were isolated incidents,'' he said. ''We certainly don't want there to be anything other than high-quality conditions.''

HEADLINE: ConAgra Shares Fall as Sales Disappoint

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
ConAgra Foods posted a 19 percent increase in quarterly income on Thursday but said its sales fell unexpectedly as it offered coupons and other promotions to push new products. 
 ConAgra's consumer foods segment showed 3 percent volume growth, helped by sales of products like Banquet frozen dinners and Chef Boyardee pasta that consumers embraced during the recession.
 But dollar sales in the segment rose only 2 percent, raising concern that the higher volume stemmed from heavy price promotions.
 ConAgra said profit rose to $228.7 million, or 51 cents a share, from $193.1 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 44 cents a share, matching analysts' average estimate.
 Sales fell 1 percent, to $3.10 billion, from $3.13 billion, as the company's flour milling operation passed on lower prices to customers, ConAgra said. Analysts on average had forecast $3.15 billion.
 On a conference call with analysts, ConAgra said most of the promotional spending was for items like new Healthy Choice and Marie Callender's meals. Manufacturers typically offer coupons and other deals to lure consumers to try new products and to get retailers to put those products on store shelves.
 Stock in ConAgra, which is based in Omaha, fell $1.16, or 4.4 percent, to $24.94 a share on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Carnegie Benefit for Haiti: Tracking the Numbers

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
On Sunday night, the Chinese pianist Lang Lang announced from the stage of Carnegie Hall, at a concert billed as a benefit for victims of the Haiti earthquake, that the generosity of the participating artists and some corporations had ''allowed us to raise $100,000 for Unicef so far.''
 But before others attempt to raise money for charity by holding their own musical events, it is instructive to look at where that estimated $100,000 came from. 
 All 2,804 seats for the concert were sold by 4 p.m. on Sunday, according to the producer, Anastasia Boudanoque of CAMI Music, an affiliate of Columbia Artists Management. Ticket prices, which ranged from $36 to $109, were set before the concert was designated as a benefit in late January (and were not tax deductible). 
 Because some free tickets were given out, and some tickets were discounted, the exact amount of the proceeds was not immediately available, but on Sunday the box office told CAMI that it estimated proceeds would be around $160,000, according to Ms. Boudanoque. 
 The New York Times reported last week that CAMI anticipated that costs for the concert would be $181,590, due in part to significant expenses for stagehand labor and advertising in The New York Times.
 If the box-office proceeds did not even cover the costs, how did the concert raise money? 
 Montblanc, the luxury-goods maker with which Mr. Lang, 27, has a sponsorship deal, subsidized the concert with $50,000 before it was designated a benefit. After it became a benefit, CAMI also decided to donate; in the last several days, although the exact box-office take was uncertain, CAMI sent a check for $50,000 to the U.S. Fund for Unicef, which raises money for the charity in the United States, Ms. Boudanoque said.
 In addition, as Mr. Lang noted in his onstage remarks, the members of a senior center in Chinatown raised $5,000, which they donated to Unicef. (Unicef confirmed the payment.)
 Ms. Boudanoque said that Mr. Lang's total also reflected a donation to Unicef made by Sony in early February, shortly after the earthquake, and after Mr. Lang had signed a recording deal with one of its divisions, Sony Classical. Mr. Lang is an official Unicef goodwill ambassador. Besides his new relationship to Sony Classical, Mr. Lang has also had a sponsorship agreement with Sony since April 2008 to promote its hardware globally.
 Mr. Lang said in a telephone interview on Wednesday that in the weeks after the Jan. 12 earthquake, ''I suggested to Sony corporate to donate money to Unicef.'' They agreed, he said, ''and they signed a check right in that moment.''
 A Sony spokeswoman, Lisa Davis, said that Sony made earthquake relief donations to three organizations: Unicef, Save the Children and the American Red Cross. She would not confirm the amount of the donation to Unicef, but said the check was sent on Feb. 2 to the U.S. Fund for Unicef, and that the U.S. Fund transferred the money to Unicef on Feb. 4. 
 A spokesman for the U.S. Fund for Unicef, Richard Alleyne, confirmed those dates.
 Sony and Mr. Lang are also raising money for Unicef through a single that Sony released on iTunes on March 16. The recording, of Chopin's Polonaise in A-flat Major No. 6 Op. 53, ''Heroique,'' was made in late February, when Mr. Lang was performing at the Musikverein in Vienna. At Sunday's concert, Mr. Lang said that the track was No. 1 on the iTunes classical chart. 
 In the interview, he said the piece had been downloaded more than 1,400 times. The track costs $1.29. Apple charges a processing fee for each purchase; Sony's take is 70 percent of each sale, or around 90 cents for each download. Mr. Lang waived his fee, and Sony said that all of its proceeds would go to Unicef -- approximately $1,260 so far.
 On Sunday at Carnegie Hall, Mr. Lang shared the stage with the conductor Christoph Eschenbach and the Schleswig-Holstein Festival Orchestra, which is touring with Mr. Lang, and the Haitian-American hip-hop musician Wyclef Jean. Mr. Jean's Yele Haiti Foundation raised millions of dollars after the earthquake; it has also been subjected to questions about its bookkeeping and its ability to distribute the money it raised. 
 Mr. Lang said he met Mr. Jean in December, when both appeared at events related to the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony. Mr. Jean invited Mr. Lang to join him in a performance of ''Gunpowder,'' an antiwar song he had written. They performed that song again at Sunday's concert, with new lyrics referring to the earthquake.
 Mr. Lang said that he had hoped to raise more money through the concert, but that the economy had made it difficult to attract corporate donors. 
 ''Obviously I was hopeful for more, but I think we did what we could for this time,'' he said. ''It's already finished, but I really hope money will keep going in.''

HEADLINE: Gang Colors in the Set, Part of a Rapper's Scheme

BYLINE: By JON CARAMANICA

 BODY:
There aren't many generators of good will in New York currently more effective than ''Beamer, Benz or Bentley,'' the creeping, slightly sinister collaboration between Lloyd Banks and Juelz Santana, a radio staple and the foundation for dozens of remixes.
 Nipsey Hussle, from Los Angeles, hasn't yet released a version of this song -- certainly there's an ''Impala, Cut or Caddy'' afoot, no? -- but at S.O.B.'s on Wednesday, far from home, he played to the crowd, bringing out Mr. Santana to perform the original and also for what might have been seen as an unlikely co-sign. 
 ''I came out to support the homie Nipsey Hussle,'' Mr. Santana said. ''I mean, y'all know what I rep, and I know what he rep.'' Different cities and coasts, to be sure, but also this: Nipsey Hussle is a self-proclaimed Crip, and Juelz Santana, who wore a fire-truck-red Yankees cap and scarf -- well, he's not.
 After a long break, traditional gang culture is reassimilating into hip-hop, owing in no small part to the increasing strength of Los Angeles rap. Business has long trumped colors there: in the Death Row era, the label owner Suge Knight, a Blood, happily profited off of the talented young Snoop Dogg, a Crip.
 That alliance is long gone, but a new generation of flag-waving Los Angeles rappers is keeping gang rap out of the nostalgia dustbin. Slight and weary-looking, Nipsey Hussle is at the front of that class. He's released three volumes of the ''Bullets Ain't Got No Name'' mixtape series, but so far, no album. Ever so briefly, he appeared in the recent Haiti-focused update of ''We Are the World.''
 Of late he's also spent a lot of time around Snoop Dogg, an influence you can hear not on the younger rapper, but on the older one. Nipsey Hussle, a sly but sometimes intricate rapper with a bossy, nasal tone, owes less to Snoop Dogg's trademark drawl than to the agitated, compressed style of Snoop's onetime Dogg Pound running buddy Kurupt.
 ''Hussle in the House'' from 2008 was his breakthrough single, a fat slice of late-1980s gangster rap classicism, with whining synths a la N.W.A. or Cypress Hill, a slow plod of a beat and sharply barked lyrics:
 I'm from where homicide boost the economy
 Pay taxes to these corners and putting in work is a policy
 It's white chalk on the corners
 It's yellow tape on the gates
 Choppers up above
 That's 'cause
 Tiny locs run the streets where I'm from
 That song, still one of his best, opened Nipsey Hussle's short, perfunctory, somewhat charmless set on Wednesday, a performance far less compelling than he is. He was better on the spooky ''Killer'' and ''The Hussle Way''; during ''Let's Talk $,'' one of his hypemen tossed handfuls of bills -- singles? -- into the crowd.
 He closed the night with his verse from a remix of Dorrough's resilient ''Ice Cream Paint Job,'' one of last year's biggest and most remixed Southern rap songs, showing his versatility on a record out of his sonic comfort zone, and region. That said, it's unmistakeably Nipseyesque: ''Pull up at the spot, park the Regal on the grass, man,'' he rapped. ''They say, 'Why you leave it running?' I say, '' 'Cause I'm in the hoooood, man.' ''

HEADLINE: Student Loan Overhaul Approved by Congress

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and TAMAR LEWIN; David M. Herszenhorn reported from Washington, and Tamar Lewin from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Ending one of the fiercest lobbying fights in Washington, Congress voted Thursday to force commercial banks out of the federal student loan market, cutting off billions of dollars in profits in a sweeping restructuring of financial-aid programs and redirecting most of the money to new education initiatives.
 The revamping of student-loan programs was included in -- if overshadowed by -- the final health care package. The vote was 56 to 43 in the Senate and 220 to 207 in the House, with Republicans unanimously opposed in both chambers. 
 Since the bank-based loan program began in 1965, commercial banks like Sallie Mae and Nelnet have received guaranteed federal subsidies to lend money to students, with the government assuming nearly all the risk. Democrats have long denounced the program, saying it fattened the bottom line for banks at the expense of students and taxpayers. 
 ''Why are we paying people to lend the government's money and then the government guarantees the loan and the government takes back the loan?'' said Representative George Miller, Democrat of California and chairman of the Education and Labor Committee. 
 Democrats celebrated the legislation, a centerpiece of President Obama's education agenda, as a far-reaching overhaul of federal financial aid, providing a huge infusion of money to the Pell grant program and offering new help to lower-income graduates in getting out from under crushing student debt. Still, the final bill is less ambitious than the original proposal. 
 Congressional allies of the student-loan industry attacked the overhaul as an overreaching government takeover. The legislation substitutes an expanded direct-lending program by the government for the bank-based program, directing $36 billion over 10 years to Pell grants, for students from low-income families.
 ''The Democratic majority decided, well look, while we're at it, let's have another Washington takeover,'' said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and a former federal education secretary. ''Let's take over the federal student loan program.''
 Even as the Democrats' decision to attach the student-loan overhaul to the health care package virtually ensured its passage, banks fought fiercely up to the last minute, prompting some lawmakers, like Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, where Nelnet has its headquarters, to cast their vote against the overall bill. 
 Although private banks will no longer be allowed to make student loans with federal money, many will continue to earn income by servicing those loans. 
 The Congressional Budget Office said the direct-lending approach would save taxpayers about $61 billion over 10 years. Roughly $40 billion of the savings will be redirected to higher education. Education programs will get an additional $10 billion from the health care package. 
 The bill includes some landmark changes, like automatic increases, tied to inflation, in the maximum Pell grant award. But for individual students, the increase in the maximum Pell grant -- to $5,900 in 2019-20 from $5,550 for the 2010-11 school year -- is minuscule, compared with the steep, inexorable rise in tuition for public and private colleges alike.
 And because college costs are rising so quickly, the maximum Pell grant now covers only about a third of the average cost of attending a public university, compared with three-quarters in the 1970s, when the program began. So each year, more students graduate with debt of more than $20,000. 
 The legislation will make it easier to pay back student loans, by reducing the share of income that a graduate must devote to loan payments and by accelerating loan forgiveness -- but not right away. Those who take out new loans after July 1, 2014, will have to devote 10 percent of their income to payments, down from the current 15 percent, and those who keep up their payments will have their loans forgiven after 20 years, reduced from the current 25. 
 ''Income-based repayment is a fantastic addition to the Senate bill that will allow over a million students to avoid being crushed by unmanageable levels of debt,'' said Rich Williams, a higher-education advocate at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. 
 With the new legislation, students will have to take out their loans through their college's financial aid office, instead of using a private bank. 
 The original proposal stood to save $87 billion over 10 years by ending the bank-based program, known formally as the Federal Family Education Loan program. But as the Senate delayed in taking up the legislation, colleges and universities began shifting to the direct-lending program, realizing the savings to the Treasury up front and cutting the amount of money available for future spending. 
 At the same time, an increase in the number of Americans enrolling in college and seeking financial aid, as a result of the recession, raised the projected costs of the enhanced Pell grant program.
 In addition, to comply with the complex budget reconciliation rules, some of the savings from the education changes had to be redirected to pay for parts of the health care legislation. 
 In the scaled-back, final version, the administration scrapped $8 billion in proposed spending on early-childhood education. It also mostly erased a $12 billion ''American Graduation Initiative,'' which was announced with fanfare in the fall as an effort to bolster the work force by producing millions more community college graduates over the next decade, and building up high-quality free online courses. 
 Community colleges, the main provider of higher education for most low-income Americans, were slated to receive $10 billion under the administration's original plan, but will instead get just $2 billion for job training. 
 ''I'm disappointed,'' said Eduardo J. Padron, the president of Miami Dade College, one of the nation's largest community colleges. ''For the first time, we had a president who understood the importance of community colleges, and we were validated and recognized for our role in opening the doors of higher education.'' 
 Untouched was the $2.55 billion to historically black and minority-serving colleges, a priority of the Congressional Black Caucus. If the new legislation had not passed, Obama administration officials say, Pell grants would have had to be cut to about $2,150, and some 500,000 students dropped from the program. 
 In lobbying fiercely against the overhaul, the private banks argued that it would eliminate jobs, even though the government will hire many of the same banks on a contract basis to service the loans and perform other back-office administration. Furthermore, the banks said that with the government as the only lender, students would not get the same level of service.

HEADLINE: Some Long-Term Jobless to Lose Benefits

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Congress raced to leave Washington for a two-week recess, a single Republican senator, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, blocked a stopgap bill to extend jobless benefits, saying its $9 billion cost should not be added to the national debt. 
 As a result, some people who have been out of work for more than six months will at least temporarily lose benefits. Health insurance subsidies for the jobless will also expire. Republicans said Senate negotiations had produced a compromise that did not pass muster in the House.
 Jim Manley, a spokesman for the majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said the Senate would try to retroactively award the benefits when it returns April 12.

HEADLINE: Shelby Criticizes Reform Bill, Saying It Won't End 'Too Big to Fail' Problem

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Democratic bill to overhaul the nation's financial system would not end the ''too big to fail'' phenomenon or adequately protect taxpayers from having to bail out large companies, a leading Republican senator said on Thursday. 
 The senator, Richard C. Shelby, is the top Republican on the Banking Committee, and his objections, laid out in a letter to the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, suggested the line of criticism that his party will pursue when the Senate takes up the bill, possibly as early as next month.
 Lawmakers from both parties have said that a major aim, perhaps the foremost aim, in rewriting financial regulations is to prevent the government from having to bail out systemically important financial companies, as it did in 2008. 
 But economists and lawyers have disagreed about how to create a workable ''resolution authority.'' In general, Republicans have sought to rely as much as possible on existing bankruptcy law, while Democrats support an approach like the one the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation uses to seize and dismantle failing banks. 
 Sole reliance on bankruptcy courts is seen as unfeasible. After the Bush administration allowed Lehman Brothers to fail in September 2008, markets went into a panic and the government was forced to bail out the American International Group and other companies.
 On Monday, the Banking Committee approved, on a party-line vote, a bill introduced by its Democratic chairman, Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut. 
 Mr. Shelby outlined four objections to the Dodd bill's handling of the ''too big to fail'' problem. 
 He said that the bill would leave the Federal Reserve with emergency lending powers that could be abused, and that the bill would give the F.D.I.C. and the Treasury Department the ability to provide broad debt guarantees. 
 ''A resolution regime can be credible only if the government does not have the authority to bail out failing firms,'' he wrote.
 The Dodd proposal contains a provision that would require large financial companies to contribute to a $50 billion fund that could be used to help dismantle a systemically important company. 
 Mr. Shelby called it a slush fund and said, ''The mere existence of this fund will make it all too easy to choose a bailout over bankruptcy.'' (The Obama administration has indicated that it does not support such a fund.)
 Finally, Mr. Shelby said that giving the Fed oversight over the largest and most interconnected financial companies would tarnish those firms by singling them out for scrutiny. 
 ''The market will view these firms as being identified by the Federal Reserve as 'too big to fail' and implicitly backed by the government,'' he wrote.
 Democrats have called for Republicans to come forward with alternative proposals instead of trying to block the legislation altogether.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Pakistan Agree To Reinforce Strategic Ties

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Pakistan and the United States wrapped up two days of high-level talks on Thursday, with a raft of economic development initiatives, an agreement to hasten deliveries of military hardware and a promise to put their often mistrustful relationship on a new footing.
 In a communique issued after the talks, the countries said they would ''redouble their efforts to deal effectively with terrorism'' and would work together for ''peace and stability in Afghanistan.'' 
 Administration officials said Pakistan was likely to get swifter delivery of F-16 fighter jets, naval frigates and helicopter gunships, as well as new remotely piloted aircraft for surveillance missions. But the United States was silent about Pakistan's most heavily advertised proposal: a civil nuclear agreement similar to the one the Bush administration signed with Pakistan's archrival, India.
 Given Pakistan's history of selling nuclear technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea, such an agreement would realistically be 10 or 15 years away, a senior administration official said Thursday. Still, the administration was careful not to dismiss the idea out of hand.
 ''This is a new day,'' Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said in greeting Pakistan's foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi. ''For the past year, the Obama administration has shown in our words and our deeds a different approach and a different attitude toward Pakistan.''
 The ''strategic dialogue'' was by itself meant to send a message: The administration used the term reserved for the substantive, wide-ranging exchanges it carries on with important countries like China and India. Pakistan and the United States held three such dialogues during the Bush administration.
 But last year, Mr. Qureshi asked Mrs. Clinton to upgrade the exchange to the level of foreign minister. On Wednesday, he said he hoped the two days of higher-level talks would help Pakistan and the United States overcome a history that ''did not always enjoy a sunny side.''
 Mr. Qureshi said the United States had agreed to put on a fast track some longstanding Pakistani requests for military hardware.
 Although Mrs. Clinton deflected a question about civil nuclear cooperation, she said, ''We're committed to helping Pakistan meet its real energy needs.''
 Among specific announcements was an agreement for the United States Agency for International Development to help Pakistan upgrade three thermal power plants. The administration said it would try to push through legislation creating so-called reconstruction opportunity zones in Pakistan. And it hopes to set up a fund to stimulate direct foreign investment.
 Pakistan's military campaign against Taliban insurgents in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan has improved the tenor of its relationship with Washington. But success on the battlefield cuts both ways for Pakistan, analysts said. It gives the country's government in Islamabad a more credible argument for increased military aid. But it also imposes greater expectations from the United States about Pakistan's counterinsurgency efforts and military cooperation.
 ''Yes, you get a pat on the back,'' said Bruce O. Riedel, an expert on Pakistan at the Brookings Institution. ''But now that you've shown you can do something, you've got to do more.''
 Pakistan's role in Afghanistan also remains a subject of intense scrutiny in the United States. The Pakistani authorities cooperated with the Central Intelligence Agency to capture the Taliban's military chief, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. But some analysts question whether the Pakistanis are rounding up other Taliban leaders, including shadow Afghan governors, simply to make sure that Pakistan has leverage in any future political bargaining in Kabul.
 Mr. Qureshi insisted that Pakistan wanted Afghanistan to lead this process. ''If they feel we can contribute, if we can help, we'll be more than willing to help,'' he said. ''But we leave it to them.''
 On this subject, however, administration officials are more interested in hearing from Pakistan's chief of army staff, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, who was part of the delegation. General Kayani recently held talks in Islamabad with Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, and the general is viewed as critical to determining the role Pakistan will play.
 Of all the raw nerves in the relationship, Pakistan's nuclear ambitions may be the most sensitive. Islamabad yearns for an agreement with the United States because it would confer legitimacy on Pakistan's existing program.
 But Washington does not formally recognize Pakistan as a nuclear power. The selling of nuclear secrets by the father of its nuclear program, Abdul Qadeer Khan, and the country's refusal to allow American investigators to have access to him ensures that this recognition may be a long way off.
 ''The question is, can you move somewhere toward giving legitimacy to a Pakistani nuclear program?'' said Daniel S. Markey, senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''Is there space between a civil nuclear deal and just saying 'no'?''

HEADLINE: Final Votes In Congress Cap Battle Over Health

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and ROBERT PEAR; Carl Hulse contributed reporting from Washington, and Sheryl Gay Stolberg from Iowa City.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Congress on Thursday gave final approval to a package of changes to the Democrats' sweeping health care overhaul, capping a bitter partisan battle over the most far-reaching social legislation in nearly half a century. 
 The bill, which Democratic leaders hailed as a landmark achievement, now goes to President Obama for his signature. 
 ''The American people have waited for this moment for a century,'' the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said at a news conference. ''This, of course, was a health bill. But it is also a jobs bill, an economic recovery bill, was a deficit-reduction bill, was an antidiscrimination bill. It was truly a bill of rights. And now it is the law of the land.'' 
 In a fitting finale to the yearlong health care saga, the budget reconciliation measure that included the final changes was approved first by the Senate and then by the House on a tumultuous day at the Capitol, as lawmakers raced to complete their work ahead of a two-week recess. 
 The final House vote was 220 to 207, and the Senate vote was 56 to 43, with the Republicans unanimously opposed in both chambers. 
 The reconciliation bill makes numerous revisions to many of the central provisions in the measure adopted by the Senate on Dec. 24, including changes in the levels of subsidies that will help moderate-income Americans afford private insurance, as well as changes to the increase in the Medicare payroll tax that will take effect in 2013 and help pay for the legislation. 
 The bill also delays the start of a new tax on high-cost employer-sponsored insurance policies to 2018 and raises the thresholds at which policies are hit by the tax, reflecting a deal struck by the White House and organized labor leaders. It also includes changes to close the gap in Medicare prescription drug coverage known as the doughnut hole, and to clarify a provision requiring insurers to allow adult children to remain on their parents' insurance policies until their 26th birthday. 
 Many of the changes were intended to address the concerns of House Democrats, as well as to bridge differences between the original House and Senate bills and to incorporate additional provisions sought by Mr. Obama. 
 The bill also included a broad restructuring of federal student loan programs, a centerpiece of Mr. Obama's education agenda. 
 As the Senate voted, Mr. Obama was in Iowa City where he opened an aggressive public relations blitz to sell the health care overhaul with a campaign-style rally at the University of Iowa Field House. 
 Speaking to a crowd of about 3,000 Mr. Obama dared Republicans to follow through on their efforts to repeal the legislation, which would require them to win back big enough majorities in Congress to override his veto. 
 ''My attitude is, go for it!'' Mr. Obama declared, warning Republicans that he is eager to take them on this fall. ''If these congressmen in Washington want to come here to Iowa and tell small-business owners that they plan to take away their tax credits and essentially raise their taxes, be my guest.'' 
 It was in Iowa City that Mr. Obama first laid out detailed plans for ''affordable, universal health care in America'' as a presidential candidate in May 2007. When he delivered that speech, he was facing criticism for lacking substance; his proposal made policy analysts sit up and take notice.
 ''Because of you,'' Mr. Obama told the crowd, ''this is the place where change began.''
 The Senate voted after running through an obstacle course of Republican amendments and procedural objections, which kept lawmakers working through Wednesday night until 3:30 a.m. Thursday. 
 Republicans, raising procedural challenges, identified small flaws that struck out two minor provisions. Those changes forced the bill to be sent back to the House one more time. 
 The Senate approved the measure shortly after 2 p.m. Senators cast their votes standing individually at their desks, a ceremonial gesture reserved for historic occasions. 
 Three Democrats opposed the measure, Senators Blanche Lincoln and Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Ben Nelson of Nebraska. Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, was ill and did not vote. 
 With both sides girding for a last round of parliamentary challenges, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. arrived in the chamber to preside over the session in his role as president of the Senate. Mr. Biden served for 36 years as a senator from Delaware, making him intimately familiar with the chamber, its rules and precedents, and the main combatants on the floor.
 As Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, formally made the procedural challenges, Mr. Biden twice replied, ''The point of order is sustained.'' Then he added, ''Both provisions are stricken.'' 
 Once the roll call was completed, Mr. Biden declared, ''The bill as amended is passed.'' 
 The vote came after Senate Democrats defeated more than 40 Republican amendments intended to delay or derail the legislation, including proposals related to insurance coverage of erectile dysfunction drugs for convicted sex offenders, the legality of same-sex marriage in the District of Columbia, and gun rights. 
 The provisions struck out were minor. One sought to prevent any annual decrease in the maximum amount of Pell grants for students from low-income families; the other was technical.
 Exuberant Democrats celebrated the vote in the corridors of the Capitol. Republicans, reacting somberly, said they would carry their opposition to the bill into the fall campaign, in an effort to win back majorities in Congress and repeal the measure. 
 In a floor speech, the House Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, derided the legislation as ''a sloppy mess that the majority of the American people believe should be repealed and replaced.'' He added, ''We're going to have to come back and fix this bill time and time again.''
 Although the bulk of the Democrats' overhaul was already the law of the land, the passage of the final revisions fulfilled a promise that Mr. Reid made to rank-and-file House Democrats before they took up the Senate version of the health care legislation and approved it Sunday night, 219 to 212.

HEADLINE: Chavez Critic Is Arrested, Then Freed, In Venezuela

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

 BODY:
CARACAS, Venezuela -- Agents from Venezuela's military intelligence agency on Thursday arrested Guillermo Zuloaga, the owner of the independent television network Globovision and one of the country's most influential critics of President Hugo Chavez, heightening concerns over an intensifying clampdown on news organizations and opposition political leaders. 
 Mr. Zuloaga was released several hours later and told not to leave the country while the investigation continued. International human rights groups and the Organization of American States had pressed the government to release him.
 Attorney General Luisa Ortega said that Mr. Zuloaga had been arrested in connection with comments he made this month at an Inter American Press Association meeting in Aruba that were considered false and ''offensive'' to Mr. Chavez. Among other remarks at the meeting, Mr. Zuloaga pointedly criticized methods used by Mr. Chavez's government to shut down news outlets, and was quoted as saying it meant the country lacked freedom of expression.
 The arrest of Mr. Zuloaga comes at a time when Mr. Chavez's government is adopting an increasingly harsh approach to dealing with the president's critics. Mr. Chavez, who is facing broad public ire over continuing electricity blackouts and a sharply contracting economy, recently pushed another critical television network, RCTV, off the airwaves. 
 Mr. Chavez has also long clashed with Globovision. Other private broadcasters tempered criticism of the president after lawmakers loyal to Mr. Chavez opened the way for sharp penalties on news outlets deemed to be inciting disorder. But Globovision kept its anti-Chavez stance.
 ''This is about the criminalization of opinion,'' Carlos Ayala Corao, a leading rights lawyer here, said in televised comments. ''It is an extremely grave matter.'' 
 The arrest of Mr. Zuloaga, carried out while he was preparing to board a plane to Bonaire, in the Dutch Antilles, followed the arrest this week of a high-profile opposition political figure for comments critical of Mr. Chavez's government that had been broadcast on Globovision.
 The politician, Oswaldo Alvarez Paz, a former governor of oil-rich Zulia State, said he supported claims by one of Spain's top judges that Venezuelan officials had helped ETA, the armed Basque separatist group, train with leftist Colombian guerrillas.
 Mr. Alvarez Paz also said that Venezuela had been transformed into a center for drug trafficking in South America. That assertion has also been made repeatedly by the United States government and in independent media investigations. 
 The authorities here charged Mr. Alvarez Paz with conspiracy and spreading false information. 
 As for Mr. Zuloaga's arrest, Ms. Ortega, the attorney general, said he faced prison terms of three to five months for comments considered offensive to the president, and of three to five years for the charge of divulging false information.
 In comments on Globovision, Mr. Zuloaga described his arrest as ''another abuse.''

HEADLINE: 'Cap and Trade' Loses Its Standing as Energy Policy of Choice

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Less than a year ago, cap and trade was the policy of choice for tackling climate change.
 Environmental groups and their foes in industry joined hands to embrace the approach, a market-driven system that sets a ceiling on global warming pollution while allowing companies to trade permits to meet it. President Obama praised it by name in his first budget, and the authors of the House climate and energy bill passed last June largely built their measure around it.
 Today, the concept is in wide disrepute, with opponents effectively branding it ''cap and tax,'' and Tea Party followers using it as a symbol of much of what they say is wrong with Washington. 
 Mr. Obama dropped all mention of cap and trade from his current budget. And the sponsors of a Senate climate bill likely to be introduced in April, now that Congress is moving past health care, dare not speak its name. 
 ''I don't know what 'cap and trade' means,'' Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said last fall in introducing his original climate change plan.
 Mr. Kerry's partner in promoting global warming legislation, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, pronounced economywide cap and trade dead last month and has since been working with Mr. Kerry to try to patch together a bill that satisfies the diverse economic, regional and ideological interests of the Senate.
 That plan, still being written, will include a cap on greenhouse gas emissions only for utilities, at least at first, with other industries phased in perhaps years later. It is also said to include a modest tax on gasoline, diesel fuel and aviation fuel, accompanied by new incentives for oil and gas drilling, nuclear power plant construction, carbon capture and storage, and renewable energy sources like wind and solar.
 Why did cap and trade die? The short answer is that it was done in by the weak economy, the Wall Street meltdown, determined industry opposition and its own complexity.
 The idea began as a middle-of-the-road Republican plan to unleash the market to reduce power plant pollution and spur innovation. But when lawmakers tried to apply the concept to the far more pervasive problem of carbon dioxide emissions, it ran into gale-force opposition from the oil industry, conservative groups that portrayed it as an economy-killing tax and lawmakers terrified that it would become a bonanza for Wall Street traders and Enron-style manipulators.
 ''Economywide cap and trade died of what amounts to natural causes in Washington,'' said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, who has been promoting the idea for more than two decades. ''The term itself became too polarizing and too paralyzing in the effort to win over conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans to try to do something about climate change and our oil dependency.'' 
 Cap and trade was first tried on a significant scale 20 years ago under the first Bush administration as a way to address the problem of airborne sulfur dioxide pollution -- widely known as acid rain -- from coal-burning power plants in the Eastern United States. A limit was imposed on emissions from the plants, and utilities were allowed to buy and sell permits to comply. Today it is considered one of the most effective environmental initiatives. 
 Environmentalists and industries resurrected the idea in recent years as a centerpiece of measures to address global warming and growing oil imports. Representatives Henry A. Waxman of California and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats, built their climate change bill last year in large measure around it. 
 But in trying to assemble a majority to pass it, Mr. Waxman and Mr. Markey dished out a cornucopia of concessions and exemptions to coal companies, utilities, refiners, heavy industry and agribusinesses. The original simplicity was lost, replaced by a bazaar in which those with the most muscle got the best deals.
 Opponents labeled it a tax-and-redistribution scheme.
 ''We turned it into 'cap and tax,' and we turned that into an epithet,'' said Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market research organization supported by conservative individuals and corporations. ''We also did a good job of showing that a bunch of big companies -- Goldman Sachs, the oil companies, the big utilities -- would get windfall profits because they'd been given free ration coupons.'' 
 C. Boyden Gray, White House counsel in the first Bush administration and a strong advocate of the acid rain cap-and-trade program, said that opponents were largely correct in labeling the Waxman-Markey plan a tax, because so many of the pollution allowances were given away to industry rather than allocated based on past emissions.
 ''This is potentially a $3 trillion tax,'' Mr. Gray said, ''which is pretty steep in the best of times, and poison in the worst of times.'' 
 The House narrowly passed the bill last June, but the Senate has moved slowly to take it up. Mr. Kerry and Mr. Graham, along with Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, have been trying to find support for a comprehensive measure.
 They, too, have been forced to seek compromise, offering incentives to oil drillers, nuclear power advocates, antitax groups, coal companies and utilities.
 Two senators, Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, and Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, have proposed an alternative that they call cap and dividend, under which licenses to pollute would be auctioned to producers and wholesalers of fossil fuels, with three-quarters of the revenue returned to consumers in monthly checks to cover their higher energy costs.
 Ms. Cantwell said that cap and trade had been discredited by the Wall Street crisis, the Enron scandal and the rocky start to a carbon credits trading system in Europe that has been subject to dizzying price fluctuations and widespread fraud.
 She said her bill would require every pollution permit to be auctioned rather than given away and was 39 pages long, compared with Waxman-Markey, which weighs in at some 1,400 pages.
 The Cantwell-Collins plan is almost exactly what Mr. Obama proposed in the campaign and after first taking office -- a 100 percent auction of permits and a large tax rebate to the public.
 ''He called our bill 'very elegant,' '' Ms. Cantwell said. ''Simplicity and having something people can understand is important.''

HEADLINE: First-Time U.S. Unemployment Filings Decline

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- New claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week.
 The Labor Department said first-time claims dropped by 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 442,000. That was below analysts' estimate of 450,000, according to Thomson Reuters. 
 But most of the drop resulted from a change in the calculations the department makes to seasonally adjust the data, a Labor Department analyst said. Excluding the effect of the adjustments, claims would have fallen by 4,000.
 The department updates its seasonal adjustment methods every year, and revises its data for the previous five years. Seasonal adjustment attempts to filter out expected changes in employment such as the layoff of temporary retail employees after the winter holidays. The goal of seasonally adjusted figures is to provide a more accurate picture of underlying economic trends.
 The four-week average of claims, which smoothes volatility, dropped by 11,000 to 453,750, the lowest since September 2008, when the financial crisis intensified.
 Initial claims have fallen in three of the last four weeks, wiping out most of the increase that took place in the first two months of the year. That increase early in the year stoked worries among economists that improvement in the job market was stalling.
 First-time claims were elevated last month by severe snowstorms on the East Coast, which caused backlogs in many state offices that fell behind in processing claims.
 Many economists say claims need to fall below roughly 425,000 to signal that the economy will consistently create jobs, though some say it could happen with claims at higher levels. Analysts forecast the nation will gain more than 150,000 jobs in March, partly due to temporary hiring for the Census. The March figures will be reported April 2.
 The number of people continuing to claim unemployment benefits, meanwhile, fell to 4.6 million.
 But that does not include millions of people who are receiving extended benefits for up to 73 extra weeks, paid for by the federal government, on top of the 26 customarily provided by the states. Nearly 5.7 million people were on the extended benefit rolls for the week ended March 6, the latest data available. That is about 300,000 lower than the previous week. The extended benefit figures aren't seasonally adjusted and are volatile from week to week.
 All told, more than 11.1 million people are claiming unemployment benefits, the department said.

HEADLINE: Reform Plan For Pensions Has Critics

BYLINE: By DAVID GREISING

 BODY:
The remarkably swift reform of the state's pension plans, thrust through Wednesday by Mike Madigan, the Illinois house speaker, does virtually nothing to make up a shortfall in funds, some of the state's leading pension-reform advocates said. 
 ''It's like a patient is in the hospital bed with a serious case of gangrene in the right leg, and the doctor has chopped off the little toe and wonders if that is a step forward,'' said Eden Martin, who has led calls for pension reform as president of the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago. ''While this was a step in the right direction, it didn't address the issue at all.''
 With no prior warning or public hearings, Mr. Madigan pushed through a measure to increase the retirement age of employees for state pension calculations to 67 from 65. He also capped the maximum salary that would apply in pension calculation at $106,800. Those changes, like the others in the bill, apply only to newly hired state employees. 
 In the near term, parts of the plan will worsen the $76 billion shortfall in the state's contributions to five public-employee pension funds -- among the worst in the nation. 
 By allowing the Chicago Public Schools a three-year hiatus in funding its pension obligations, the Madigan plan increases the immediate shortfall in funding teacher pensions by an estimated $1.3 billion. ''Not funding pension obligations is exactly what got Illinois into the precarious position it is in,'' said Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation, which has advocated pension reform. 
 A decision to pay compounded interest on pensions for lawmakers and judges could become politically potent as unions seek to respond to Mr. Madigan's reform measure, which was acted upon immediately in an apparent effort to bypass potential union opposition. For a lawmaker who has a $100,000 pension obligation, the state would owe an additional $80,000 after compounding at a conservative 4 percent interest rate over 15 years. 
 The Madigan measures, and other potential reform initiatives, may be vastly underestimating the size of the state's pension problem, said Joshua Rauh, a finance professor at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management who has studied the crisis in pension finances nationwide. 
 Illinois estimates its $76 billion pension shortfall by assuming the state's pension funds will earn an 8 percent annual return on their investments. Using a more standard measurement -- the rate of return on Treasury securities -- Mr. Rauh calculates the shortfall at nearly triple the official estimate: $218 billion. By that measure, each state citizen owes $16,897 to future pensioners, not the $5,844 official figure. 
 ''The reform did not change our numbers at all,'' Mr. Rauh said. ''In my view, it does not address the gaping hole of liabilities that's already been earned.''

HEADLINE: Even as Costs Rise, University of California Remains a Bargain

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco.

 BODY:
Alexander Dobranic, an undergraduate politics major at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is not taking math this spring. But he knows when numbers -- like the tuition and fee increases that have led to protests and vandalism on U.C. campuses this winter -- don't add up.
 ''We're only being billed a couple hundred extra dollars,'' Mr. Dobranic said, questioning what all the fuss is about. The first of two waves of increases have hit University of California campuses, and for some the extra cost is less than their daily large soy latte at Peet's. The first bump is as little as $4 more a day -- a small price to pay to protect one of the best educations in America from yet another round of what have been relentless, demoralizing cuts caused by the state's fiscal crisis. 
Mr. Dobranic did not want his education interrupted over such a sum, so he started a protest against the protests: a Facebook event called ''How about we DON'T protest on March 4th,'' a scheduled day of demonstrations. 
 To his surprise, instead of being vilified, Mr. Dobranic said hundreds of students joined him online. Campus news media interviewed him, and national conservative and libertarian groups have tried to recruit him.
 ''You're still getting one of the highest-quality educations in the country,'' Mr. Dobranic said. ''You should be grateful for that.''
 Mr. Dobranic is hardly alone in questioning the protests. A scan of the online comments section of The Daily Californian at the University of California, Berkeley, revealed a spirited debate and wide diversity of views.
 The schism has manifested in public, too. At one recent demonstration at the corner of Telegraph Avenue and Bancroft Way in Berkeley, the language was decidedly mixed. While one young man sporting a Che Guevara-style hat took to the microphone to shout that education is ''a human right we will defend to the death,'' other speakers conceded that the recent increases affected relatively few current students. 
 In Santa Cruz, Mr. Dobranic said the increase represented an additional $293 for the current spring quarter. The university's calendar shows the campus open 73 days during that time, which breaks the increase down to $4.01 per day.
 At Berkeley, which is on a semester system, the same calculations put the increase at $5.22 per day.
 A second increase goes into effect over the summer, raising the average University of California education costs to $10,302 from $7,788 for undergraduate California residents, up about 32 percent -- a total increase of less than $11 per day.
 Considering education in such mercurial ways is bound to be controversial. As Mark Twain wrote, ''There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics.'' Few will appreciate having their additional financial burden equated to the price of a movie ticket.
 But the 32 percent breathlessly reported by local news media rarely explains the increases in actual dollars, and often fails to explain the costs relative to other universities. A recent report by KTVU-TV quoted a student at De Anza College, a community college in Cupertino, saying the increase was so extreme that she would ''have to go out of state to go to college.''
 It is an oft-repeated view that appears to have little truth. According to rankings by U.S. News & World Report, Berkeley at No. 21 is the highest-rated public university in the nation, in the same tier as private institutions like Harvard, Stanford and Yale. State residents attending the University of California pay a small fraction -- as little as 25 percent -- of what students pay for tuition at similarly ranked colleges and universities.
 Seven other University of California campuses are also ranked in the magazine's top 100, making them a relative bargain compared with most of the nation's other top-quality schools.
 To be sure, any increase in cost is too much for students like Zachary J. Taylor. In order to afford his degree in urban studies, he crammed his course work into three years to graduate from Berkeley in May.
 Mr. Taylor said he favored the protests because they provoked discussion about the state's future. ''There's a crisis of priorities -- there's tons of money here,'' he said, referring to the overall economy.
 Accepted to the London School of Economics for this fall, Mr. Taylor, 20, said Californians needed to have ''messy long conversations'' about education, taxes and legislative gridlock or the state's fortunes would worsen.
 ''Everyone's frustrated, at least we can all agree,'' he said. ''That's a starting point.''

HEADLINE: As Budget Gaps Widen, San Francisco Police Salaries Grow

BYLINE: By GERRY SHIH

 BODY:
Three years ago, Gary P. Delagnes, the president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association, made a bullish prediction after successfully negotiating a lucrative four-year contract: After a scheduled 4 percent pay raise phased in on July 1, 2010, Mr. Delagnes wrote in a note to the officers, the force would most likely fulfill a 20-year mission to become the ''highest paid major police department in the country.''
 Now, his prediction may be coming true, but at the worst possible time. As it nears its gilded goal, the union may be simultaneously alienating itself from its traditional rooting sections on the street and in City Hall. The raise is set to take effect just as city government is cutting deeply across every department in an effort to bridge a record $522 million budget gap.
The city has asked the police union to forgo the raise, but the union has refused. Union officials said that Mayor Gavin Newsom had warned them that he may take the unprecedented step of laying off 180 of the force's 2,374 uniformed officers to save $17 million. A spokesman for the mayor's office said that the city was seeking those savings by any means possible and that it did not rule out layoffs. 
 ''When I sit down with my constituency,'' said Supervisor David Campos, who was on the police commission before running for district office, ''the feeling I get is they want the police, but they don't want the police being the best compensated in the country when we're shutting down gyms and pools.''
 He added: ''There are violence-prevention programs, after school programs, programs for youth, they are all critical components of the policing. Should they be the best compensated in the country at a time when we're cutting all these services? I don't think that should be the case.''
 For years, voters in this labor-friendly town have afforded the public employee unions generous contracts and benefits at the ballot box -- transit workers are guaranteed the nation's second highest wages by a voter-approved city charter amendment. But in recent weeks, hundreds of people have taken to the streets to protest the transit union's refusal to give pension concessions. Some see a similar moment approaching for the city's police.
 ''The folks who wear the uniforms are favored by the leaders, and the public has a special place in their hearts for them because to their credit, they are the thin blue line,'' said William A. Sokol, a labor lawyer and lecturer on labor studies at San Francisco State University. 
 ''It gives them that peculiar and special place in our society which has enabled them to get all kinds of benefits and emoluments that by and large the rest of us don't get.'' But now, he added, the brisk rise in police pay might appear to portray a union that has somehow overreached.
 ''It's a tough row to hoe,'' he said.
 The police wage gains have in recent years outstripped those of all other San Francisco public employees. Since 2003, total compensation paid by the department has risen by more than 67 percent to $364 million while the ranks of employees grew to 2,787 from 2,524. Average pay per employee rose to $130,600 in the 2008-9 fiscal year from $95,600 in the 2003-4 fiscal year.
 By 2009, wages had consumed 84 percent of the $442 million Police Department budget. And the police budget itself, although still just 6.7 percent of the city's total budget, has been an ever-larger slice of the tax revenue available to the city, according to city data reviewed by The New York Times. 
 While it is difficult to confirm that San Francisco's uniformed officers will earn more than their counterparts in any other big city if the scheduled raise takes effect, economists at the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that the 2009 average hourly wage of San Francisco officers was about 67 percent higher than the national average, 15 percent above that of officers in Los Angeles and 18 percent higher than in San Diego.
 Last year, 52 officers and command staff members took home total compensation of more than $200,000, according to records provided by the city controller. Several large payouts were made, in part because of a series of personnel shuffles in the upper ranks, which triggered one-time payments for accrued sick leave and compensatory time. 
 Some of the totals for 2009 were memorable. Charles J. Keohane, a deputy chief who was retiring, earned total pay of $516,118; Morris Tabak, a deputy chief who was promoted, received $425,558; and three captains whose assignments were changed earned more than $300,000 each.
 Street-level officers in recent years have also had opportunities to receive generous compensation. The highest-paid officer, Ricardo Guerrero, earned $223,170 last year when he worked in the narcotics division; he is now a plainclothes officer in the Mission Station. 
 Since 2007, Officer Guerrero's cumulative compensation has totaled nearly $680,000. Of this, $298,000 was his cumulative salary payments for 2007 through 2009. Much of the remainder was overtime and ''other pay,'' a category that includes compensation for time spent in court, or pay differentials for officers on night shifts or motorcycle patrols, said Assistant Chief Kevin Cashman.
 Homicide rates have dropped 54 percent in San Francisco in the past year while overall violent crime dipped 10 percent; rates in many other large cities dropped as well, according to federal crime statistics.
 Union officials say the wage increases are necessary to recruit competitively. 
 ''In 1989, we were the 92nd best compensated department in the state of California,'' said Kevin M. Martin, a 25-year patrolman out of Southern Station who also serves as vice president of the officers' union. ''It's been through great, great, contract negotiations by Gary Delagnes that we've moved up to the top three in the country.''
 Criticism of police pay and benefits is hardly unprecedented. For decades, the Police Department has weathered intermittent attacks, only to emerge with its compensation largely unaffected. During the 1990s and early 2000s, the debate over the department's generous pensions occasionally grew heated. Officers who have served 30 years are now eligible for pensions at 90 percent of their salary in their final year.
 In the past six years, the focus became intractable overtime overruns, culminating in a series of civil grand jury reports that recommended drastic overhauls to eliminate the culture of bonus pay, expanding oversight and limit overtime eligibility to officers below the rank of captain.
 ''We got too many guys who became dependent on a certain amount of overtime, and if they weren't able to make that they found themselves in a little bit of ditch,'' Mr. Martin said.
 ''Overtime is a very contentious issue,'' said Vincent Pan, a member of the police commission. ''It's time and a half, so it adds up fast.''
 Chief Cashman said that budget cuts over the past two years, combined with internal reforms -- such as requiring high-level approval of overtime requests and close monitoring of the number of hours worked -- had reduced costs. Overtime pay from general funds, as opposed to overtime reimbursed by sponsors of events like the Chinese New Year's parade, dropped to $20 million last year, after reaching a high of $26 million in the 2007-8 fiscal year. As of January, the department was on track to accumulate roughly $16 million in general-fund overtime payouts this year. 
 But the drop in overtime did nothing to slow the increase in total compensation per capita. 
 Reckoning the bottom line on the budget, however, and reckoning the political bottom line of controlling public safety costs are two very different calculations. Even in the midst of the recession and the budget crunch, there may still be some political risk in questioning the compensation of police officers. There certainly was when the city's former mayor, Art Agnos, did so in 1988, during another extreme budget crisis. In a telephone interview, Mr. Agnos said that his proposal to cut police and fire compensation exacted a political toll from which he never recovered.
 ''I got hammered,'' Mr. Agnos said. ''It's the third rail of politics -- public-safety benefits and compensation and pensions. They are very often in harm's way, and no politician wants to argue that they shouldn't be paid the hero's pay.''

HEADLINE: Chinese Leaders Divided on Whether to Let Currency Rise

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Sewell Chan contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Signs are emerging of conflicting views among China's leaders over whether to allow the country's currency to rise against the dollar. 
 The conflict, which has broken into rare public view, seems to be mainly between China's central bank and its Commerce Ministry. But how it is eventually resolved could decide the course of trade tensions between China and the United States. 
 Many experts contend China deliberately undervalues its currency, the renminbi, making Chinese exports more competitive on global markets and creating jobs in China at the expense of employment elsewhere. 
 The current drama began on March 6 when the governor of China's central bank stunned analysts by saying that the bank's policy of keeping the renminbi at a constant exchange rate against the dollar was a ''special'' response to the global financial crisis. 
 The new description suggested to many economists that the current value of the renminbi was temporary and that the central banker, Zhou Xiaochuan, was preparing the Chinese public for a stronger renminbi.
 But other Chinese officials, particularly at the Commerce Ministry, have fought back in the last two weeks, stoking nationalism and anti-American sentiment by loudly declaring that China would not be told what to do by the United States. 
 ''It seems like they are talking from different perspectives,'' said Li Wei, the director of the American studies department at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, speaking of the Chinese officials. He added that he supported the Chinese government's overall stance of resisting American pressure.
 The debate is far from academic. In the coming weeks, the Obama administration faces a series of politically charged deadlines set by Congress to decide whether to continue negotiating with China over currency and trade issues or to take a more confrontational stance and name China a currency manipulator. 
 If the administration labels China a currency manipulator, it would face further Congressional pressure to impose punitive tariffs on many Chinese goods. 
 So far, the media-wise Commerce Ministry is trouncing the normally secretive central bank.
 Every few days, senior Commerce Ministry officials have spoken out, warning that pressure to let the renminbi rise is ''irrational.'' The ministry is close to exporters, who are still upset that shipments fell early last year for the first time since China began opening trade in the late 1970s. China's overall trade surplus was $198.1 billion last year, down from $297.4 billion the year before as global trade shrank during the financial crisis. 
 The ministry has even taken its campaign to Washington, with Zhong Shan, the deputy minister, giving a speech at the United States Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday morning and telling reporters at the Chinese Embassy on Wednesday afternoon that American pressure for a stronger renminbi ''is unacceptable to China.''
 These comments have raised a surge of anti-American sentiment in Internet chat rooms and prompted daily headlines on the front pages of Chinese newspapers that China must not ''back down.''
 Borrowing a page from the playbook of some of the most sophisticated Western crisis management consultants, the ministry even sent to reporters last week the private cellphone numbers of eight Chinese academic experts on Sino-American trade relations. But unlike the Western consultants, the ministry did not ask or warn the academics before giving out their phone numbers.
 Some Chinese economists gingerly suggested in the past year that China could find better uses for the hundreds of billions of dollars it spends buying United States Treasuries and other foreign securities to keep the renminbi from rising against the dollar. 
 That investment in overseas bonds was equal to nearly a tenth of China's entire economic output last year, even though Treasuries have a return of only 0.13 to 4.76 percent currently. If the renminbi does appreciate eventually, the value of China's vast foreign reserves will plunge in renminbi terms -- a loss for which the central bank would likely be blamed.
 Maintaining the current level of the renminbi also means the central bank cannot easily push up interest rates -- a move countries normally use to battle inflation. 
 That may be necessary in China. The economy here is doing so well and China international competitiveness is so strong that inflation is starting to appear. Exporters have more orders than they can fill -- although imports have been rising even faster as Chinese companies have stockpiled commodities as a hedge against inflation. 
 Export-oriented provinces in coastal China raised their minimum wages by 20 percent last week in a desperate bid to attract more workers from China's increasingly prosperous interior to run factory assembly lines.
 These problems have made the central bank unenthusiastic about selling renminbi and buying foreign bonds so as to hold down the value of the currency, people close to the central bank said. But the bank has been reluctant to make its case in public, consistently rebuffing requests for interviews, and now may have missed its chance as the increasingly free Chinese business press has embraced the weak renminbi as a nationalistic symbol of Chinese sovereignty.
 In many policy discussions between the United States and China over the past two decades, the Chinese government has seemed to maintain a laserlike focus. American officials in a succession of administrations and Congresses have been more like flashlights pointing in different directions at night.
 But in the current debate, American officials have been tightly disciplined -- the Treasury, Commerce Department and Office of the United States Trade Representative have said little. Chinese officials, on the other hand, have been vocal and less consistent.
 In the United States, the Treasury -- and often only the Treasury secretary himself -- comments on the dollar. That has helped limit sudden fluctuations in the dollar's value in currency markets.
 But China has no such policy limiting which agencies or individuals can publicly address currency issues. For decades, currency policy has been the purview of the central bank, but the central bank is a politically weak institution. The People's Bank of China is simply one of many economic policy ministries and even lacks independent authority over monetary policy, unlike the Federal Reserve. 
 Commerce Ministry officials say that they are following a broader trend in the Chinese government of greater responsiveness to the public. ''Our ministry is doing a good job to be more open and more transparent -- there is even an office in our ministry responsible for publicizing our policies,'' said Chen Rongkai, the ministry's division director for press.

HEADLINE: Street Repair Falls Victim To Budgets

BYLINE: By SUSAN SWARD

 BODY:
San Francisco motorists may have to be prepared for more potholes in their already bumpy streets unless the city comes up with more money.
 That may come as a surprise to those who are currently dodging the many repaving projects. That work is being underwritten by both the city -- whose budget line item for road repairs doubled to $40 million last year -- and a one-time infusion of $13.5 million in federal stimulus money. 
But after that money is spent, said Edward D. Reiskin, the director of the city's Department of Public Works, there is not going to be much left for road work. 
 One reason is that last year, San Francisco's leaders scrapped a multimillion-dollar road-repair measure headed for the ballot after polls showed a lackluster response on the part of voters.
 ''It's unrealistic to think that we're going to be able to make additional new road expenditures at a time when we are drastically cutting all our most critical city services,'' said David Chiu, the president of the Board of Supervisors.
 Mr. Chiu noted that the city was forced to cut $438 million from its budget last year and faced a $522 million cut this year.
 At the same time, payouts for street-related lawsuits and claims rose more than 17 percent in the past two years, to $634,268, according to records in the city attorney's office.
 ''In a down economy, the city sees more claims,'' Mr. Reiskin said. ''I think that's part of what is going on.'' 
 Without more money to maintain the city's 850 miles of roadway, he said, ''we won't be able to keep average street conditions from declining, and we certainly won't be able to make improvements in the overall condition of the streets.''
 The challenge is enormous. Just last weekend, the city staged a ''pothole blitz,'' filling 125 holes on four major thoroughfares: 19th Avenue, Park Presidio Boulevard, Van Ness Avenue and Lombard Street.
 Mr. Chiu, who with Mayor Gavin Newsom had sponsored the $368 million street bond that they then abandoned last July, said he and the mayor had asked a city capital planning committee ''to think about other alternative sources of funding to deal with the street and roads condition.'' The bond would have paid for street repaving and sidewalk repair, along with other improvements.
 San Francisco's money crunch for street repairs is being felt by other counties statewide, said DeAnn Baker, the senior legislative representative of the California State Association of Counties. 
 Ms. Baker said her organization participated in a study pinpointing state transportation improvement needs at $7 billion a year for the next 10 years. But she added: ''I don't know anyone who is willing to back increased support for transportation in light of everything else going on in the economy. We continue to underinvest in our infrastructure.''

 ERNESTINE ANDERSON WITH HOUSTON PERSON (Tuesday through Thursday) Ms. Anderson, a soulful and experienced singer, is at her best weighing the ups and downs of love. She should have no problem covering that terrain with help from a frequent foil, the tenor saxophonist Houston Person, and a rhythm section consisting of the pianist Lafayette Harris Jr., the bassist Lonnie Plaxico and the drummer Willie Jones III. (Through April 4.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway , (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30 and $35, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Nate Chinen)20100325
KENNY BARRON (Saturday) Mr. Barron is the leading practitioner of an elegant, economical and sure-footed piano style that thrives in any mainstream setting. He can often be found at the helm of a trio or a quintet, but here he performs unaccompanied, most likely savoring both the flexibility and the intimacy of that setting. At 7:30 and 9 p.m., Brooklyn Conservatory of Music, 58 Seventh Avenue, at Lincoln Place, Park Slope , (212) 209-3370, bqcm.org; $25; $15 for students. (Chinen)20100325 
 DAVID BERGER JAZZ ORCHESTRA (Monday) This ensemble, led by the composer-arranger-trumpeter David Berger, can always be trusted with a good repertory angle. Here it's ''The Undiscovered Standards of Harry Warren,'' in a program featuring the vocalists Freda Payne and Denzal Sinclaire. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway , (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $20; students, $10; with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)20100325
 MAURICE BROWN EFFECT (Tuesday) The trumpeter Maurice Brown plays an extroverted strain of modern jazz that borrows from soul and hip-hop as well as from bop. His working band includes Derek Douget on tenor saxophone, Chris Rob on piano, Solomon Dorsey on bass and Joe Blaxx on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan , (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $20. (Chinen)20100325
 REGINA CARTER AND REVERSE THREAD (Friday through Sunday) Ms. Carter, one of the most charismatic violinists in jazz, has explored timbres both rustic and urbane throughout her career. Her current preoccupation -- and the promising subject of her forthcoming album, ''Reverse Thread'' (E1), due out in May -- is folkloric music of Africa. She previews that material here, in a group that includes Yacouba Sissoko on kora, Will Holshouser on accordion, Chris Lightcap on bass and Alvester Garnett on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway , (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30 and $35, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)20100325
 BILL EVANS AND ROBBEN FORD (Friday through Sunday) Virtuosity, the chief ingredient shared by blues-rock, bluegrass and fusion, will be in copious supply during an engagement jointly led by the saxophonist Bill Evans and the guitarist Robben Ford. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village , (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $30 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)20100325
 ORRIN EVANS QUARTET (Tuesday and Wednesday) ''Faith in Action'' (Posi-Tone), the new album by the Philadelphia pianist Orrin Evans, does a lot of things right: galvanizing a band, advancing an agenda, articulating a purpose. The album's main rhythm section, Luques Curtis on bass and Nasheet Waits on drums, appears here to help celebrate its release (and, a couple of days late, Mr. Evans's birthday); also on hand is the sure-footed young saxophonist Tia Fuller. At 9:30 and 11 p.m. and 1 a.m., Zinc Bar, 82 West Third Street, Greenwich Village , (212) 477-9462, zincbar.com; cover, $10, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)20100325
 EVOLVING VOICE/EVOLVING MUSIC (Monday) The headliner on this edition of the experimental music series, appearing at 10 p.m., is Bizingas, a quartet with Kirk Knuffke on trumpet, Brian Drye on trombone, Jonathan Goldberger on guitar and Ches Smith on drums. Preceding them at 9 is an improvising trio composed of the saxophonist Ingrid Laubrock, the guitarist Mary Halvorson and the drummer Tom Rainey. Earlier sets will feature poets -- Pierre Joris and Nicole Peyrafitte at 8, Golda Solomon at 7 -- each backed by a bassist. Local 269, 269 East Houston Street, at Suffolk Street, Lower East Side , (212) 228-9874, myspace.com/rucmanyc; $10 per set; $15 for two sets; $20 for the night; students, $7 per set; $12 for two. (Chinen)20100325

At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village , (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)20100325
 JERRY GONZALEZ AND FORT APACHE (Saturday and Sunday) A powerhouse of Afro-Latin jazz for more than 20 years, Fort Apache, led by the trumpeter and conga specialist Jerry Gonzalez, brings crackling energy to an array of rhythmic conceits. This edition of the group includes Joe Ford on saxophones, Zaccai Curtis on piano, Andy Gonzalez (Mr. Gonzalez's brother) on bass and Dafnis Prieto on drums. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village , (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; $25; $10 for members. (Chinen)20100325
 TORD GUSTAVSEN ENSEMBLE (Wednesday) A Norwegian pianist of lyrical and often halcyon sensibilities, Tord Gustavsen recently expanded from his usual trio format toward something broader and more emphatic. His new album, ''Restored, Returned'' (ECM), features the same group appearing here, which features two front-line participants: the vocalist Kristen Asbjornsen and the saxophonist Tore Brunborg. At 8:30 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan , (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $25. (Chinen)20100325
 GILAD HEKSELMAN QUARTET (Friday) Drawing partly from his most recent album, ''Words Unspoken'' (LateSet), the coolly proficient Israeli guitarist Gilad Hekselman leads a top-shelf band with Mark Turner on saxophone, Joe Martin on bass and Marcus Gilmore on drums. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village , (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; $20; $10 for members. (Chinen)20100325
 FRED HERSCH (Wednesday) Four years ago Mr. Hersch became the first person to headline a week of solo piano at the Village Vanguard, on the heels of an excellent album. Here, in a concert presented by the Abby Whiteside Foundation, he once again airs an approach to the format that's elegant and to the point, with room for digression but a forthright respect for melody. At 8 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall , (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $35. (Chinen)20100325
 HOT & COOL NEC JAZZ 40TH VOCAL SHOWCASE (Friday) The New England Conservatory has been celebrating the 40th anniversary of its jazz program, and this feels like one of the better ways to do it: with a smorgasbord of vocalists, including an influential pillar of the faculty (Dominique Eade); a few stylistically diverse established talents (Patrice Williamson, Amy Cervini, Sofia Rei Koutsovitis); and a pair of highly promising recent arrivals (Sara Serpa, Jo Lawry). The rhythm section, also consisting of alumni, is similarly first-rate. At 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village , (212) 967-7555, joespub.org; $15, with a two-drink or $12 food minimum. (Chinen)20100325
 HSBC JAZZ FESTIVAL (Saturday) This smooth-jazz festival, making its first landing near the heart of Times Square, features the singer Al Jarreau. Adding a whiff of youth is the trumpeter Christian Scott, celebrating his solid third album on Concord; he opens for Mr. Jarreau. Saturday at 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street , (800) 745-3000, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $39.50 to $95. (Chinen)20100325
 CHARLIE HUNTER (Saturday and Sunday) On his wryly titled new album, ''Gentlemen, I Neglected to Inform You You Will Not Be Getting Paid'' (Spire Artist Media), the guitarist Charlie Hunter renews his investment in backbeat funk and instrumental gospel groove, with a cohort that includes a few horns. He does something similar here, leading a group with Mike Williams on trumpet, Alan Ferber and Curtis Fowlkes on trombone and Eric Kalb on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan , (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $30 on Saturday; $25 on Sunday. (Chinen)20100325
 JOE LOCKE'S FORCE OF FOUR (Friday and Saturday) Revisiting the music and camaraderie of a recent album, ''Force of Four'' (Origin), the dynamic vibraphonist Joe Locke leads a group with Robert Rodriguez on piano, Ricardo Rodriguez (they are not related) on bass and Johnathan Blake on drums. At 8 and 10 p.m., Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street , (212) 885-7119, kitano.com; cover, $25, with a $15 minimum. (Chinen)20100325
 JOHN MCNEIL-BILL MCHENRY QUINTET (Friday) The trumpeter John McNeil and the tenor saxophonist Bill McHenry make up a wiseacre front line and a two-man history lesson, specializing in hardy bebop obscurities. For this one-nighter, part of the festivities surrounding the 40th anniversary of the New England Conservatory jazz program, they enlist a rhythm section consisting of the pianist Ethan Iverson, the bassist Matt Penman and the drummer Billy Hart. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village , (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)20100325
 NEC JAZZ SUMMIT (Saturday) This is the culmination of a weeklong festival tied to the 40th anniversary of the New England Conservatory jazz program. Among the alumni assembled to perform are the pianists Ran Blake, Matthew Shipp and Jason Moran; the vocalists Sarah Jarosz and Dominique Eade; the guitarist Joe Morris; the keyboardist Bernie Worrell; D.J. Logic; and two-thirds of Medeski Martin & Wood. Proceeds will support jazz scholarships at the institution. At 7:30 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street , (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)20100325
 GARY PEACOCK, MARC COPLAND, BILL STEWART (Tuesday through Thursday) The bassist Gary Peacock is a deeply intuitive musician, drawn to sonorous melody, and so are his partners in this trio, the pianist Marc Copland and the drummer Bill Stewart. A handful of years ago the same group made a beautiful record called ''Modinha'' (Pirouet) under Mr. Copland's leadership; results should be just as fine here. (Through April 3.) At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton , (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $30 and $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)20100325
 21ST CENTURY DIZZY: DANILO PEREZ AND FRIENDS (Thursday) Mr. Perez, the irrepressible Panamanian pianist, composer and educator, spearheads a tribute to a Dizzy Gillespie, the irrepressible trumpeter, composer and bebop ambassador (and, for a spell, his former bandleader). The assembled cast is as sharp and multicultural as anyone could expect; it features David Sanchez and Rudresh Mahanthappa on saxophones, Amir ElSaffar on trumpet and vocals, Ben Street on bass and Jamey Haddad and Adam Cruz on drums and percussion. (Through April 4.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan , (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $30. (Chinen)20100325
 VICTOR PRIETO QUARTET (Thursday) Victor Prieto, a Spanish accordionist with an exuberant style, presides over a quartet with the tenor saxophonist Chris Cheek, the bassist Carlo De Rosa and the drummer Vince Cherico. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Tea Lounge, 837 Union Street, near Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn , (718) 789-2762, tealoungeny.com; suggested donation, $5. (Chinen)20100325

Miller. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village , (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)20100325
 KURT ROSENWINKEL STANDARDS TRIO (Friday) Last year the guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel released ''Reflections'' (Wommusic), the first album featuring his Standards Trio. With songs by the likes of Wayne Shorter and Thelonious Monk, it's the closest thing to a conventional guitar-trio album that Mr. Rosenwinkel has made -- and yet it has the same luminescent, nearly weightless quality of all of his work. Revisiting the album's premise here, he enlists the bassist Matt Clohesy and the drummer Ted Poor. At 7:30, 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan , (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $30. (Chinen)20100325
 PHAROAH SANDERS (Saturday) The tenor saxophonist Pharoah Sanders, one of the most significant survivors of 1960s free jazz, has never stopped imbuing his performances with the tone of a spiritual quest. His appearance here, on a concert that also includes the poet Louis Reyes Rivera and the Yoruba-inspired group Omi Yesa, is part of the Central Brooklyn Jazz Festival. At 8 p.m., Boys and Girls High School Auditorium, 1700 Fulton Street, Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn , (718) 773-2252, cbjcjazz.org; $35. (Chinen)20100325
 JOHN SCOFIELD NEW QUARTET (Friday and Saturday) John Scofield, one of modern jazz's leading guitarists for the better part of 30 years, introduces a promising lineup featuring one of his well-traveled contemporaries, the pianist Mulgrew Miller. Anchoring the group is a muscular young rhythm team, with Ben Street on bass and Kendrick Scott on drums. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton , (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $30 and $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)20100325
 TODD SICKAFOOSE'S TINY RESISTORS (Wednesday) As a bassist, Mr. Sickafoose builds grooves from the ground up, but that's no impediment to the buoyancy of his music. ''Tiny Resistors'' (Cryptogramophone), his most recent album, features a number of tunes in which horn parts and guitar lines swirl around a calmly asymmetrical pulse; among his partners here are the violinist Jenny Scheinman, the saxophonist John Ellis and the trombonist Alan Ferber. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan , (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $20. (Chinen)20100325
 TANGO SALON (Friday and Saturday) The Argentine bassist Pablo Aslan, a prominent figure in the thriving jazz-tango subculture, draws mainly from his new album, ''Tango Grill'' (Zoho), in this special engagement. Among his featured partners: the clarinetist and saxophonist Paquito D'Rivera, presenting a new piece of his own; the acclaimed bandoneon player Raul Jaurena; and the drummer Daniel Piazzolla, grandson of the nuevo tango pioneer Astor Piazzolla. At 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway , (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $30 to $95. (Chinen)20100325
 STEVE TURRE QUINTET (Friday and Saturday) Steve Turre, the trombonist and conch shell player, brings casual virtuosity to the conventions of small-group hard-bop. He leads a strong ensemble with Billy Harper on saxophones, Xavier Davis on piano, Corcoran Holt on bass and Dion Parsons on drums. At 8, 10 and 11:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street , (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; cover, $30, with $10 food and drink minimums. (Chinen)20100325
 CEDAR WALTON, JAVON JACKSON, BUSTER WILLIAMS, JIMMY COBB (Wednesday) Radiating competence and camaraderie, this quartet calls on a trio of vigorous elder statesmen (Mr. Walton on piano, Mr. Williams on bass and Mr. Cobb on drums), along with an accomplished former young blood (Mr. Jackson on saxophones). At 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street , (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $35, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)20100325
 STEVE WILSON QUARTET (Friday through Sunday) The saxophonist Steve Wilson combines economy and modernity in his playing and engages deeply with his supporting cast, which consists here of the pianist Orrin Evans, the bassist Ugonna Okegwo and the drummer Bill Stewart. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village , (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)20100325

 Museums
AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'APPROACHING ABSTRACTION,' through Sept. 5. Self-taught artists are noted for producing weird, wacky and otherwise eccentric objects. This exhibition of about 60 works from the museum's permanent collection proposes that the best of them are also adept abstractionists. Few works are nonrepresentational, and most have a vibe of strangeness, but almost every piece is as compelling for its form and technique as for its idiosyncratic imagery. 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan , (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20100325 
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KIKI SMITH: SOJOURN,' through Sept. 12. Kiki Smith's installation ''Sojourn'' was inspired by an 18th-century needlework, Prudence Punderson's ''First, Second and Last Scene of Mortality.'' There are rich ideas in that work, about the female life cycle and the life of the artist; to these Ms. Smith adds religious, mystical and personal symbolism. The installation's many drawings, peopled with women at various stages of life, can be quite affecting. But Ms. Smith has a tendency to sugarcoat death with craft: flowers, papier-mache, antique glass, gold and silver leaf and glitter everywhere. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20100325
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'TO LIVE FOREVER: ART AND THE AFTERLIFE IN ANCIENT EGYPT,' through May 2. Drawing from its own world-class collection of Egyptian art and artifacts, the Brooklyn Museum has assembled an exhibition exploring all facets of the Egyptian funerary industry. It's not a blockbuster, but it is fascinating. It presents more than 100 objects, from massive stone sarcophagus covers and elaborately decorated wooden coffins to little statuettes and elegant ink drawings on sheets of papyrus. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20100325
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'DESIGN USA: CONTEMPORARY INNOVATION,' through April 4. Less an exhibition than an extra-large design seminar in your head, this dense display presents work by all 78 recipients of the annual National Design Awards, which were established in 2000. Encompassing several generations, it honors individuals and corporations and recognizes historic achievements and some of the latest things. One of these is a specially programmed iPod Touch that serves as an exhibition guide; it puts the show in the palm of your hand and is free. Don't even think about not using it. 2 East 91st Street, Manhattan , (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Roberta Smith)20100325
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'CONTEMPLATING THE VOID: INTERVENTIONS IN THE GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM,' through April 28. In what it calls ''a self-reflexive folly,'' the museum completes the 50th-birthday festivities for Frank Lloyd Wright's building by inviting more than 200 artists, architects and designers to have their way with the landmark rotunda -- imaginatively speaking, of course. Some 193 responded, usually in digital photographs, depicting it as everything from a place to exhibit their work; to a site for trampolines, forests and aquariums; to a jumping-off point for a redesign. The architects tend to be more Oedipal, but not one really improves upon the space. The list of invitees, while global, is a trifle predictable, overloaded with sculptors and installation artists and noticeably short on painters and photographers, who also have imaginations. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Roberta Smith)20100325
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'TWILIGHT VISIONS: SURREALISM, PHOTOGRAPHY AND PARIS,' through May 9. Considering how revolutionary Surrealist photography was back in the day, it may seem paradoxical that nostalgia would be the mood suffusing this resonant exhibition. But it makes sense. Caught in the throes of sweeping change in the cultural capital of the Western world, photographers like Andre Kerte, Ilse Bing, Man Ray and others were as preoccupied with what was being lost as with what might be gained by modernization, and the images they made are darkly meditative. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street , (212) 857-0000, icp.org.

 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MASTERING THE ART OF CHINESE PAINTING: XIE ZHILIU (1910-1997),' through July 25. This philosophically intriguing exhibition presents drawings and paintings by a 20th-century Chinese artist and professor who was trained in traditional artistic methods in his youth. That meant primarily copying and tracing drawings and paintings by past masters. Xie's elegant but unimaginative copies are interesting mainly for what they reveal about how classical artists arrived at works of seemingly effortless perfection: not by observing nature but by repeatedly imitating other artists. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20100325
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MASTERPIECES OF FRENCH ART DECO,' continuing. The largest exhibition of works from the Met's extensive holdings in French Art Deco fills a large gallery to overflowing with nearly 150 examples of art, furniture, wallpaper, decorative objects and the odd painting. Far more aristocratic than its American counterpart, French Deco devoted exquisite craftsmanship, opulent materials and historicizing design to the creation of one-of-a-kind luxury items. The desks and cabinets of the incomparable Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann quietly dominate, along with vases by Jacques Dunand and silver by Jean Puiforcat. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20100325
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'PLAYING WITH PICTURES: THE ART OF VICTORIAN PHOTOCOLLAGE,' through May 9. This seemingly modest, startlingly reverberant exhibition reveals that upper-class Englishwomen of the 1860s and '70s devised an early form of collage, the supposedly Cubist breakthrough. Adding cutout photographs of family, friends, royals and celebrities to the watercolor albums that were already an acceptable female activity, they created all kinds of witty effects -- drawing-room scenes, trompe l'oeil designs, human-animal hybrids. The effects of Darwinism and the publication of ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' register in these amazing works, as does the collective, even osmotic nature of invention. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)20100325
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE DRAWINGS OF BRONZINO,' through April 18. Agnolo Bronzino was the hand to hire for a power portrait in mid-16th-century Florence. He could turn toddlers into potentates and make money-mad Medicis look like decent people. At his peak, in the 1550s, he was the most influential artist in Florence. So why, given his fame, he has had to wait some 500 years for a museum solo is a puzzle. But that solo has now arrived at the Met. Encompassing all but 2 of the 61 works on paper currently attributed to the artist, and justifying each attribution in its gorgeous catalog, the show is scholarly tour de force and a breathtaking demonstration of a sovereign hand at work and at play. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)20100325
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2010. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20100325
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'YOUNG ARCHER,' continuing. Is it or is it not? ''Young Archer,'' a life-size marble carving of a naked boy drawing an arrow from his lion's paw quiver might be the earliest known sculpture by Michelangelo. Scholars disagree. On a 10-year loan from France, the legless, armless boy with a yearning expression is in the Met's bright and airy Velez Blanco Patio, where viewers may decide for themselves if it is the real thing. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20100325
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'DEMONS AND DEVOTION: THE HOURS OF CATHERINE OF CLEVES,' through May 2. The need for new bindings creates the rare, maybe one-time chance to see 93 of the 157 surviving miniatures from the extraordinary illuminated book of hours commissioned around 1440 by Catherine of Cleves (1417-1479) in the southern Netherlands. Among the masterpieces of a golden age by an anonymous artist known only as the Master of Catherine of Cleves, it features exquisite, jewel-like miniatures that locate the Holy Family, apostles, and saints in the here and now, among detailed interiors and landscapes and trompe l'oeil borders. The kingdom of God gives way to that of the real. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Roberta Smith)20100325
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'ROME AFTER RAPHAEL,' through May 9. This exhibition of 16th-century Italian drawings from the Morgan's collection covers a lot of ground. It moves, in fits and starts, from the High Renaissance to Mannerism and the nascent Baroque. And it's enlivened by the classic match-up of Raphael versus Michelangelo; drawings by both artists, and their followers, pit Raphael's sprezzatura, or relaxed refinement, against Michelangelo's vein-popping muscularity. Look for drawings by Parmigianino (in Raphael's camp) and the sumptuous Farnese Hours by Giulio Clovio (in Michelangelo's), in addition to splendid Late Mannerist studies by Annibale Carracci. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20100325
 MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'BIGGER, BETTER, MORE: THE ART OF VIOLA FREY,' through May 2. Viola Frey's giant ceramic sculptures of men and women are among the underappreciated wonders of late-20th-century art. Rising 11 feet and higher, wearing business suits and ties and nondescript dresses, they have a spookily imposing physical presence and a clunky, cartoonish ugliness. With their blank or seemingly angry expressions, they may remind you of what it was like to be a child among grown-ups troubled by incomprehensible problems. 2 Columbus Circle , (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20100325
 MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'SLASH: PAPER UNDER THE KNIFE,' through April 4. The third show in the museum's Materials and Process series, ''Slash'' explores the sometimes violent, always intricate art of paper cutting. The art is impressively detailed and eager to please, though rarely challenging. Among the highlights are 12 site-specific installations that engage the architecture of the museum's year-old home at Columbus Circle in savvy ways. Jane South's ''Wall'' evokes fire escapes, ventilation systems and other elements of the urban-industrial landscape; in Mia Pearlman's ''Inrush,'' whorls of white paper descend on the gallery with gale force from a recessed window. 2 Columbus Circle , (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20100325
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MARINA ABRAMOVIC: THE ARTIST IS PRESENT,' through May 31. The long-building energy wave of performance art hits the Museum of Modern Art with this four-decade survey of work by one of the form's more visible and magnetic figures. And the show's combination of stressed-out bare flesh on film and live bodies, some nude, in the galleries, makes pretty radical fare for the museum. The exhibition is part true endurance-test grit, part pure diva hokum. And it comes with a mission: to demonstrate that it is possible to preserve an ephemeral medium through live re-creations of past work in a museum setting. The demonstration falls flat, but Ms. Abramovic herself is performing a new piece. It consists of her sitting absolutely still and staring straight ahead in MoMA's atrium for almost the entire time the museum is open during the show's run, an estimated 716 hours and 30 minutes, all told. Visitors are invited to participate by taking a seat across from her and meeting her gaze. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Holland Cotter)20100325
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PERFORMANCE 7: MIRAGE BY JOAN JONAS,' through May 31. It helps to think of time as cyclical, or at least non-Western and nonlinear, when encountering Joan Jonas's ''Mirage'' at the Museum of Modern Art. The latest installation of a piece conceived in 1976, it suggests that Ms. Jonas's art has a longer-than-usual life span because it's constantly being reborn. In its current form at MoMA, ''Mirage'' consists of six moving-image works arranged in a loose circle and accompanied by a series of props: metal cones, chalkboards, a mask and a wooden hoop, among other objects. Performance, drawing, dance and video combine and recombine in arcane but thrilling ways. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)20100325
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'TIM BURTON,' through April 26. Given the tremendous visual appeal of Mr. Burton's movies, you would expect that this expansive retrospective of his nonmoving art would be equally exciting. Alas, it is a let-down. Focused mainly on hundreds of Victorian-Gothic-Expressionist cartoons dating from his teenage years to the present and including paintings, sculptures, photographs and a smattering of short films on flat screens, it is an entertaining show, but there is a sameness to all Mr. Burton's two- and three-dimensional output that makes for a monotonous viewing experience. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Ken Johnson)20100325
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'WILLIAM KENTRIDGE: FIVE THEMES,' through May 17. This well-designed exhibition of prints, drawings, films and film installations from the last 30 years showcases the artist's dazzling fusion of charcoal drawing and stop-action animation to excellent effect. The 1990 animations that meditate on the ravages of apartheid remain especially powerful. As the show traces a kind of progression away from, and back to, political subject matter, through a gallery that offers a dreamlike visit to his studio, it also traces his growing role in his own work, first as image, then as actor. And with a forthrightness that is almost touching, the exhibition also confirms that in the contest between still and moving images, moving almost always wins. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Roberta Smith)20100325
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MONET'S WATER LILIES,' through April 12. Devotees of late Monet can rejoice. The Museum of Modern Art has hung its three ''Water Lilies'' together for the first time since 2001, along with a relatively recent acquisition and two guests. That's six waterlily paintings, all completed in the last dozen years before the artist's death in 1926. In addition, these canvases are isolated from the onward march of Modernism according to MoMA, and their separateness emphasizes their meditative, immersive quality. But it also confirms their radical achievement. While bringing Monet's Impressionism to a grand conclusion, they also open the path to Abstract Expressionism. It can still stop you in your tracks. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Roberta Smith)20100325
 NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: '185TH ANNUAL: AN INVITATIONAL EXHIBITION OF CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN ART,' through June 8. This year the National Academy's Annual has been pared down to 65 artists from the usual 120 or so. Reduced finances are to blame, but happily this juried exhibition doesn't suffer. Quality is high over all, and congestion has been minimized. Painting dominates, as always here, but with everything from photorealism to geometric abstraction, the show still feels rich in variety. The lineup includes the Chelsea habitues Dana Schutz, Ghada Amer and the fast-rising Alison Elizabeth Taylor, whose impressive marquetry work graces a marbled alcove. National Academy Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Rosenberg)20100325
 NEW MUSEUM: 'SKIN FRUIT: SELECTIONS FROM THE DAKIS JOANNOUS COLLECTION,' through June 6. This exhibition of works from the collection of a New Museum trustee selected and installed by the art star Jeff Koons might conceivably have pulled a rabbit out of its ethically sticky headgear. Instead it teems with usual suspects, and its overcrowding benefits no one, especially the several larger, more admittedly festivalist works that form its high points. This museum has some rethinking to do, and high on the list should be coming to grips with the size and limitations of its often poorly proportioned galleries. Ultimately the air of complicity is less disturbing than the look of complacency. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)20100325
 NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'NOGUCHI REINSTALLED,' through Oct. 24. In anticipation of the museum's 25th anniversary in 2010, this show presents about 200 of Isamu Noguchi's works from the 1920s to the 1980s. They include sculptures in stone, wood, metal and clay; maquettes and models for parks and playgrounds; and props for Martha Graham dance productions. Though unfailingly suave, Noguchi's polished abstraction no longer has the urgency it once had, but the museum as a whole is a wonderful time capsule, and the sculpture garden he designed is utterly blissful. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Johnson)20100325
 QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: DANIEL BOZHKOV AND DUKE RILEY, through April 25. Two young and opportunistic artists -- Daniel Bozhkov and Duke Riley -- have found a way to make the most of the Queens Museum's transitional state. (The museum is in the process of expanding.) Egged on by trusting curators and a residency program, Launch Pad, that encourages exploration of the site and the Queens community, they have turned to the surrounding park and its former ice rink for materials and inspiration. Their adjacent solo installations are well worth seeing, if only because they are profoundly at odds with each other: Mr. Bozhkov salvages, while Mr. Riley torches the place in a ''naumachia'' (Roman naval battle). Flushing Meadows-Corona Park , (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20100325
 SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'A SONG FOR THE HORSE NATION,' through July 7, 2011. Including saddles, riding blankets, clothing and beaded bags and much more, this exhibition brings to light a fascinating and ultimately sad chapter in American history: the hundred-year period during which horses were central to the lives of the Plains Indians. A highly efficient form of transportation, horses enabled Navaho, Crow, Comanche, Pawnee and others to expand their territories and flourish more than they otherwise would have. It also enabled them to make war more effectively, though ultimately not effectively enough. George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan , (212) 514-3700, americanindian.si.edu. (Johnson)20100325
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'COLLECTING BIENNIALS,' through Nov. 28. Start your Whitney Biennial experience on the fifth floor, with this permanent-collection show of works by artists who were in past Annuals and Biennials. It caps off an extravaganza of brand-new art with a humbling and diverting mix of classics, oldies and one-hit wonders. Figurative paintings from the 1950s Annuals are paired with contemporaneous Abstract Expressionism, and some big names from the 1980s (Schnabel, Condo) look refreshed. Most eye-opening is the fact that some of the most influential artists (Warhol, Hammons) barely register on the Biennial scorecard. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)20100325
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: '2010 WHITNEY BIENNIAL,' through May 30. In the spirit of the economically bleak two years it represents, the Whitney has made efforts to under-pitch its 2010 Biennial, and the show lives up -- and down -- to its billing. There are fewer artists than in the past. Its installation is spartan. Spectacle is out. Much of what's in is quiet and hermetic to the point of looking blank. The prevailing aesthetic is the art of the tweak, minute variations on conventional forms and historical styles: abstract paintings stitched like quilts, performance pieces channeling the 1960s, and so. The show feels empty where it reflects the retrenched, art-about-art spirit of the moment. But it also has strong work, particularly in video and photography, that speaks of life beyond the art factory. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Holland Cotter)20100325
 Galleries: Uptown
 MILTON AVERY: 'INDUSTRIAL REVELATIONS,' through May 1. This knockout exhibition is the first exhaustive look at the artist's depictions of New York City's waterways, bridges and railroad yards from the late 1920s and early '30s, a period most associated with his portraits. But here he is out in the open, already summoning the deft abbreviations of form, space and light that would dominate his mature, far more pastoral landscapes. With more than three dozen works -- one-third of them oils -- this show provides an exciting new view of Avery's development and reminds us that his many-splendored achievement is still not fully visible. Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street , (212) 794-0550, knoedlergallery.com. (Smith)20100325
 OTTO DIX, through Aug. 30. The first Dix retrospective in this country provides heady glimpses of the achievement of this ''wild man'' of German art. Few things escaped his remorseless eye -- from the horrors of World War I to the hypocrisies of the Weimar Republic. He made every stop on the itinerary of German modernism (including Realism, Dada, Surrealism, Expressionism, folk, visionary), had a few Cubist moments and, of course, qualified as ''degenerate'' under the Nazis. This exhibition of more than 100 paintings, prints, watercolors and drawings (organized with the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts) doesn't have the scope -- or the space -- to do Dix justice, but it begins to make up for lost time. Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street , (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Roberta Smith)20100325
 'PAINTINGS OF FELIX VALLOTTON,' through April 10. The Swiss artist Felix Vallotton (1865-1925) was and still is much admired for his elegantly simplified, erotic woodcut prints. This show of paintings from 1905 to 1912, all depicting attractive young women in different states of dress and dishabille, is a revelation. Inspired by Ingres, these works offer a weird, frankly lubricious classicism. It would be great to see more. Michael Werner, 4 East 77 Street , (212) 988-1623, michaelwerner.com. (Johnson)20100325
 Galleries: Chelsea
 R. CRUMB: 'THE BIBLE ILLUMINATED: R. CRUMB'S BOOK OF GENESIS,' through April 17. Loaded with sex, violence, visions and miracles, the stories in the Book of Genesis of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Lot and his daughters, David and Goliath and many others seem custom-made for Mr. Crumb's bawdy sensibility and earthy draftsmanship. His 207 richly hatched, firmly delineated drawings bring to unruly, comical life people and events that often seem puzzlingly abstract in the Bible, from the seven days of creation to the happy death of Joseph at 110 in Egypt. David Zwirner Gallery, 519 West 19th Street , (212) 727-2070, davidzwirner.com. (Johnson)20100325
 JACCO OLIVIER, through April 3. Mr. Olivier makes films by painting a picture in a loose, representational manner and photographing each stage as he repaints and changes the image. The major attraction here is a mesmerizing, 20-foot-wide wall projection. Colorful, loosely painted images of planets, stars and luminous gases slowly move from left to right against distant fields rendered in Abstract Expressionist-style gestures. It is as if you were seeing the universe through the eyes of God -- or a god -- turning on a central pivot as he surveys his infinite domain. Marianne Boesky Gallery, 509 West 24th Street , (212) 680-9889, marianneboeskygallery.com. (Ken Johnson)20100325
 KEN PRICE: 'NEW SCULPTURE,' through April 10. A dozen impressive new ceramic sculptures reflect the continued cultivation of Mr. Price's rich, ever evolving vocabulary of suggestive forms and his radiant palette of layered, exquisitely revealed colors. His biomorphic idiom has encompassed single shapes stretched to extremes and multiple forms fused to bumpy excess. Now combined shapes suggestive of sausage or Mallomars retain their integrity, while broadcasting intimations of the human form: entwined lovers, reclining odalisques and a seated, Matissean blue nude. But, as usual, that is only half the story. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street , (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com. (Smith)20100325
 BANKS VIOLETTE, through April 17. This show has something of a comeback feeling. Its centerpiece is one of the artist's best efforts so far: a big, morose chandelier, made of white fluorescent lights hung low, that resembles a skeletal cabana or giant wind chime, despite the arctic light. Its black wiring spreads like tendrils across the floor to a bank of outlets in a big road case that a rock band might use. Opposite, enormous, rumpled planes of Mr. Violette's signature black fiberglass refract the light of the chandelier. They suggest abstract outcroppings, collapsing billboards and rock arena sets. They're a bit vacuous, but have never been better used. Gladstone Gallery, 530 West 21st Street , (212) 206-7606, gladstonegallery.com. (Smith)20100325
 Galleries: SoHo
 JOSEF ALBERS/KEN PRICE, through June 1. Pairing a German abstract painter and color theorist, Josef Albers (1888-1976), and a ceramic sculptor, Ken Price (born 1935), is a bit of curatorial genius that can make your eyes feel attached to a bigger, better brain. An intricate dovetailing of works spanning several mediums and decades clarifies their individual greatness. The shared passion for strong color juxtapositions is to be expected. Less so are those for Modern architecture, pre-Columbian pyramids, stones, interior spaces (variously erotic, domestic or symbolic) and an oscillation between biomorphic and straight-edged form. Anyone interested in the curatorial arts should see this thrilling show, among the best and most timely to grace a New York commercial gallery. Brooke Alexander Gallery, 59 Wooster Street , (212) 925-4338, baeditions.com. (Smith)20100325
 JOSEF ALBERS: 'FORMULATION: ARTICULATION, 1972,' through May 8. This headlong plunge into all things Josef Albers (1888-1976) presents a portfolio of 127 silk-screens that sums up his art and thought to a remarkable degree -- especially if you read the ''Statements of Content'' explaining each motif. A horizontal installation aids absorption, which can transform your understanding of both Albers in particular and abstraction in general, revealing it to be, unexpectedly, an art of everyday life. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street , (212) 343-0441, peterblumgallery.com. (Smith)20100325
 'THE BRUCENNIAL 2010: MISEDUCATION,' through April 12. This alternative to the Whitney Biennial is the brainchild of the Bruce High Quality Foundation, a five-artist collective that is also in the Whitney show and that is intent on placing some of the art world's more conspicuous functions, like education and the organizing of exhibitions, into artists' hands. The show's fun, but how alternative is it? With its floor-to-ceiling roster of young artists and veteran guest celebrities, it feels like the average Bring-Your-Art festival crossed with a Whitney Biennial of maybe 25 years ago. 350 West Broadway, between Broome and Grand Streets , brucennial.com. (Holland Cotter)20100325
 Last Chance
 JOE BRADLEY AND CHRIS MARTIN; closes on Saturday. This combination of two sympathetic but quite different abstract painters -- one boisterous, one restrained, both basic in approach -- was an excellent idea that should have been carried out more convincingly. Showing several blank canvases, some of them shaped in the manner of Ellsworth Kelly, Mr. Bradley in particular plays it too cool. The more genuine collaboration is the book that accompanies the exhibition. Devoid of text and filled with photographs of artworks, exhibitions, family and friends, it generously surveys the artists' common ground. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea , (212) 744-7400, miandn.com. (Smith)20100325
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ANISH KAPOOR'; closes on Sunday. This exhibition by the celebrated British sculptor consists of just one work, but it's a doozy. Viewable only from three partial perspectives, ''Memory'' is an enormous, egg-shaped volume of Cor-Ten steel, wedged into a boxy side gallery like a dirigible that drifted off course and got stuck. One approach offers only a square window allowing you to behold the impenetrable, seemingly infinite darkness inside. Call it a womb with a view. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Johnson)20100325
 SUE GURNEE: 'THE FULGENT CADENCES'; closes on Saturday. This perplexing but intriguing exhibition presents works by a professional healer who lives in North Carolina. If you meditate on Ms. Gurnee's square canvases bearing thinly painted layers of nonrepresentational forms -- spacey veils of muted color; translucent, bubblelike circles and ovals; and small, deftly brushed glyphic signs -- you are supposed to experience a clarifying integration of your brain functions. Feature Inc., 131 Allen Street, between Delancey and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side , (212) 675-7772, featureinc.com. (Johnson)20100325
 GEORGE AFEDZI HUGHES: 'LAYERS'; closes on Saturday. Born in Ghana and living in the United States since 1994, George Afedzi Hughes is a multitasking artist, working as poet, performer and painter. There's a sense of all these disciplines working together in the collage-style paintings in this substantial show, which insert single words and Twitter-style abbreviations among images of soccer players, soldiers and animals. Silvery figures float like rising souls above a battered landscape made from cutout high school yearbook portraits. Gold is everywhere in the paintings: in the sunburst of a lion's mane, in a dollar sign, in a disembodied brain. Values, like objects, seem to be in violent motion. Skoto Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, fifth floor, Chelsea , (212) 352-8058, skotogallery.com. (Cotter)20100325
 CHARLES W. HUTSON: 'A SURVEY'; closes on Saturday. The Southerner Charles W. Hutson (1840-1935) took up painting at 65, and refusing instruction from his artist-daughter, developed a genre of charmingly awkward yet carefully observed landscapes -- first in watercolor, then in pastels and finally oils. The pastels and oils are best. Their powdery surfaces work well with Hutson's rounded, sometimes clumsy shapes and radiant colors. But it's more than that. Hutson paid as much attention to light, reflections and space as any Impressionist. His best scenes have a sense of atmosphere and depth that invites us into enter into their beatific calm. Edward Thorp Gallery, 210 11th Avenue, at 25th Street, Chelsea , (212) 691-6565, edwardthorpgallery.com. (Smith)20100325
 KEN PRICE: 'SCULPTURE AND DRAWING'; closes on Saturday. Orchestrated with the Franklin Parrasch Gallery in Midtown, this revelatory show underscores Mr. Price's importance and originality with works from the 1960s and '70s. It includes a selection of ''egg'' and ''cup'' sculptures and drawings, as well as several pieces that reflect early attention to the erotic side of Duchamp and also make Mr. Price something of a precursor to Conceptual Art. These gems are spaciously arrayed in rooms painted Pricean colors of deep pink, lavender and yellow. Not to be missed. Nyehaus Gallery, 358 West 20th Street, Chelsea , (212) 366-4493, nyehaus.com. (Smith)20100325
 STERLING RUBY: '2 TRAPS'; closes on Saturday. A formidably talented artist -- known for garish ceramics, vandalized Minimalist plinths and spray-paint abstractions -- goes big and relatively bland for his two-piece debut at a big-top gallery. ''Bus,'' a former prison bus with sinister customizing, looks like something Mad Max might drive if he could find the gas; ''Pig Pen,'' a shipping-container-size assemblage of cages made of barred security doors, might imprison Max's competitors for said gas. The qualities that make Mr. Ruby's work compelling are present here, but in uncompelling ratios. Pace Wildenstein, 545 West 22nd Street, Chelsea , (212) 989-4258, pacewildenstein.com. (Smith)20100325
 SCULPTURE CENTER : 'LEOPARDS IN THE TEMPLE'; closes on Tuesday. Inspired by a Kafka short story, this exhibition says a lot about the state of contemporary art. It presents an international array of artists who riff on familiar conventions of modern art. Kitty Kraus's squared-off lengths of men's suit fabric lying flat on the floor evoke Carl Andre but with a feminist twist. Don't miss the funny, magical films by the team of Joao Maria Gusmao and Pedro Paiva in the basement. 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 23, 2010, Friday

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An art entry in the Listings pages last Friday about ''Rome After Raphael,'' at the Morgan Library & Museum, misspelled the given name of an artist whose work appears in the exhibition. He was Annibale Carracci, not Anibale. (The error has appeared in the Listings pages each Friday since Feb. 12 and was pointed out in an e-mail message from a reader on Wednesday.)

HEADLINE: The Return Of History

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Some brilliant scholar has to write a comprehensive history of modern economics because the evolution of this field is clearly one of the most consequential things happening in the world today.
 Act I in this history would be set in the era of economic scientism: the period when economists based their work on a crude vision of human nature (the perfectly rational, utility-maximizing autonomous individual) and then built elaborate models based on that creature.
 Act II would occur over the past few decades, as a few brave economists tried to move beyond this stick-figure view of humanity. Herbert Simon pointed out that people aren't perfectly rational. Gary Becker analyzed behaviors that don't seem to be the product of narrow self-interest, like having children and behaving altruistically. Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman pointed out that people seem to have common biases when they try to make objective decisions. 
 This part of the history would be the story of gradually growing sophistication and of splintering.
 Then the story would come to Act III, the economic crisis of 2008 and 2009. This act is a climax of sorts because it exposed the shortcomings of the whole field. Economists and financiers spent decades building ever more sophisticated models to anticipate market behavior, yet these models did not predict the financial crisis as it approached. In fact, cutting-edge financial models contributed to it by getting behavior so wrong -- helping to wipe out $50 trillion in global wealth and causing untold human suffering.
 This would bring the historian to Act IV, the period of soul-searching that we are living through now. More than a year after the event, there is no consensus on what caused the crisis. Economists are fundamentally re-evaluating their field.
 ''Where were the intellectual agenda-setters when this crisis was building?'' asked Barry Eichengreen of the University of California, Berkeley, in The National Interest. ''Why did they fail to see the train wreck coming?''
 In The Wall Street Journal, Russ Roberts of George Mason University wondered why economics is even considered a science. Real sciences make progress. But in economics, old thinkers cycle in and out of fashion. In real sciences, evidence solves problems. Roberts asked his colleagues if they could think of any econometric study so well done that it had definitively settled a dispute. Nobody could think of one.
 ''The bottom line is that we should expect less of economists,'' Roberts wrote.
 In a column called ''A Crisis of Understanding,'' Robert J. Shiller of Yale pointed out that the best explanation of the crisis isn't even a work of economic analysis. It's a history book -- ''This Time is Different'' by Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff -- that is almost entirely devoid of theory.
 One gets the sense, at least from the outside, that the intellectual energy is no longer with the economists who construct abstract and elaborate models. Instead, the field seems to be moving in a humanist direction. Many economists are now trying to absorb lessons learned by psychologists, neuroscientists and sociologists. They're producing books with titles like ''Animal Spirits,'' ''The Irrational Economist,'' and ''Identity Economics,'' about subjects such as how social identities shape economic choices.
 This amounts to rediscovering the humility of an earlier time. After all, Adam Smith was a moral philosopher, Friedrich von Hayek built his philosophy on an awareness of our own ignorance, and John Maynard Keynes ''was not prepared to sacrifice realism to mathematics,'' as the biographer Robert Skidelsky put it. Economics is a ''moral science,'' Keynes wrote. It deals with ''motives, expectations, psychological uncertainties. One has to be constantly on guard against treating the material as constant and homogenous.''
 In Act IV, in other words, economists are taking baby steps into the world of emotion, social relationships, imagination, love and virtue. In Act V, I predict, they will blow up their whole field.
 Economics achieved coherence as a science by amputating most of human nature. Now economists are starting with those parts of emotional life that they can count and model (the activities that make them economists). But once they're in this terrain, they'll surely find that the processes that make up the inner life are not amenable to the methodologies of social science. The moral and social yearnings of fully realized human beings are not reducible to universal laws and cannot be studied like physics.
 Once this is accepted, economics would again become a subsection of history and moral philosophy. It will be a powerful language for analyzing certain sorts of activity. Economists will be able to describe how some people acted in some specific contexts. They will be able to draw out some suggestive lessons to keep in mind while thinking about other people and other contexts -- just as historians, psychologists and novelists do.
 At the end of Act V, economics will be realistic, but it will be an art, not a science.

HEADLINE: Downstate Republican Faces Rough Road in Race for Governor

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
As Bill Brady made his way through a crowded ballroom at the Hilton on Michigan Avenue the other evening, heads did not turn to glimpse a political big shot. The Republican nominee for governor of Illinois, at least for now, is an unfamiliar face in the city. 
 Mr. Brady, a state senator from Bloomington who won the primary without running a single advertisement in the Chicago market, thrust out his hand and introduced himself to anyone who cared to chat at the dinner for construction executives.
 One of the bystanders, Bob Fiascone, could muster only a shrug about the candidate. 
 ''Hey, I only just now met the guy,'' Mr. Fiascone said. 
 The reaction underscores the challenge for Mr. Brady, 48, who is running to unseat Gov. Patrick J. Quinn, a Democrat. He needs to bond quickly with voters in Chicago and its suburbs, a region that will cast perhaps 60 percent of the vote in the general election. That will take plenty of cash to buy airtime and direct-mail ads. 
 While Mr. Quinn's campaign is comparatively flush, Mr. Brady, a real estate developer, said his campaign ended the primary about $350,000 in the hole. He said the campaign was now almost at the break-even point, but that was due to a $250,000 loan from the candidate himself. 
 Besides trying to raise money, Mr. Brady -- a social conservative who opposes abortion and civil unions for same-sex couples -- faces the task of winning the affection of metropolitan Republicans and swing voters who have tended to prefer moderates in statewide Illinois races. 
 ''In any other year,'' said Don Rose, who has worked as a consultant for Democratic and Republican candidates, ''it would be an absolute impossibility for a candidate like Brady.'' 
 But with the wrenching unemployment rate, an angry electorate and the coming corruption trial of Rod R. Blagojevich, the former Democratic governor, this is no ordinary year. 
 The best strategy for Mr. Brady, some Republican insiders say, is to introduce himself to voters in Chicago and the suburbs, decry the sorry state of the economy -- and talk as little as possible about his conservative social stands. He opposes abortion even in cases of rape and incest -- but not if the pregnant woman's life is endangered. He believes Illinois should legalize the carrying of concealed firearms. 
 Ronald Gidwitz, the heavyweight Republican bankroller, said moderate voters in the Chicago region would look past Mr. Brady's positions if he could chart a plan toward fiscal and economic recovery. 
 ''The bread-and-butter issues, creating jobs and opposing taxes,'' will trump social issues during a deep recession, Mr. Gidwitz said. 
 Mr. Brady promises to stimulate job growth by fostering a business-friendly environment with cuts in taxes and regulations. He vows to end the state's sordid tradition of ''pay-to-play politics'' by pushing for caps on campaign contributions and term limits for elected officials.
 For his part, Mr. Gidwitz, the former head of the Helene Curtis cosmetics company, said he planned to contribute money to Mr. Brady's campaign, although he had not done so yet. 
 In the view of Jim Edgar, the former Republican governor who appealed to moderates in the Chicago area, Mr. Brady has a steep hill to climb. ''It's a huge challenge for Brady,'' said Mr. Edgar, who endorsed State Senator Kirk W. Dillard, a Hinsdale moderate, during the primary. ''The people in Chicago and the suburbs don't know him at all.'' 
 Mr. Edgar suggested that Mr. Brady's best chance rested in potential missteps by the governor. ''People aren't going to vote for Brady as much as they'll vote against Quinn,'' he said. ''It's going to be a matter of whether people think Quinn's up to the job. It's Quinn's to win or lose.'' 
 Still, he said, the state's demographics are stacked against Mr. Brady. Making gains in the suburbs, the crucial battleground in any statewide race, ''generally requires time and TV -- marching in Fourth of July parades and buying airtime.'' 
 Mr. Brady said he was working hard to become more familiar to voters in the Chicago area. He has taken an apartment in the Streeterville neighborhood, and he vowed to spend at least two-thirds of the campaign in the city and its suburbs. 
 In a recent interview at the Hispanic American Construction Industry Association dinner here, Mr. Brady volunteered that his daughter, a nurse, lived in the city, as did his older son, a second-year student at DePaul University Law School. His younger son attends Bloomington Central Catholic High School. 
 During the primary, Mr. Brady portrayed himself as a champion of Downstaters, placing blame for corruption on the ''clique of Chicago Democratic lawyers'' who ''continue to run Illinois.'' But he now offers praise for at least one of the city's Democratic lawyers, Mayor Richard M. Daley. 
 ''The mayor and I both agree on the need for Chicago and Illinois to become more competitive for businesses,'' Mr. Brady said, citing their agreement that ''big box'' stores like Wal-Mart should be welcomed to Chicago, despite opposition from unions. 
 Mr. Brady, who won the five-way Republican primary with just one in five votes -- the vast majority of them from south of Interstate 80 -- said he had focused on Downstate regions during the primary for a strategic reason: He could not afford airtime in the Chicago market. 
 Now trying to court metropolitan voters, Mr. Brady said the Republican Party had ''done a terrible job of reaching out to Latino and black voters,'' and insisted that his message would resonate in the Chicago region. 
 While many political analysts say Mr. Brady will need to moderate his views to win the state, Tom Roeser, the prominent Chicago conservative commentator, said it would be a mistake for him to ''water down'' his principles.
 ''Ronald Reagan didn't back down,'' Mr. Roeser said, ''and he carried Illinois.'' 
 But voting patterns have been changing in Illinois in the last generation, and the state has turned a solid blue. In Chicago, voters have been trouncing Republican candidates. Suburban counties that were once dependably Republican have trended more Democratic. . 
 Republican leaders, however, are counting on anger over joblessness and disgust with corruption in Springfield to lead voters to punish Democrats. 
 Jack Schaefer, a former longtime state senator from McHenry County, said he was organizing a fund-raiser for Mr. Brady in the northwest suburbs and noted that potential donors in his region were anxious to clean house in Springfield.
 ''These are business types who aren't necessarily 100 percent Republican,'' Mr. Schaefer said. ''But the shape we're in, they agree that we've got to do something differently.'' 
 To cultivate moderate suburban voters, Mr. Brady is expected to lean heavily on his former rival Mr. Dillard, whom he defeated by fewer than 200 votes. Mr. Dillard was the candidate most feared by Democrats for his appeal to moderate suburbanites. 
 Mr. Dillard said voters in the Chicago region would grow comfortable with Mr. Brady and his wife, Nancy. He said the candidate, photogenic and charming, exuded a suburban cul-de-sac credibility that voters in places like DuPage County would find appealing -- no matter that Mr. Brady has roots in Bloomington that go back generations. 
 ''When you meet Nancy and Bill Brady, you could easily think they live in Naperville,'' Mr. Dillard said. ''It's an easy sell.''

HEADLINE: Latest Legal-Marijuana Push Is All About the Tax Revenue

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Perhaps only in California could a group of marijuana smokers call themselves fiscal realists. 
 And yet, faced with a $20 billion deficit, strained state services and regular legislative paralysis, voters in California are now set to consider a single-word solution to help ease some of the state's money troubles: legalize.
 On Wednesday, the California secretary of state certified a November vote on a ballot measure that would legalize, tax and regulate marijuana, a plan that advocates say could raise $1.4 billion and save precious law enforcement and prison resources. 
 Indeed, unlike previous efforts at legalization -- including a failed 1972 measure in California -- the 2010 campaign will not dwell on assertions of marijuana's harmlessness or its social acceptance, but rather on cold cash. 
 ''We need the tax money,'' said Richard Lee, founder of Oaksterdam University, a trade school for marijuana growers, in Oakland, who backed the ballot measure's successful petition drive. ''Second, we need the tax savings on police and law enforcement, and have that law enforcement directed towards real crime.''
 Supporters are hoping to raise $10 million to $20 million for the campaign, primarily on the Internet, with national groups planning to urge marijuana fans to contribute $4.20 at a time, a nod to 420, a popular shorthand for the drug. 
 The law would permit licensed retailers to sell up to one ounce at a time. Those sales would be a new source of sales tax revenue for the state.
 Opponents, however, scoff at the notion that legalizing marijuana could somehow help with the state's woes. They tick off a list of social ills -- including tardiness and absenteeism in the workplace -- that such an act would contribute to.
 ''We just don't think any good is going to come from this,'' said John Standish, president of the California Peace Officers Association, whose 3,800 members include police chiefs and sheriffs. ''It's not going to better society. It's going to denigrate it.''
 The question of legalization, which a 2009 Field Poll showed 56 percent of Californians supporting, will undoubtedly color the state race for governor. The two major Republican candidates -- the former eBay chief executive Meg Whitman and the insurance commissioner, Steve Poizner -- have said they oppose the bill. 
 Jerry Brown, the Democratic attorney general who is also running for governor, opposes the idea as well, saying it violates federal law. 
 And while the Obama administration has signaled that it will tolerate medical marijuana users who abide the law in the 14 states where it is legal, a law authorizing personal use would conflict with federal law. 
 Supporters of the bill say the proposal's language would allow cities or local governments to opt out, likely creating ''dry counties'' in some parts of the state. The proposed law would allow only those over 21 to buy, and would ban smoking marijuana in public or around minors. 
 Stephen Gutwillig, the California state director for the Drug Policy Alliance, a New York-based group that plans to raise money in favor of the measure, said he expected ''a conservative implementation,'' if passed.
 ''I think most local jurisdictions are not going to authorize sales,'' Mr. Gutwillig said.
 Local opt-out provisions are part of a strategy to allay people's fears about adding another legal vice and to help capture a group considered key to passing the bill: non-pot-smoking swing voters. 
 ''There's going to be a large sector of the electorate that would never do this themselves that's going to sort out what the harm would be versus what the supposed good would be,'' said Frank Schubert, a longtime California political strategist who opposes the bill. ''That's where the election is going to be won.''
 But Dan Newman, a San Francisco-based strategist for the ballot measure, said he expected broad, bipartisan support for the bill, especially among those Californians worried about the recession. 
 ''Voters' No. 1 concern right now is the budget and the economy,'' Mr. Newman said, ''which makes them look particularly favorable at something that will bring in more than $1 billion a year.'' Opponents, however, question that figure -- which is based on a 2009 report from the Board of Equalization, which oversees taxes in the state -- and argue that whatever income is brought in will be spent dealing with more marijuana-related crimes. 
 Mr. Standish said: ''We have a hard enough time now with drunk drivers on the road. This is just going to add to the problems.'' 
 He added: ''I cannot think of one crime scene I've been to where people said, 'Thank God the person was just under the influence of marijuana.' '' 
 Advocates of the measure plan to counter what is expected to be a strong law enforcement opposition with advertisements like one scheduled to be broadcast on radio in San Francisco and Los Angeles starting on Monday. The advertisements will feature a former deputy sheriff saying the war on marijuana has failed.
 ''It's time to control it,'' he concludes, ''and tax it.'' 
 Not everyone in the community is supportive. Don Duncan, a co-founder of Americans for Safe Access, which lobbies for medical marijuana, said he had reservations about the prospect of casual users joining the ranks of those with prescriptions. 
 ''The taxation and regulation of cannabis at the local or state level may or may not improve conditions for medical cannabis patients,'' Mr. Duncan said in an e-mail message. He added that issues like ''police harassment and the price and quality of medicine might arise if legalization for recreational users occurs.'' 
 Still, the idea of legal marijuana does not seem too far-fetched to people like Shelley Kutilek, a San Francisco resident, loyal church employee and registered California voter, who said she would vote ''yes'' in November.
 ''It's no worse than alcohol,'' said Ms. Kutilek, 30, an administrator at Metropolitan Community Church of San Francisco. ''Drunk people get really belligerent. I don't know anybody who gets belligerent on marijuana. They just get chill.''

HEADLINE: More Doctors Giving Up Private Clinics

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A quiet revolution is transforming how medical care is delivered in this country, and it has very little to do with the sweeping health care legislation that President Obama just signed into law.
 But it could have a big impact on that law's chances for success. 
 Traditionally, American medicine has been largely a cottage industry. Most doctors cared for patients in small, privately owned clinics -- sometimes in rooms adjoining their homes. 
 But an increasing share of young physicians, burdened by medical school debts and seeking regular hours, are deciding against opening private practices. Instead, they are accepting salaries at hospitals and health systems. And a growing number of older doctors -- facing rising costs and fearing they will not be able to recruit junior partners -- are selling their practices and moving into salaried jobs, too. 
 As recently as 2005, more than two-thirds of medical practices were physician-owned -- a share that had been relatively constant for many years, the Medical Group Management Association says. But within three years, that share dropped below 50 percent, and analysts say the slide has continued. 
 For patients, the transformation in medicine is a mixed blessing. Ideally, bigger health care organizations can provide better, more coordinated care. But the intimacy of longstanding doctor-patient relationships may be going the way of the house call.
 And for all the vaunted efficiencies of health care organizations, there are signs that the trend toward them is actually a big factor in the rising cost of private health insurance. In much of the country, health systems are known by another name: monopolies. 
 With these systems, private insurers often have little negotiating power in setting rates -- and the Congressional health care legislation makes little provision for altering this dynamic. If anything, the legislation contains provisions -- including efforts to combine payments for certain kinds of medical care -- that may further speed the decline of the private-practice doctor and the growth of Big Medicine.
 The trend away from small private practices is driven by growing concerns over medical errors and changes in government payments to doctors. But an even bigger push may be coming from electronic health records. The computerized systems are expensive and time-consuming for doctors, and their substantial benefits to patient safety, quality of care and system efficiency accrue almost entirely to large organizations, not small ones. The economic stimulus plan Congress passed early last year included $20 billion to spur the introduction of electronic health records. 
 For older doctors, the change away from private practice can be wrenching, and they are often puzzled by younger doctors' embrace of salaried positions.
 ''When I was young, you didn't blink an eye at being on call all the time, going to the hospital, being up all night,'' said Dr. Gordon Hughes, chairman of the board of trustees for the Indiana State Medical Association. ''But the young people coming out of training now don't want to do much call and don't want the risk of buying into a practice, but they still want a good lifestyle and a big salary. You can't have it both ways.''
 In many ways, patients benefit from higher quality and better coordinated care, as doctors from various fields join a single organization. In such systems, patient records can pass seamlessly from doctor to specialist to hospital, helping avoid the kind of dangerous slip-ups that cost the lives of an estimated 100,000 people in this country each year. 
 And yet, the decline of private practices may put an end to the kind of enduring and intimate relationships between patients and doctors that have long defined medicine. A patient who chooses a doctor in private practice is more likely to see that same doctor during each office visit than a patient who chooses a doctor employed by a health system. 
 The changes have increasingly put the public and private provision of health care at odds. In the Medicare and Medicaid program, the government sets most prices related to hospitalization and doctor visits. And so organized health systems are seen as a way to increase quality and lower costs, in part because salaried doctors may order fewer procedures than those in private practice. 
 But in the private-insurance setting, where big hospitals and health care chains have more clout in setting rates, the push for quality may put health insurance out of reach for much of the middle class.
 There are political consequences, too. As doctors move from being employers to employees, their politics often take a leftward turn. This helps explain why the American Medical Association -- long opposed to health care reforms -- gave at least a tepid endorsement to Mr. Obama's overhaul effort. 
 Gordon H. Smith, executive vice president of the Maine Medical Association, said that his organization had changed from being like a chamber of commerce to being like a union.
 Dr. Michael Mirro of Fort Wayne, Ind., is among those caught in the tide. A 61-year-old cardiologist, he began his career like so many of his peers in a small private practice with two other cardiologists. They gradually added doctors until, by last year, they had 22 cardiologists, making theirs one of the largest private heart clinics in Indiana. 
 But in December, Dr. Mirro and his partners sold everything to Parkview Health, a growing health system that owns the hospital across the street from their building. ''We had to hire more and more people to contact insurers and advocate for people to get the care they needed,'' Dr. Mirro said. ''That's expensive.'' As insurance rates rose and coverage weakened, patients were forced to pay out of their own pockets an increasing portion of Dr. Mirro's bills. When the economy soured, many stopped trying.
 ''In the last year, the share of our patients from whom we could not hope to collect any money rose to about 30 percent,'' Dr. Mirro said. Dr. Mirro and his partners had been thinking of selling for years. But they made the decision after the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services decided last year to cut reimbursements to cardiologists by 27 to 40 percent, depending on the type of practice. The Medicare savings in cardiology are to be used to pay more to primary care doctors, widely seen as under great financial strain.
 In the wake of the government decision, cardiology practices across the country began selling out to health systems or hospitals. Dr. Jack Lewin, chief executive of the American College of Cardiology, estimated that the share of cardiologists working in private practice had dropped by half in the past year. 
 ''And the remainder of those left are looking to move in that direction,'' Dr. Lewin said. ''This is all happening with or without reform passing.''
 The process feeds on itself because doctors who remain in private practice worry that as their peers sell out, their own options become more limited and the prices for their own practices fall. 
 Although Dr. Mirro saw his decision as life-changing, many of his patients noticed little difference. Parkview let the doctors remain in their building and allowed them to continue to hire their own staff. 
 Mimi Strong, an 89-year-old heart failure patient, said everything was the same when she visited recently. Told in an interview that her care may now be more coordinated, Mrs. Strong expressed little interest. 
 But it matters to Dr. Mirro. ''We wouldn't go back,'' he said, ''now that we've seen the value of improved patient care and improved communication with primary care physicians.'' 
 Michael Packnett, the president of Parkview and Dr. Mirro's new boss, said that his organization was growing rapidly, while the number of independent hospital and doctor practices in northeast Indiana shrank. A key reason, Mr. Packnett said, is that many doctors have decided that the challenges of running their own businesses are simply too great. 
 ''Now they get to refocus on practicing medicine,'' Mr. Packnett said.

HEADLINE: Going To Extreme

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
I admit it: I had fun watching right-wingers go wild as health reform finally became law. But a few days later, it doesn't seem quite as entertaining -- and not just because of the wave of vandalism and threats aimed at Democratic lawmakers. For if you care about America's future, you can't be happy as extremists take full control of one of our two great political parties.
 To be sure, it was enjoyable watching Representative Devin Nunes, a Republican of California, warn that by passing health reform, Democrats ''will finally lay the cornerstone of their socialist utopia on the backs of the American people.'' Gosh, that sounds uncomfortable. And it's been a hoot watching Mitt Romney squirm as he tries to distance himself from a plan that, as he knows full well, is nearly identical to the reform he himself pushed through as governor of Massachusetts. His best shot was declaring that enacting reform was an ''unconscionable abuse of power,'' a ''historic usurpation of the legislative process'' -- presumably because the legislative process isn't supposed to include things like ''votes'' in which the majority prevails. 
 A side observation: one Republican talking point has been that Democrats had no right to pass a bill facing overwhelming public disapproval. As it happens, the Constitution says nothing about opinion polls trumping the right and duty of elected officials to make decisions based on what they perceive as the merits. But in any case, the message from the polls is much more ambiguous than opponents of reform claim: While many Americans disapprove of Obamacare, a significant number do so because they feel that it doesn't go far enough. And a Gallup poll taken after health reform's enactment showed the public, by a modest but significant margin, seeming pleased that it passed.
 But back to the main theme. What has been really striking has been the eliminationist rhetoric of the G.O.P., coming not from some radical fringe but from the party's leaders. John Boehner, the House minority leader, declared that the passage of health reform was ''Armageddon.'' The Republican National Committee put out a fund-raising appeal that included a picture of Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, surrounded by flames, while the committee's chairman declared that it was time to put Ms. Pelosi on ''the firing line.'' And Sarah Palin put out a map literally putting Democratic lawmakers in the cross hairs of a rifle sight.
 All of this goes far beyond politics as usual. Democrats had a lot of harsh things to say about former President George W. Bush -- but you'll search in vain for anything comparably menacing, anything that even hinted at an appeal to violence, from members of Congress, let alone senior party officials. 
 No, to find anything like what we're seeing now you have to go back to the last time a Democrat was president. Like President Obama, Bill Clinton faced a G.O.P. that denied his legitimacy -- Dick Armey, the second-ranking House Republican (and now a Tea Party leader) referred to him as ''your president.'' Threats were common: President Clinton, declared Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, ''better watch out if he comes down here. He'd better have a bodyguard.'' (Helms later expressed regrets over the remark -- but only after a media firestorm.) And once they controlled Congress, Republicans tried to govern as if they held the White House, too, eventually shutting down the federal government in an attempt to bully Mr. Clinton into submission.
 Mr. Obama seems to have sincerely believed that he would face a different reception. And he made a real try at bipartisanship, nearly losing his chance at health reform by frittering away months in a vain attempt to get a few Republicans on board. At this point, however, it's clear that any Democratic president will face total opposition from a Republican Party that is completely dominated by right-wing extremists.
 For today's G.O.P. is, fully and finally, the party of Ronald Reagan -- not Reagan the pragmatic politician, who could and did strike deals with Democrats, but Reagan the antigovernment fanatic, who warned that Medicare would destroy American freedom. It's a party that sees modest efforts to improve Americans' economic and health security not merely as unwise, but as monstrous. It's a party in which paranoid fantasies about the other side -- Obama is a socialist, Democrats have totalitarian ambitions -- are mainstream. And, as a result, it's a party that fundamentally doesn't accept anyone else's right to govern. 
 In the short run, Republican extremism may be good for Democrats, to the extent that it prompts a voter backlash. But in the long run, it's a very bad thing for America. We need to have two reasonable, rational parties in this country. And right now we don't.

HEADLINE: Fix Health Reform, Then Repeal It

BYLINE: By PAUL RYAN. 
Paul Ryan, a Republican, is a representative from Wisconsin.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 ON Thursday night, Congress sent to President Obama the reconciliation package to remove some of the embarrassing provisions in his signature legislative achievement, health care reform. But a serious fix for what ails health care in America will entail far more than merely tweaking the new law of the land; we will need to repeal the entire faulty architecture of the government behemoth and replace it with real reform. 
 To be clear: it is not sufficient for those of us in the opposition to await a reversal of political fortune months or years from now before we advance action on health care reform. Costs will continue their ascent as the debt burden squeezes life out of our economy. We are unapologetic advocates for the repeal of this costly misstep. But Republicans must also make the case for a reform agenda to take its place, and get to work on that effort now. 
 So what can we do?
 Health care experts across the political spectrum acknowledge that a fundamental driver of health inflation is the regressive tax preference for employer-based health insurance. This discriminatory tax treatment lavishes the greatest benefit on the most expensive plans while providing no support for the unemployed, the self-employed or those who don't get coverage from their employer. 
 Reform-minded leaders like Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, and Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, pushed legislative proposals that would directly address this issue. I helped write a plan that would replace the bias in the tax code with universal tax credits so that all Americans have the resources to purchase portable, affordable coverage that best suits their needs, with additional support provided for those with lower incomes. All these ideas, though, were dismissed early on, as they didn't fit with the government-driven plan favored by the majority. But going forward it's important that we reconsider this regressive tax issue. 
 Then, when helping Americans with pre-existing conditions obtain coverage, we should focus on innovative state-based solutions, including robust high-risk pools, reinsurance markets and risk-adjustment mechanisms. I intend to continue advancing true patient-centered reforms like attaching tax benefits to the individual rather than the job, breaking down barriers to interstate competition, and promoting transparency and consumer-friendly coverage options. 
 We should ensure that health care decisions are made by patients and their doctors, not by bureaucrats, whether at an insurance company or a government agency. By inviting market forces into health care, we can encourage a system where doctors, insurers and hospitals compete against one another for the business of informed consumers.
 We must also immediately begin dealing with our crushing debt burdens, which this legislation will worsen. The Democrats' fiscal arguments never did add up: they claim that their program will reduce the deficit even though the federal government will pick up the tab for more than 30 million uninsured Americans and subsidize millions more. Even after accounting for the $569 billion in tax increases and $523 billion in Medicare cuts, the true costs of this legislation -- concealed by timing gimmicks, hidden spending and double-counting -- will make the deficit explode, plunging us deeper into debt.
 Washington already has no idea on how to pay for its current entitlement programs, as we find ourselves $76 trillion in the hole. Our country cannot afford to avoid a serious conversation on entitlement reform. By taking action now, we can make certain that our entitlement programs are kept whole for those in and near retirement, while devising sustainable health and retirement security for future generations.
 The case for attempting health care reform was not difficult to make. Skyrocketing health care costs are driving more and more families and businesses to the brink of bankruptcy, leaving affordable coverage out of reach for millions of Americans and accelerating our path to fiscal ruin. The challenge was how to deal with the seemingly inexorable increase in health care costs. 
 Yet the Congressional majority went at this goal backward: with the force of the federal government, cover all Americans -- then figure out which screws to twist to contain costs. Democrats opted for this approach because their concern was never about costs. It was about expanding coverage through an expansion of government.
 As the dust settles from this historic and fiscally calamitous week, we have to try to steer this country back in the right direction. The opposition must always speak with vigor and candor on the need for wholesale repeal and for real reform to fix what's broken in health care.

HEADLINE: A BIG EXPANSION IS PLANNED IN AID TO HOMEOWNERS

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD; Sewell Chan and Louise Story contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Obama administration on Friday will announce broad new initiatives to help troubled homeowners, potentially refinancing several million of them into fresh government-backed mortgages with lower payments.
 Another element of the new program is meant to temporarily reduce the payments of borrowers who are unemployed and seeking a job. Additionally, the government will encourage lenders to write down the value of loans held by borrowers in modification programs.
 The escalation in aid comes as the administration is under rising pressure from Congress to resolve the foreclosure crisis, which is straining the economy and putting millions of Americans at risk of losing their homes. But the new initiatives could well spur protests among those who have kept up their payments and are not in trouble. 
 The administration's earlier efforts to stem foreclosures have largely been directed at borrowers who were experiencing financial hardship. But the biggest new initiative, which is also likely to be the most controversial, will involve the government, through the Federal Housing Administration, refinancing loans for borrowers who simply owe more than their houses are worth.
 About 11 million households, or a fifth of those with mortgages, are in this position, known as being underwater. Some of these borrowers refinanced their houses during the boom and took cash out, leaving them vulnerable when prices declined. Others simply had the misfortune to buy at the peak.
 Many of these loans have been bundled together and sold to investors. Under the new program, the investors would have to swallow losses, but would probably be assured of getting more in the long run than if the borrowers went into foreclosure. The F.H.A. would insure the new loans against the risk of default. The borrower would once again have a reason to make payments instead of walking away from a property.
 Many details of the administration's plan remained unclear Thursday night, including the precise scope of the new program and the number of homeowners who might be likely to qualify. 
 One administration official cautioned that the investors might not be willing to volunteer any loans from borrowers that seemed solvent. That could set up a battle between borrowers and investors. 
 This much was clear, however: the plan, if successful, could put taxpayers at increased risk. If many additional borrowers move into F.H.A. loans, a renewed downturn in the housing market could send that government agency into the red.
 The F.H.A. has already expanded its mortgage-guarantee program substantially in the last three years as the housing crisis deepened. It now insures more than six million borrowers, many of whom made minimal down payments and are now underwater.
 Sources said the agency would use $14 billion in funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, some of which it could dangle in front of financial institutions as incentives to participate.
 Another major element of the program, according to several people who described it, will be to encourage lenders to write down the value of loans for borrowers in modification programs. Until now, the government's modification efforts have focused on lowering interest rates.
 Lenders began offering principal forgiveness last year on loans they held in their own portfolios. In the fourth quarter, however, this process abruptly reversed itself, for reasons that are unclear. The number of modifications that included principal reduction fell by half.
 Bank of America, the country's biggest bank, announced this week that it would forgive principal balances over a period of years on an initial 45,000 troubled loans. 
 Another element of the White House's housing program will require lenders to offer unemployed borrowers a reduction in their payments for a minimum of three months.
 An administration official declined to speak on the record about the new programs but said they would ''better assist responsible homeowners who have been affected by the economic crisis through no fault of their own.''
 The new initiatives would expand the government's current mortgage modification plan, announced a year ago with great fanfare. It has resulted in fewer than 200,000 people getting permanent new loans. As many as seven million borrowers are seriously delinquent on their loans and at risk of foreclosure. 
 While fewer people are beginning default, the number of borrowers who are seriously distressed is rising. In the fourth quarter, the number of households at least 90 days past due on their mortgages swelled by 270,000, according to a report issued Thursday by the comptroller of the currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision.
 ''The government is seeking to persuade people to stay in their homes by aligning the mortgage debt with the asset value, which is the only viable path to real housing stability,'' said one person who was briefed on the government's plans.
 The number of foreclosures in the fourth quarter rose 9 percent, to 128,859. An additional 38,000 owners disposed of their homes in short sales, where the lender agreed to accept less than it was owed.
 A person briefed on the new plan said the number of underwater borrowers who qualified for the plan could be in the millions. The government is not planning to solicit loans for the program, stressing that it is voluntary.
 The administration recognizes that some people's finances have deteriorated so far that they are beyond help, the person said. People in that situation simply cannot afford the houses they are living in, the person said, even if the mortgages were reduced.
 ''All these programs are geared toward people for whom it makes sense, for whom it's workable when all is said and done,'' the person said. ''Some people are too far gone.''

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Hints at Sale Of Mortgage Securities

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, hinted on Thursday that the central bank might be open to selling part of its huge portfolio of mortgage-backed securities when the time came to start tightening credit.
 In testimony Thursday before the House Financial Services Committee, Mr. Bernanke did not depart from the Fed's stance that it intended to keep short-term interest rates near zero for ''an extended period,'' given that unemployment remained high and inflation was expected to remain low. 
 But he offered a glimpse into his thinking about the timing and pace of the Fed's eventual withdrawal from its monetary policies of the last two years.
 The Fed's balance sheet has grown to about $2.3 trillion, about 2.5 times its size before the crisis. The central bank bought up mortgage-backed securities, Treasury securities and debts guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in an effort to hold down long-term interest rates as the economy went into a tailspin in 2008.
 In addition, the Fed created several emergency lending programs to pump credit into the economy.
 While the lending programs have mostly ended, the giant balance sheet, which includes a large volume of bank reserves that the Fed created as it bought the assets, poses a difficult challenge for Mr. Bernanke.
 Mr. Bernanke was originally to testify before the Financial Services Committee about the Fed's exit strategy on Feb. 10, but the hearing was postponed because of a snowstorm. 
 ''I currently do not anticipate that the Federal Reserve will sell any of its security holdings in the near term, at least until after policy tightening has gotten under way and the economy is clearly in a sustainable recovery,'' Mr. Bernanke wrote in that testimony, which was released after the hearing was postponed.
 On Thursday, Mr. Bernanke omitted reference to ''the near term.'' He said, ''Restoring the size and composition of the balance sheet to a more normal configuration is a longer-term objective of our policies.'' 
 The Fed plans to experiment with two tools, reverse repurchase agreements and term deposits, to drain the large store of bank reserves and replace them with other liabilities. Those tools would not change the overall size of the balance sheet.
 ''If necessary, as a means of applying monetary restraint, the Federal Reserve also has the option of redeeming or selling securities,'' Mr. Bernanke said. 
 He was careful to avoid specifying a time frame, but he told Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican, ''We would like to get back to an all-Treasury portfolio within a reasonable amount of time.'' Traditionally, the Fed bought and sold Treasury securities to lower and raise the key interest rate it controls, the federal funds rate. 
 Later, in response to a question from Representative Stephen F. Lynch, Democrat of Massachusetts, Mr. Bernanke said, ''My expectation is that sales would be slow, gradual, announced in advance and would not create undue market impacts.'' 
 Even if the Fed were to do nothing, the balance sheet would slowly shrink as the securities mature or as Fannie or Freddie redeem their debts. But Mr. Bernanke said the Fed had no intention of holding onto the securities -- some of them backed by 30-year fixed-rate mortgages -- indefinitely. ''We certainly don't want to hold this stuff for 30 years,'' he told Representative Scott Garrett, Republican of New Jersey. 
 The Fed's exit strategy is untested, and several economists who testified after Mr. Bernanke warned of potential risks.
 Marvin Goodfriend, of the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University, warned that reverse repurchase agreements, in which the Fed would sell securities with an agreement to buy them back later a slightly higher price, could expose the Fed to private sector risks. He said that term deposits, analogous to certificates of deposit, would also compete with Treasury bills and ''potentially cause friction with the Treasury.''
 John B. Taylor, an influential Stanford economist, said the Fed might want to follow an ''exit rule,'' reducing reserve balances by $100 billion for each 0.25 percent increase in the federal funds rate. 
 Other economists were more optimistic about the choices the Fed faced. Laurence M. Ball, of Johns Hopkins University, said the Fed should not raise rates ''until we see major progress in reducing unemployment,'' even if inflation starts to rise. A moderate rise in inflation, he said, could even be good for the economy.
 Laurence H. Meyer, an economic forecaster and former Fed governor, testified that the risk of high inflation was remote unless the central bank came under political pressure. 
 ''The Fed is operating in uncharted waters,'' he warned. ''It has never had such a challenging exit. Don't expect the Fed to be perfect. Nobody is perfect.''

HEADLINE: World Trade Is Expected to Rebound After a Bleak 2009

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
Led by economic growth in China and India, world trade is projected to expand by 9.5 percent this year after shrinking by 12.2 percent last year in the sharpest contraction since World War II, the World Trade Organization said on Friday.
 ''We see the light at the end of the tunnel, and trade promises to be an important part of the recovery,'' the organization's director-general, Pascal Lamy, said. ''But we must avoid derailing any economic revival through protectionism.'' 
 Export declines last year were even greater in the United States (13.9 percent), the European Union (14.8 percent) and Japan (24.9 percent) than in the rest of the world. Shipments from China fell 10.5 percent. 
 The W.T.O. confirmed that China overtook Germany as the world's top exporter of merchandise in 2009, accounting for almost 10 percent of global exports. China is second on the import side, with an 8 percent share of world imports compared to 13 percent for the United States. 
 The exports from developed countries are expected to rise by 7.5 percent this year, outpaced by an 11 percent increase projected for the rest of the world.
 The W.T.O., which is trying to catalyze political support for the long-stalled Doha round of global trade negotiations, said its members had avoided imposing trade barriers in response to the crisis, but expressed concern that persistent unemployment ''may intensify protectionist pressures.'' 
 President Obama has established a National Export Initiative with the goal of doubling American exports over five years, a goal that economists have described as a tall order.
 The United States is grappling with a severe trade imbalance with China. In Brussels on Friday, the United States trade representative, Ron Kirk, said that credit card companies like MasterCard, Visa, American Express, Discover Financial Services and the First Data Corporation had talked with his office about filing a complaint against China for blocking their access to its payment-processing market. 
 Also on Friday, Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the trade subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, urged the administration to review the effects of tariffs imposed last September on tire imports from China. The tariffs, a victory for the United Steelworkers, one of the nation's largest manufacturing unions, were intended as a response to the loss of American jobs in the tire industry. 
 The Treasury Department is to deliver its semiannual foreign exchange report to Congress on April 15, and lawmakers have pressed the administration to find China to be a currency manipulator. Many economists agree that China has held down the value of its currency, the renminbi, to support its export-oriented economy. But officials have expressed concern that a manipulation finding, which could lead to retaliatory steps by the United States, could worsen relations with China, the nation's second-largest trading partner.
 Last year's decline in trade was higher than the 10 percent drop the W.T.O. had projected last July, and was far larger than recent declines of 0.2 percent in 2001, 2 percent in 1982 and 7 percent in 1975. ''Exports and imports of all countries fell at the same time, leaving no region untouched,'' the W.T.O. said.
 As measured in dollars rather than volume, the drop was even greater, 23 percent, to $12.15 trillion, mostly because of falling prices in oil and other primary commodities. 
 But economists also say they believe that the measured decline in exports might have been inflated by the spread of global supply chains, in which goods cross national borders several times during the production process, getting counted as exports more than once, before arriving at their final destination.
 The decline in shipments was fueled by lower demand for consumer durables like automobiles and investment goods like industrial machinery, the W.T.O. said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Revises 4th-Quarter Growth Slightly Lower

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Economic growth in the last quarter of 2009 was slightly less robust than previously thought, the government said on Friday. But corporate profit in the quarter rose significantly, providing hope that businesses might begin hiring again. 
 Gross domestic product, the total value of goods and services in the economy, expanded at an annual rate of 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said. Growth was previously forecast at 5.9 percent from October through December. 
 Even with the revision, it was the fastest quarterly growth rate in more than six years. But economists expect the pace will slow again, given chronic unemployment and struggling real estate markets.
 ''This doesn't take much away from the strong pace in the fourth quarter,'' said Julia Coronado, senior United States economist at BNP Paribas. 
 ''Looking at the underlying numbers, it tells us the recovery is on track, but it's going to be slow.''
 After-tax corporate profit, considered a harbinger of business spending, rose 6.5 percent in the quarter, according to the government report, signaling that businesses might soon begin hiring in greater numbers.
 Spending by businesses in the quarter was lower than expected, rising 5.3 percent rather than the 6.5 percent originally forecast. Much of the difference was attributed to the worsening commercial real estate sector, with spending falling 18 percent rather than the original 13.9 percent estimate. The sector is grappling with high vacancy rates, excess supply and little interest by investors in financing large projects.
 After cutting costs significantly in the last year, businesses have begun to tentatively expand. The report issued Friday recorded higher-than-expected spending on equipment and software, which rose 19 percent in the quarter.
 Consumer spending was weaker than originally estimated. Americans, facing mounds of debt and dreary job prospects, have been reluctant to spend freely. Spending rose 1.6 percent in the quarter, compared with the 1.7 percent originally forecast.
 A barometer of consumer sentiment released Friday by the University of Michigan held steady in March; analysts had expected it to decline. Views on the current health of the economy brightened, but consumers were slightly more pessimistic about the outlook. 
 The roaring growth rate in the fourth quarter was largely the result of a slowdown in how quickly businesses slashed stockpiles. Inventories remained well stocked in the fourth quarter, contributing more than 3 percent to gross domestic product.
 Economists do not expect the restocking of inventories to contribute as much to future growth. Forecasts call for the economy to grow at an annual rate of 2 to 3 percent in the first quarter of 2010 -- far short of the levels needed to significantly reduce the jobless rate, which stands at 9.7 percent. 
 The government's first estimate of first-quarter growth will be released at the end of April.

HEADLINE: Some States Find Burdens In Health Law

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

 BODY:
Because of the new health care law, Arizona lawmakers must now find a way to maintain insurance coverage for 350,000 children and adults that they slashed just last week to help close a $2.6 billion budget deficit.
 Louisiana officials say a reduction in federal money to hospitals that treat the uninsured under the bill could be a death knell for their state-run charity hospital system.
 In California, policymakers estimate they will have to come up with an additional $500 million a year to make necessary increases in payments to Medicaid providers. 
 Across the country, state officials are wading through the minutiae of the health care overhaul to understand just how their governments will be affected. Even with much still to be digested, it is clear the law may be as much of a burden to some state budgets as it is a boon to uninsured consumers. 
 States with the largest uninsured populations, like Texas and California, might be considered by its backers the biggest winners to emerge from the law, because so many additional residents will have access to health insurance. But because those states are being required to significantly expand their Medicaid programs, they are precisely the ones that will face the biggest financial strains, in many cases magnified by existing budget shortfalls. 
 ''The federal government has to account for states' inability to sustain our current programs, much less expand,'' said Kim Belshe, secretary of California's Health and Human Services Agency.
 In contrast, states like Massachusetts and Wisconsin, which already have extensive health care safety nets, do not expect to spend much more money, while still taking in billions in federal grants.
 In Massachusetts, for example, which already has a form of universal coverage, the federal government will wind up taking over from the state a significantly larger share of the costs of Medicaid coverage for adults without children, officials said.
 ''On balance, it's definitely a gain,'' said JudyAnn Bigby, secretary of the Massachusetts Office of Health and Human Services. 
 Supporters of the new law have argued that states will benefit from efforts to slow health care inflation and billions of dollars in new federal spending on subsidies for the uninsured and on an array of programs like community health centers.
 But even with more federal help, the challenge for states like Alabama, Arkansas and Texas that now offer only limited Medicaid coverage will be substantial. In these states, Medicaid has been mostly restricted to low-income families with children, pregnant women, certain people with disabilities and some elderly. The income cutoffs have also been extremely low.
 Beginning in 2014, however, anyone with an income of up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, or $29,300 for families of four, will be eligible for coverage under Medicaid. For the first three years, the federal government will pick up the entire cost of these new enrollees, but the state share then gradually increases until it reaches 10 percent in 2020. 
 Texas, which has some of the most restrictive Medicaid eligibility rules in the country for adults, currently covers working parents only if they do not earn more than roughly 20 percent of the federal poverty level. The program does not cover childless adults.
 Anne Dunkelberg, associate director of the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a research group in Austin that strongly supported the health care law, estimated that if the legislation went into effect today, an additional one million adults would qualify for Medicaid, at a cost of $370 million a year if Texas were to pay its full 10 percent share.
 In addition, Ms. Dunkelberg said, many children who are currently eligible but are not enrolled in Medicaid and the state Children's Health Insurance Program will emerge and want to join, potentially costing the state several hundred million dollars.
 Some states, like Arizona, face an immediate fiscal conundrum because of stipulations in the law that prohibit them from rolling back their existing Medicaid programs before the required expansion takes effect. 
 About a decade ago, voters in Arizona approved a measure to expand Medicaid to include childless adults whose incomes were at or below the federal poverty limit. As part of an effort to close a $2.6 billion budget gap next year, state officials recently decided to end that program, along with the state's Children's Health Insurance Program. Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, signed the cuts into law last week.
 Now, however, the state must come up with the money to restore the programs, estimated at a billion dollars annually. 
 ''Any flexibility we used to have is gone with the new mandate,'' said Tom Betlach, director of the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, which runs Medicaid.
 Because the circumstances of the states are so varied, the challenges facing them under the legislation diverge considerably. In Louisiana, there is particular concern about what the statute will mean for the future of the state's charity hospital system, which has a long and storied history of treating the poor in the state. The state-run hospitals are heavily dependent on special federal payments to institutions that treat large numbers of the uninsured. The new health care legislation cuts those payments significantly, though some of that could be offset by in the increase in insured patients.
 California's fiscal woes have been particularly devastating and unrelenting. The state is now facing a $20 billion shortfall. Besides the anticipated flood of new enrollees to Medicaid, an equally urgent concern there has to do with increases to the reimbursement rate for Medicaid providers, which are currently among the lowest in the country. 
 Under the new health care legislation, states will have to raise the Medicaid rates paid to primary-care doctors to the same level the federal government sets under Medicare, the program for the elderly. For the first two years, the federal government will pay the difference. After that, it is left up to the states whether to continue paying the higher rates, which could mean an additional $500 million in costs a year for California, officials said.
 But California officials said they also believe they will have to significantly raise rates for other outpatient Medicaid providers to ensure an adequate supply of providers for all the newly insured. They believe this will cost an additional $2 billion a year. 
 Supporters of the health care overhaul argue that states will wind up getting a huge economic injection from the billions of dollars in new federal money pouring into Medicaid. States could also save money as hospitals that treat the uninsured become less needy, although many of these institutions are also heavily supported by localities. 
 In the end, supporters say, the ledger ends up in the black for states.

 the burden felt will depend on both the overall number and the proportion who will be covered. (Source: Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data) (A12)

HEADLINE: A Salvage Operation

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD; Sewell Chan and Louise Story contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Will it work this time?
 Once again, the federal government is adding to its arsenal of programs for troubled homeowners, seeking to help those who urgently need it while neither angering nor creating perverse incentives for those who do not.
 The new measures, announced by financial policy makers at the White House on Friday, are among the boldest to date. They are aimed not only at the seven million households that are behind on their mortgages but, in a significant expansion of aid that proved immediately controversial, the 11 million that simply owe more on their homes than they are worth. 
 Some of these people, if the government plan works, will emerge with a house whose payments they can afford and whose new mortgage reflects its market value. Unlike many previous modification recipients, they would presumably be less likely to re-default, helping to stabilize a housing market that remains queasy.
 ''We're walking that delicate balance to make sure these solutions are sustainable and not temporary,'' said David H. Stevens, commissioner of the Federal Housing Administration. 
 It is a balancing act in numerous ways. If the plan falls short -- and some experts were skeptical on Friday -- the Obama administration could find itself having to start over yet again in six months or a year.
 ''The housing market is the Vietnam War of the American financial system,'' said Howard Glaser, a housing consultant. ''The federal government is in so deep, they have to keep ramping up to find a way out.'' 
 The latest programs, together with foreclosure assistance efforts already in place, are aimed at helping as many as four million embattled owners keep their houses. But the measures, which will take as long as six months to put into practice, might easily fall victim to some of the conflicting interests that have bedeviled efforts to date. None of these programs have the force of law, and lenders have often seen no good reason to participate.
 To lubricate its efforts, the government plans to spread taxpayers' money around liberally. For instance, it had previously planned to give homeowners that sell their homes rather than let them go into foreclosure a ''relocation assistance'' payment of $1,500. The plan announced on Friday increases that amount to $3,000.
 All told, the new measures are expected to cost about $50 billion. The White House was careful to stress that the money will come from funds already set aside for housing programs in the Troubled Asset Relief Program. There will be ''no additional commitment of taxpayer dollars,'' Michael S. Barr, an assistant secretary of the Treasury, said at the White House briefing.
 Here is what the $50 billion is supposed to buy:
 The simplest component of the plan involves assistance to unemployed homeowners. Mortgage companies will now be encouraged to reduce payments for at least three months and possibly six months while the homeowner pursues a new job.
 To be eligible, borrowers must submit proof they are receiving unemployment insurance. The new payments will be 31 percent or less of their monthly income. The missing money will be tacked onto the loan's principal.
 A second and more complicated program is a requirement that mortgage servicers consider writing off a portion of a borrower's loan to get it down to a more manageable level. 
 Borrowers in the government modification plan who owe more than 115 percent of the value of their home and are paying more than 31 percent of their monthly income toward the mortgage are eligible. The write-downs are to take three years, with the borrowers in essence being rewarded for making their payments on time.
 The third major new program strays the farthest from the government's previous approach. Borrowers who owe more on their homes than they are worth will get a chance to cut their debt -- providing the investor or bank who owns the loan agrees. 
 Mr. Stevens of the F.H.A. said the program was ''for responsible homeowners who through no fault of their own find themselves in a situation of negative equity.'' 
 There is no official requirement that these homeowners be in distress, but it would probably make the investor more receptive to a deal. Whether homeowners will scheme to get into the program is one of the big uncertainties. 
 The investors will write down the loans to 97.75 percent of the appraised value of the property, at which point the F.H.A. will refinance them through new lenders. The F.H.A., which currently insures about six million homes, will insure the new loans as well.
 If the homeowner has a second mortgage, as many do, the total value of the new mortgage can be as much as 115 percent of the value of the property. The F.H.A. will spend up to $14 billion to provide incentives to the banks that service the primary loan as well as the owners of the secondary loans. Some of the money will also provide additional insurance on the new loans.
 Numerous parties will have to work together to make these deals fly. The primary loan might have been bundled into a pool and sold to investors during the housing boom. The investor must agree to cut the principal balance for a deal to work, and any bank holding a second mortgage on the property would have to go along, too.
 The only incentive for the first lien holder is a quick exit from a loan that might ultimately default. Payments for second lien holders will be made on a sliding scale. 
 Early reaction to the refinance program among lending groups was less than enthusiastic.
 ''The magnitude of this program will likely be measured in the tens of thousands rather than the hundreds of thousands of borrowers,'' said Tom Deutsch, executive director of the American Securitization Forum. Both banks and investors belong to the forum.
 The Mortgage Bankers Association, which represents the banks that service the primary loans and own outright many of the secondary loans, warned that ''each servicer will need to determine whether this is the best approach to help the individual borrower.''
 The new proposals irked many people, who flooded online forums Friday. Some said those in trouble deserved their fate. Others asked why the government was propping up housing prices when many renters still could not afford to buy a house. And some wondered about the message these rescue plans were sending to those who resisted the housing bubble.
 Dave Juliette, a software worker in Pittsburgh, is in the last group. He paid off his loan eight years ahead of schedule and now owns his house free and clear. ''I'm a homeowner in a more genuine sense of the word than many of these people with mortgages,'' Mr. Juliette said. ''But I won't be seeing a dime.''

HEADLINE: A Filipino Political Scion, Ready to Take Up the Mantle

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

 BODY:
QUEZON CITY, the Philippines
 THE couple's only son, he had never shown his father's raw political ambition or his sense of a predestined place in this country's history. He had, more like his mother, occupied the low-key, public role expected of him until circumstances forced him to act.
 Benigno S. Aquino III, 50, despite being the only son of the Philippines' two democracy icons, had a quiet, unremarkable career as a lawmaker, overshadowed by countless politicians of his generation. By his own admission, he had never imagined himself leading this country. But he now finds himself the front-runner in the May 10 presidential election.
 The nation's emotional reaction to the death of his mother, former President Corazon C. Aquino, last August led to calls for his candidacy. After some public waffling, Mr. Aquino, known as Noynoy, accepted, though not before spending half a day inside a convent for guidance. 
 ''There were too many voices saying, 'Run,' 'Don't run,' how to run, what to run in,'' he said. ''It had a calming effect on me. It helped me order the thoughts that were in my mind.''
 A quarter of a century earlier, his mother also visited a convent before agreeing to run against Ferdinand E. Marcos, the American-backed autocrat whose soldiers had gunned down her husband, Benigno S. Aquino Jr., the opposition leader known as Ninoy, at the airport in Manila. After Mr. Marcos tried to steal the election, Mrs. Aquino was thrust into the presidency on the strength of ''people power,'' a large-scale, nonviolent protest in the capital.
 Asked whether he harbored doubts, Mr. Aquino, who is single, said: ''Well, you know, my friends who have gotten married tell me that they've resolved so many issues before they go to the altar. But at the altar itself there are still some doubts that flash in their minds.''
 With less than two months left before election day, though, some of the popular emotion surrounding his mother's death has lost its intensity and Mr. Aquino's lead in the polls has started to shrink, perhaps as a result. Criticism that he offers little besides lineage has been sharpened by the fact that his closest rival, Manuel Villar, a senator, rose from poverty to become one of the Philippines' richest businessmen. 
 ON a recent morning, in a middle-class neighborhood, Mr. Aquino sat down for nearly 90 minutes at the family home, a modest, one-story house that has belonged to the Aquinos since 1961. It is where Mrs. Aquino lived until her death, and where the son now lives alone.
 In a living room dominated by portraits of his parents, Mr. Aquino spoke of channeling his mother's people power movement to victory. He promised to break with the Philippines' corrupt political culture, trying to capitalize on widespread disillusionment with the deeply unpopular President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who is prevented from running again by term limits.
 ''We believe if it is the people's campaign, then our bosses are very clearly defined,'' he said in a voice made raspy from campaigning and smoking.
 Without referring to notes or consulting any aides, Mr. Aquino spoke at length about his priorities for the Philippines: creating jobs and strengthening education, health care and the judicial system. He would seek to recalibrate his country's relations with the United States, a former colonial power here. 
 Since 2002, American Special Forces have been operating in the southern Philippines, training the Philippine military to hunt for Islamic extremists. While Mr. Aquino credits the Americans with increasing the Philippine military's ''capability,'' he said the United States force should not become ''semi-permanent or permanent.'' He also said that the Visiting Forces Agreement, the bilateral pact that allows the United States military to hold its servicemen in its custody during criminal proceedings here, ''will have to be reviewed.''
 ''I get the impression at times that in our relation with America, they seem to follow the mold of a corporation that has to report to its stockholders every year, as opposed to thinking about generating a long-term relationship,'' he said.
 Policy debates and party loyalty have little influence on campaign outcomes in the Philippines, where families dominate. 
 So his campaign rallies are punctuated by the color, symbolism and music that evoke, in his mostly middle-class supporters, the martyrdom of his father and the promise of his mother's people power uprising -- leaving aside Mrs. Aquino's more mixed record as president.
 Inside a sports stadium here, Mr. Aquino walked onto the stage to ''Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree,'' the song that was the theme of his parents' movement and recalled his mother's trademark yellow dresses. The event ended with ''The Impossible Dream,'' the favorite song of his father, a precociously successful politician who came to embody the democratic opposition to Marcos. Before he was killed, the father had extended his ambitions to his only son, in a letter whose contents were highlighted at the rally: ''Son, the ball is now in your hands.''
 Mr. Aquino, who has four sisters, said his father had great expectations of him because he was the only son.
 ''When I was younger, I think at one point, I was top three in my class. I was really, really proud of being in the top three because the other two were really nerdy individuals I couldn't see myself being,'' he recalled. ''And my dad said, 'Why only top three?' ''
 BUT Mr. Aquino's reliance on his parents' legacy, coupled with a modest legislative record, has begun to draw increasing criticism.
 ''He can't forever depend on his name and his parents,'' said Bobby Tuazon, director of the University of the Philippines' Center for People Empowerment in Governance. ''It's becoming too obvious.''
 Supporters say Mr. Aquino was unable to propose laws simply because he was in the political opposition. More than anything, supporters point to Mr. Aquino's probity, though some wonder whether he will be tough enough to rein in the kind of corruption that flourished in the government of his mother, who was also considered personally honest. 
 Critics say that Mr. Aquino, like his mother, will be unable to push through policies, like land reform, that go against his extended family's interests.
 ''All the major candidates have similar economic programs,'' said Alberto Lim, executive director of the Makati Business Club, an influential organization. ''The reason we support Noynoy is that he hasn't used his post in government to enrich his business.'' 
 Other backers also express their support of Mr. Aquino, though, tellingly, in sometimes defensive terms. He is widely regarded as a tepid campaigner who, despite improving his public speaking, rarely electrifies crowds. 
 Leah Navarro, a prominent singer helping Mr. Aquino's campaign, said he was ''cut from good cloth.''
 She added: ''He exudes a more quiet self-confidence. He's not blazing saddles. He's not razzmatazz. He's not dancing girls in short skirts.''
 Mr. Aquino says he has enjoyed meeting people at rallies but recoils at what he describes as the ''circus aspects'' of campaigning. He has allowed his sister Kris, one of the country's most famous entertainers, to pick out new clothes for him. But he has rejected advice to work on his thinning hair or get Botox injections.
 He said he was comfortable being himself, though he was keenly aware voters would invariably compare him to his parents.
 ''I never sought to compete with them because I believe that was a test that was not possible,'' he said. ''Early on after my dad died, these ardent supporters would say I'm very far from my dad. 
 ''How does one compete with an idea?'' he added, alluding to his parents' struggle for democracy. ''So that would be a useless venture on my part. I concentrated on making sure that their sacrifices were not squandered.''

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Regulators shut down two Georgia banks and one each in Florida and Arizona on Friday, bringing to 41 the number of bank failures so far this year, after the 140 that fell in 2009 to mounting loan defaults and the recession. 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation took over the banks: the McIntosh Commercial Bank, based in Carrollton, Ga.; the Unity National Bank of Cartersville, Ga.; the Key West Bank of Key West, Fla., and the Desert Hills Bank, based in Phoenix.
 CharterBank, based in West Point, Ga., agreed to assume the assets and deposits of McIntosh. 
 The Bank of the Ozarks, based in Little Rock, Ark., is assuming the assets and deposits of Unity National. 
 Another Arkansas bank, Centennial Bank of Conway, Ark., is assuming the assets and deposits of Key West.
 New York Community Bank, based in Westbury, N.Y., is assuming the assets and deposits of the Desert Hills Bank.

HEADLINE: Mixed Finish on Fears About Rally's Strength

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks closed mixed for a second day after investors grew pessimistic about the market's ability to keep its rally going.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 9 points Friday. It had been up as much as 68 after European leaders announced a plan to help Greece with its debts. A similar advance and retreat occurred Thursday.
 There was no clear reason for stocks' retrenchment Friday. But analysts said the market needed a break from a climb that has now gone on for two months with few interruptions. The Dow has advanced 17 of the last 21 days. 
 ''The market is extremely vulnerable to a pullback,'' said Christian Bendixen, director of technical research at Bay Crest Partners in New York.
 Even with the mixed finish Friday, major stock indexes still managed to rise for a fourth consecutive week.
 The early gain in stocks came after the European Union and the International Monetary Fund created a bailout program that will help Greece and other European nations facing rising debt. The deal reached late Thursday will not make money immediately available to Greece, but instead act more as a safety net.
 ''It reinforces there will be a rescue and support for Greece,'' said Oliver Pursche, executive vice president at Gary Goldberg Financial Services. ''It lays the groundwork for future rescue packages.''
 Investors have worried that mounting debt problems in places like Greece, Portugal and Spain will spread to other countries and hamper a global economic rebound.
 The reassurance that Greece will get aid, if necessary, helped the euro rise against the dollar. The euro hit 10-month lows during the week.
 But the gains faded as traders became uneasy after the extended string of advances, which have come on light volume. When trading volume is weak, investors often worry that only a small number of buyers are driving the market higher.
 ''Investors may be trigger-happy to lock in gains at any sign of selling,'' said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial Group.
 The Dow rose 9.15 points, or 0.08 percent, to 10,850.36. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.86 of a point, or 0.07 percent, to 1,166.59, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 2.28 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,395.13.
 For the week, the Dow gained 1 percent. The S.& P. 500 rose 0.6 percent, and the Nasdaq gained 0.9 percent.
 Bond prices rose, pushing down yields. Weak demand at the government's latest auctions for Treasury notes sent prices tumbling and interest rates higher during the week.
 The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 9/32 on Friday, to 98 6/32, and the yield fell to 3.85 percent, from 3.88 percent late Thursday. 
 The coming week is a short one for investors. Markets will be closed for Good Friday. But there will be plenty of economic data, including consumer confidence figures on Tuesday and a manufacturing report on Thursday. The government will release its March employment report on Friday.
 Investors brushed aside Friday's final update to the gross domestic product report that showed the nation's economy grew at a rate of 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter, below the 5.9 percent forecast by economists polled by Thomson Reuters. 
 Much of the growth was tied to a surge in spending from government stimulus measures and manufacturing as businesses restocked exceptionally low inventories. Those gains are seen as temporary, so G.D.P. most likely has slowed in the first quarter.
 Consumer spending also remains weak and has not been able to replace the slack from a slowdown in government measures. Consumers are cautious because unemployment remains high, analysts say.
 The Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for March was revised to 73.6 from a previous estimate of 72.5. The revised number was better than the 73 reading economists had forecast, but was not an improvement over February's figure. High unemployment has made consumers cautious, which has been reflected in mixed consumer confidence surveys in recent months. 
 The Labor Department's employment report next Friday is expected to show that employers added jobs in March for only the second month since the recession began in December 2007.

HEADLINE: State Jobless Rates Show Signs of Stabilizing

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- State unemployment rates stabilized somewhat last month, reflecting a broader nationwide trend, the Labor Department reported on Friday. 
 Sixteen states said their jobless rate was unchanged in February, seven reported declines and 27 reported increases.
 That was an improvement from January, when 30 states reported rising unemployment rates, and much better than December, when joblessness rose in 43 states.
 The nationwide unemployment rate was 9.7 percent in February, the same as the previous month. Layoffs are slowing as the economy recovers, however. 
 The economy is likely to generate more than 150,000 jobs this month, according to a survey of economists by Thomson Reuters. The national figures for March will be released next Friday. The jobless rate is forecast to remain at 9.7 percent.
 These ''readings are consistent with labor markets beginning to show some stability,'' said Donald L. Schunk, an economist at Coastal Carolina University near Myrtle Beach, S.C.
 But Mr. Schunk and other economists said there were still few signs of widespread, consistent job growth. Twenty-seven states reported a decline in total jobs, the Labor Department said, while 23 reported increases. 
 The biggest declines were in Virginia, which lost 32,600 jobs; California, which shed 20,400; and Michigan and Pennsylvania, which each lost 16,000. 
 Virginia officials blamed at least part of the drop on the snowstorms that hit the East Coast last month. 
 Four states had record-high unemployment rates: Nevada at 13.2 percent, Florida at 12.2 percent, North Carolina at 11.2 percent and Georgia at 10.5 percent.

HEADLINE: Layers of Contradiction In L.I. Hate-Crime Trial

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
RIVERHEAD, N.Y. -- The crime seemed brutally simple: Seven high school students attacked two Hispanic immigrants in Patchogue in November 2008, prosecutors said, after a night of ''Mexican hopping,'' a sport made of assaulting Latino men in Suffolk County on eastern Long Island.
 Yet, more than a year later, in a room in State Supreme Court here, the picture that has emerged of the crime and the role that race played in it is proving to be far more complex, and even contradictory. 
 Six of the teenagers are white, and one has a black mother and a Puerto Rican father. Jeffrey Conroy, the teenager accused of fatally stabbing one of the immigrants, Marcelo Lucero, has a tattoo of a swastika on his leg. But the young woman Mr. Conroy had been dating on and off for years and had spoken to earlier that night in November, Pamela Suarez, is Bolivian. 
 In the selection of victims, it seems an assumption was made that any Hispanic person encountered would be Mexican. One victim chased earlier that night was an English-speaking Colombian waiter who came to America in 1973, long before the teenagers were born. Two others, Mr. Lucero and his friend Angel Loja, were born in Ecuador. 
 ''We're not Mexican,'' Mr. Loja said he told the teenagers that November night near a train station in Patchogue, moments before the attack. 
 And though prosecutors say Mr. Conroy, 19, admitted to the police that he stabbed Mr. Lucero, his trial on second-degree murder as a hate crime focused one day this week on another issue: the precise slurs that the teenagers are accused of using. 
 Mr. Loja testified on Wednesday that the group called them ''Mexicans'' and ''illegals'' and used racial and ethnic slurs against blacks and Hispanics. In his testimony before the grand jury and in his signed statement to the police in November 2008, he said the attackers used a racial epithet, but he made no mention of their using ''Mexicans,'' ''illegals'' or a Hispanic slur. It was a point that Mr. Conroy's lawyer stressed throughout much of his nearly four-hour cross-examination of Mr. Loja.
 The exchange between the attackers and Mr. Loja and Mr. Lucero seemed to be as much about race as class, or even economics.
 ''You come to this country to take our money from us,'' Mr. Loja said someone in the group told them. Mr. Loja worked in construction; Mr. Lucero worked in a dry-cleaning store. When one of the teenagers asked him for money, Mr. Lucero replied that they should work, as he did, so that they could have money, too, Mr. Loja testified. 
 At one point, Mr. Loja said he told the teenager who is black and Hispanic, Jose Pacheco, ''I'm the same color as you.'' He also admitted in court that he had used a racial slur to refer to Mr. Pacheco after, he said, Mr. Pacheco used the slur against him. 
 The indelicate, intricate details that have come to light in Long Island's first trial on murder as a hate crime have complicated a case that exposed racial tensions in Suffolk County and prompted numerous Hispanics to come forward to describe episodes of harassment and assaults.
 ''A lot of hate-crime trials are gray in this way,'' said Mark Potok, a director at the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit Alabama-based organization that tracks hate groups. The center issued a report in 2009 about racial intolerance in Suffolk County.
 ''It's really a jury call,'' Mr. Potok added. ''Oftentimes, whether or not a crime is a hate crime turns on very fine points of the evidence.''
 Mr. Potok said he saw no contradictions in the fact that Mr. Pacheco is black and Hispanic and that Mr. Conroy has black and Hispanic friends. Mr. Potok spoke of a white supremacist gang in California called the Nazi Low Riders that has many members who are Latino or have Latina companions. 
 ''These kinds of contradictions are much more common than anyone expects,'' Mr. Potok said. ''When I look at this group of defendants, I wouldn't be looking for ideological consistency. I think that the idea that Latino immigrants were somehow disposable people was in the atmosphere in Suffolk County and very much sunk into these kids' brains. It's not so much that they're following a strict ideology. In a sense, the community around them has identified a group of people who are somehow less.''
 Mr. Conroy has pleaded not guilty. Four of the seven, including Mr. Pacheco, have pleaded guilty to second-degree attempted assault as a hate crime and other charges, and are cooperating with the authorities. The two others have pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial.
 Despite the racially charged atmosphere surrounding the case, the trial has unfolded in quiet, low-key fashion in the criminal courthouse. One day, in a hallway, Mr. Conroy's parents, Robert and Lori Conroy, spoke briefly with Mr. Lucero's brother, Joselo Lucero, and the Rev. Allan B. Ramirez, an immigrant advocate assisting the Lucero family. The Conroys told Joselo Lucero that his family had been in their prayers.
 Ms. Suarez, 20, has visited Mr. Conroy in jail, and she said in an interview that she believed Mr. Conroy was innocent and had been falsely demonized as a hate-filled young man. Ms. Suarez, who attended Patchogue-Medford High School with Mr. Conroy, dated him on and off for about four years. In that time, she said, Mr. Conroy never said anything anti-Hispanic to her.
 ''He didn't care what you were,'' she said. ''They're saying that he's a supremacist. It's not true. It's not him. He's a very loving person.'' 
 Ms. Suarez, now a freshman at Stony Brook University, said she had no plans to testify, saying she did not want to put herself or her family in the spotlight. 
 Another of Mr. Conroy's friends, Keith Brunjes, 18, did testify, describing how one day in 2008 he drew a swastika tattoo on Mr. Conroy, using a needle, ink and thread. Asked in court if he had given himself any tattoos, Mr. Brunjes said he had. There was one on Mr. Brunjes's arm. It read ''One Love.''

HEADLINE: How the Plan Works

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER and JENNIFER SARANOW SCHULTZ

 BODY:
The federal government announced initiatives on Friday to help people who are having trouble paying their mortgages or who owe more than their homes are worth. Here are answers to some questions you may have about the programs. 
 Q.I am currently unemployed. What sort of mortgage payment reduction can I qualify for?
 A. The company servicing your mortgage will be required to offer at least three, and up to six, months of reduced payments. During that time, you wouldn't have to pay more than 31 percent of your monthly income toward the mortgage. 
 You have to live in the home to qualify, and the mortgage balance has to be less than $729,750, with a monthly payment that represents more than 31 percent of the gross monthly income of all the borrowers who signed the mortgage, before you subtract anything for taxes or deductions. 
 If one person in the household works and one is unemployed, you will not be eligible if the loan payment is under 31 percent of your current total household income.
 Also, you need to prove that you are receiving unemployment benefits. The amount of the reduced payments will be added to the balance of the loan for you to pay off later. 
 Q.I'm underwater, since my mortgage is for more than my home is worth. What sort of help might I get from my mortgage company?
 A. The company that controls your mortgage may reduce your principal, and the government is offering additional incentives for it to do so.
 You will have to owe more than 115 percent of the value of your first mortgage to qualify. You need to live in your home, have a mortgage under $729,750 and have a mortgage payment that is more than 31 percent of your gross monthly income. You also need to prove that you are undergoing financial hardship, like a mortgage payment that has risen recently or a reduction in income.
 Any principal forgiveness will take place in three equal amounts over the course of three years, but only if you make your mortgage payments on time.
 Banks are not required to participate, and it's not clear how many will.
 Q. What about the new refinancing option for people who are underwater?
 A. If you're current on your payments with your existing mortgage provider, you may be able to refinance into a loan through the federal government's Federal Housing Administration program and have some of your principal forgiven. Here, too, you need to occupy your home to qualify; you can't be an investor or landlord. 
 Your current mortgage holder is not required to help you. But if it decides to do so, it will have to agree to write down at least 10 percent of the value of your first mortgage. And your current loan cannot itself be an F.H.A. mortgage.
 Also, your payment under any new F.H.A. loan must be less than 31 percent of your gross monthly income, and your total household debt cannot be more than about 50 percent of your income unless you have an excellent credit history.
 Q.Who decides how much my home is worth and how?
 A. There will be a reappraisal, which raises an odd situation. Normally, when selling your home, you want the appraisal to be at a high value. Here, however, the lower the value of your home, the more likely you are to be far enough underwater to qualify for help.
 Q.What if there is a second mortgage on my home?
 A. There are now additional incentives in place to write down amounts on second mortgages. You may be eligible for help with a second mortgage even if you've already qualified for help with a first mortgage. For people refinancing into an F.H.A. loan, their original lenders must forgive enough principal so that their new, single, loan is not more than 115 percent of the current value of their home. 
 Q.How will taking part in these initiatives affect my credit history?
 A. If your mortgage holder writes down some of your principal, there's a chance that won't be a black mark on your credit report. But the exact impact is still unclear.
 As of November, the credit reports of borrowers in earlier mortgage modification programs weren't necessarily affected because of their participation. That's because the Treasury and the Consumer Data Industry Association, which represents credit reporting agencies, created a new code for loans modified under a government plan. They recommended that lenders use the code but did not require it. FICO, the company that developed the credit-scoring system used by most lenders, is not counting financial transactions with the new code in its scores.
 It's possible, however, that banks will treat some or all of the new principal forgiveness programs in a different way that could harm participants' credit reports. A spokesman for the Consumer Data association said the group was still working out what code or codes ought to apply. The federal agencies involved do not tell lenders how to report participation in the programs. 
 Meanwhile, if you participate in the temporary payment reduction program for unemployed people, you will probably see some damage to your credit report.
 Q.When should I call my mortgage servicer?
 A. Unemployed borrowers should start calling in the next couple of months. Some servicers may already have their own programs in place. The principal reduction programs may not begin until the fall.
 Your lender is supposed to contact people who are eligible for help, but it's probably best to call in periodically yourself for updates if you think you may be eligible.

HEADLINE: Derailing Help for Consumers

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 Why should there be any significant opposition to the creation of an independent agency with strong powers of enforcement to protect consumers from exploitation by banks, mortgage companies, auto dealers and other purveyors of credit?
 The dragons lurking in the fine print of some credit agreements are enough to give you heart failure. Payday loans, for example, typically carry annual interest rates in the vicinity of 400 percent. Or look at the lineup of fees, penalties and interest rates on your credit cards and overdraft privileges. Don't even start on mortgage abuses. That would take too long, and it's too depressing.
 We're talking here about exploitation run wild. The Mob, which used to have a stranglehold on loan-sharking, can only look on with envy. 
 So I guess it's understandable that the financial industry and other big-money interests are all but hysterical in their opposition to the Consumer Financial Protection Agency that has been proposed by the Obama administration as part of its overall reform of financial regulations. You'd hardly expect the people rifling the pockets of middle-class Americans and the poor to be happy about an agency with oversight and enforcement authority homing in on their nefarious and wildly profitable activities. 
 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is spending millions trying to prevent the agency from ever seeing the light of day. 
 The antiregulatory mania of the past three decades and the stagnant wages of most American workers during that period have left families at the mercy of an increasingly predatory financial sector. As a briefing paper by the progressive think tank Demos noted:
 ''An increasingly strapped middle class became the ideal consumer for banks: highly reliant on loans for paying for the basics of family life; savings easily depleted by emergency events such as an illness or home repair; a paycheck-to-paycheck budget easily leading to overdraft fees and payday loans.
 ''Consumers were less and less able to avoid any one lender's high fees, penalties and interest rates because of government's newfound willingness to approve financial industry mergers.''
 Ordinary Americans need someone on their side in the wild world of consumer credit. The big companies have their accountants and economists and lawyers and lobbyists and trade associations, and their good buddies on Capitol Hill -- all of them figuring out new and better ways to separate consumers from their money. But as Elizabeth Warren has asked again and again: Who is looking out for the consumer?
 The answer is no one. Consumers have to navigate the treacherous credit terrain on their own, often with the equity in their homes or their life's savings at stake.
 Ms. Warren, a bankruptcy expert, Harvard professor and head of Congressional oversight for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, came up with the idea of a consumer financial protection agency. It would shield individuals and families from the deceptive practices and outright fraud that is rampant in the credit industry. As Timothy Geithner, the Treasury secretary put it, ''This agency will have only one mission: to protect consumers.''
 But the proposal, bombarded with criticism from corporate interests with enormous stakes in the status quo, is already being weakened. A bill that emerged from the Senate banking committee this week provides for a consumer protection agency that would be housed in the Federal Reserve, which would limit its independence somewhat.
 More important, the bill would allow bank regulators from outside the agency to veto the agency's rules under certain circumstances. That's a recipe for undermining the agency's effectiveness.
 Heather McGhee, the director of Demos's Washington office, noted that the Senate bill would also prevent the agency from enforcing its own rules in the case of certain smaller lenders. ''So what's being left out,'' she said, ''are the smaller payday loans, private student lenders, debt collectors, auto title loans, and so forth.''
 When you allow so-called smaller businesses to escape enforcement of consumer protection rules, you encourage the creation of companies and other entities that are just small enough to escape the enforcement threshold. And that's where the bad practices will flow. 
 An interesting concept at work here is the notion that consumer protections that work too well would end up hurting the ''safety and soundness'' of the nation's financial sector. (That's the reason the Senate bill provides for bank regulators to have a veto over the proposed agency's rules under some limited circumstances.)
 ''Safety and soundness'' is a euphemism for profitability. What's really being said is that when the profitability of the big banks and other financial agencies and institutions are in conflict with the fair treatment of consumers, it's the fair treatment of consumers that has to give way.
 Now would be a good time to start putting that notion to rest.

HEADLINE: Twists, Turns and Anger on Way to Arms Pact With Russia

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER; Ellen Barry contributed reporting from Moscow.

 BODY:
President Obama was angry. He was on the phone with President Dmitri A. Medvedev last month to finalize a new arms control treaty with Russia, only to be confronted with new demands for concessions on missile defense. A deal that was supposed to be done was unraveling.
 ''Dmitri, we agreed,'' Mr. Obama told Mr. Medvedev with a tone of exasperation, according to advisers. ''We can't do this. If it means we're going to walk away from this treaty and not get it done, so be it. But we're not going to go down this path.''
 Mr. Obama hung up and vented frustration. Some of his advisers had never seen him so mad. A picture taken by a White House photographer captured his grim face in that moment of uncertainty. For a year he had been trying to forge a new relationship with Russia, starting with a treaty to slash nuclear arsenals. And for a year Russia had been testing him, suspecting he was weak and certain it could roll over him. 
 If Mr. Obama overestimated his powers of persuasion in reaching quick agreement with the Russians, they misjudged how far they could get him to bend. In the end, they compromised on nonbinding language. And so, after all the fits and starts, all the miscalculations, the vodka toasts that proved premature and the stare-downs that nearly sank the whole enterprise, Mr. Obama hung up the phone again with Mr. Medvedev on Friday, this time having finally translated aspiration into agreement.
 The president then stepped before cameras to tell the world that next month the United States and Russia would sign a ''new Start'' treaty paring back their still formidable nuclear arsenals, cutting the legal limits on deployed strategic warheads by 30 percent and on launchers by half. Just as important, it will establish an inspection regime to replace one that expired in December.
 The announcement culminated a negotiation that sprawled across time and space in ways that Mr. Obama hardly expected when he kicked it off, a process that dragged on four months past its deadline and leapt from London to Moscow to Geneva to Singapore to Copenhagen to Washington. For a new president, the effort became a crucible of diplomacy and a tutorial in the complexities of international security.
 This account of how Mr. Obama reached agreement is based on interviews with American officials and Russian insiders, many of whom requested anonymity to discuss confidential negotiations. It is a story with twists and turns that included 10 rounds of talks by full-time negotiators in Geneva but ultimately kept coming around to intense personal negotiations between Mr. Obama and Mr. Medvedev, who met or talked by telephone 14 times to hash through disputes.
 ''When President Obama's domestic positions were weakened in recent months and he was completely consumed in his crusade for health care reform, making all other issues irrelevant, it is surprising how much attention he kept on Start,'' said Sergei M. Rogov, director of the Institute for U.S. and Canada Studies in Moscow, referring to the treaty. ''Even being 24-hours-a-day busy on health reform, he had a 25th hour for Start.''
 And a 26th and maybe a 27th. 
 ''It's been much harder than we anticipated,'' said a senior Obama administration official involved in the process. ''We thought it would be relatively easy.''
 It was not.
 The treaty was born in the days after Mr. Obama's election as president in 2008, when he decided to ''reset'' strained ties with Russia. Since he also harbored dreams of eventually eliminating the world's nuclear weapons, arms control was an obvious way to pursue two goals at once. 
 Mr. Obama first met Mr. Medvedev last April at an economic summit meeting in London, and they agreed to draft a replacement for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty of 1991, or Start, which was scheduled to expire in December. With so little time, the goal was to extend and update inspection and verification systems while enacting modest weapons cuts as a down payment on deeper reductions later.
 The two sides picked arms control veterans to lead talks in Geneva. Rose Gottemoeller, who worked on nuclear issues in the Clinton administration and later lived in Russia as director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, was appointed assistant secretary of state for verification, compliance and implementation. Anatoly Antonov, a veteran ambassador and director of security and disarmament at the Russian Foreign Ministry, would lead Moscow's delegation. But Mr. Obama would find again and again that he had to step in, that the Russians would not resolve the big issues until they had taken his measure. 
 ''He has been personally involved in this in a way I don't think other presidents have been,'' said Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff. And along the way, he forged a bond with Mr. Medvedev that he hopes will prove useful in the future.
 Mr. Obama used a visit to Moscow in July to narrow differences over treaty goals, with American negotiators pushing to announce specific targets for arms cuts. The Russians balked, wanting to leave them undefined. In the end, they compromised by declaring a target range for warheads and delivery vehicles, defining the parameters of future talks.
 The Russians raised American plans for missile defense, long a sore point. How could Moscow cut its arsenal deeply if the Americans built a system that could negate the smaller nuclear force? Mr. Obama agreed only to a general statement acknowledging that the decisions about deploying offensive and defense weapons were interrelated.
 Missile defense was not the only point of contention. Mr. Obama's team assumed that the Kremlin would agree to an updated version of the Start treaty's verification program. But they were surprised to discover that Russian officials resented that system, viewing it as part of a treaty negotiated in weakness as the Soviet Union was collapsing.
 Under Start, American inspectors had been based at Russia's Votkinsk missile production factory. The Kremlin wanted them out and told the Obama team that the Bush administration, before leaving office, had already agreed. Ms. Gottemoeller was disturbed but found she could not reopen the issue. ''They kept saying, 'It's the reset. Why do we need inspectors? We're all friends now,' '' another American official recalled.
 Russia wanted deeper cuts in American launchers because Moscow already had unilaterally pared back its costly missiles. During a meeting in Singapore, Mr. Medvedev pressed the point, but Mr. Obama resisted, worrying that it would compel him to abandon one of the legs of the American nuclear triad: ballistic missiles, nuclear-armed submarines and strategic bombers. 
 The two sides also split over sharing missile data known as telemetry. Moscow was adamant that the new treaty not require telemetry exchange. The topic came up so frequently that Mr. Medvedev joked, ''My favorite word in English now is 'telemetry.' ''
 With those issues unresolved, Start expired in December. The Russians calculated that Mr. Obama would be so eager to have a new treaty by the time he traveled to Oslo later that month to accept his Nobel Peace Prize that he would accept concessions, so they took a hard line. 
 Mr. Obama held out. But at a meeting on climate change in Copenhagen, he met Mr. Medvedev again and thought he finally made a breakthrough.
 The climate change meeting was held in an emptied shopping mall. Mr. Obama met his team in a dress shop surrounded by unclothed mannequins. He and Mr. Medvedev finally agreed on most of the major issues: They would cut deployed warheads to 1,550 per side, down from the current limit of 2,200. Theywould cut deployed heavy bombers and missiles to 700 each. They would conduct 18 inspections a year, up from 10 originally proposed by Moscow.
 Even on the technical telemetry issue, they found agreement. 
 ''Let's just do it on an annual basis,'' Mr. Obama proposed spontaneously. 
 ''I don't see any problem with that,'' Mr. Medvedev said.
 Mr. Obama turned to his own advisers and asked, ''You guys good with that?''
 The Americans left Copenhagen feeling good with that. 
 ''We thought we had all the major things agreed on,'' an Obama adviser said. But nothing was in writing. A team went to Moscow in January to iron out final details. It included Gen. James L. Jones, the national security adviser; Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Ms. Gottemoeller; Michael McFaul, the president's Russia adviser; and Gary Samore, his nonproliferation adviser.
 The negotiators finalized one last weapons limit, capping launchers, deployed or not, at 800 each. The meeting went so well that the Americans returned to their hotel and exchanged high fives. Waiting to leave at a Moscow airport, they treated themselves to a vodka toast, only to be surprised at the $270 bill for nine shots. Mr. Obama was pleased when he later ran into Mr. McFaul and Mr. Samore.
 ''How'd we do, guys?'' Mr. Obama asked. 
 ''We're done, sir,'' one said.
 Not yet. 
 Missile defense had faded as an issue after Mr. Obama scrapped the Bush architecture and reformulated it to focus initially on short- and medium-range Iranian missiles. But the day after the Moscow meeting, Mr. Antonov of the Russian delegation suddenly reintroduced the issue to Ms. Gottemoeller, insisting the treaty include a commitment not to change missile defense plans further. The renewed dispute intensified two weeks later when Romania unexpectedly announced that it would host interceptors from the new system, putting the reconfigured missile defense system right in Russia's geopolitical backyard. That led to the tense phone conversation with Mr. Medvedev on Feb. 24 that left Mr. Obama so angry.
 Mr. Medvedev insisted on issuing a joint statement that would bind missile defense. Mr. Obama refused but said he was open to separate unilateral statements that would detail each side's position without any binding effect. Ellen O. Tauscher, the under secretary of state for arms control, flew to Geneva to join Ms. Gottemoeller for a final push.
 Dmitri V. Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, said that the Kremlin thought Mr. Obama would back down out of eagerness to finish the treaty before coming international nuclear summit meetings. 
 ''They believed Obama could be put under pressure and concessions could be extracted from him,'' Mr. Trenin said. ''He needed the treaty more than the Russians in the short term.''
 Ultimately, Russia backed down. Mr. Medvedev called Mr. Obama on March 13, and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton then traveled to Moscow. Negotiators finished drafting their separate statements on Tuesday, with Russia warning that it reserved the right to withdraw from the treaty if it deemed American missile defenses a threat, while the United States said it would build the defenses as it saw fit but was not making a target of Russia.
 By Friday, the two presidents set aside the discord underlying those statements. Speaking on the phone, according to an American official, they congratulated themselves on breaking through the mistrust. ''If you want something done right,'' Mr. Medvedev began in English, and Mr. Obama finished his thought: ''you do it yourself.''

HEADLINE: Port Authority Official Criticizes Towers Deal

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The news on Thursday that the Port Authority and the developer Larry A. Silverstein had ceased hostilities and come to a tentative agreement at ground zero was greeted with a great deal of fanfare. But judging from a blistering note the next morning from the Port Authority's vice chairman, the next 120 days are going to be anything but peaceful. 
 The vice chairman, Henry R. Silverman, said in an e-mail message that the final deal allowing Mr. Silverstein to build two skyscrapers at ground zero with up to $1.6 billion in public subsidies cannot leave the developer flush with cash and the authority at financial risk. 
 ''The notion that a private developer and/or his investors profit while the public sector is at risk for billions of dollars is unacceptable,'' he wrote to the authority's executive director, Christopher O. Ward, and eight fellow commissioners.
 Only 17 hours earlier, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Gov. David A. Paterson and various labor leaders lauded the announcement that the two sides would spend the next three months putting their rough outline of a deal into formal documents.
 But clearly the commissioners are worried. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is already building 1 World Trade Center, a $3 billion tower at the northwest corner of the site, which also needs tenants, as well as a $3.2 billion transit center and the national memorial.
 ''By enabling the construction of Towers 3 and 4, we are further crystallizing'' a loss of $1 billion to $2 billion on 1 World Trade Center, Mr. Silverman wrote. ''If we owned a losing McDonald's at 18th and Park, would we build two more restaurants on the same block?''
 Mr. Silverman said he recognized the ''public interest'' in rebuilding Lower Manhattan, but he and other commissioners wanted to reiterate to Mr. Ward the importance of ensuring that the developer not profit or take development fees while public money is at risk. He also said that the authority should get a bigger return for its investment if the buildings are successful.
 Asked about the e-mail message, Mr. Silverman said: ''It's self-explanatory. It doesn't require further comment.''
 Mr. Ward, who negotiated the tentative agreement on behalf of the authority, attended the news conference with the mayor and the governor. Anthony R. Coscia, the board chairman, did not. Mr. Coscia said Thursday that ''much work needs to be done to hammer out all the details in a complex agreement.''
 Asked about Mr. Silverman's e-mail message, Stephen Sigmund, a spokesman for the authority, said: ''We believe this is a strong framework for building out the entire World Trade Center site. The board directed the staff to finalize an agreement, and we look forward to doing so responsibly. We're committed to partnering with Silverstein Properties on the east side of the site.''
 With the downturn in the economy and declining toll and airport revenue, the authority has been forced to cut $5 billion from its capital budget. Mr. Silverman and the commissioners who govern the authority are clearly worried that providing subsidies for speculative office towers in Lower Manhattan will mean that important transportation projects go unfinanced.
 Mr. Silverstein leased the trade center just weeks before the complex was destroyed in a 2001 terrorist attack. Under a 2006 development agreement with the authority, he was to build three enormous skyscrapers along Church Street with a combination of insurance money, private financing and tax-exempt bonds.
 But he has been unable to secure financing or corporate tenants because of a weak real estate market and lenders' refusals to pay for new projects. Predicting that the market will rebound in the coming years, Mr. Silverstein asked the authority to provide financing and won the backing of Mayor Bloomberg.
 The authority, which estimated that Mr. Silverstein's initial proposal would cost $3.5 billion, did not want to finance big office towers that could sit empty, leading to a 16-month impasse. The authority came under enormous pressure from Mayor Bloomberg, and later Governor Paterson, to fashion a solution.

HEADLINE: A Better Way to Elect Our Leaders?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''A Tea Party Without Nuts,'' by Thomas L. Friedman (column, March 24):
 It's wonderful to see Mr. Friedman recommend ''alternative voting,'' which in this country is more commonly known as ''instant runoff voting'' or ''ranked-choice'' voting. Instant runoff voting is fairer than the ''vote for one'' election method, and as Mr. Friedman points out, ranked-choice ballots let voters more freely and fully express their preferences.
 Instant runoff voting has already been adopted by several California cities. This year the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences helped publicize instant runoff voting by using it to award the best picture Oscar. The League of Women Voters of Los Angeles, of which I am president, is advocating instant runoff voting for government elections. 
 The league's intent is not to push politics in any particular direction. Instant runoff voting simply gives people a clearer voice.
 David A. Holtzman Los Angeles, March 24, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman's column calls for breaking up ''the oligopoly of our two-party system.'' I couldn't agree more, but I'd add two essential points.
 In addition to instant runoff voting and nonpartisan redistricting, to give us more choice in our elections, we need a uniform, reasonable ballot access law to allow alternative candidacies (independents and third parties) to have a chance to present ideas to the American public by being on the ballot.
 We also need nonpartisan administration of our elections to ensure that partisan election officials are not making discriminatory determinations of who gets on the ballot, who gets to vote, how voter rolls are purged and how votes are counted.

 The writer, a public interest lawyer, is the author of ''Grand Illusion: The Myth of Voter Choice in a Two-Party Tyranny'' and was national campaign manager for Ralph Nader in 2000 and 2004.
 To the Editor:
 Phil Keisling may be right that to avoid extremism we should scrap party primaries (''To Reduce Partisanship, Get Rid of Partisans,'' Op-Ed, March 22), but the alternative system he recommends is even worse in that respect.
 Mr. Keisling proposes that states should run open primaries in which the top two vote-getters go on to face each other in the general election. This is essentially the same method that France uses to elect presidents, only instead of a general election, the French hold a runoff between the two leading candidates from the first round.
 In 2002, this system shocked the world by sending Jean-Marie Le Pen, an extreme right-wing candidate, to the runoff -- a travesty because the left-center candidate, Lionel Jospin, would have easily defeated Mr. Le Pen in head-to-head competition, but was eliminated in the first round (he finished third to Mr. Le Pen and the right-center incumbent, Jacques Chirac).
 Such an outcome was possible because the vote on the left was badly split among several popular candidates. Mr. Keisling's proposal would permit similar travesties to occur in the United States.
 A better approach would be to eliminate primaries altogether and open the general election to all candidates. But rather than confining citizens to vote for a single candidate, they would be given the opportunity to rank candidates in order of their preference. The winner would be the candidate who, according to the rankings, would beat all others in head-to-head contests.
 Such a system would avoid the possibility of an extremist defeating a moderate when a large majority of voters prefer the moderate.

 The writer, a Nobel laureate in economics, is a professor of social science at the Institute for Advanced Study.
 To the Editor:
 Phil Keisling, a former Oregon secretary of state, sponsored a ''top-two'' primary measure that was rejected by almost a 2-to-1 margin by Oregon voters in 2008. It would have allowed parties to advance their candidates to the general election by using ''ringers'' to split the primary votes of the other parties.
 Anyone could register with any party and appear on the primary ballot with that party's label. For example, Republicans could recruit people to register and file as Democratic candidates and thereby split up the Democratic vote and stop any of them from finishing in the top two. Democrats could follow the same strategy.
 Since 1979, in Louisiana, the only state where this system has operated for more than one election cycle, there have been 9, 9, 8, 12, 16, 11, 17 and 12 candidates on the primary ballot for governor alone. Fragmenting the vote has allowed extremist candidates (remember the white supremacist David Duke) to win the primary -- the opposite of what Mr. Keisling desires.
 Linda Williams Portland, Ore., March 24, 2010
 The writer is chairwoman of the Independent Party of Oregon.
 To the Editor:
 Phil Keisling is right that our primary system is broken, with plunging and unrepresentative turnout, but his prescription for a general election between the top two primary candidates would too often replicate the worst of modern politics. After eliminating most candidates in low-turnout primaries, we'd typically be left with two candidates representing only the major parties.
 It would be better to allow all candidates on the November ballot and use instant runoff voting. Voters would have one vote but indicate backup choices. If their first choice runs weakly and is eliminated, their ballots are awarded to their next choice, requiring winners to reach out to backers of other candidates.
 ''Hurt Locker'' won the best picture Oscar with this system, and voters handle it well in major elections in Minneapolis and San Francisco and in nations like Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.
 Instant runoff voting can be particularly valuable in those state legislative districts where voters elect several representatives rather than just one. It could result in fairer representation of the left, center and right, providing more balance to policymaking.

HEADLINE: Doctors Offer Thoughts on Cutting Health Care Costs

BYLINE: By LESLEY ALDERMAN

 BODY:
IN persuading Congressional Democrats to pass the health care overhaul, President Obama addressed one of the most pressing issues facing the country: providing broader access to medical insurance for as many as 32 million Americans who do not now have it. 
 For many of the rest of us, the benefits could still be substantial once the law takes full effect in 2014. People with pre-existing medical conditions could no longer be denied insurance. All lifetime and annual limits on coverage would be eliminated. And new policies would be required to meet higher benefit standards.
 But the new law does not tackle head-on the staggering cost of health care in the United States, which eats up $2.3 trillion a year, about 16.2 percent of our gross domestic product, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. 
 That raises the ultimate Patient Money question: How can the country reduce health care costs while not compromising quality? 
 During the health care debate, government officials, insurers, drug companies and medical associations all weighed in with their opinions. But what about the people who receive so much of our out-of-pocket health care payments: the doctors on the medical front lines? What do they think the country -- in other words, you and me -- should do to help moderate costs?
 I turned to some of the doctors I've interviewed over the last year and asked them to prescribe remedies for high medical costs. Here is what they said. (The remarks have been edited and condensed.)
 Insure Catastrophes Only
 ''The idea of paying a certain monthly fee for insurance that allows you to have most of your routine care covered doesn't make sense. When you buy auto insurance, you don't insure yourself for every dent and nick -- you insure yourself for serious accidents. This is the way the health insurance system should work. Our current insurance model does not encourage patients to take care of themselves. It doesn't reward patients for being healthy, it rewards them for being sick. This isn't good for patients or insurers.''
 Jacques Moritz, M.D., director of gynecology, St Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, New York
 Change Malpractice Law
 ''Some doctors often order tests to confirm a suspected diagnosis -- even when the suspected diagnosis is likely correct with a high degree of certainty -- out of concerns regarding the potential for malpractice suits in our current litigious climate. This is a cost of medical care that could be fixed if serious efforts at tort reform were undertaken.''
 James A. Reiffel, M.D., professor of clinical medicine and director, electrocardiography laboratory, Columbia University Medical Center, New York
 NOTE: The new law contains a provision to award five-year grants to selected states to develop alternatives to current tort litigation.
 Counsel Nutrition
 ''In the cardiology arena, adoption of a Mediterranean style diethas been shown to reduce the likelihood of a second heart attack by more than 70 percent -- a benefit far in excess of any drug or procedure. Unfortunately, most doctors do not have the training to provide effective nutritional counseling. How much does the health care system -- and more importantly, the patient -- lose every time a medical encounter does not include attention to nutrition?''
 Stephen R. Devries, M.D., preventive cardiologist, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Chicago
 Rely on Evidence...
 ''I believe that if you do the right thing for the patient, it will ultimately be the right thing for the health care system. That means spending adequate time gathering information and using actual research data to guide judicious ordering of tests and prescribing of treatment. For instance, if an asymptomatic, otherwise healthy, patient comes to me wanting a whole-body CT scan to make sure they do not have something bad hiding inside of them, I would decline and educate him or her that there is no data to show that this test has any significant benefit to offset the potential radiation or other harm and the major medical societies do not recommend this test.''
 Lisa Bernstein, M.D., internist and associate professor in the department of medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta
 NOTE: The new law provides for the creation this year of a nonprofit corporation, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, which would conduct research comparing the clinical effectiveness of medical treatments. The institute's findings could not be construed as mandates, though, or used to deny coverage.
 ... But Allow for Expertise
 ''Government policy often results in a race to the average and mediocre, to the customary and usual, while ignoring the exceptional and extraordinary. And it is this group of patients -- the unusual, the outlier, the complex, the group that has failed evidence-based care -- that represents the costliest group in any illness category. Such is the case in migraine, where a very small percentage of patients represent 75 percent of the overall costs. These are the patients who must be hospitalized, who attend the emergency department on a regular basis, who develop secondary illness, undergo needless procedures and surgery, and become dependent on narcotics in their desperate search for pain relief. The pursuit of savings by government agencies often misses the point that good care at almost any price is less costly than bad care at almost any savings.''
 Joel R. Saper, M.D., founder and director, Michigan Head Pain & Neurological Institute, Ann Arbor, Mich. 
 Use 'Integrative Medicine'
 ''Plenty of studies now show that integrative medicine works very well. By that I mean the practice of medicine that reaffirms the importance of the relationship between practitioner and patient, and has a broader scope that includes therapies from conventional bioscientific medicine, as well as newer complementary approaches like acupuncture and chiropractic. For example, a study conducted at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York found that when women participated in a hypnosis session before breast surgery, they required less pain medication and experienced less nausea and emotional upset than the control group. Patients in the hypnosis group also cost the hospital $772 less overall. That's an example of how a simple technique can help patients and reduce costs.''
 Woodson Merrell, M.D., chairman, department of integrative medicine at Beth Israel Medical Center, New York 
 Pay to Treat Child Obesity
 ''We struggle constantly to get reimbursement for services at my clinic. This is terribly short-sighted. Society could spend one thousand dollars now for comprehensive medical care for an obese child, or it could spend one hundred thousand dollars later for that patient's coronary artery bypass surgery. Every insurance company figures it's not their problem: an obese kid will likely be with a different carrier by the time he or she starts to experience costly health complications.''
 David Ludwig, M.D., director, Optimal Weight for Life Program, Children's Hospital, Boston
 Stop Overtreating 
 ''There are some people who would benefit from more medical care, but there are many more who are getting too much. Excessive intervention is particularly rampant at the two extremes of health: those who are dying, for whom our aggressive care can be inhumane, and those who are well, in whom we feel increasingly compelled to look hard for things to be wrong. There are strong commercial interests in tapping this latter group as a new source of revenue. Screening scans, for instance, find more small cancers and early heart disease. Contracted definitions of what's normal label more people as having disease, such as hypertension and diabetes. And everyday experiences become entirely new diseases: difficulty sleeping becomes a sleep disorder, impaired sex drive becomes sexual dysfunction.''
 H. Gilbert Welch, M.D., professor of medicine, Dartmouth Institute of Health Policy and Clinical Practice, Lebanon, N.H.
 Restore the Humanity
 ''What's in jeopardy in medicine -- for a host of reasons -- is the human connection between doctor and patient. There are doctors in training now who do not want to do a physical exam; they just want the lab tests and the echo-cardiogram on a heart patient, for example. But the laying on of hands is a powerful tool in establishing trust and in healing. Doctors, patients and insurers alike should work together to recreate the familiarity, the warmth, the trust and the friendly alliances that used to define patient-caregiver relationships. If the health care profession would rediscover the power of the human relationship, we could bring about the kinds of lifestyle changes that would reduce disease big-time.''
 Edward Hallowell, M.D., a child and adult psychiatrist practicing in New York City and Sudbury, Mass., author of ''Married to Distraction'' (Ballantine Books, 2010)

HEADLINE: Deciding Who Will Lead a Health Care Leader

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
BOSTON -- Here in the cradle of health reform, where universal coverage was pioneered, this year's tightening race for governor is focused on the question that now confronts the nation: how to keep spiraling costs from bankrupting the experiment. 
 Four years ago, when Massachusetts enacted a health insurance plan that became a national template, state leaders deferred any serious discussion about controlling health care costs, with predictable results. While the law succeeded in insuring nearly all residents, the state had to raise taxes and trim benefits to preserve its essential contours. 
 As with the new federal plan, leaders of both parties here agree that expanded coverage cannot be sustained without arresting the growth of spending. But in what may be another preview for Washington, the campaign for governor has stirred a debate over how best to do that. 
 Three years into his first term, Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, has jolted the health care industry by proposing an aggressive, albeit temporary, solution. 
 Using untapped authority, he has directed his insurance commissioner to deny proposed health insurance premiums that are deemed ''unreasonable or excessive,'' starting April 1. Mr. Patrick, who took office just in time to implement the health care overhaul here, also has submitted a bill to allow state regulation of the fees that hospitals and doctors command from insurers. That is seen as an audacious move in a state where prestigious academic medical centers hold heavy sway over pricing. 
 Mr. Patrick's assertiveness is widely interpreted as a shot over the bow of his chief rival, Charles D. Baker Jr., a Republican who, as it happens, spent the last 10 years as chief executive of one of the state's largest insurers, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. 
 Emboldened by the January victory here of another Republican, Senator Scott Brown, Mr. Baker has been raising record sums, much of it from the health care industry, and has drawn nearly even with Mr. Patrick in recent polling. 
 As Mr. Baker gains standing, the governor has worked to remind voters of his opponent's role in an industry roundly vilified by the Obama administration. He asserted in an interview in his office that Mr. Baker had done little to control escalating premiums during his tenure at Harvard Pilgrim.
 ''It is actually somewhat dismaying the number of people who stand on the sidelines and root for failure, who could lift a finger, but don't, to help,'' Mr. Patrick said of Mr. Baker. ''You have to make powerful interests mad if you want to change the status quo. And I have never, ever seen any evidence from Charlie of a willingness to do that.''
 Mr. Patrick said his emergency measures would bring quick relief to individuals and small businesses as the state tries to spur its recovery. He said the price controls would be a bridge until the legislature could consider a second phase of restructuring.
 Mr. Baker, who has long called for more transparency in health care pricing, questioned why Mr. Patrick waited until his re-election year to tackle the problem.
 ''He's really late to the game,'' said Mr. Baker, formerly a top aide to two Republican governors. ''That's a long time to sit on your hands.''
 The Massachusetts race has taken shape in the shadow of the national debate, which produced a law that Mr. Patrick supports but Mr. Baker derides as ''a bad deal.''
 The contest has been complicated by the candidacy of the state treasurer, Timothy P. Cahill, who left the Democratic Party to run as an independent.
 Appealing to Mr. Brown's voters, Mr. Cahill charged this month that the Massachusetts health plan had ''blown a hole'' in the budget and warned that the federal changes would ''bankrupt this country within four years.''
 In 2006, Mr. Patrick's Republican predecessor, Mitt Romney, joined with Democratic lawmakers to enact legislation that required most residents to have insurance, offered subsidized coverage to those with low incomes, and set up an insurance exchange to encourage comparison shopping. But to preserve a fragile coalition of powerful stakeholders, state leaders put off the painful work of cutting costs, and the slumping economy made the problem worse.
 This year's state budget is out of balance by $295 million, partly because of rising health costs, meaning more cuts may lie ahead. Insurance premiums continue to grow far faster than inflation. State regulators are thinking about exempting more people from the insurance mandate because they cannot afford to buy policies.
 Despite Mr. Patrick's threat to deny unreasonable premiums, health insurers are seeking approval of increases from 7 percent to 34 percent. Mr. Patrick said he would use a medical inflation rate of 3.2 percent as a rough benchmark. ''It's a soft cap,'' he said. ''We're not going to be jerks about it.''
 Any relief would give the governor and legislature time to design and enact a ''global payment'' system that would reward doctors and hospitals for keeping patients healthy, rather than reimbursing for each office visit, test and procedure. That plan, recommended by a state commission, is designed to remove incentives for needless treatment, and would take five years to implement.
 Health insurers and providers predict market chaos if Mr. Patrick follows through and rejects rates. They warn that existing contracts with doctors and hospitals will be broken, leading to lawsuits. 
 ''Our concern,'' said Jay McQuaide, vice president at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, ''is that this be an actuarial review of the rates, not a political review of the rates.''
 Two of the state's four largest insurers lost money in 2009, and the others, including Harvard Pilgrim, posted only modest profits. Premium increases at Harvard Pilgrim generally have tracked the Massachusetts market during Mr. Baker's tenure, typically hovering around 10 percent a year. Mr. Baker, who made $1.7 million in his last full year, is widely credited with pulling the company back from the precipice of financial ruin.
 As secretary of health and human services under Gov. William F. Weld, a Republican, Mr. Baker oversaw deregulation of the health care industry in 1991, ending the state's last experiment with price-setting. Like other health insurance executives, he argues that Mr. Patrick's singling out of health insurers, a strategy plucked from the White House playbook, is misdirected. 
 He points to a recent investigation by Attorney General Martha Coakley that identified doctor and hospital prices as the main drivers of health care inflation. Ms. Coakley concluded that wide variations in prices paid by insurers to hospitals and physicians were related to providers' market leverage, but not to quality.
 Mr. Baker said he would demand that hospitals and doctors disclose their prices, and would generate savings by converting the state's Medicaid program to managed care. 
 With Mr. Baker faulting Mr. Patrick for inattention to the cost problem, the governor has set out to convey a sense of action. The doomsday talk from the industry is unfounded, he said.
 ''I think people are exaggerating to protect the status quo,'' he said. ''It's about time they got off their duffs and came in here and tried to solve this with a sense of urgency.''

HEADLINE: Some Tax Considerations to Keep in Mind for 2010

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
The discussion this tax season has been dominated by some big changes in tax and other laws. One allows some taxpayers to convert their regular retirement account to a Roth I.R.A., which would incur a tax bill now but the gains would then accumulate tax-free. Another is the expiration of the estate tax for 2010. And with the passage of the health care overhaul this week, there is now the prospect of surcharges for higher earners (though not until 2013). 
 With so much written on these bigger issues, I thought some people might forget a few -- albeit smaller -- tax considerations this year. 
 ENERGY CREDITS The government has long offered tax credits for green home improvements like solar panels. Those credits are still available at a deduction of 30 percent of the cost. But there is an additional credit this year of up to $1,500, or 30 percent of the cost, on more basic things that make your house more energy-efficient. These include new windows, doors, insulation or heating and cooling improvements. There is no income limit on this, but everything has to be installed by Dec. 31, 2010. 
 ''If someone is thinking about making an energy-efficient improvement, this is a time to do it,'' said Amy McAnarney, executive director of the Tax Institute at H&R Block in Kansas City, Mo. ''You just calculate the cost of the improvements and take up to 30 percent of that cost.''
 HOME SWAP One of the central concerns in the early part of the financial crisis was homeowners' ability to pay their mortgages. Now, the federal government is giving people a tax credit for buying a home. People who sell one home and buy another for less than $800,000 by April 30 (June 30 if you're in contract) will get a $6,500 tax credit. 
 There are four caveats to this: the total value of the house has to be under the limit (an $805,000 house would not qualify), the buyers' adjusted gross income has to be less than $245,000 a year for a couple, they have to have lived in their previous home for five of the last eight years and the new home can't be purchased from a family member. The credit started on Nov. 7, 2009. So if you swapped homes between then and the end of April and meet the other criteria, you qualify. 
 CAPITAL GAINS The capital gains debate is an old one, but good to repeat. As the law stands now, the long-term capital gains rate is set to rise to 20 percent, from 15 percent, next year. Congress has plenty of time to change this, but last year the same was said for lawmakers' ability to address to estate tax. 
 ''I view this as the last call to rebalance your portfolio at 15 percent,'' said David Hamar, a managing director at Silvercrest Asset Management. ''This has been around, but there are still people out there who haven't done it.''
 One particular area where people may be stuck is incentive stock options. If the options are set to expire, you have to exercise them. And to get the long-term capital gains rate, you need to hold them for at least one year. The consolation is that even if the rate rises next year, it is still lower than the short-term capital gains tax, which is the same as ordinary income.
 GIFT TRUSTS In the run-up in the stock market, a wildly popular device for passing money to heirs tax-free was a grantor retained annuity trust, or GRAT.
 One of the main benefits of these trusts was their short duration, often two years. This allowed the wealthy to put something they believed would go up in value into the trust -- from stock to a stake in a private company that was about to be sold -- and name a child or other heir as a beneficiary. The appreciated amount would pass to the heir, while the original value of the asset and a small amount of interest would come back to the person who set up the trust. 
 But on March 17, the House Ways and Means committee approved a bill that would increase the minimum length of a GRAT to 10 years. While there has been a lot of debate over the extension since President Obama took office, Don Weigandt, a managing director at J. P. Morgan Private Bank, said this change is part of a broader bill -- the Small Business and Infrastructure Jobs Tax Act of 2010 -- that is likely to pass. 
 ''We've been talking to a lot of clients about this, saying the time to be able to do GRATs in the most effective way is slowly leaking away from us,'' he said. Those who want to set up a shorter-duration trust have only until the date of the bill's enactment to do it. 
 CHARITY The other trusts widely used during the boom were charitable remainder trusts. These allowed people to put an asset in a trust -- usually a concentrated stock position -- and receive an annuity from it. The benefit to the taxpayer was an immediate gift tax deduction and deferral of the capital gains tax on the securities, and charities knew they would eventually receive the principal. 
 Those whose financial circumstances have changed, for better or worse, since setting up a charitable trust have a couple of options, said Jennifer Immel, senior wealth planner at PNC Wealth.
 One option for those who need money immediately is to ''collapse'' the trust. The asset would go directly to the charity and the grantor would receive back a sum equivalent to the present value of the future annuity stream. This would mean a higher tax bill, but it would give the grantor all the money now. 
 The other option is to ''accelerate'' the trust, which essentially means donating the income stream to the charity and getting a second gift deduction now. This would come in handy if someone faced a large tax bill for converting, say, a retirement account to a Roth I.R.A.. ''This could be a very creative way to offset some of that income,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Toyota Slows Production in Europe as Sales Lag

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Toyota Motor said on Friday that it would idle three plants in France and Britain for a total of 14 days to reduce inventory amid recent recalls and a slump in European sales. 
 The company, which was the world's biggest automaker by sales last year, will suspend output for four days in early April at its factory in Valenciennes, France, and for five days in May at its Burnaston and Deeside factories in Britain, according to a Toyota spokeswoman, Ririko Takeuchi.
 Toyota also plans to halt one of the two assembly lines at Burnaston for five days in early June, Ms. Takeuchi said. 
 Toyota has recalled 8.5 million vehicles worldwide over gas pedals that could stick or get caught under floor mats. Toyota has also recalled the latest model of its flagship Prius gas-electric hybrid car, as well as several other hybrid models, because of braking problems.
 The automaker is halting production in France because of a slowdown in sales after the recalls, Ms. Takeuchi said. Plans for the closures in Britain predated the recalls, as sales have been lackluster in Europe in the aftermath of the global economic crisis.
 Sales have slowed across the Continent as cash-for-clunkers programs have expired in several European countries. But the flurry of recalls have hurt Toyota's reputation for quality as well.
 Toyota sales in the European Union fell 20 percent in February from a year earlier, even though overall car sales rose 3 percent in the 16 countries that use the euro. In the United States, Toyota's sales fell 9 percent in February from the previous year. 
 The Toyota president, Akio Toyoda, testified in Washington before a Congressional committee last month over the company's handling of the recalls, which has been criticized as slow and inadequate. In Washington and elsewhere, Mr. Toyoda has promised to bolster quality controls at the automaker. 
 In February, Toyota said that it would form a global quality review committee to oversee quality and safety issues, and to ensure that recalls were carried out swiftly. The committee meets for the first time next week at Toyota's headquarters in Nagoya, Japan.
 Toyota said this week that it would review its production setup in Japan to stem looming losses.

HEADLINE: Gatsby Would Feel at Home

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER

 BODY:
KINGS POINT
''A COLOSSAL affair by any standard,'' was the way F. Scott Fitzgerald described a home in this village of 1,560 residences at the tip of the Great Neck peninsula, thinly veiled as West Egg in his 1925 novel ''The Great Gatsby.''
Nearly all of the 22 or so homes now under construction here -- as well as nine more expected to break ground this summer along the swampland bordering Manhasset Bay on Split Rock Road -- are mansions and estates like Gatsby's own pseudo-French mansion of an earlier era, extravagant anomalies in a recessionary landscape. 
And they may represent the tail end of a building boom that began here years ago and has proceeded apace despite the recession, said Richard A. Schilt, the village building inspector. He estimates that 60 jumbo homes have been built since 2005 -- 31 of them in the last two years.
Kouros Torkan, the owner of Villadom, a design-and-build firm in Great Neck, has five projects under way in Kings Point: a Tudor, two Mediterraneans, a Dutch colonial with a gambrel roof, and an Italianate villa.
Depending on land values, each 8,000-square-foot home on an acre lot costs $4 million to $6 million to build, Mr. Torkan said. For larger homes on more land, the range is $6 million to $10 million and up.
''The new construction has upgraded the overall values of the residential market,'' he added, calling Kings Point ''the strongest market on the North Shore for the past 15 years.'' Among the attractions he cited were the 25-minute commute via express train to Manhattan, the lush parks and the top-rated schools.
Yet, though he did mention a ''big turnaround in the last two to three months toward the better,'' Mr. Torkan says he expects ''a big decline'' in building over the next two years, because of the time involved in ''identifying a property, hiring an architect, having plans approved and building.''
Mr. Schilt concurs, saying that despite the buzz of saws and other evidence of construction, there are signs that the recession has not entirely missed the neighborhood. Applications for new construction to the local architectural review board have slowed, he said, with one to two new applications at each hearing this year, rather than the three to five received in the past.
Meanwhile, prices for knockdowns have slumped as far as $1.8 million from the low $2 millions, said Soheila Sharf, a local broker, adding that what used to fetch $3 million was going for a bit less. Most of the homes under construction, she said, broke ground before the real estate bubble burst.
According to Mr. Schilt, most of the current crop of new homes have one-acre lots and will thus take up 8,000 square feet, the maximum allotted for that size property. Most of the houses they are replacing, by contrast, were 3,500-square-foot ranches worth $2 million or more.
Among the latest giant knockdowns was the comedian Alan King's 6,457-square-foot Tudor showplace, which sold for $12.75 million in 2004. Built in 1926 by the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein, it stood on 2.39 acres with a pool, a tennis court, a private rocky beach and wraparound views of Manhasset Bay. Its replacement, Mr. Schilt said, will have 12,000 square feet above grade with an 11-car garage underneath. He described the plans as ''very esque'' -- a sort of colonial chateau with ''a little bit of this, a little of that.''
In the Hammerstein era, visitors included F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald as well as the singer Eddie Cantor. Mr. King, who knocked down a neighboring home to build a guesthouse, later had his own soirees, inviting the playwright Neil Simon and comedians like Billy Crystal, Buddy Hackett and Sid Caesar.
After a recent tour of the area, Prof. Steven L. Goldleaf, an expert on Fitzgerald at Pace University and the editor of the Pace University Press, said that the scrapping of older houses in favor of ''all this garish new construction, with tall pillars and archways and driveways and gates,'' was evocative of Gatsby, ''a conspicuous consumer of the 1920s, literally putting up a grand facade to impress and intimidate his neighbors.''
Ms. Sharf estimated that the new owner of the former King property, a local businessman whose family recently built other mansions in the village, would sink $30 million into the house.
John Kean, the Cold Spring Harbor-based builder on this project, said that despite the economy, the Kings Point market had been strong. ''It is a bright spot,'' he said.
Juliet balconies with curlicue iron railings are rife, along with huge columns and ornate appliques on limestone facades. A 28,000-square-foot home being built on a bend on the shoreline not far from the King place resembles a hotel. Inside, Mr. Schilt said, some of the homes have domed foyer ceilings, stone carvings, carved woodwork, gold leaf detailing, and amenities like warm-water-flushing toilets, which avoid condensation.
On a sliver of land next to the King place, on the site of a relatively small 40-year-old ranch, Marc B. Spector, an architect and principal with the Spector Group in Woodbury, said the foundations were in for a 10,000-square-foot natural stone-and-stucco home, ''a modern castle'' -- French with a touch of Gothic. Once built, the home could fetch $11 million or $12 million, he ventured.
''Waterfront in Kings Point is priceless,'' Mr. Spector said.
Many of those now having places built in Kings Point grew up here. Thirty years ago, David Chotan built luxury homes for an influx of Persian Jews. These days he is building mansions with ''smart'' technology and energy-efficient heating and cooling systems.
''Their children are maturing and they want to live close to Mama and Papa,'' Mr. Chotan said. ''They are also getting mansions. The good land is where the houses are already existing,'' he added, pointing out that more recently, those seeking custom castles have also included Asians.

HEADLINE: End the Unions' Sweetheart Deals

BYLINE: By ALFONSE D'AMATO

 BODY:
New York's painful fiscal crisis should be an opportunity to restructure state finances for the benefit of future generations. 
 First, our legislators must take a stand against special interests, particularly the public-sector unions. Their large checkbooks have made them equal-opportunity terrorizers, able to buy both Republicans and Democrats. Because of their influence, state workers last year avoided not only layoffs but even milder measures like a wage freeze similar to the one New York City employees negotiated to help the city recover from its fiscal crisis in 1975. 
 Such a freeze must now be on the table. And if state employee unions will not agree to a reasonable plan, the governor should exercise his power to lay off state employees to make up the difference.
 Thanks to the unions, New York has the highest overall pension cost per resident in the country. The creation of a fifth, less-generous tier in the state's pension plan, agreed on by the governor and the unions last year, will save the state as much as $48 billion dollars over the next 30 years. But that should be only the first step; another compelling option is to make state pension programs similar to a 401(k) plan, so that retirees can help take the state off the hook for exorbitant defined benefits.
 New York could also reap as much as $600 million in annual revenue by enforcing the law requiring the state to collect sales tax on cigarettes sold on Native American reservations. Why should New York be the state of tax evaders? 
 Finally, our short-term cash crunch would be eased if the state refinanced the interest rates on its tobacco-settlement bonds. Given current low long-term interest rates, this is preferable to Lt. Gov. Richard Ravitch's plan, under which the state would borrow $2 billion a year over three years for operations, leading us down a perilous road of annual borrowing. 
 These steps would not necessarily be popular -- but it is time for Albany to lead, not simply pander.

HEADLINE: Reaching the End of the Trail

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP. 
E-mail: generationb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
EVEN as I proposed the ski trip to my brother, I worried I was out of my mind. It had been eight years since I'd skied, and I'd never been very good. At my best, intermediate trails were a challenge. On top of this, my last ski trip with my three sons had been a disaster. My oldest, Ben, an eighth grader at the time, had gone barreling off the trail, hitting a tree. I spent one of the worst nights of my life as a father, in an emergency room in Albany, waiting to see if Ben's back was broken.
 There were many reasons not to ski again. I'm now in my late 50s, and though I jog four miles daily, it's on a flat beach. I wasn't sure my legs were still up to the twists and bumps of skiing. Would I break if I fell? Last summer, I'd had a stent put into my circumflex artery, and while I'm free to exercise normally, was skiing still normal for me? We were looking at Squaw Valley in California, a resort where trails reach 9,050 feet; would altitude be a problem? 
 And yet, hint as I did that this might not be wise, I couldn't find anyone to discourage me. When I mentioned my concerns to friends, they'd say things like, ''I know this guy John, he's 107, and he's still skiing double black diamond moguls.'' My neighbor Debbie said it's like riding a bike, it comes right back. My four kids thought it was about time that I left them alone and did something a little out there. My wife was supportive, even when I implied there was a question of whether I'd return alive. ''Better story if you don't,'' she said.
 Despite the worry, I had my reasons. Since the economic collapse, these last two winters in New York have felt particularly bleak to me. Too cold, too dark, too morose. Skiing might brighten the winter.
 Our family is changing; the three oldest are now out of the house. Instead of busying myself with their activities, I needed to rediscover some of my own. Skiing is something I did before kids. I learned fairly late. I had always assumed it was something someone like me would never do. And then, when I did it, it felt a little magical.
 To give that up without another try would not speak well for me.
 If I was too old, I needed the evidence.
 My angst, I think, was partly generational, and partly about my blue-collar roots. Growing up in Quincy, Mass., in the 1950s and '60s, I played mostly in the streets. Football, basketball, baseball and street hockey were my big four sports. It never would have occurred to me or my friends in our shipyard town to ask our parents for sports lessons.
 I taught myself to swim (badly) by flailing around at Wollaston Beach, for many years the grimmest, most polluted beach in Massachusetts. When it snowed, we sledded down the side streets that came to a dead end at Black's Creek.
 The only lessons I had as a child were piano lessons, and believe me, the $3 my determined mother forked over to Mrs. Donohue every Saturday morning for two years was a musical calamity.
 I didn't play Little League baseball until I was 11. My first basketball and tackle-football teams were in junior high. And by sophomore year, my school sports career was over: cut from the basketball team (I was 5-foot-7, on my way to 5-foot-8), too small for football (120 pounds) and no depth perception (Strike 3).
 At Harvard, where I first mixed with wealthier kids, it began to dawn on me that some must have had lessons -- the girls who slammed me around the tennis court, for example. But not until my junior year, when a girlfriend in the process of breaking my heart suggested I needed to learn to do new things, did it occur to me that maybe I did.
 It was embarrassing to go to an ice rink and have 5-year-olds whiz around me. But that winter, the Charles River froze solid, and midnights, when no one else was out, I taught myself to skate.
 I got a good bike and lightweight tent and took long-distance, overnight trips. I camped in St. John in the Virgin Islands and fell in love with snorkeling. I started running.
 But best of all, in my early 30s I learned to ski. My brother taught me, sort of. He took me to some modest New England mountain, showed me two basic moves -- French fries (go) and pizza (stop) -- and said that if I started barreling downhill out of control, to just fall over.
 It was glorious. There was so much blue sky and cerebral pleasure -- no matter how many were on the mountain, you had to figure your own way down. It gave me a sense of progress, learning leisure skills that my parents -- products of the Depression and World War II -- never contemplated. For exercise, they walked.
 This had a big impact on me when I had children. I wanted them to learn early and well so that they'd be spared the embarrassment that I'd felt by learning late and poorly. And I was not alone. As boomers moved from blue-collar to middle- and upper-middle-class, many of us had the same thought: Imagine if we'd started sooner, practiced more and played longer seasons. If only we had hitting lessons, soccer clinics, basketball camps, travel teams and expert coaching.
 We might have been really good.
 I should say none of this was as important to my wife, one of those boomer girls who did have lessons and played tennis at a Big Ten university.
 So I led the charge. Our four children took swimming lessons before they were 2, played Little League tee-ball at age 5, and joined C.Y.O. basketball and soccer teams by the second grade.
 I was on the verge of getting them to conquer skiing, when Ben had his accident. Thankfully, his back was not broken, but he was done with the slopes; that was our last family ski trip.
 All four turned out to be better athletes than I was, standouts on their high school teams, though none of them played in college, like their mother.
 Today the three boys' favorite sport is surfing, which of course they taught themselves. (In fairness to their dad, those early swim lessons, which made them strong in the water, deserve some credit.)
 Now it was my time again, and I intended to do this ski trip right. My brother and I rented a condo on the mountain so that we could ski on and off. I bought a new jacket, pants and goggles, and for the first time, a helmet.
 I was all nerves the first day. We'd picked Squaw Valley because there were plenty of lengthy beginner slopes for warming up. What I hadn't noticed from the map on the Internet was that the only trail to the bottom was a challenging 3.2-mile intermediate run. (You could ride the cable car down if your goal was total humiliation.)
 I started slow, focusing on not falling as I got off the lifts. I spent a ridiculous amount of time listening to whether my breathing was altitude-impaired.
 After a few beginner runs we were bored and onto intermediates. By the second day, we were at the top of the mountain, the wind howling as we took in the spectacular views of Lake Tahoe framed by a cloudless blue sky. I'd forgotten the exhilaration of standing on a peak, unable to see the trail below, and pushing off with faith that you'll cut the mountain down to your size.
 By the final afternoon, I was promising myself that if I'd just get in this last run without getting hurt, I'd be done. And then I'd get to the bottom, break my promise and go again.
 But there were other things I'd forgotten about skiing, like the pain of clumping around in ski boots, lugging all the equipment, dealing with the crowds and having people 40 years younger whiz by on both sides as I zigzagged down the mountain.
 And what a hack skier I truly am.
 I was glad I did it. It was unfinished business. But to be honest, I'm not sure I like it that much any more.

SINCE the beginning of time, political scandal has been an important source of nutrition for the press. And so it is for New York's ethnic newspapers. They often report such items, however, with a dual focus on the United States and their homelands. In the past month, a Caribbean paper analyzed the troubles of Representative Charles B. Rangel, an Indian newspaper pondered a New York politician's reaction to routine political misbehavior in India, and a Korean paper explored the struggles of Mr. Rangel and Gov. David A. Paterson through their impact on striving minorities -- like its own readers. KIRK SEMPLE
Congressman Charles Rangel: 
 A Friend of the Caribbean on Capitol Hill
 Should Rangel, who is 80 years old, be forced permanently from the chairmanship, it would be a significant blow to the Caribbean. It goes without saying that the entire United States would feel the loss. The dean of New York's Congressional delegation has been the champion of the poor for decades.
 ''We can always rely on him to listen to us and to be fair,'' said [Dr. Julian] Hunte [a former president of the United NationsGeneral Assembly]. ''The congressman helped us in significant ways and was routinely accessible to us from the Caribbean.''
 Some cases in point: Rangel:
 Led the legislative efforts on Capitol Hill to extend the life of the Caribbean Basin Initiative, whose provisions spurred economic growth in some Caribbean and Central American states.
 Sought to ensure that offshore financial services centers in the Caribbean, including Barbados, the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, Antigua and others, weren't singled out for unfair treatment in any legislative plan designed to curb tax evasion. His point was clear: the Caribbean islands must be treated the same way as Switzerland, Luxembourg, Ireland, Liechtenstein and France.
 Strongly criticized the Bush White House when it tried to browbeat Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica and their neighbors into endorsing the Washington-led Iraqi conflict.
 Rangel is a decent man. ... That he is being forced at this stage of his career to suffer the indignity of stepping aside reflects the corrosive atmosphere that's prevailing in Washington and elsewhere at this time.

 OUR LEGISLATORS BRING US SHAME 
 It did not surprise many Indians when some Rajya Sabha members the other day took away papers relating to Women's Reservation from the table of the chairman of Rajya Sabha and tore and tossed them. But one of my American friends, who happens to be a councilman in the city of New York, was stunned to watch it all happen. I was watching a TV channel beaming the news.
 My friend shrugged his shoulders in utter disbelief and wondered if it could happen in a legislature. I did not know what to say. I was simply ashamed. He asked if such incidents were common in Indian legislatures and I did not have the heart to tell lies. I said, ''Yes, such incidents are quite common.''
 I narrated to him a couple of such incidents and he seemed to be unwilling to believe that this could happen. Just as he was to leave, he turned to me and said, ''Professor, I have heard so much about India being a land of early civilization and Indians being quite cool and accommodating. But what I have seen today makes me quite uncomfortable. It should not happen in a civilized society.'' And I agreed with him; it should not happen in a civilized society. But I could not tell him that a large number of our legislators are yet to be civilized.

 NEW YORK BLACK POLITICIANS AT RISK, CORPORATE-SPONSORED PRIVATE TRIP, ETHICS TROUBLE 
 New York black politicians are at risk. David Paterson has dropped out of the New York governor's race and the well-known, pro-Korean Representative Charles B. Rangel announced that he would temporarily step down as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. The reason why they are politically struggling is because people are criticizing their ethics.
 ... ''It's frustrating to see black politicians, who have overcome difficulties to be where they are now, going down because of their ethics problems,'' said the president of Minkwon Center, Seung-Jin Jung. ''It is sad that they could not show much more leadership to become good role models for other minorities.''

HEADLINE: Illinois Democratic Party Chooses a Familiar Name as Lieutenant Governor Nominee

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- In the end, the winner of the Illinois Democratic Party's open audition to be the nominee for lieutenant governor was not one of the some 200 unknowns who had stepped forward, among them a brick salesman, a police officer and a violinist. Instead, party leaders on Saturday chose a name familiar across the state: Sheila Simon, the daughter of former Senator Paul Simon. 
 Ms. Simon, a 49-year-old lawyer and former City Council member in Carbondale, some 300 miles south of Chicago, will share the ticket led by Gov. Patrick J. Quinn, who was elevated from lieutenant governor last year after a corruption scandal engulfed his predecessor, Rod R. Blagojevich. Political experts said the choice seemed an effort to provide geographical balance for a ticket otherwise weighted toward Chicago, the state's largest city, and some inoculation (if that is possible) against the memory of the corruption scandal. 
 Ms. Simon, who had been endorsed by Mr. Quinn on Friday, won a vote of the state's central committee, made up of 38 top Democratic leaders. 
 Voters selected a Democratic nominee for the lieutenant governor in February: Scott L. Cohen, a pawnbroker and political unknown who had spent $2 million of his own money on his campaign. But, within days of the election Mr. Cohen resigned under pressure from party leaders after questions emerged over a domestic battery charge, unpaid child support and steroid use.
 Democratic leaders, who have battled a reputation for cronyism and back-room deals, announced that Mr. Cohen's replacement would be picked in a manner that seemed to turn its old reputation on its head. All who wished to apply should do so. Resumes would be posted online. Interviews would be done in public.
 Among the applicants was an array of expected candidates -- state lawmakers, mayors, county board members, convention delegates and former political candidates, including Ms. Simon. 
 But there were also scores of ordinary residents who had never sought office, people out of work, people fed up with politics as usual. On Saturday, a few said they were irked by the outcome, which, they said, proved that everything was just as it had always been. 
 ''If you're a family member or a friend, you're in,'' said Michael S. Rebresh, the owner of Mr. Chauffeur, a car service, who had applied. ''You get to smoke the same cigars they do. I had really thought that maybe they were going to do something different this time.''
 In November, Mr. Quinn and Ms. Simon will compete against Bill Brady, a state senator who is the Republican candidate for governor, and Jason Plummer, his running mate, a 27-year-old lumber company executive.

HEADLINE: Hobby Or Necessity?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
If you think this latest Israeli-American flap was just the same-old-same-old tiff over settlements, then you're clearly not paying attention -- which is how I'd describe a lot of Israelis, Arabs and American Jews today. 
 This tiff actually reflects a tectonic shift that has taken place beneath the surface of Israel-U.S. relations. I'd summarize it like this: In the last decade, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process -- for Israel -- has gone from being a necessity to a hobby. And in the last decade, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process -- for America -- has gone from being a hobby to a necessity. Therein lies the problem. 
 The collapse of the Oslo peace process, combined with the unilateral Israeli pullouts from Lebanon and Gaza -- which were followed not by peace but by rocket attacks by Hezbollah and Hamas on Israel -- decimated Israel's peace camp and the political parties aligned with it. 
 At the same time, Israel's erecting of a wall around the West Bank to prevent Palestinian suicide bombers from entering Israel (there have been no successful attacks since 2006), along with the rise of the high-tech industry in Israel -- which does a great deal of business digitally and over the Internet and is largely impervious to the day-to-day conflict -- has meant that even without peace, Israel can enjoy a very peaceful existence and a rising standard of living. 
 To put it another way, the collapse of the peace process, combined with the rise of the wall, combined with the rise of the Web, has made peacemaking with Palestinians much less of a necessity for Israel and much more of a hobby. Consciously or unconsciously, a lot more Israelis seem to believe they really can have it all: a Jewish state, a democratic state and a state in all of the Land of Israel, including the West Bank -- and peace.
 Why not? Newsweek's Dan Ephron wrote in the Jan. 11, 2010, issue: ''An improved security situation, a feeling that acceptance by Arabs no longer matters much, and a growing disaffection from politics generally have, for many Israelis, called into question the basic calculus that has driven the peace process. Instead of pining for peace, they're now asking: who needs it? ... Tourism hit a 10-year high in 2008. Astonishingly, the I.M.F. projected recently that Israel's G.D.P. will grow faster in 2010 than that of most other developed countries. In short, Israelis are enjoying a peace dividend without a peace agreement.''
 Now, in the same time period, America went from having only a small symbolic number of soldiers in the Middle East to running two wars there -- in Iraq and Afghanistan -- as well as a global struggle against violent Muslim extremists. With U.S. soldiers literally walking the Arab street -- and, therefore, more in need than ever of Muslim good will to protect themselves and defeat Muslim extremists -- Israeli-Palestinian peace has gone from being a post-cold-war hobby of U.S. diplomats to being a necessity. 
 Both Vice President Joe Biden and Gen. David Petraeus have been quoted recently as saying that the festering Israeli-Palestinian conflict foments anti-U.S. sentiments, because of the perception that America usually sides with Israel, and these sentiments are exploited by Al Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran to generate anti-Americanism that complicates life for our soldiers in the region. I wouldn't exaggerate this, but I would not dismiss it either.
 The issue that should make peacemaking a necessity rather than a hobby for both the U.S. and Israel is confronting a nuclear Iran. Unfortunately, Israel sees the question of preventing Iran from going nuclear as overriding and separate from the Palestinian issue, while the U.S. sees them as integrated. At a time when the U.S. is trying to galvanize a global coalition to confront Iran, at a time when Iran uses the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli conflict to embarrass pro-U.S. Arabs and extend its influence across the Muslim world, peace would be a strategic asset for America and Israel. 
 Ari Shavit, a columnist for the Israeli daily Haaretz, last week argued that Israel should adopt a more integrated view -- which he calls a ''Palestine-Iran-Palestine'' strategy: Israel should take the initiative with an overture to the Palestinians, which would make progress on that front easier, which would strengthen the U.S. coalition against Iran, which could ultimately weaken Tehran and its allies, Hamas and Hezbollah, which would open the way for more progress on the Palestine-Israel front. He suggests that Israel reach an interim agreement with Palestinians on the West Bank or even consider a partial, unilateral withdrawal there. 
 ''One way or another,'' said Shavit, ''Netanyahu should have made a genuine move on the Palestinian front that would have made genuine moves on the Iranian front possible, that would have made dealing with the core of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute possible at a later stage.'' 
 Indeed, Jerusalem, settlements, peace, Iran -- they're all connected and pretending you can treat some as a hobby and one as a necessity is an illusion.

HEADLINE: Palermo Privata

BYLINE: By JIM LEWIS

 BODY:
It sits on the north shore of Sicily on a fan-shaped stretch of land between two towering stone promontories, and it's been there, in one form or another, for almost 3,000 years. Empire after empire has trodden upon the place: Greeks, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans; then Vandals, Normans, Moors, Spaniards; then Italians, the United States Army; and since the end of World War II, Cosa Nostra, whose influence over the place is only recently waning. For millennia it's been built up and knocked down, robbed and bombed, patched up and left to fend for itself. So it is a spectral city, a city of ghosts and ruins, amid which the living citizens slip quietly and for the most part without expression; an inward city, not unkind but very private -- Italia insulare, as they call it. Palermo can be very beautiful, in a decaying, Hubert Robert way; on sunny days the sky overhead is Mediterranean enamel blue; the food is wondrous. But above all, Palermo is full of secrets and very strange. 
 Even notional comparisons are hard to come by and incomplete. Like Naples, Palermo is famous for its depredations, its crime and its unemployment; but Naples is far busier and more worldly. Like Havana, Palermo has the faint, heady air of isolation and rotting elegance. But Havana is wide open, a city seemingly without interiors, whereas Palermo is nothing but: for all its markets and sidewalk restaurants, it feels as if most of life takes place indoors, behind curtains. 
 Wandering through one of Palermo's outdoor markets one afternoon, I was hailed by a young man who asked me if I was Italian. I said no and he merely nodded, but he'd asked in English, so I stopped to chat with him. He had lived in California a decade or so before, and, judging from his black turtleneck and Iggy Pop haircut, time had simply stopped since he'd moved back. He presided over a small stall stocked with Sicilian staples: peppers and capers, fennel seed, infused olive oils, honey and homemade limoncello, but he seemed uninterested in selling me anything. We talked a bit. He shrugged matter-of-factly and said, ''It's like a third-world country around here.''
 ''Otherworldly'' might be more accurate. The city reminded me of nothing so much as Michelangelo Antonioni's movie ''L'avventura,'' in which some young friends camp out on a tiny Aeolian island, only to find in the morning that one of their group is missing, though there's no place she could have gone. They never do find her, the woman in the movie, and after a while no one wants to talk about it. Palermo is like that.
 Consider, for example, the Caravaggio. Fewer than 100 paintings have been attributed to the master, and one of them, a large, late-period Nativity, hung in Palermo's tiny Oratorio di San Lorenzo. The day I visited, there was a small orange tree in full fruit in the courtyard, and the place was so quiet that the young woman selling tickets almost jumped out of her skin when I knocked on the doorjamb. She pointed out a sad, photographic reproduction on the far wall and then left me: the Caravaggio was the jewel in Sicily's patrimony, and in 1969 it was stolen, by thieves who simply tore it from its frame. To this day no one knows who took it or where it is now -- whether it's hanging in someone's palazzo or stashed in a safe deposit box or whether, as one Mafia informant recently claimed, it was hidden by a crime boss in a barn on his property, where it was gnawed on by pigs and rats, and finally burned in a fit of culturecide. 
 Left behind in the San Lorenzo are a series of plaster sculptures by a Baroque artist named Giacomo Serpotta. They cover the walls and ceiling with three-dimensional allegories -- embodiments of the Virtues, scenes from the lives of saints -- a population of eddying stucco figures that look as if they'd emerged from swirls of vanilla frosting and then begun leaping and crawling, alive and addressing one another, like the figures in a Tiepolo ceiling painting come to life. They are not quite enough to make up for the missing masterpiece, but they're spectacular and eerie, and possessed of their own peculiar genius.
 Little is known about Serpotta. He was born in Sicily in the mid-17th century and may have never left; he's the kind of artist a city could boast about, but Palermo is not a place that boasts. It's a place that takes the bad with the better. When I went into the San Lorenzo, it was raining; I was thinking about the Caravaggio; the day was crabby and dour. By the time I left the church, I was thinking about Serpotta. A swift Mediterranean wind had blown the clouds off the island. Down the street I passed a music conservatory named for Vincenzo Bellini, housed in an old building whose windows had been flung open to catch the fresh air, and the sound of dozens of students playing scales and snatches of opera drifted over the street -- one of the world's most pleasing sounds.
 To get around the city, you walk. Public transportation is spotty and cabs are hard to come by, and it's a small place anyway, with a little more than 650,000 people. Besides, the side streets are barely wider than a man's outstretched arms, the piazzas so tiny they feel like courtyards, and all of it is a jumble. Each succeeding empire built upon the remains of the last; then, toward the end of World War II, the United States Air Force bombed the place, destroying a considerable part of the center, little of which has been repaired since, leaving gaping holes through which you can see layers of time. Everywhere there are ancient arches that lead nowhere, lintels supporting nothing, half-collapsed roofs, walls gouged with shrapnel and peppered with bullet holes, a half block razed down to its foundations, like an abandoned archaeological dig. It's not uncommon to see aged apartment buildings only half-occupied: one side reduced to rubble, the other occupied by families going about their lives. On the walls of buildings there is invariably graffiti, cryptic hollow-political slogans -- ''Masters of ourselves,'' ''You who have been warned, don't give up'' -- rendered simply in black spray paint and signed with the anarchists' encircled A, though the effect is more melancholy than fierce. 
 Every morning I would leave my hotel and start walking, choose a direction and get lost, wandering for hours, poking my head into stores and churches, looking for something, finding something else. On the western edge of town there is a catacomb, where exhumed bodies are stacked in an underground warren. You pay a fee to a fat Capuchin monk in dun-colored robes tied with a rope belt, head down a flight of stairs and gawk at row upon row of bodies, clothes over bones, that have been propped up on the wall. But aboveground, and for free, there's a small, overbuilt cemetery filled with elaborate tombs, each plastered with a dozen or so small photographic cameos, generations passed saying, Remember me, remember me. 
 Near the antiques stores that line the Corso Alberto Amedeo lies the Palazzo di Giustizia, an enormous courthouse designed in the 1930s in kind of a high fascist modern -- a fearsome thing when it was built, now mostly an architectural curiosity that lies sun-raked like the empty piazze in a de Chirico. Down by the Vucciria, the city's great seafood and produce market, I stopped to eat in a restaurant called Trattoria Da Toto. When I asked to see a menu, the waiter hastily scribbled some words on a piece of paper and showed it to me. I chose a generic frutti di mare and received, a few minutes later, a glass of plonk and a dish, consisting of a very dense, oily spaghetti scattered with mussels, squid, baby octopus and other intensely flavored sea creatures. I polished it off without interruption, my only company a small piebald tomcat who begged cartoonishly at my ankles.
 It was that way everywhere: Palermitani do not pander. You don't get hustled; you don't get hassled; no one volunteers charming anecdotes or touristy pointers; no one asks where you're from. Palermo is for loners, misanthropes, the faintly morbid, the fatalistic.
 One can hardly talk about Sicily without talking about the Mafia, which ran the place for the latter half of the last century and still have a hand in, though how much is anyone's guess. Law enforcement estimates that 80 percent of businesses in town continue to pay some sort of kickback to organized crime. 
 In the early '80s, the Italian government began a concerted effort to eradicate the mob, and for a while there was something like open warfare. Dead bodies of suspected informants were routinely found in parked cars, and in 1992 two prominent Italian judges, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, were assassinated by bomb attacks. A huge roundup and trial followed, but the Mafia has been more muted than silenced permanently; a more recent wave of arrests is in full swing. The week I was there the police captured Gianni Nicchi, a 29-year-old fugitive who is believed to be Cosa Nostra's second in command. Still, you needn't be alarmed; the worst of it is pretty much over, and the casual visitor will notice nothing untoward at all.
 Moreover, the ebb and flow of organized crime has provided an opportunity for a new kind of ethical tourism. In 2004, a few young and very brave locals decided they'd had enough and started a remarkable movement called Addiopizzo. Pizzo is the local word for extortion, and they simply refuse to pay it. Thus far, about 400 businesses have joined them. I stopped in one, a store named Punto Pizzo Free, run by Fabio Messina. ''It's starting to change,'' he told me. ''But the Mafia is 100, 120 years old, and we've only been fighting them for five years. So there's a long way to go.'' And how was the movement's recruiting going? Well enough, he indicated, but there are still holdouts. ''Many people say, 'Mafia? What's Mafia?' They say, 'What's pizzo? I never paid.' '' He smiled. ''Then you know they've been paying for years.''
 It's a subdued city. At night there's little going on, except for dinner, which starts quite late: the restaurants don't begin filling up until around 10:30. Walking back to my hotel, I would occasionally pass an American-style bar, stocked with locals engaged in what seemed like an elaborate imitation of high life. Otherwise the streets were empty.
 Then came Saturday, and with it the first real smiles I saw all week. It started with a few kids on scooters hanging out in the Piazza Ruggero Settimo, a grand square that serves as the city center. By evening there were dozens of them, sitting on the benches, laughing it up, making out. Then suddenly the streets were filled, the Via della Liberta, a grand boulevard stretching north from the piazza, teeming with sleek-looking men and women, the cafes crowded, noise everywhere, scooters revving -- and outdoor televisions tuned to an important soccer game, Juventus versus Inter Milan. Make no mistake, Palermo is not in any way chic or hip, nor is it meant to be. But on that Saturday night, the residents had dressed themselves up and come out, and they were having a high time.
 The following morning, all was quiet again. In the old city, I came across a small flea market in the Piazza Marina, where one could buy little fragments of antique Sicilian detritus: painted tiles salvaged 
 from abandoned buildings, lire notes, old cigarette cases and jewelry boxes. But by 2 in the afternoon, the merchants had packed up and gone home, leaving the streets empty, the restaurants closed. Outside the Botanical Garden, a pair of dilapidated mossy stone sphinxes stood sentry. There's nothing so quiet as a small city on a Sunday, nor any place quite as endearing, and I was glad it was my last glimpse of Palermo. Riding out to the airport just before dawn the next morning, 
 I saw a single word emerge out of the darkness, spray-painted on the stanchion of an overpass in the same black writing I'd been seeing all week, but it was the only one in English, and the only one that wasn't angry. ''Love,'' it said.

HEADLINE: Making Haiti Whole

 BODY:
A donors' conference at the United Nations this Wednesday is meant to be the beginning of the long, slow birth of a new Haiti. Representatives of the Haitian government, the United States and other nations and aid organizations will be discussing large, ambitious, farsighted plans. Participants will be asked for lots of money: $11.5 billion to start, $34.4 billion over 10 years.
 That is a large investment for a small country, but it is not all Haiti needs. For this to succeed, the commitments made this week will need to be sustained for many years, and the rebuilding will need to clear away more than just rubble. 
 It will need to sweep out the old, bad ways of doing things, not only those of the infamously corrupt and hapless government, but also of aid and development agencies, whose nurturing of Haiti has been a manifest failure for more than half a century. 
 The good news is that even before the Jan. 12 earthquake, international donors had largely reached a consensus on what they had done wrong, and how to get Haiti right. Their conclusions are reflected in the plans to be presented this week, with ideas like these:
 TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY, EFFECTIVENESS No donor wants to pour more cash down a Haiti sinkhole, or to fritter it away in small-bore projects that do not accomplish much. The plan envisions a multidonor trust fund managed by the World Bank that pools money for big projects and avoids wasteful redundancy. 
 The Haitian Development Authority would approve the projects; outside auditors would oversee the spending. There also is a parallel idea, in which certain donors choose just one area to focus all their efforts -- reconstructing government buildings, say, or fixing the power grid. That promises to be an effective way to eliminate the curse of inefficiency.
 HAITIAN INVOLVEMENT Haiti is Haiti's problem, for Haitians to solve with the help of the rest of the world. The rebuilding must involve genuine, not token, engagement by the Haitian government and civil society. 
 Previous efforts by aid organizations to entirely avoid the control -- and corruption -- of the government were an understandable impulse, but had the unwanted effect of undermining the effectiveness and credibility of the Haitian state. 
 The new plan proposes an interim recovery commission of Haitians and non-Haitians, which would eventually evolve into a Haitian Development Authority that answers to the prime minister. 
 If it works, Haiti might no longer have to rely on freelance charities roaming the country, doing scattershot good works that cannot be sustained. Relief agencies have also recently been hiring thousands of Haitians to clear rubble. The country needs much more of that strategy, in other areas like reforestation and reconstruction, to boost not just employment but also the skills of the work force.
 SELF-SUFFICIENCY Haitians need seeds and fertilizer more than bags of charity groceries. President Bill Clinton recently confessed that United States trade policies in his tenure did more to help rice farmers in Arkansas than those in Haiti. 
 Haiti now enjoys generous access to the American market, which should be continued and expanded. As many experts have pointed out, modest investments in the garment industry, and trade preferences for it, could swiftly employ many thousands of Haitians and accelerate foreign investment. 
 TAPPING THE DIASPORA Haiti does have a large, successful professional class -- entrepreneurs, doctors, lawyers, teachers and administrators. It just happens to live in Brooklyn, Miami, Boston, Canada and other places. Many of its members are eager to go back to Haiti to help. 
 They could do so far more easily if their governments subsidized their salaries when they moved. Such paid furloughs would quickly supply Haiti with people of great expertise, language skills and deep commitment to the rebuilding. 
 DECENTRALIZATION There are too many people in Port-au-Prince. Haiti needs new population centers, less congested and more vibrant. The failure to build safe housing for earthquake survivors is a continuing tragedy; the time to start fixing it is now, far from the capital. 
 The paradox being confronted on Wednesday is how to rebuild a country that was never properly built in the first place. Haiti may yet escape the crushing legacy of its tragic history, propelled by the opportunity that this latest tragedy creates. The government of President Rene Preval has not inspired confidence in its handling of the relief effort, but it has a chance to shake off its inertia and show it wants to get the rebuilding right, beginning this week.

Re ''The Acorn Sting Revisited'' (March 21): 
 I marvel at the level of naivete that you show. It wasn't that Acorn was a criminal organization to conservatives -- they wanted to make it appear to be so because they thought that Acorn's core mission helped the Democratic Party. Having ballot initiatives along with voter registration drives got notoriously low-voting Democrats to the polls and helped Democratic candidates. Once Acorn showed some success in Florida with the minimum-wage ballot initiative, it became a target to the conservative media. All soon took up the hue and cry in order to make Acorn appear criminal, whether it was or not. 
 I fault the Times and other media outlets for not being more skeptical. The loser in this whole sorry episode is not Acorn but the low-income people that depended on its help in many areas like health care, taxes and legal assistance.
 MELANIE JARAMILLO 
 Okemos, Mich., March 21, 2010
 Your response on the Acorn story boils down to this: Some Acorn employees probably said some stupid things to a couple of right-wingers visiting their offices under false pretenses. Big deal. By focusing on this alone, your reporting, in essence, is saying that Acorn's fate is deserved. 
 But what organization doesn't have some clunkers among its employees? I can think of a few bank C.E.O.'s who would qualify. At least in the case of Acorn, no laws were broken and no economy destroyed. You are caving to the dominance of the so-called conservative media to decide what is a ''scandal'' and what news stories get traction. 
 If this is such a big story, why not broaden it? Why not assign one of the many reporters to work on this story for the paper to demand to see the full unedited videos? Why not get some crusading young person to infiltrate James O'Keefe's little troupe to see what they can turn up. These are the new Watergate burglars.
 WILLIAM E. ROSENTHAL
 South Orange, N.J., March 21, 2010
 Clark Hoyt: I would never recommend that The Times ''infiltrate'' O'Keefe's operation. The paper's ethics guidelines require staff members to disclose their identities in such situations, and forbid them to pose, as O'Keefe did, as something they are not. (The guidelines also forbid something else that he did: recording someone without their consent.) I think the paper should have asked for the full, unedited videos. When I asked for them, Andrew Breitbart, who operates the Web site where the videos reside, said he intended to make them public someday but was looking for a splashy way to do it, to call still more attention to the issue.
 Theft and Competition
 Re ''Journalistic Shoplifting'' (March 7):
 I'm confused. If you're a subscriber to the wire services, you're entitled to take their material and use it as you wish. When I worked for Reuters, my reporting would routinely get lifted verbatim and wind up in many, many newspapers without attribution. I don't believe anyone ''shoplifted'' my stories or victimized Reuters. That's why you buy the service. 
 It's also naive to assume that reporters shouldn't use other publications' material, either to spark off their own work, or to match a story and take it forward. That isn't plagiarism; it's being competitive.
 Maybe you're being a little overwrought about all this.
 SARAH DAVISON
 New Delhi, March 7, 2010
 Clark Hoyt: Times reporters are not permitted to take reporting from wire services and insert it verbatim into articles without credit. The paper's integrity guidelines say that facts gathered by any other organization must be attributed. The guidelines say that, when possible, facts should be independently verified. Readers have a right to expect that The Times has done its own reporting, and it has an obligation to note where it is relying on the work of others. As for sparking off the work of others and pushing a story forward with original reporting, that's good old-fashioned competition.
 At the Kent School of Social Work at the University of Louisville -- and I presume academic units in many places -- we employ such tools as SafeAssign and other safeguards to help prevent the problem of plagiarism. We encourage and sometimes require students to check their work for plagiarism through this fairly powerful tool before handing in assignments, recognizing that the faculty will do the same following submission. It is not foolproof, but we have found that it minimizes plagiarism in profound ways. 
 Students are taught to be better writers and gain a better understanding of citing sources, while avoiding careless note-taking. Would it not make sense for The New York Times and other news sources to use these tools to ensure a better product? 
 TERRY L. SINGER
 Louisville, Ky., March 7, 2010
 The writer is the dean of the Kent School of Social Work.
 Clark Hoyt: The Times has looked into plagiarism-detection software a dozen times over the years, according to Terry Schwadron, the editor for information and technology. He said it has always been rejected, in part because it is not reliable enough. A test run on plagiarized articles by Jayson Blair, for example, failed to detect all the stolen passages. He said the software also slows the work flow because it produces many false positive results, like quotes from newsmakers reported in many places, that have to be checked out. Craig Silverman, the editor of Regret the Error, a Web site that reports on accuracy and honesty in the press, thinks journalists may resist the software because they think its use assumes guilt. I think The Times should keep working with the makers of the software to find a workable solution. You can read a fuller discussion of the issue by Silverman at pbs.org/mediashift/.
 Shifting Labels
 Re ''Lost in the Shorthand'' (March 14):
 I agree that turning generic descriptors such as moderate, liberal and conservative into nouns is lazy and often an error. First, most generalizations break down when applied to specific issues. Second, with time things change, making such labels quickly anachronisms. For example, the American Federalists of 1787 were philosophically very different from the same American Federalists who resisted both the War of 1812 and federalism in general.
 But for ''neoconservatives'' like Robert Kagan to complain about being inappropriately labeled makes little sense. Neoconservatives, circa 2003, were not required to be ''leftists who switched to the right''; for Kagan to lump neoconservatives into a ''progressive'' tradition is not only illogical, but misleading.

HEADLINE: Google Searches for a Foreign Policy

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When Google announced last week that it would shut its censored online search service in China, it was doing more than standing up to a repressive government: it was showing that, with the United States still struggling to develop a foreign policy for the digital age, Internet companies need to articulate their own foreign policies.
 Google is hardly the first American company to stray into the State Department's bailiwick. Since the bad old days of the United Fruit Company in Latin America, powerful multinationals have conducted themselves like quasi-states, influencing the foreign lands in which they operate by deciding whether to accommodate or resist the unsavory practices of authorities there. 
 For Internet companies, that choice has been sharpened by the fact that the World Wide Web is no longer just a force for freedom and diversity but also a tool for repression. Governments use it to spy on dissidents, human rights activists, and other troublesome elements.
 This change happened so fast that it left the foreign policy establishment gasping to catch up. It also exposed Washington's deep ambivalence about information technology: while it champions the free flow of ideas in closed societies like Iran, it fears being a target for cyber-attacks by hostile governments and doesn't want to export technology that could be diverted into military uses. Conflicted and confused, Foggy Bottom has little to offer Silicon Valley by way of support or even guidance.
 ''What forces Google to have a foreign policy is that what they're exporting isn't a product or a service, it's a freedom,'' said Clay Shirky, who teaches at New York University and writes about the Internet's social effects. ''The question is, 'Are they going to be United Fruit?' '' For Google, the sinister side of China's cyberpolicy eventually came to outweigh the economic attraction of China's market and the putative benefit of opening the Internet to a vast audience.
 If the folks at Google were diplomats instead of ''digirati,'' one might say their view of the Internet had evolved from Woodrow Wilson's idealistic notion that independent countries tend toward democracy to the realpolitik understanding that their interests simply differ from your own. But seen another way, the company's decision to stop censoring pushes it farther away from the moral neutralism of United Fruit, showing that it is no longer willing to collude with a restrictive system in pursuit of profits.
 The choice was not easy. Since late 2006, when it entered China, Google argued that a censored search service was better than no search service at all. But after it discovered that its network had been hacked from inside China, and that the Gmail accounts of human rights activists had been infiltrated, that tradeoff no longer seemed defensible. This ''goes to the heart of a much larger global debate about freedom of speech,'' Google's chief legal officer, David Drummond, said in a post explaining the company's thinking.
 As if on cue, the Obama administration made its first major statement on Internet freedom. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said the Internet could be a force for good or ill and encouraged governments to use it for good, while urging American companies not to knuckle under to censorship. But she left the work of navigating restrictions to the companies.
 That navigation gets harder by the day, said Mark Palmer, a former United States ambassador to Hungary who has started independent TV stations in Eastern Europe. ''There are more than 40 countries that restrict the Internet,'' he said. ''The State Department and the Treasury Department have not come to grips with it.''
 The Treasury did recently begin allowing firms to export free online services like instant messaging, chat and photo sharing to Iran, Sudan, and Cuba. Having watched the impetus that Twitter and Facebook gave to antigovernment protests in Tehran, the administration wanted more of it. But the difficult-to-jam high-speed satellite Internet service that Iran's dissidents also crave remains unavailable because of sanctions intended to retard Iran's nuclear program.
 The State Department is encouraging the development of technologies that enable users to circumvent restrictions on the Internet. But advocates for some startups said that the government had not allotted enough money or steered support to the most promising ventures. And the United States lacks a uniform policy for dealing with American companies that export software that governments can use to filter the Internet.
 Google's problems are not just with repressive regimes. Last month, an Italian court convicted Mr. Drummond and two colleagues of breaking privacy laws after a video of an autistic boy being bullied was posted on Google's network.
 Google's showdown with Beijing, analysts said, is driven in part by its fear of similar lawsuits from China. Google also wants the United States to treat Internet censorship as a trade barrier that influences decisions on foreign aid.
 Not all tech companies share Google's fervor. Microsoft remains in China, running a government-censored search engine. Its founder, Bill Gates, said in January that companies needed to decide if they are going to obey the rules of the countries in which they operate, although Microsoft says that it, too, pushes back.
 Mr. Shirky says he sees a generational divide. ''It's no accident,'' he said, ''that Microsoft was founded during the cold war while Google was founded after the cold war.'' While Microsoft has a mentality in which national sovereignty still trumps ethical arguments, he said, Google is trying to balance the rights of sovereignty against its own evolving set of values.

HEADLINE: A Push to Eat Local Food Is Hampered by a Shortage

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

 BODY:
EAST MONTPELIER, Vt. -- Erica Zimmerman and her husband spent months pasture-raising pigs on their farm here, but when the time came to take them to slaughter, an overbooked facility canceled their appointment. 
 With the herd in prime condition, and the couple lacking food and space to keep them, they frantically called slaughterhouses throughout the state. After several days they found an opening, but their experience highlights a growing problem for small farmers here and across the nation: too few slaughterhouses to meet the growing demand for locally raised meat. 
 In what could be a major setback for America's local-food movement, championed by so-called locavores, independent farmers around the country say they are forced to make slaughter appointments before animals are born and to drive hundreds of miles to facilities, adding to their costs and causing stress to livestock.
 As a result, they are scaling back on plans to expand their farms because local processors cannot handle any more animals. 
 ''It's pretty clear there needs to be attention paid to this,'' Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in an interview. ''Particularly in the Northeast, where there is indeed a backlog and lengthy wait for slaughter facilities.''
 According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the number of slaughterhouses nationwide declined to 809 in 2008 from 1,211 in 1992, while the number of small farmers has increased by 108,000 in the past five years. 
 Fewer slaughterhouses to process local meat means less of it in butcher shops, grocery stores and restaurants. Chefs throughout the Northeast are partnering with farms to add locally-raised meat to their menus, satisfying a customer demand. But it is not always easy.
 ''There are a lot of people out there who raise great animals for us to use, and they don't have the opportunity to get them to us because the slaughterhouses are going away,'' said Bill Telepan, chef and owner of Telepan, a high-end restaurant in New York. 
 Mr. Telepan's veal supplier, Duane Merrill of Walton, N.Y., said there was no slaughterhouse in Delaware County, ''and it's the size of Rhode Island.'' Mr. Merrill said he also had difficulty finding adequate transport for veal cattle down to New York City.
 Brian Moyer, director of Rural Vermont, a nonprofit farm advocacy group, uses the image of an hourglass. ''At the top of the hourglass we've got the farmers,'' he said, ''the bottom part is consumers and in the middle, what's straining those grains of sand, is the infrastructure that's lacking.'' 
 Vermont, a locavore's paradise, is seeing increased demand for the facilities from both small-scale meat producers and dairy farmers, who are facing some of the lowest milk prices in years and are trying to diversify with beef cattle. 
 ''People are trying to figure out how to get a little more money out of their herds,'' said Randy Quenneville, program chief for the Vermont meat inspection service. ''And with the interest in stuff being local, wanting to know where their food is coming from and how it was raised, there are more people looking to do this.''
 The state has seven operating slaughterhouses, down from around 25 in the mid-1980s, Mr. Quenneville said. One is a state-inspected facility, meaning that meat inspected there cannot be sold over state lines. 
 Two slaughterhouses recently closed, one destroyed by a fire and the other shuttered because of animal cruelty charges. The closed facility is expected to reopen soon.
 Mr. Quenneville said a number of small, family-owned slaughterhouses started closing when strict federal rules regarding health control went into effect in 1999. Large corporations like Cargill also began to take over much of the nation's meat market. 
 He and Mr. Vilsack are both urging farmers to band together and open local cooperatives or mobile slaughter facilities. The Agriculture Department is financing some mobile units and helping to build a regional facility near the Quad Cities in Illinois and Iowa. Helping small farmers, Mr. Vilsack said, will improve struggling rural economies. 
 ''We recognize that the buy-local food movement is a significant economic driver in rural communities,'' he said.
 But building a regional facility is not always easy. As the locavore movement and self-butchering movements grow, so do cries of ''Not in my backyard.'' 
 Some residents in the quaint town of Woodstock, Vt., raised more than $1 million to buy a water buffalo farm whose owner wanted to convert it into a slaughterhouse. Some said the facility would have been too big for the town. Vince Galluccio, who helped organize opposition, was concerned that waste from the proposed plant's feed lot and manure piles would run down a hill and into town. Now the owners plan to turn the property into a dairy farm and educational center. 
 Mr. Galluccio says the state needs more slaughterhouses and hopes to help build one that would be a better fit for the community. ''We're not against slaughterhouses,'' Mr. Galluccio said. ''But you wouldn't open up a discotheque next to a church.'' 
 Some would not open a ''slaughterhouse'' anywhere, preferring to discard the term in favor of the French ''abattoir.'' There are hurdles, whatever the name. 
 ''You need skilled management and work force, a cooperative town, a good supply of water, a good way of getting rid of waste,'' said Ed Maltby, a spokesman for Adams Farm, a slaughterhouse in Athol, Mass., that reopened in 2008 after a fire. ''It's not a problem that can be easily solved.''
 The mobile units have been popular for poultry, and many farmers are trying to replicate the system with larger animals. Cheryl Ouellette, a farmer from Tacoma, Wash., known as ''the pig lady,'' helped secure a U.S.D.A.-certified mobile processing unit with $250,000 in local conservation money. It opened in August and expects to process 10 animals -- mostly cows, pigs and sheep -- each day. 
 In Washington, Ms. Ouellette said, some farmers were driving animals more than 300 miles to slaughter. ''Farmers had problems, butchers couldn't get U.S.D.A. carcasses to sell in meat cases, and chefs couldn't get local meat,'' she said. ''Here there are no small processing facilities left for that food to get into commerce.'' 
 The mobile unit goes from farm to farm with a U.S.D.A.-approved butcher and inspector aboard. It contains heaters, potable water and dumps wastewater at RV stations. 
 Ms. Zimmerman and her husband, Kevin McCollister, would like to see the rules relaxed on farm slaughter. Their slaughterhouse is an hour and a half away -- long enough for the pigs to be stressed and not in optimal shape for processing, Ms. Zimmerman said. 
 ''We have a product that people really wanted; we should have a system that would allow us to produce it as efficiently as possible,'' Ms. Zimmerman said. ''There's not enough room for all the people like me.''

HEADLINE: Carrots, Sticks And Lower Premiums

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
FOR all the debate lately, one basic fact about America's health care crisis is rarely mentioned. Namely, the one thing that could really reform health care is you, collectively speaking: People living healthier lives.
 The statistical evidence has been clear for years, but it bears repeating. Studies show that 50 percent to 70 percent of the nation's health care costs are preventable. Much of that expense goes to treat a few chronic conditions that are closely linked to behavior, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and cancer. Bad genes and bad luck matter, of course. But behavior -- exercise and choice of diet -- matters most.
 So why not pay people to live healthier lives? In fact, a fledgling ''pay for prevention'' industry is beginning to emerge, offering employers ways to reward workers with cash or reduced insurance premiums for exercising more and eating wisely. Among the industry's early entries are RedBrick Health, Tangerine Wellness and Virgin HealthMiles. 
 And some big companies, like Safeway and General Electric, are experimenting on their own with financial incentives to prod employees to adopt healthy habits or to drop bad ones. (At G.E., smokers pay an extra $625 a year.)
 While just under way, the drive to align financial incentives with healthy behavior seems promising, experts say. ''If this were the Olympics, it would be a demonstration sport -- not there yet, but clearly coming,'' said Dr. David J. Brailer, chairman of Health Evolution Partners, a private equity fund, which has not invested in a health-incentive management company to date. 
 And some early research in behavioral economics suggests that financial incentives can be used to essentially kick-start healthy habits that then become self-sustaining, according to Gary B. Charness, an economist at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
 That certainly seems to be how things worked out for Mona Ellender, 55, a database administrator who lives in Metairie, La. At the end of 2008, her employer, Ochsner Health System, which operates seven hospitals and 35 clinics in southeastern Louisiana, adopted a health incentive program designed and managed by Virgin HealthMiles, part of the Virgin Group. 
 The Virgin formula focuses mainly on promoting physical activity, which can be measured using pedometers, accelerometers or heart-rate monitors. Online tools are important. Personal activity data is uploaded from the activity-tracking devices into an individual's account on the Web. A general Web site includes health and dietary tips. Contests and online chat are part of the mix.
 Yet what first got her attention, Ms. Ellender concedes, was the money. Under the program, her premium payments for health insurance for her and her husband drop by more than $100 a month if she attains her activity goals. 
 But soon, Ms. Ellender says, the main appeal became the improvements she was observing in her energy, appearance and weight. She says she walks a lot more than she used to, including 30 minutes during her lunch break and often after work. She attends an aerobics class most every day, she says. And she tracks her progress online daily. In 15 months, Ms. Ellender's cholesterol level has fallen sharply. She has lost 40 pounds and intends to lose 14 more.
 ''It's made a big difference in my life,'' she says.
 Her employer is pleased as well. After rising steadily for years, health insurance claims fell 5 percent last year for Ochsner, says Susan Piglia, director of corporate programs.
 It is the long-term trends -- not a year or two -- that matter most in health. But the health-incentive management companies do seem to be off to a good start. The employee participation rates in their programs -- all are voluntary -- are typically in the 50 to 80 percent range, far higher than for traditional wellness programs, which do not include financial incentives.
 Virgin HealthMiles, RedBrick Health and Tangerine Wellness use somewhat different approaches. Still, there are some common lessons from their few years of experience.
 In modifying health behavior, they say, rewards trump punishment. A person who does poorly in a program, for example, loses a chance to save money, but there are no penalty payments, only encouragement to convert to healthy habits. ''The carrot definitely works better than the stick,'' says Aaron Day, chief executive of Tangerine Wellness. 
 (Some companies are offering cash carrots to smokers. Edelman, a big public relations firm, pays more than $500 to smokers who quit.)
 Markets thrive on good information and good incentives. The market for personal health, it seems, lacks both. RedBrick Health was founded in 2006, with an eye toward having incentives focused on health instead of just cost savings.
 Kyle Rolfing, the chief executive, was previously a founder of Definity Health, a pioneer in developing consumer-driven spending plans like health reimbursement accounts and health spending accounts, known as H.R.A.'s and H.S.A.'s. (Definity was sold to UnitedHealth in 2004.) The rationale behind the high-deductible plans has been that if people spend more of their own money, they will be more price-conscious consumers of health care.
 The problem with H.R.A.'s and H.S.A.'s alone, Mr. Rolfing says, is that people do opt for less costly care but not better health. ''The real goal is to get accountability about health and wellness at the individual level,'' he says. ''So the incentive -- the return on investment -- should be at the individual level as well.''
 PERSONAL health decisions also suffer from an information gap. The gratification for eating rich desserts is immediate, while the health consequences, if any, are well into the future. But online tracking and affordable digital devices, like pedometers, to collect timely data are beginning to close the information gap. At the least, users can constantly check measures of activity and calorie counts that are clearly linked to health.
 ''We're trying to create the good-driver discount for health,'' explains Sean Forbes, president of Virgin HealthMiles. ''One reason that's been so difficult is there's never been a way to really measure things before, but that is changing because of technology.''

HEADLINE: Quake Accentuated a Chasm That Has Long Defined Haiti

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Grant Fuller contributed reporting.

 BODY:
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- The lights of the casino above this wrecked city beckoned as gamblers in freshly pressed clothes streamed to the roulette table and slot machines. In a restaurant nearby, diners quaffed Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Champagne and ate New Zealand lamb chops at prices rivaling those in Manhattan.
 A few yards away, hundreds of families displaced by the earthquake languished under tents and tarps, bathing themselves from buckets and relieving themselves in the street as barefoot children frolicked on pavement strewn with garbage. 
 This is the Petionville district of Port-au-Prince, a hillside bastion of Haiti's well-heeled where a mangled sense of normalcy has taken hold after the earthquake in January. Business is bustling at the lavish boutiques, restaurants and nightclubs that have reopened in the breezy hills above the capital, while thousands of homeless and hungry people camp in the streets around them, sometimes literally on their doorstep. 
 ''The rich people sometimes need to step over us to get inside,'' said Judith Pierre, 28, a maid who has lived for weeks in a tent with her two daughters in front of Magdoos, a chic Lebanese restaurant where diners relax in a garden and smoke flavored tobacco from hookahs. Chauffeurs for some of the customers inside lined up sport utility vehicles next to Ms. Pierre's tent on the sidewalk near the entrance.
 Haiti has long had glaring inequality, with tiny pockets of wealth persisting amid extreme poverty, and Petionville itself was economically mixed before the earthquake, with poor families living near the gated mansions and villas of the rich. 
 But the disaster has focused new attention on this gap, making for surreal contrasts along the streets above Port-au-Prince's central districts. People in tent camps reeking of sewage are living in areas where prosperous Haitians, foreign aid workers and diplomats come to spend their money and unwind. Often, just a gate and a private guard armed with a 12-gauge shotgun separate the newly homeless from establishments like Les Galeries Rivoli, a boutique where wealthy Haitians and foreigners shop for Raymond Weil watches and Izod shirts.
 ''There's nothing logical about what's going on right now,'' said Tatiana Wah, a Haitian planning expert at Columbia University who is living in Petionville and working as an adviser to Haiti's government. Ms. Wah said the revelry at some nightclubs near her home, which are frequented by rich Haitians and foreigners, was now as loud -- or louder -- than before the earthquake. 
 The nongovernmental organizations ''are flooding the local economy with their spending,'' she said, ''but it's not clear if much of it is trickling down.'' 
 Aleksandr Dobrianskiy, the Ukrainian owner of the Bagheera casino here in the hills, smiled as customers flowed in one recent Saturday evening, drinking Cuba Libres and plunking tokens into slot machines.
 He said business had never been better, attributing the uptick at his casino to the money coming into Haiti for relief projects. That spending is percolating through select areas of the economy, as some educated Haitians get jobs working with relief agencies and foreigners bring in cash from abroad, using it on housing, security, transportation and entertainment.
 ''Haiti's like a submarine that just hit the bottom of the sea,'' said Mr. Dobrianskiy, 39, who moved here a year ago and carries a semiautomatic Glock handgun for protection. ''It's got nowhere to go but up.''
 Sometimes the worlds of haves and have-nots collide. Violent crime and kidnappings have been relatively low since the earthquake. But when two European relief workers from Doctors Without Borders were abducted outside the exclusive Plantation restaurant this month and held for five days, the episode served as a reminder of how Haiti's poverty could give rise to resentment and crime. 
 The breadth of Haiti's economic misery seemed incomprehensible to many before the quake, with almost 80 percent of the population living on less than $2 a day. A small elite in gated mansions here in Petionville and other hillside districts wields vast economic power. 
 But with parts of Port-au-Prince now in ruins, tens of thousands of people displaced by the quake are camping directly in the bulwarks once associated with power and wealth, like Place St.-Pierre (across from the elegant Kinam Hotel) and the grounds of Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive's office. 
 The city's biggest tent camp, with more than 40,000 displaced people, sprawls over the hills of the Petionville Club, a country club with a golf course that before the quake had its own Facebook page for former members. (''Had the best Citronade; I bet I drank thousands of them, no exaggeration,'' one reminiscence said.) 
 Petionville's boutiques and restaurants stand in stark contrast to the parallel economic reality in the camp now at the Petionville Club. Throughout its maze of tents, merchants sell dried fish and yams for a fraction of what the French cuisine costs in exclusive restaurants nearby like Quartier Latin or La Souvenance. 
 Manicurists in the camp do nails. A stylist in a hovel applies hair extensions. The camp even has its own Paradis Cine, set up in a tent with space for as many as 30 people. It charges admission of about $1.50 for screenings of ''2012,'' the end-of-times disaster movie known here as ''Apocalypse.'' 
 ''The people in the camp need their diversion, too,'' said Cined Milien, 22, the operator of Paradis Cine. 
 Still, a ticket to see ''Apocalypse'' is a luxury out of the grasp of most people who lost their homes in the earthquake. Some of the well-off in Petionville who have reopened their businesses have done so cautiously, aware of the misfortune that persists on their doorstep.
 ''It's kind of hard for people to dance and have fun,'' said Anastasia Chassagne, 27, the Florida-educated owner of a trendy bar in Petionville. ''I put music, but really low, so like the people walking outside the street don't hear, like, 'Hey, these people are having fun.' '' 
 Not everyone in Petionville has such qualms. Mr. Dobrianskiy, the casino entrepreneur, said he was pleased that Haiti's currency, the gourde, had recently strengthened against the dollar to a value higher than before the quake, in part because of the influx of money from abroad.
 And on the floor above Mr. Dobrianskiy's casino, a nightclub called Barak, with blaring music and Miami-priced cocktails, caters to a different elite here: United Nations employees and foreigners working for aid groups. They mingle with dozens of suggestively clad Haitian women and a few moneyed Haitian men taking in the scene. 
 As hundreds of displaced families gathered under tents a few yards away, the music of Barak continued into the night. A bartender could not keep up with orders for Presidente beers. 
 ''Those who are gone are gone and buried, and we can't do anything about that,'' said Michel Sejoure, 21, a Haitian enjoying a drink at Barak. Asked about the displaced-persons camp down the street, he said, ''I would want to help but I don't have enough, and the government should be the ones that are actually helping these people out.'' 
 ''But,'' he said over the booming music, ''they're not.''

HEADLINE: With No Jobs, Plenty of Time For Tea Party

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
SOUTH BEND, Ind. -- When Tom Grimes lost his job as a financial consultant 15 months ago, he called his congressman, a Democrat, for help getting government health care.
 Then he found a new full-time occupation: Tea Party activist. 
 In the last year, he has organized a local group and a statewide coalition, and even started a ''bus czar'' Web site to marshal protesters to Washington on short notice. This month, he mobilized 200 other Tea Party activists to go to the local office of the same congressman to protest what he sees as the government's takeover of health care.
 Mr. Grimes is one of many Tea Party members jolted into action by economic distress. At rallies, gatherings and training sessions in recent months, activists often tell a similar story in interviews: they had lost their jobs, or perhaps watched their homes plummet in value, and they found common cause in the Tea Party's fight for lower taxes and smaller government. 
 The Great Depression, too, mobilized many middle-class people who had fallen on hard times. Though, as Michael Kazin, the author of ''The Populist Persuasion,'' notes, they tended to push for more government involvement. The Tea Party vehemently wants less -- though a number of its members acknowledge that they are relying on government programs for help. 
 Mr. Grimes, who receives Social Security, has filled the back seat of his Mercury Grand Marquis with the literature of the movement, including Glenn Beck's ''Arguing With Idiots'' and Frederic Bastiat's ''The Law,'' which denounces public benefits as ''false philanthropy.''
 ''If you quit giving people that stuff, they would figure out how to do it on their own,'' Mr. Grimes said.
 The fact that many of them joined the Tea Party after losing their jobs raises questions of whether the movement can survive an improvement in the economy, with people trading protest signs for paychecks. 
 But for now, some are even putting their savings into work that they argue is more important than a job -- planning candidate forums and get-out-the-vote operations, researching arguments about the constitutional limits on Congress and using Facebook to attract recruits. 
 ''Even if I wanted to stop, I just can't,'' said Diana Reimer, 67, who has become a star of the effort by FreedomWorks, a Tea Party group, to fight the health care overhaul. ''I'm on a mission, and time is not on my side.''
 A year ago, Ms. Reimer's husband had been given a choice -- retire or be fired. The couple had been trying to sell their split-level home in suburban Philadelphia to pay off some debt and move to a small place in the city.
 But real estate agents told them the home would sell for about $40,000 less than they paid 19 years ago -- not enough to pay off their mortgage. 
 Then Ms. Reimer saw a story about the Tea Party on television. ''I said, 'That's it,' '' she recalled. ''How can you get this frustration out, have your voices heard?'' 
 She liked that the Tea Party was patriotic, too. ''They said the Pledge of Allegiance and sang the national anthem,'' she said. 
 She had taken a job selling sportswear at Macy's. But when her husband found her up early and late taking care of Tea Party business, he urged her to take a leave. When the store did not allow one, she quit. 
 ''I guess I just found my calling,'' she said. 
 Ms. Reimer, now a national coordinator for the Tea Party Patriots, also found a community. Directing protesters to Congressional offices on Capitol Hill before the vote on health care this month, Representative Steve King, an Iowa Republican who has become a Tea Party hero, stopped to welcome her by name. ''I should have known you'd be here,'' he said, embracing her. 
 A Tea Party member from North Carolina recognized Ms. Reimer from Massachusetts, where she led crews knocking on doors in the snow for Scott Brown, the state's new Republican senator. ''Our slave master,'' the man said, greeting her.
 Ms. Reimer often wells up talking about her work. ''I'm respected,'' she said, her voice breaking. ''I don't know why. I don't know what is so special. But I'm willing to do it.''
 She and others who receive government benefits like Medicare and Social Security said they paid into those programs, so they are getting what they deserve. 
 ''All I know is government was put here for certain reasons,'' Ms. Reimer said. ''They were not put here to run banks, insurance companies, and health care and automobile companies. They were put here to keep us safe.''
 She has no patience for the Obama administration's bailouts and its actions on health care. ''I just don't trust this government,'' Ms. Reimer said. 
 Jeff McQueen, 50, began organizing Tea Party groups in Michigan and Ohio after losing his job in auto parts sales. ''Being unemployed and having some time, I realized I just couldn't sit on the couch anymore,'' he said. ''I had the time to get involved.''
 He began producing what he calls the flag of the Second American Revolution, and drove 700 miles to campaign for Mr. Brown under its banner. Flag sales, so far, are not making him much. But he sees a bigger cause. 
 ''The founding fathers pledged their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor,'' he said. ''They believed in it so much that they would sacrifice. That's the kind of loyalty to this country that we stand for.''
 He blames the government for his unemployment. ''Government is absolutely responsible, not because of what they did recently with the car companies, but what they've done since the 1980s,'' he said. ''The government has allowed free trade and never set up any rules.''
 He and others do not see any contradictions in their arguments for smaller government even as they argue that it should do more to prevent job loss or cuts to Medicare. After a year of angry debate, emotion outweighs fact.
 ''If you don't trust the mindset or the value system of the people running the system, you can't even look at the facts anymore,'' Mr. Grimes said. 
 Tea Party groups like FreedomWorks recognize that they are benefiting from the labor of many people who have been hit hard economically. But its chairman, the former House majority leader Dick Armey, argued that their ranks will remain strong -- and connected -- even as members find work.
 ''I see these folks as pretty much the National Guard,'' Mr. Armey said. ''They will go back to their day jobs, they will go back to their Little League and their bridge club. But they will have their activism at the ready, and they will stay in touch.''
 Mr. Grimes, for his part, is thinking of getting a part-time job with the Census Bureau. But he is also planning, he said, to teach high school students about the Constitution and limits on government powers.
 ''I don't think that the unemployment thing is going to change,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Greener Pastures

BYLINE: By CHRISTIAN L. WRIGHT

 BODY:
Just as bushy beards and Hunter boots have captured the pastoral fantasies of the 
 urban fashion tribe, a taste for field and stream is driving the travel avant-garde. Nowadays, rural pleasures -- whether it's picking your own asparagus or indulging your inner ranger -- have given rise to a new breed of back-to-the-land destinations. 
 Membership in Worldwide Opportunities on Organic Farms (wwoofusa.org), an organization that matches ''wwoofers'' with farms where they're expected to work for room and board, rose last year by almost 10,000. And they're not just college kids. Jane Eckert, founder 
 of the national agritourism registry Ruralbounty.com, says that in the last few years there's been 
 a dramatic surge in people seeking a ''simpler life.'' Whether in reaction to economic uncertainty or as a desire to go back to their roots, Eckert says, ''they are coming to the countryside and wanting to live the life they can't have in the city.'' 
 Along with the agritourist has risen a new kind of country squire. James Manley, a banker, always dreamed of owning a ranch; this spring, he'll open the Ranch at Rock Creek in Montana on 6,600 acres of pristine countryside. And John Pritzker, who started as a teenager in his family's Hyatt hotel business, is diving back into hospitality, not with what he calls an ''urban box'' but with 500 acres in the fruit basket of California. When his redo of the Carmel Valley Ranch opens this summer, guests can learn everything from organic gardening to beekeeping. ''It's summer camp without the discipline,'' he says. 
 Considering that half of American travelers say they're looking for ''cultural authenticity,'' according to the research firm PhoCusWright, it's not hard to see how fetching eggs from the coop seems thrillingly real, even revelatory. As Luite Moraal, the founder of the farm-stay group Feather Down Farms, says, ''People grow up thinking milk is cold.'' CHRISTIAN L. WRIGHT

HEADLINE: Where the Littlest Composers Learn Composure

BYLINE: By PHILLIP LUTZ

 BODY:
LIKE many 8-year-olds, Chantal Loaiza is occasionally given to shyness. But as she moved about her classroom in a school behind St. Gabriel's Roman Catholic Church in New Rochelle last month, dictating to the visiting musicians how she wanted her work-in-progress played, she sounded every bit the confident composer. And that was music to Jon Deak's ears. 
 Mr. Deak, a composer whose works have been performed by many orchestras -- including the New York Philharmonic, for which he played bass for 40 years -- is devoting much of his life these days to nurturing students like Chantal, who is enrolled in Composers of the Future, a joint effort by St. Gabriel's and the Westchester Chamber Orchestra to provide high-quality, low-cost instruction in composition to children who might otherwise not be able to afford it, or even know of its existence. 
 The effort, now in its ninth year, is bucking at least one trend: school systems are increasingly turning to technological aids in their music programs -- the New Rochelle district this month announced plans to expand its computer-assisted instrumental instruction -- and labor-intensive tutoring like Mr. Deak's is becoming a tougher sell. 
 But Mr. Deak said he had no intention of diluting the process he had developed for teaching composition to young children. Though it might be painstaking, he said, spending the time and effort to draw out their ideas was the best way -- perhaps the only way -- to discover their potential.
 ''It sometimes encounters resistance,'' Mr. Deak said of his method. Some school systems or contributors will say, '' 'You're not reaching enough kids.' I say, 'We reach what we reach. It takes a certain amount of man and womanpower to do this thing right.' ''
 Mr. Deak's association with St. Gabriel's grew out of discussions he held in 2000 with Barry Hoffman, the artistic director of the Westchester Chamber Orchestra. Mr. Hoffman suggested setting up a program involving musicians from his orchestra and students from the after-school programs run by Sister Beth Dowd. Mr. Deak agreed, and after the program received financing from the Westchester Arts Council, foundations and New York State, the first class was held in early 2002. 
 Sister Beth said that she chose students for the program based largely on their commitment to lessons and their musicality. Before entering the composers' program, Chantal, who had been in St. Gabriel's after-school programs since she was 5, was writing tunes on the guitar and successfully notating them, in an unorthodox way, on staff paper. 
 The teaching approach was modeled on programs that Mr. Deak started in the mid-1990s in the Denver and New York City school systems, involving members of the Colorado Symphony Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic. He now has programs running in 11 New York City schools and in China and Japan. Next month, he will travel to Venezuela to explore the possibilities there.
 Mr. Deak's classes make liberal use of techniques that he learned directly from Leonard Bernstein. In the class at St. Gabriel's last month, Mr. Deak's associate, the pianist and composer Avery Griffin, applied a Bernstein technique for building chord recognition, asking the students to describe how triads that he played made them feel. The exercise serves as a foundation for understanding how harmony is used in composition.
 Mr. Deak has also adopted Bernstein's encouraging attitude. With gentle prodding, Chantal overcame her reticence, sidling up to Mr. Griffin on the piano bench before clarifying for him what notes were in her melody. Later, she assertively explained to the violinist Alexander Abayev, the Westchester Chamber Orchestra concertmaster, what dynamics and rhythm to apply to it.
 While Mr. Deak creates a relaxed atmosphere, he insists on coaxing ideas from students without making suggestions to them. Any of the 11 students in the St. Gabriel's class, who range in age from 8 to 12 and meet at least twice a week for six weeks of group or individual instruction, might at any time be required to sing or play a composed passage the same way three times before the teaching associate will write it down.
 ''To even suggest something is to color the kid's perception,'' Mr. Deak said. ''The whole motivation for this is to get what's already inside the kid.''
 The confidence the students acquire can help them overcome disadvantages, Sister Beth said, citing two young women from low-income families who began the program when they were 7 and later excelled -- one a sophomore at Georgetown University who won a spot in the university's orchestra, the other a senior at Harrison High School who led the school's marching band and will receive an award next month for her volunteer work teaching flute. 
 ''We've seen transformations on the personal as well as the musical level,'' she said.
 The program is struggling financially. A $50,000 two-year state grant for advanced instruction aimed at older children -- instruction, Mr. Deak said, that can boost the chances a student will continue composing after high school -- has expired. And with the economic downturn, the program is scrambling to raise the $12,000 to $14,000 for each six-week basic-instruction program. A $5 lesson fee is being considered .
 ''We're scraping the bottom of the barrel,'' Sister Beth said, noting that the church had cut back programs in which professional musicians mentored volunteer teachers.
 But for the moment, the composers' program is moving forward. Having nailed down her melody, Chantal is adding other parts to what will ultimately be a fully orchestrated chamber piece of a minute or so -- one of 11 scheduled to be performed at the Westchester Chamber Orchestra's May 1 concert, alongside works by Aaron Copland, Ernest Bloch and David Amram.
 Pieces produced by students in the Composers of the Future program will be included in a concert by the Westchester Chamber Orchestra at 8 p.m. on May 1 at the Christopher J. Murphy Auditorium in the Murphy Science Building, Iona College, New Rochelle. Information: westchesterchamberorchestra.org or (914) 654-4926.

 CORRECTION:
An article in some editions last Sunday about the Composers of the Future program for children, held in a school behind St. Gabriel's Roman Catholic Church in New Rochelle, N.Y., misidentified the entity that runs the program together with the Westchester Chamber Orchestra. It is Songcatchers, an after-school music group, not the church itself.

HEADLINE: Does This Bank Watchdog Have a Bite?

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN; Gretchen Morgenson contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Houston
 FOR now at least, the nation's front line for consumer financial protection resides on the 34th floor of a downtown office tower here, amid cubicles surrounded by posters that read, ''Improving the Customer Experience -- Be a LEADER in every call.''
 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency operates this service center, fielding thousands of complaints each year about the nation's banks.
 One recent morning, a woman groused that her credit card limit had been cut for no apparent reason. Another said her bank had continued to charge her for disputed transactions on her credit card. A man said he was charged overdraft fees on the same day he made several deposits. 
 What many customers may not realize is that the man who oversees the operation used to represent the very banks they are complaining about.
 John C. Dugan, a former bank lobbyist, has been comptroller since 2005 -- when the mortgage boom was in full force -- and he's responsible for regulating banks with national charters, including giants like Citibank and Chase. Like his recent predecessors, Mr. Dugan often takes positions that align with banks, even as they have come under withering attack for their role in the financial crisis. 
 For instance, he has opposed efforts by state officials who try to crack down on abusive consumer-lending practices, arguing that national banks aren't in their jurisdiction. At the same time, he rarely imposes serious penalties related to consumer protection, particularly against the big banks.
 ''To have a regulator this partial and this helpful to the people he is supposed to regulate is, to say the least, very troubling,'' says the Iowa attorney general, Tom Miller, who has tangled with the O.C.C. ''It's a pretty warped view of public responsibility.''
 Mr. Dugan casts himself as a zealous guardian of the safety and soundness of banks, a mission his agency sees as its first objective. As such, he has also taken positions that are at odds with the Obama administration and with other regulators, like opposing a proposal to limit banks' ability to raise interest rates on existing credit card balances and opposing a special assessment on banks to shore up the fund that insures consumers' deposits. 
 He has managed to do so mostly behind the scenes, avoiding the fusillades that have been directed at other bank regulators like the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke. After all, who has heard of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency?
 ''I call them as I see them,'' says Mr. Dugan, who plans to step down when his term expires this summer. ''I've done some unpopular things with the industry on things that they didn't like. And I have done some unpopular things where people thought I was doing things that were too pro-bank.''
 Mr. Dugan has survived -- even thrived -- amid such criticism by retaining powerful allies, including the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner. Mr. Geithner has also been something of a pinata for critics, who contend that he, too, guards the welfare of banks at the expense of taxpayers and average consumers. The comptroller's office is technically an arm of the Treasury Department, though Mr. Geithner has little day-to-day oversight.
 Mr. Geithner did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
 As Congress considers an overhaul of financial regulations, including a new agency for consumer financial protection, the recent track record of regulators like Mr. Dugan and Mr. Geithner hangs over the debate.
 Last summer, President Obama proposed creating an independent consumer protection agency. But months of Congressional debate and furious lobbying by banks have undermined support for an independent agency. A main sticking point is determining what, if any, authority existing bank regulators should have over the agency if it is created.
 Some Republican senators -- and Mr. Dugan -- would like to protect the existing authority of the O.C.C. over national banks, arguing that a healthy banking system protects consumers.
 Arthur E. Wilmarth Jr., a law professor at George Washington University, says that none of the current federal regulators, including the O.C.C., have been consumer guardians. By contrast, he said, attorneys general in New York and elsewhere have successfully rooted out consumer lending and investing abuses.
 ''To me, the real bottom line is that 4 of the 16 largest national banks had to be bailed out or sold with federal TARP assistance in order to avoid failure,'' says Professor Wilmarth.
 This track record, he says, proves that the ''quiet'' approach of the O.C.C. and the Office of Thrift Supervision ''failed either to protect consumers or to ensure the safety and soundness of major banks.''
 MR. DUGAN bristles at the notion that he is too easy on banks and says his agency's record on consumer protection has been ''vigorous and sustained.'' He says it is a ''cheap shot'' to suggest that his lobbying years color his viewpoint and that it demeans his employees and his years of public service. 
 A 2005 appointee of President George W. Bush, Mr. Dugan came to the O.C.C. after working for 12 years as a lawyer and lobbyist representing the banking industry. Before that, he worked for the federal government, including stints as counsel for the Senate Banking Committee and as an assistant secretary in the Treasury Department.
 Though acknowledging some missteps at the O.C.C., he is quick to say that others deserve more blame, like nonbank lenders who dished out subprime loans and sleepy state regulators overseeing them.
 Although the comptroller's office oversees two-thirds of the nation's assets held by commercial banks, Mr. Dugan points out that national banks represent just 17 percent of all assets from failed banks since the start of the financial crisis.
 Of course, that doesn't account for national banks that avoided collapsing because of huge taxpayer bailouts -- ''too big to fail'' banks like Citigroup and Bank of America. Mr. Dugan counters that most of the big banks repaid taxpayers with interest -- unlike A.I.G., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
 ''In the end,'' he says, ''the fact that they got the money but took steps to fix themselves, to raise private equity, build loan-loss reserves to pay the government back quickly, will be viewed as a successful way to deal with a very difficult situation.'' 
 In addition, Mr. Dugan says, the O.C.C. has issued guidance to banks on risky mortgages, credit cards and gift cards. He says he would have done more to protect consumers if he had the authority to write regulations. For now, that is left to the Federal Reserve.
 ''I'm not trying to say we are perfect,'' he says, ''but it's a record that I think is good given the circumstances.'' 
 WHEN Darrell McGraw, the attorney general of West Virginia, decided to sue Capital One Bank in 2005, alleging credit card abuses, his office expected to face a phalanx of high-priced defense lawyers.
 What it didn't expect was that Capital One would get a hand from the federal government.
 As Mr. McGraw tells it, his legal team was thwarted every step of the way by Capital One and the O.C.C.
 While Capital One didn't comply with Mr. McGraw's subpoenas, it did apply for a national charter with the O.C.C., which it obtained in March 2008. Soon afterward, Capital One notified Mr. McGraw that he no longer had authority over it. 
 For more than a decade, the O.C.C. has beaten back state attorneys general who have tried to enforce state consumer laws against national banks, arguingthat federal laws pre-empt those of the states: the O.C.C. has stopped Georgia from enforcing predatory lending laws, intervened in New York's effort to investigate discriminatory lending and opposed a campaign by New England states to curb gift card fees. 
 ''It's always disheartening when the federal government becomes the refuge for scoundrels,'' Mr. McGraw says. 
 Last year, the White House suggested giving states more authority to enforce consumer laws against national banks. Lobbyists counterattacked and Congress weakened the proposal.
 Mr. Dugan has made no secret of his opposition to increasing states' authority. He argues that it could cripple national banking and be bad for consumers because it would create uneven standards and enforcement. 
 West Virginia officials say they decided to pursue Capital One in part because of its state charter. Capital One says that it switched charters because it was evolving from a credit card company into a traditional bank and that the move had nothing to do with the West Virginia suit.
 A federal judge reluctantly granted Capital One's request to stop the West Virginia case once the bank obtained a national charter.
 ''While I find that federal law requires this result, I am sympathetic to the defendant, whose lawful investigation was hijacked by Capital One's conversion to a national bank,'' the judge, Joseph Goodwin, wrote. ''It is questionable whether the O.C.C. will be as motivated or as effective in protecting the consumers of West Virginia.''
 The O.C.C. asked Mr. McGraw's office for its investigative files. In February, the agency announced that Capital One would pay $775,000 in restitution, which West Virginia said addressed only one of seven issues it had raised.
 Mr. McGraw said the penalty ''is not even a drop in the bucket.'' The O.C.C. disputes the notion that it protected Capital One and says that its sanction was fair. 
 CRITICS maintain that the O.C.C.'s campaign against the states weakened crucial consumer protections and ultimately exacerbated the impact of the financial crisis. In addition, they say that the O.C.C.'s own oversight efforts were so tepid that risky mortgages, credit card abuses and overdraft fees proliferated.
 ''It's not that they want to displace the states,'' says Kathleen Keest, a lawyer for the Center for Responsible Lending. ''It's that they want to replace something with nothing.''
 While the debate over pre-emption dates back decades, critics say it culminated in 2004, when the O.C.C. issued sweeping rules blocking states' ability to enforce consumer laws. The crackdown came just as the market for subprime loans was starting to explode.
 The O.C.C. and its critics disagree on the percentage of subprime and other risky mortgages originated by national banks: the O.C.C. says it was less than 15 percent of the total; others say more. But, critics say, the O.C.C. does not take into account the pivotal role that banks played in stoking the appetite for risky mortgages by securitizing the loans.
 In addition, national banks remain the largest provider of credit cards, and some were engaged in controversial practices like over-the-limit fees. The nation's big banks also tend to charge the highest overdraft fees and tack on other dubious fees, critics say.
 Even so, the O.C.C. only sparingly takes robust action on consumer protection issues, particularly against the big banks. Mr. Dugan maintains that this is because the agency works closely with banks and tries to stop problems before they metastasize and require stronger measures.
 In the last decade, the O.C.C. has issued 124 formal enforcement orders related to consumer protection, according to an O.C.C. report in October. Of those, only 10 required banks to pay restitution, one called for a refund and nine required civil penalties.
 The nation's biggest banks and credit card issuers were rarely penalized for consumer abuses. Providian Financial, Wachovia Bank and Capital One were among the bigger banks that were handed enforcement orders.
 Even the O.C.C.'s in-house watchdog -- the Treasury Department's inspector general -- has criticized the agency. In a January report, the inspector cited multiple mistakes by O.C.C. examiners in the failure of Silverton Bank of Atlanta. For instance, the O.C.C. had identified ''significant weaknesses'' in Silverton's operations when it applied for a national bank charter in April 2007, but it approved the application anyway, the report said. 
 The receiver appointed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation when the bank collapsed estimated that Silverton's failure would cost taxpayers $1.26 billion.
 Three weeks after Silverton's collapse, the F.D.I.C. urged its board to approve a special assessment on banks to help shore up its depleted insurance fund. Mr. Dugan was the only board member to vote against the assessment, which eventually prevailed. 
 Mr. Dugan said that he was concerned that added expenses would harm already-struggling banks and disproportionately affect big banks, most of which he oversees.
 Consumer advocates say they remain underwhelmed by Mr. Dugan's efforts. ''It's hard to get help from an agency that thinks the banks are always right,'' said Travis B. Plunkett, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America.
 AT the customer assistance operation here in Houston, employees tell callers to first try to resolve problems directly with their banks.
 On occasion, however, consumers are reimbursed as a result of O.C.C. intervention. Last year, the O.C.C. fielded 72,047 complaints -- more than double the year before -- and reimbursed $9.2 million.
 The woman who complained about her credit card limit was told to file a formal complaint, while the woman who disputed the fees was told that she was out of luck. The man who griped about overdraft fees got his money back.

HEADLINE: Trying to Tame The Unknowable

BYLINE: By N. GREGORY MANKIW. 
N. Gregory Mankiw is a professor of economics at Harvard.

 BODY:
THE economy is recovering, in baby steps, from the financial crisis and deep recession of 2008 and 2009. A big question still looms on the horizon: What can policy makers do to prevent this kind of thing from happening again?
 Perhaps the best place to start is to acknowledge what we cannot do. If recent events have taught economists and policy makers anything, it is the need for humility. 
 One thing we cannot do very well is forecast the economy. The recent crisis and recession caught most economists flat-footed. This is nothing new. We have never been good at foretelling the future, but when the news is favorable, others forgive our lack of prescience. 
 Some critics say the Federal Reserve should have foreseen the bursting of the housing bubble and its financial aftershocks. A few of them, having made the correct call themselves, are enjoying newfound celebrity.
 Yet at any time, there are many forecasters with a large range of views. After the fact, a few will turn out to be right, and many wrong. Policy makers at the Fed don't know in advance who will be the lucky few. Their best course is to rely on the consensus forecast and to be ready for the inevitable surprises.
 Another thing we cannot do very well is regulate financial institutions. 
 When I was chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers from 2003 to 2005, I spoke openly about the need to reform regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I did not know when or how these government-sponsored enterprises would come crashing down, but I thought they posed undue risks for the economy and for taxpayers.
 I was not alone in that judgment. While working on the issue, I consulted privately with an economist who had held a high-ranking position in the Clinton administration. He shared precisely my concerns, as did Alan Greenspan, who was then the Fed chairman.
 Why was nothing done? Many members of Congress were worried less about financial fragility than about expanding access to homeownership. Moreover, lobbyists from these companies assured Congress that there was no real problem, while the sheer complexity of these institutions made it hard for legislators to appreciate the enormity of the risks.
 I recount this story not because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were the main cause of the recent financial crisis -- they were only one element -- but because it shows the kind of problem we'll encounter on a larger scale as we reform oversight of the financial system. 
 We should certainly aim for better financial regulation, especially for institutions with government-insured deposits. More transparency and more accurate assessment of risks are admirable goals. Higher capital requirements would be a step in the right direction.
 There has been much talk about restricting the use of financial derivatives. Unfortunately, writing good rules is not easy. Derivatives, like fire, can lead to disaster if not handled with care, but they can also be used to good effect.
 Whatever we do, let's not be overoptimistic about how successful improved oversight will be. The financial system is diverse and vastly complicated. Government regulators will always be outnumbered and underpaid compared with those whose interest it is to circumvent the regulations. Legislators will often be distracted by other priorities. To believe that the government will ever become a reliable watchdog would be a tragic mistake. 
 So where does this leave us? We should plan for future financial crises, to occur at some unknown date for some unknown reason, and arm ourselves with better tools to clean up the mess. 
 Much focus in Washington has been on expanding the government's authority to step in when a financial institution is near bankruptcy, and to fix the problem before the institution creates a systemic risk.
 That makes some sense, but creates risks of its own. If federal authorities are responsible for troubled institutions, creditors may view those institutions as safer than they really are. When problems arise, regulators may find it hard to avoid using taxpayer money. The entire financial system might well become, in essence, a group of government-sponsored enterprises.
 Another idea is to require financial firms to write their own ''living wills,'' describing how they would wind down in the event of an adverse shock to their balance sheets. It is hard to say whether this would work. Like real wills, the next of kin may well contest the terms when the time comes. That would slow the process and defeat much of the purpose.
 MY favorite proposal is to require banks, and perhaps a broad class of financial institutions, to sell contingent debt that can be converted to equity when a regulator deems that these institutions have insufficient capital. This debt would be a form of preplanned recapitalization in the event of a financial crisis, and the infusion of capital would be with private, rather than taxpayer, funds. Think of it as crisis insurance.
 Bankers may balk at this proposal, because it would raise the cost of doing business. The buyers of these bonds would need to be compensated for providing this insurance. 
 But this contingent debt would also give bankers an incentive to limit risk by, say, reducing leverage. The safer these financial institutions are, the less likely the contingency would be triggered and the less they would need to pay for this debt.
 A few years ago, some people thought that major financial crises were a thing of the past. We know that was wrong. Despite our best efforts, more financial crises are likely to occur. As we recover from the last one, we should prepare for the next.

HEADLINE: Day Traders 2.0: Wired, Angry and Loving It

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

 BODY:
Encinitas, Calif.
 REMEMBER the day traders?
 They were hard to miss during the tech-stock mania a decade ago, when the Nasdaq seemed like a casino built by morons and a chimp with darts could pick winners. You would hear about these guys -- nearly all of them were guys -- and wonder: Could anyone make a living this way? And if the answer was yes, why were the rest of us suckers still holding down regular jobs?
 No doubt, it's been a long time since a question like that troubled your imagination. And perhaps you assumed that the twin calamities of the Internet crash and the Great Recession had doomed the day-trader species in the unruly jungle of American capitalism. But some dreams refuse to die, and few, it seems, are more resilient than the dream of beating the market while wearing nothing but tighty-whities.
 Or, if you are Andy Lindloff, a pair of jeans and a black waffle-pattern shirt. 
 ''Banks are seeing a nice little lift,'' he says, staring at computer screens one recent Wednesday morning, sipping coffee from a Denver Broncos mug. ''The European banks are up, so that may bleed over to ours. Bank of America might be one to watch.''
 Mr. Lindloff, 49, is sitting in his living room here in a city known as ''surfer's paradise,'' about 25 miles north of San Diego. Surrounded by the playthings of his daughter -- a toy oven, a doll house -- he appears to be alone. In fact, he has plenty of company. With a hands-free headset, he is speaking to Steve Gomez, his partner in Today Trader, a two-year-old Internet venture that is ''about helping traders find success through virtual technology,'' as it says on the company's Web site.
 The company charges aspiring traders $199 a month for a live, real-time view of Mr. Lindloff's computer screen, along with the running banter, commentary and advice that he and Mr. Gomez provide through the morning. (After lunch, it's just Mr. Lindloff.) The service is billed as a chance to look over the ''virtual shoulder'' of two veteran stock traders, but you don't really see anyone's shoulder. It's more like staring at the instrument panel of a jet while eavesdropping on the pilots, plus the ceaseless tap-tap of a keyboard.
 By the opening bell, 21 subscribers are logged in.
 ''Citigroup's at $4.10,'' says Mr. Gomez, 43, who is in his home in San Diego. ''Probably going to hang around that strike price.''
 ''AMD is at an interesting stop there, too,'' says Mr. Lindloff, hopscotching from one chart to another.
 ''Keep it tight,'' says Mr. Gomez. ''Don't fight the momentum.''
 All the while, subscribers send questions and share ideas in a chat room that is part of the service.
 ''DRYS over 6.''
 ''MNKD short?''
 ''Watching this ALD.''
 ''HBAN?''
 It might read like a teenager's idea of a haiku, but this is the new frontier in do-it-yourself trading. Today Trader and its rivals are tiny operations, and they have modest followings. But they are harnessing all the crowd-sourcing features of the Internet circa 2010: YouTube, Twitter, and companies like GotoMeeting, a Web conferencing service.
 They are also harnessing a lot of market-related rage. The gruesome stock plunge of late 2008 and early 2009 was a searing, fool-me-twice moment for many people. The market again seemed hopelessly treacherous, a mug's game. And if you had an account with the brokerage arm of any number of Wall Street stalwarts -- like Lehman Brothers, Citigroup or Merrill Lynch -- your losses were doubly galling. Your team helped put a sleeper hold on the economy, the near-collapse of which then ravaged your portfolio.
 Even many of those who took the safe route and years ago bought index funds have seen little upside. Look at the performance of the Standard & Poor's 500, the most popular index out there. If you put $1,000 in it in 1999, you now have slightly less money in your account (about 0.3 percent less, actually).
 If the motto of the original day-trade boom was, ''If the pros can do it, so can we,'' the motto today is, ''We can't do much worse than the pros.''
 ''There's this idea out there that retail investors are dumb,'' says Howard Lindzon, the co-founder of StockTwits, which curates a gusher of stock tips and financial news alerts tweeted by 20,000 regular contributors. ''Well, it turns out that the institutional investors are pretty dumb. They nearly blew us all up with leverage.''
 Of course, anyone hoping to join the day-trade caravan had better wear a seat belt, as Mr. Lindloff's experience on this Wednesday morning demonstrates. Before lunch, he will buy and sell about 44,000 shares, in 17 trades. He starts off poorly, losing about $500. But a timely bet on a company called Rackspace Hosting (''I don't know what they do,'' he says), as well as quick investments in Applied Materials, Eagle Bulk Shipping and a few others, have turned things around.
 ''Up $210,'' he says, removing his headset. Factoring in commissions, he's made $60.
 IT is hard to say how many day traders are currently plying their craft, if that is the right word, in this country. Brokerage firms track the activity and demographics of their customers, but they have been reluctant to share that data. About the most we know is that the day traders skew male, and the number of trades per $100,000 in client dollars is a little less than half what it was back in 2000, according to the Charles Schwab brokerage firm. 
 Even that figure seems high. As a job, ''day trader'' registers in roughly the same way as ''disco ball manufacturer'' or ''Brooklyn farmer.'' You know that someone has to be making disco balls and that maybe there are still a few plots of arable land in Brooklyn.
 Still, it can seem strange to see TV ads for an Atlanta company called Long Term Short Term, which offers two-day investment seminars, as well as DVDs, CDs and online tutoring, in cities across the country. Price: $3,995 a person. Part of the pitch taps into the simmering anger at professional investors.
 ''People put their trust in stock brokerages that are now out of business, and have seen their 401(k) drop by 40 percent or more,'' says Michael Hutchison, an executive vice president of Long Term Short Term, which does business as Better Trades. ''Meanwhile, mutual fund companies are making $85 billion a year, and look at their performance. There are people who see all this and think, 'Why don't I educate myself?'''
 Mr. Hutchinson hastens to add that his company doesn't encourage anyone to quit a job and trade full time. But more than a few attendees may be looking for a change in career. Many of the new day traders are people who recently lost jobs and can't find work.
 ''I get e-mails from people saying, 'I worked for XYZ company for 20 years and I just got laid off,''' says Brian Shannon of Alphatrends, which, for $60 a month, offers proprietary online videos and a once-a-week live chat. ''They've got a severance package or a nest egg that they want to invest themselves.''
 Mr. Gomez and Mr. Lindloff are among the few who started day trading in the late '90s and never stopped. At a late breakfast, just after that $60 morning, the two are sitting at a sidewalk cafe. You expect them to be revved up and antsy. Instead, look like members of a mellow Southern California rock band that split up 15 years ago. The most agitated either gets while trading online is the occasional ''goddangit,'' Mr. Lindloff's idea of an outburst.
 For years, Mr. Gomez was a manager at a self-storage facility, but he couldn't resist trading commodities during office hours, and he had a hard time keeping his mind on his work. Mr. Lindloff worked at an Isuzu dealership for years, then made cold calls -- knocking on doors -- for Edward Jones, the brokerage firm. He left after three months. 
 ''I knew I wanted to trade,'' he says.
 How good are they? Mr. Lindloff, who Mr. Gomez says is the more skilled of the two, says he has averaged somewhere between $100,000 and $120,000 a year for the last 10 years, even during the worst part of the Great Recession. With low expenses, he lives comfortably, though hardly extravagantly.
 ''I basically have $80,000 to $100,000 in my trading account every day,'' he says, ''and take my earnings out of that account to live.''
 It is, to be sure, an odds-defying performance. The great mass of studies point to the same conclusion: trading is hazardous to your wealth, as an academic paper memorably put it. The losers far outnumber the winners. 
 Exactly how far is clear from one of the most comprehensive looks at the subject in a yet-to-be-published study conducted in Taiwan. (The country is ideal for this kind of research because all trades go through one place, the Taiwan Stock Exchange, which is willing to share the information.) The authors sifted through tens of millions of trades, from 1992 to 2006, and found that 80 percent of active traders lost money.
 ''More importantly, we found that if you were to look at the past performance of these traders, only 1 percent of them could be called predictably profitable,'' says a co-author, Brad M. Barber, a finance professor at the University of California, Davis. Everyone else, it seems, was on a short-term winning streak. Even those who did modestly well found their that profits were wiped out, and then some, by transaction fees like commissions and taxes.
 ''It's not impossible to make money actively trading,'' Mr. Barber continues. ''There are slivers of people out there who are quite good. And everyone thinks they will be in that group of 1 percent.''
 So why do people persist in this line of work?
 ''The technical term is thrill-seeking,'' says Hersh Shefrin, a professor of behavioral finance at Santa Clara University in California and author of ''Beyond Greed and Fear,'' an exploration of investors' mindscapes. ''There's an adrenaline rush. And the thing about day trading is that it gives you pretty quick feedback. If you buy and hold, a lot of things need to happen before you see a result, and much of what happens relates to external factors that are beyond your control. With day trading, you're in charge.''
 Also, he says, ''people enjoy trading.''
 IF Mr. Lindloff is earning steady six-figure returns, he is squarely in the rarefied 1 percent of winners. But for $199 a month you sort of expect a man with a mansion, a hot tub and hyperbolic claims of double-digit returns. Why do a few dozen subscribers pay to watch these quite appealing but hardly world-beating guys at work?
 ''Eighty percent of it is camaraderie,'' says Mr. Lindzon at StockTwits. ''Look, my wife watches cooking shows and I tell her, 'That's not going to make you a better cook.' With these guys, you get a community, you get to hang out with people who love stocks, and if you get a couple great ideas in a month, even better.''
 Services like Twitter are naturals for traders, and not just because they offer a geyser of pointers, whispers and news flashes. They also give a far-flung group of people a simulacrum of fellowship, which is something that day traders need almost as much as good ideas.
 Asked about the Today Trader method of buying and selling, both men seem momentarily stumped, as if they never saw the question coming. Then they talk about the search for ''set-ups,'' which seems to translate roughly as ''golden opportunities,'' but they struggle to put a finger on what set-ups are, or how to spot them.
 It has something to do with tracking trading volumes of stocks and buying heavily traded stocks as they rise in price. But how to know a stock will keep rising? Intuition, they say. It tells them whether they've arrived at the party too late (in which case they won't buy), at the right time (in which case they buy), or just before it ends (time to sell).
 ''A common phrase in this business,'' says Mr. Lindloff, ''is 'the trend is your friend.'''
 The more you listen, the more you realize that for all the high-tech gadgetry behind Today Trader, at its core is a Newtonian principle formulated more than 300 years ago: a body in motion tends to stay in motion.
 The problem is that stocks aren't bodies and their motion is subject to forces Newton could never have fathomed. Some of those forces are hard for the Today Trader duo to fathom, too. Mr. Gomez says that day trading has become far trickier in recent years because of the rise of robo trading -- the use of computers to automatically buy and sell huge numbers of shares in superfast bursts, based on algorithms. 
 Big, muscular Wall Street veterans like Goldman Sachs have the money, smarts and brute power to dominate this computerized battle, and many day traders may not even be aware how outgunned they now are.
 ''It's not something we fully understand, but algorithms don't have emotions,'' says Mr. Gomez. ''It's like these machines can smell a human. They can smell the fear of a discretionary trader. Stocks will still go from Point A to Point B. But what used to be a waltz is now more like mosh pit.''
 Daily hand-to-hand combat with a bunch of robots? It seems kind of crazy. But is it any crazier than leaving your money in the same place where it languished for the last decade?
 This is a not a simple question. Fortunately, one man is ideally suited to answer it.
 UNFORTUNATELY, Charles Schwab doesn't do interviews.
 This is ironic, as has been noted by reporters who have come calling of late, because the company has spent five years and a fortune on an ad campaign whose kicker is ''Talk to Chuck.'' But in 2008, Mr. Schwab vacated the C.E.O. job -- he is now chairman -- and the company would like to wean the public off the idea that Charles Schwab is the public face of Charles Schwab.
 No small feat, given the name of the company and given the ubiquity of that face in many years of advertising. Mr. Schwab once said he took his grandchildren out trick-or-treating on Halloween and some people thought he was wearing a Charles Schwab mask.
 Though he wore a jacket and tie in his TV spots, he seemed to have the heart and soul of a revolutionary. The idea behind the company was to cut commission rates so low -- they started off at $70 a trade in 1975, which was then a steal -- that the average investor could trade without paying exorbitant fees to Wall Street. If day trading had a patron saint, it was this man.
 The current C.E.O. is Walt Bettinger, 49, who is sitting one morning in his San Francisco office, which is next to Mr. Schwab's and has a killer view of the Bay Bridge. He knows the subject is day trading, and you can tell he finds this topic slightly annoying, the way a movie star would find it annoying if you asked about a film he made 20 years ago.
 ''I think the day-trade concept is a paragraph in the story of Charles Schwab,'' he says. ''But it's not the book.''
 The book, he says, is Schwab's evolution from a company that was just focused on what he calls ''self-directed investors'' to a company that also offers advice to those who seek it and full-on portfolio management for those who prefer to leave their investment decisions in someone else's hands.
 As a strategy, this makes sense because it turns out that traders are fickle customers. Even during the banner years, Mr. Bettinger said, the company had to constantly replenish its base of very active traders.
 The push to advise clients and to manage portfolios started gaining traction in 2005, and the company says that last year, customers moved $21 billion into assorted fee-based advice offerings -- which suggests that the era of professional hand-holding in the wealth-management world is hardly over.
 Schwab now offers every item at the steam table of financial offerings, and Mr. Bettinger will not say he prefers one investment strategy to any other. He is, in fact, completely agnostic on the question and surpassingly unhelpful at opining about day trading. If that works for you, do it, he'll say. Unless you'd like someone to manage your money -- in which case, do that.
 It is a politic, even-handed answer that proves just how over the whole trading phenomenon the company is. Schwab today is a bit like that part-time insurrectionist you knew in college who denounced ''the man'' and later became a management consultant. You can understand the evolution and appreciate the maturity, but you can still think fondly of the days when he stood outside the dining hall pushing copies of The Workers Vanguard.
 About the most Mr. Bettinger will say about day trading is that it's a ''tough gig.'' ''You're competing against mega-institutions that are trading in hundredths of a second.''
 HE'S right, and the Today Trader team keeps clashing with those mega-institutions. At one point, Mr. Lindloff buys shares in Patterson-UTI Energy, because he thinks it looks ripe for an uptick. Instead, it dives a few cents, and because Mr. Lindloff has an automatic stop on the trade -- which sells the shares if they dip below a certain threshold -- they are sold for a loss. A moment later, the shares shoot up.
 Mr. Lindloff thinks he has been juked and jived by a robo trader.
 ''That was nothing but an algorithm boogie,'' he mutters to the Today Trader faithful. ''Goddang it. Drives me crazy.''
 ''My analogy is that whole sector is doing great and they find one weak animal in a herd,'' replies Mr. Gomez, ''and they'll attack it.''
 Mr. Gomez trades his own accounts but spends much of his time answering questions posted in the chat room. One is from a subscriber, Rick, who asks, ''What do you guys do to stop kicking yourself (emotionally) about missed opportunity?''
 ''The only thing you can control is your attitude,'' Mr. Gomez replies into his microphone, moments after the question is posted. ''Not looking back, not kicking yourself for not catching the whole move. You're never going to be perfect. Nobody is going to be perfect.''
 Not even Today Trader. By the end of the day, Mr. Lindloff has traded 60,000 shares and is up $165. It would be a satisfying return, but commissions on those trades cost $300.
 ''You know,'' says Mr. Gomez, ''a lot of people tell us that our down days are every bit as instructive as our ups.''

BYLINE: By GERALD MARZORATI

 BODY:
It requires body control, hand-eye coordination, quickness, flat-out speed, endurance and that strange mix of caution 
 and abandon we call courage,'' David Foster Wallace was contending, making the case for tennis being our most demanding sport, as if I needed reminding. I was rereading an article called ''Tennis Player Michael Joyce's Professional Artistry as a Paradigm of Certain Stuff About Choice, Freedom, Discipline, Joy, Grotesquerie and Human Completeness,'' which Wallace (who in his too-short life came to observe tennis more ingeniously than anyone ever had) had written for Esquire back in the '90s -- rereading it because I was trying to take my mind off the fact that the small commuter plane 
 I was on was getting harshly wind-batted above the Wasatch Range, not far south of Salt Lake City, but also because I was heading to tennis camp. I was heading to tennis camp because three years ago, at the age of 54 (not that I think about that much), with my sons no longer requiring my weekend time (hell, they were barely home) and with more of my professional life behind me than in front of me (not that I think about that much, either), I was visited by the peculiarly middle-age desire to find something I'd never really done and get good, or good enough, at it. I took up tennis (which I'd long loved the idea of) and, immediately, it took hold of me. I recommend it to anyone looking for something to provide newfound aches and an ever-tidy venue for that lonely, bewildering argument with yourself that is life. 
 The Green Valley Spa, a modest compound of Santa Fe-style adobe buildings and single-story guest rooms arrayed around garden courtyards with swimming pools, is situated on the western edge of St. George, Utah, not far from both the Arizona and Nevada borders, and the camp there, or Tennis College, as it is called, is one of three (the others are in Arizona and Hawaii) based on the philosophy and principals of Vic Braden, now in his 80s and a legendary instructor who has sought for decades to bring physics and technology to bear on the improvement of tennis strokes. Improvement, not mastery: To be great or even a near great -- like Michael Joyce, No. 79 on the men's tour when Wallace (who'd been a serious junior player) profiled him in 1996 -- is to have had a racket in your hand by third grade and a psyche to endure fierce competition and endless heartbreak and, at somepoint around puberty, to have committed to summers or even years of hard labor at a place like the Bollettieri Academy in Florida. Programs like the one at Green Valley are for taking away two or three things that will make you better around the club -- to, say, take your 3.5 game (or some aspects of it) to 4.0, in the parlance of the United States Tennis Association. That's what I had in mind when I signed up for three full days of tennis and nothing else. I could see from the plane the red-rock buttes and desert valleys where I was told John Ford filmed ''Stagecoach,'' and that was enough: I would do none of the hiking that is the region's better-known lure. Nor was I interested in the yoga classes or wellness lectures or radical weight-loss regimens the spa offered -- though I did need and obtain, at the end of each day, a deep-tissue massage. 
 After arriving on a Sunday evening, unpacking and then strolling to the dining room under a high, star-blanketed canopy, I ate dinner alone -- terrific and healthful and, like all the meals I'd eat at Green Valley, as locavore as the spa's executive chef, Francesca van der Stappen, can pull off in the southwestern corner of Utah -- and was asleep in my cheery room, Wallace's essay collection collapsed on my chest, by 9:30. 
 Day 1, which was devoted to the forehand, began not outside on one of the resort's 14 hard courts (with views, beyond St. George's myriad subdivisions and retirement developments, of dun hills and azure sky) but in a small classroom, where Dave Nostrant, who directs this particular Braden college, gave me and my classmates, a late-30-something couple from Seattle, a brief geometry lesson. (Classes at the camp tend to be small, and smaller just now as a result of the Great Recession). Dave, a onetime ballplayer who came to tennis late and has, as I would come to see, the patience of a Cubs fan, began by explaining (with the help of triangles drawn on a white board and an instructional film) one of Braden's key tenets: that the court is small, very small -- that, on a singles court, the difference between hitting a forehand down the line or cross-court to the far corner entails moving the direction of your follow-through only 19.1 degrees. The point of knowing this -- in understanding that on most shots, as Dave put it, you are, or should be, trying to hit a ball down a long, narrow sidewalk -- is to concentrate on extending your racket farther out toward your target. He also talked, convincingly, about how the net is higher than you think (more white-board geometrics) and about how hitting is as much a matter of verticality (lift) as horizontality (drive). If he was trying to gently reinforce my sense that tennis was built to vanquish those who approached it (Wallace: ''Just one single shot in one exchange in one point . . . is a nightmare of mechanical variables''), he was doing an excellent job. 
 Then, after stretching and some casual hitting around outside (my Seattle classmates, I was relieved to learn, were not going to be working things out with overhead smashes, like the couple in ''The Squid and the Whale''), Dave digitally filmed our forehands with video analysis software called Dartfish. It turns out (why should this have come as a surprise?) that you have no real sense of your body's form in motion until you actually see it, even if your poor club coach has been trying to tell you -- no real sense that, in my case, I was waiting too long to take my racket back, not turning my shoulder fully toward the ball, not keeping my wrist firm or ending high on my follow-through. (And, you know, my forehand is my shot.) The Dartfish system also allows for the insertion -- right there, on the computer monitor, in a shed behind the courts -- of a film clip of a tennis star doing what you have been doing, only correctly. Suddenly, there was Tommy Haas and his forehand and me and my forehand, in sync. Instructive, in that way tennis can be. 
 From the shed we walked to a complex of machines like nothing I had seen before -- not standard ball machines but batting cages for tennis, six of them arrayed in a horseshoe. For the next 45 minutes we hit and hit forehands, with Dave gently barking at us to bend our knees and turn our shoulders and ''kiss the guns!'' -- that is, finish our swings high enough that our biceps were in our faces. Before heading to the courts for a few more hours of practicing our forehands in various drills, we took a lunch break, and walking there I learned that my Seattle classmates (he has a big job at Microsoft, she's home with their young children) had taken other vacations together like this one, most recently a full-family one built around ski instruction. I have to say I didn't get it: Wasn't the whole point of something like this that, under the guise of rigorous self-improvement, you get to be utterly, guiltlessly, self-indulgent? 
 The days blurred together, blissfully, the way they must for kids who actually enjoy summer camp. Day 2 was serves and backhands, Day 3 was overheads and volleys. The sun shone, Dave explained in morning class about the body's kinetic chain, the digital camera rolled, the machines fired balls at me, my glutes tightened. My classmates kept threatening to skip a sessionand take a hike, but no chance: they were every bit as hooked as I was. We could see how one another's shots were actually, demonstrably getting better -- not consistently, not even half the time, but once in a while, which is to say enough of the time. And I could hear that I was doing things correctly now and then: the whoosh at my ear when, while serving, I kept my elbow out in front of my hand and then pronated my forearm; that certain gentle, thudless ponk when I managed to get real, loopy topspin on my seriously erratic one-handed backhand. 
 Interestingly, not until the last hour of camp on Day 3 did we actually play a game of tennis. ''Adults -- especially the types who show up at a tennis camp -- tend to be very focused on outcomes,'' Dave had said when we had dinner together one night. ''Wanting to win gets in the way of wanting to do things efficiently.'' Too true: No sooner had the four of us begun a set of doubles as the warm, dry afternoon cooled than I was doing everything (opening up on the forehand, not bending on the backhand . . .) I had paid to be purged of. Dave never stopped firmly admonishing our faults between points, and we never, or mostly never, got down on ourselves about it. It's easier hearing criticism and facing your limitations -- facing the fact that you will never be all that good, really -- when you are old enough to have done a few things in your life, which I guess is what places like tennis camps for middle-age club players have to count on. ''I submit that tennis is the most beautiful sport there is,'' David Foster Wallace wrote somewhere, and I would submit that my time at the college at Green Valley Spa brought that beauty closer, even as it confirmed how unobtainable it was certain to remain.

HEADLINE: No More Aid for the Affluent

BYLINE: By CAROL KELLERMANN

 BODY:
Long after the recession and political crises are history, Albany will continue to be pressed fiscally, unless changes are made in three big areas of state spending: Medicaid, education and employee benefits, which together account for 70 percent of the budget. 
 MEDICAID The program's long-term care provisions drive overall Medicaid spending, and New York has such loose eligibility policies that many relatively well-off families can claim benefits. Fully 32 percent of all elderly-services beneficiaries nationwide are in New York, though our share of the population in poverty is just 7 percent. Albany will need to make cuts to Medicaid soon; restricting access to long-term care benefits so they go only to the truly needy is the place to start.
 SCHOOL AID There is no question we should continue helping lower-income students. But New York spends too much on educating the wealthy. During the 2007-2008 school year, the richest 10 percent of New York school districts were spending $28,754 per pupil, almost three times the national average. Why did the state provide $3,809 per pupil to support such lavish spending in those districts? That money could be saved, or better spent elsewhere.
 STATE EMPLOYEE BENEFITS State employees can retire after only 10 years and get lifetime health care for themselves, their spouses and dependents for just 10 percent of the premium for an employee and 25 percent for a family, even if they go on to another job. By 2014, state employee benefits will add 60 percent on top of their salaries. And, despite the recent adoption of a new, less generous pension tier, pension costs are expected to increase 132 percent during those three years. This is untenable.
 Even if revenues fall no further and state leaders manage to agree to $5 billion in spending reductions this year, the budget gap in three years will still be a formidable $12.4 billion. To close it without raising New York's already high taxes, entitlements must end for those who do not need them.

HEADLINE: The 'What If' of an Israeli Strike

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
In 1981, Israel destroyed Iraq's nuclear reactor at Osirak, declaring it could not live with the chance the country would get a nuclear weapons capability. In 2007, it wiped out a North Korean-built reactor in Syria. And the next year, the Israelis secretly asked the Bush administration for the equipment and overflight rights they might need some day to strike Iran's much better-hidden, better-defended nuclear sites.
 They were turned down, but the request added urgency to the question: Would Israel take the risk of a strike? And if so, what would follow?
 Now that parlor game question has turned into more formal war games simulations. The government's own simulations are classified, but the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution created its own in December. The results were provocative enough that a summary of them has circulated among top American government and military officials and in many foreign capitals. 
 For the sake of verisimilitude, former top American policymakers and intelligence officials -- some well known -- were added to the mix. They played the president and his top advisers; the Israeli prime minister and cabinet; and Iranian leaders. They were granted anonymity to be able to play their roles freely, without fear of blowback. (This reporter was invited as an observer.) A report by Kenneth M. Pollack, who directed the daylong simulation, can be found at the Saban Center's Web site.
 A caution: Simulations compress time and often oversimplify events. Often they underestimate the risk of error -- for example, that by using faulty intelligence leaders can misinterpret a random act as part of a pattern of aggression. In this case, the actions of the American and Israeli teams seemed fairly plausible; the players knew the bureaucracy and politics of both countries well. Predicting Iran's moves was another matter, since little is known about its decision-making process. --DAVID E. SANGER
 1. ISRAEL ATTACKS
 Without telling the U.S. in advance, Israel strikes at six of Iran's most critical nuclear facilities, using a refueling base hastily set up in the Saudi Arabian desert without Saudi knowledge. (It is unclear to the Iranians if the Saudis were active participants or not.)
 Already-tense relations between the White House and Israel worsen rapidly, but the lack of advance notice allows Washington to say truthfully that it had not condoned the attack.
 2. U.S. STEPS IN
 In a series of angry exchanges, the U.S. demands that Israel cease its attacks, though some in Washington view the moment as an opportunity to further weaken the Iranian government, particularly the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
 Telling Israel it has made a mess, Washington essentially instructs the country to sit in a corner while the United States tries to clean things up.
 3. U.S. SENDS WEAPONS
 Even while calling for restraint on all sides, the U.S. deploys more Patriot antimissile batteries and Aegis cruisers around the region, as a warning to Iran not to retaliate. Even so, some White House advisers warn against being sucked into the conflict, believing that Israel's real strategy is to lure America into finishing the job with additional attacks on the damaged Iranian facilities.
 4. IRAN STRIKES BACK
 Despite warnings, Iran fires missiles at Israel, including its nuclear weapons complex at Dimona, but damage and casualties are minimal. Meanwhile, two of Iran's proxies, Hezbollah and Hamas, launch attacks in Israel and fire rockets into the country.
 Believing it already has achieved its main goal of setting back the nuclear program by years, Israel barely responds.
 5. IRAN SEES OPPORTUNITIES
 Iran, while wounded, sees long-term opportunities to unify its people - and to roll over its opposition parties - on nationalistic grounds. Its strategy is to mount low-level attacks on Israel while portraying the United States as a paper tiger - unable to control its ally and unwilling to respond to Iran.
 Convinced that the Saudis had colluded with the Israelis, and emboldened by the measured initial American position, Iran fires missiles at the Saudi oil export processing center at Abqaiq, and tries to incite Shiite Muslims in eastern Saudi Arabia to attack the Saudi regime.
 Iran also conducts terror attacks against European targets, in hopes that governments there will turn on Israel and the United States.
 6. IRAN AVOIDS U.S. TARGETS
 After a meeting of its divided leadership, Iran decides against directly attacking any American targets - to avoid an all-out American response.
 7. STRIFE IN ISRAEL
 Though Iran's retaliation against Israel causes only modest damage, critics in the Israeli media say the country's leaders, by failing to respond to every attack, have weakened the credibility of the nation's deterrence. Hezbollah fires up to 100 rockets a day into northern Israel, with some aimed at Haifa and Tel Aviv.
 The Israeli economy comes to a virtual halt, and Israeli officials, urging American intervention, complain that one-third of the country's population is living in shelters. Hundreds of thousands flee Haifa and Tel Aviv.
 8. ISRAEL FIRES BACK
 Israel finally wins American acquiescence to retaliate against Hezbollah. It orders a 48-hour campaign by air and special forces against Lebanon and begins to prepare a much larger air and ground operation.
 9. IRAN PLAYS THE OIL CARD
 Knowing that its ultimate weapon is its ability to send oil prices sky high, Iran decides to attack Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, an oil industry center, with conventional missiles and begins mining the Strait of Hormuz.
 A Panamanian-registered, Americanowned tanker and an American minesweeper are severely damaged. The price of oil spikes, though temporarily.
 10. U.S. BOOSTS FORCES
 Unable to sit on the sidelines while oil supplies and American forces are threatened, Washington begins a massive military reinforcement of the Gulf region.
 11. REVERBERATIONS
 The game ends eight days after the initial Israeli strike. But it is clear the United States was leaning toward destroying all Iranian air, ground and sea targets in and around the Strait of Hormuz, and that Iran's forces were about to suffer a significant defeat. Debate breaks out over how much of Iran's nuclear program was truly crippled, and whether the country had secret backup facilities that could be running in just a year or two.
 A REPORTER'S OBSERVATIONS
 1. By attacking without Washington's advance knowledge, Israel had the benefits of surprise and momentum - not only over the Iranians, but over its American allies - and for the first day or two, ran circles around White House crisis managers.
 2. The battle quickly sucked in the whole region - and Washington. Arab leaders who might have quietly applauded an attack against Iran had to worry about the reaction in their streets. The war shifted to defending Saudi oil facilities, and Iran's use of proxies meant that other regional players quickly became involved.
 3. You can bomb facilities, but you can't bomb knowledge. Iran had not only scattered its facilities, but had also scattered its scientific and engineering leadership, in hopes of rebuilding after an attack.
 4. No one won, and the United States and Israel measured success differently. In Washington, officials believed setting the Iranian program back only a few years was not worth the huge cost. In Israel, even a few years delay seemed worth the cost, and the Israelis argued that it could further undercut a fragile regime and perhaps speed its demise. Most of the Americans thought that was a pipe dream. --D.E.S.

HEADLINE: Seller as Lender

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
FOR most home sellers, their ties to a property end at the closing. But for a few others the attachment can continue on for years, because they also assume the role of banker. 
 Seller financing, in which an owner offers a buyer a mortgage, was almost unheard of over the last decade, when money was cheap and lenders vied aggressively for borrowers with myriad mortgage products. But as lending conditions have since tightened drastically and the housing market has softened, seller financing is emerging as an option for both parties. 
 The terms for these transactions may be different from what borrowers would find through conventional lenders, but real estate experts say they are otherwise straightforward. An owner typically agrees to transfer title to the home in exchange for a note and a security interest in the property. The note is paid off like a conventional mortgage, though to the seller instead of a bank. Closing costs may be slightly lower: there's no need for an appraisal, for instance, because the seller already knows a property's value. 
 Walter Molony, a spokesman for the National Association of Realtors, said seller financing was common in the early '80s, when rates on the 30-year fixed mortgage rate topped 16 percent ''and conventional financing ground to a virtual standstill.''
 ''After interest rates gradually declined it became less important,'' Mr. Molony said. ''But today it remains an important tool in higher-cost markets.''
 Elise M. Barry, the chief executive of the Manhattan Association of Realtors and the Manhattan MLS Inc., says condominium developers, in particular, will sometimes offer financing to help sell the last units in a project. 
 Also, prospective buyers typically cannot qualify for traditional financing unless 70 percent of the building is sold, if it's a new development, according to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored companies that set the underwriting rules for most mortgages. In some cases, Fannie Mae will waive that requirement, even with as few as half the units sold.
 Albert Laboz, a principal of United American Land, a family-owned developer based in Manhattan, said that earlier this month he had begun offering five-year mortgages at 5.99 percent to buyers at SoHo Mews, a 68-unit development on West Broadway and Wooster Street.
 Mr. Laboz said his building's units -- mostly two-bedrooms listed for about $2 million -- sold slowly last year. The units that did sell, he said, were all-cash transactions. 
 ''Since we were under 50 percent sold, nobody could qualify for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac financing,'' he said. ''And nobody else, really, was financing.''
 At that point, Mr. Laboz said, his company sought the approval of its construction lender to offer loans to buyers who made down payments of at least 35 percent.
 The 5.99 percent interest rate is competitive with those of so-called jumbo mortgages, defined as being above $729,750 in Manhattan. But Mr. Laboz conceded that the loan terms would discourage some borrowers: they would have to refinance the loan or pay it off fully within five years. But he said the loans were meant for those who could not obtain financing elsewhere.
 One buyer has qualified for this financing, he said, though the market has improved since his company started the financing program, and now more than half of the building is sold.
 Mr. Laboz said he would still offer the loans, partly because the Fannie and Freddie mortgage limit of $729,750 may not be enough for prospective buyers.
 Neil Garfinkel, a real estate lawyer in Manhattan, said more affluent borrowers like those buying at SoHo Mews might be more likely to refinance out of a five-year mortgage than someone buying at the lower end of the market with less room for error. ''If you're borrowing $200,000 and you're having trouble finding a loan today,'' he said, ''who knows where you'll be five years from now?''

A Consumption Surtax
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Hey, Big Spender: You Need a Surtax'' (Economic View, March 21), in which Robert H. Frank suggested a tax on large amounts of consumer spending: 
 As one presumably targeted by that proposed progressive consumption tax, I consider it a very reasonable idea -- but only if it were used to reduce the tax burden on those less fortunate while still trying to shrink our ever-growing government. 
 I fear, though, that the revenue from this tax would instead be used just to fund more spending. In this case, this tax would simply feed the beast. A reasonable idea shouldn't be used to further our way down the path to doom.

 The writer is managing and founding principal of AQR Capital Management.
 To the Editor:
 To me, a progressive consumption surtax on high levels of spending looks good all around: it would shore up the abysmally low national savings rate and cause government revenue to grow. 
 As proposed in the column, it would also have two other advantages over a value-added tax or national sales tax: it wouldn't have a regressive impact, and would avoid having the federal government dip into a prime revenue source for state governments.
 A final positive aspect is that Milton Friedman, the Nobel laureate and conservative icon, supported a consumption tax. That should help the idea draw more favor. David J. Klock

HEADLINE: AGENCIES SUSPECT IRAN IS PLANNING NEW ATOMIC SITES

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Six months after the revelation of a secret nuclear enrichment site in Iran, international inspectors and Western intelligence agencies say they suspect that Tehran is preparing to build more sites in defiance of United Nations demands.
 The United Nations inspectors assigned to monitor Iran's nuclear program are now searching for evidence of two such sites, prompted by recent comments by a top Iranian official that drew little attention in the West, and are looking into a mystery about the whereabouts of recently manufactured uranium enrichment equipment. 
 In an interview with the Iranian Student News Agency, the official, Ali Akbar Salehi, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, said President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had ordered work to begin soon on two new plants. The plants, he said, ''will be built inside mountains,'' presumably to protect them from attacks.
 ''God willing,'' Mr. Salehi was quoted as saying, ''we may start the construction of two new enrichment sites'' in the Iranian new year, which began March 21. 
 The revelation that inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, now believe that there may be two new sites comes at a crucial moment in the White House's attempts to impose tough new sanctions against Iran. 
 When President Obama publicly revealed the evidence of the hidden site at Qum last September, his aides had hoped the announcement would make it easier to win international support for a fourth round of economic sanctions, particularly from a reluctant China and Russia. Since then, however, the White House has been struggling to persuade those countries to go along with the toughest sanctions and the administration is now being forced to scale back its proposed list of sanctions.
 The United Nations inspectors operate separately from the diplomats who are developing sanctions. Still, the disclosures may be intended, at least in part, to underscore the belief of Western officials that the Iranian efforts are speeding ahead, and the assertions could aid in efforts to press Iran to open up locations long closed to inspectors. 
 This article was based on interviews with officials of several governments and international agencies deeply involved in the hunt for additional nuclear sites in Iran, and familiar with the work of the I.A.E.A., the only organization with regular access to Iran's known nuclear facilities. All the officials insisted on anonymity because the search involves not only satellite surveillance, but also intelligence gleaned from highly classified operations. 
 American officials say they share the I.A.E.A.'s suspicions and are examining satellite evidence about a number of suspected sites. But they have found no solid clues yet that Iran intends to use them to produce nuclear fuel, and they are less certain about the number of sites Iran may be planning. 
 In any case, no new processing site would pose an immediate threat or change the American estimates that it will still take Iran one to four years to obtain the capability to build a nuclear weapon. Given the complexity of building and opening new plants, it would probably take several years for the country to enrich uranium at any of the new sites.
 One European official noted that ''while we have some evidence,'' Iran's heavy restrictions on where inspectors can travel and the existence of numerous tunneling projects were making the detection of any new enrichment plants especially difficult.
 Iran boasted several months ago, after the disclosure of the Qum site, that it would build 10 more enrichment plants in coming years. That number was dismissed by American officials and others as a fantasy, far beyond Iran's abilities, or its budget. 
 But I.A.E.A. inspectors in Vienna now believe that Mr. Salehi was probably accurate when he referred to two sites. 
 According to American officials, in recent weeks Israel -- which uncovered some of the evidence about Qum -- has pressed the case with their American counterparts that evidence points to what one senior administration official called ''Qum look-alikes.'' 
 The most compelling circumstantial evidence, people familiar with the inspectors' view say, is that while Iran appears to be making new equipment to enrich uranium, that equipment is not showing up in the main plant that inspectors visit regularly. Nor is it at the Natanz site in the desert, or the new facility at Qum, which inspectors now visit periodically. 
 That has heightened suspicions that the equipment, produced in small factories around Iran, is being held in a clandestine storage area for later shipment or installed elsewhere. 
 The small manufacturing factories, spread around Iran to avoid detection and sabotage, are a particular target of American, Israeli and European intelligence agencies. Several of the plants appear to have been penetrated by intelligence agencies, which are receiving sporadic reports about what Iran is producing and troubles it has encountered in manufacturing centrifuges, the machines that spin at very high speeds to enrich uranium. 
 Assessments of the potential for hidden enrichment sites beyond Qum, and the continued production of centrifuges, is one of the main subjects of an update to the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate on Iran. That update is being prepared for distribution to President Obama, his top national security team, and selected members of Congress.
 Drafts of the highly classified document are now being circulated inside the intelligence community, officials say, but its broader publication has been delayed, in part because of concerns that the early drafts failed to deal with key decisions that Mr. Obama must soon address, especially if long-delayed sanctions fail to change Iran's current course.
 When the last intelligence estimate was published, in November 2007, officials did not know about the Qum plant. Evidence of the plant was discovered later, and contributed to criticism of the report, which also concluded that Iran had halted work on designing nuclear weapons in 2003.
 That conclusion, officials say, is also being rewritten, with the United States now joining European and Israeli assessments that research and development work, if halted seven years ago, has probably resumed. ''The new report walks away, carefully, from many of the key conclusions of the previous version,'' said one person familiar with its contents. 
 Besides Qum, it is unclear whether the new conclusion is based on new intelligence breakthroughs, or a revised interpretation of the existing evidence.
 Iran revealed the existence of the Qum plant to the I.A.E.A. last September, apparently after learning that its existence was now known to the West. Iran subsequently told inspectors that it began work on the plant in 2007 and planned to complete it by 2011, and that it would be filled with 3,000 centrifuges.
 Though Tehran's leaders insist the plant, like their entire program, is for peaceful purposes, that is considered too few centrifuges for a commercial site but ideal for a clandestine military plant meant to make bomb fuel.
 But little progress has been made. In their most recent report, the inspectors said that some construction at the Qum site was continuing, adding, however, that ''no centrifuges had been introduced'' as of Feb. 16.
 But officials note that for all the digging, nuclear fuel production in Iran is behind schedule. While the Qum plant is only partly built, its main enrichment plant, at Natanz, operates at a tiny fraction of its intended capacity. 
 If Iran is indeed making plans to build new facilities, it would be in violation of its agreement with the I.A.E.A. In reports and interviews, inspectors have said they received no notice of new Iranian preparatory activity.
 In 2003, Iran signed an agreement with the agency to turn over design information on new facilities. Iran repudiated the agreement in March 2007.

HEADLINE: A Giant-Killer, Feeling His Oats

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Is this it, then? He hath slain the health-care Goliath. Does that mean, a year and a half into the job, that President Obama has acquired the political savvy and tactical confidence to take on other juggernauts?
 Amidst all the euphoria at the White House last week, that question hovered; and not just in Washington. More than a dozen foreign leaders called to congratulate Mr. Obama on his historic achievement. Editorial pages around the world lauded Mr. Obama -- a British magazine swooned that he could perhaps ''out achieve'' even Franklin Roosevelt. A Financial Times cartoon depicted Mr. Obama as Superman. 
 But, at the risk of killing the White House buzz, remember President Bush's Mission Accomplished appearance on the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln? Political fortunes can turn quickly, especially since, in Mr. Obama's case, he still has another two and a half years to go in his first term -- plenty of time for other things to go wrong that could stain his presidency.
 The trick now for Mr. Obama, presidential scholars say, will be to turn the lessons he has learned in the health care fight to the other big, intractable issues that loom, from climate change to unemployment, to Iran, and even to the ultimate behemoth that has bedeviled American presidents since 1967: Middle East peace.
 We'll come back to that in a second.
 Mr. Obama could retire into the history books, many presidential scholars say, on the health care achievement alone. But there is a swagger emanating from the White House that suggests he may now have acquired a liking for the benefits of sticking his neck out to lead.
 Just days after the health vote, Mr. Obama completed a landmark arms control accord with Russia that had eluded negotiators for months. The Start agreement took far more time to reach than Mr. Obama had expected, exceeding the deadline by four months. But in the end, Russia backed down on the last contentious point. That was after Mr. Obama refused to yield to Russian demands on missile defense, even though he risked missing another looming deadline, the nuclear security summit he will host in April.
 ''Had Obama lost the health care vote, he would have been politically damaged,'' said David Rothkopf, a Clinton administration official now who writes on foreign policy. ''And that would have had an effect on everything else. But the major transformational consequence of winning isn't a political boost, but the fact that he is now learning on the job. The message is that he is starting to come of age as a leader.''
 How Mr. Obama applies the lessons of health care to other issues will be a big part of determining his success, many presidential historians say. Tenacity isn't necessarily enough; there has to be patience and a willingness, at some point, to draw a line in the sand.
 After the fractious Copenhagen climate change summit in December, Mr. Obama sounded much more willing to accept compromise and the imperfect. After pushing and prodding, he reached a deal with China, India, Brazil and South Africa that codified commitments by those countries to act on their own to tackle global warming. But the agreement failed to set a 2010 goal for reaching a binding international treaty to seal the provisions of the accord. Nor did it commit either the industrialized or the developing nations to firm targets for mid- or long-term reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
 For Mr. Obama, it was, at best, the equivalent of hitting a single in baseball. He defended the pact as a flawed but essential step forward, saying he was ''making the best of the situation that you're in at this point, and then continually trying to improve and make progress from there.''
 Fast forward three months to Friday, post health-care victory, as Mr. Obama took his second victory lap of the week, on the Russian arms control agreement, the equivalent of a double in baseball. ''It took patience, it took perseverance,'' Mr. Obama said. ''But we never gave up.''
 Nor, this week, did Mr. Obama settle for a smaller compromise with Israel. Instead, he shocked even the most hardened Middle East peace negotiators by swinging for the fence, demanding of Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, a firm commitment to rein in settlement construction in East Jerusalem.
 The stakes on this issue are sky-high. Most Middle East experts say there can be no final Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement without resolving Jerusalem. Mr. Netanyahu's governing coalition views the city, east and west, as the undivided, eternal capital of the Jewish people, in which they can build where they want. The Palestinians and supporters throughout the Arab and Muslim worlds see East Jerusalem as holy, and rightfully under Palestinian sovereignty.
 In refusing last week to settle for Mr. Netanyahu's compromise offers, including restrictions on Israeli troop activities in the West Bank, the freeing of Palestinian prisoners and further efforts to bolster the Palestinian economy, Mr. Obama sent Mr. Netanyahu back to Israel empty-handed, lengthening the deepest crisis between the two allies in years. The Israeli press has written that Mr. Netanyahu was ambushed, Mr. Obama has come under fire from the pro-Israel lobby in Washington and from Republican lawmakers. Even some Democrats have privately questioned whether he has gone too far.
 It no doubt will be months, if not years, before anyone will know how the Israel standoff will end. But Mr. Obama, in pushing Mr. Netanyahu, is forcing the Israeli prime minister into a stark choice, argues Martin Indyk, a former United States ambassador to Israel and the vice president and director of foreign policy at the Brookings Institution: ''He's pushing the issue for Bibi, and forcing him to answer this question: Do you want to be Bibi, the politician?'' Mr. Indyk said, using Mr. Netanyahu's nickname.
 ''Or do you want to be a statesman?''

HEADLINE: Tea Party Crowd Rallies in Nevada With a Challenge to a Homegrown Democrat

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
SEARCHLIGHT, Nev. -- Several thousand people converged on this small town on Saturday for what was billed as a showdown with its most famous native, and one of the highest ranking Democrats in Congress, Senator Harry Reid.
 The show put on by a group called the Tea Party Express included Tea Party country songs and Tea Party rappers, but the biggest draw for many in the crowd was Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and Republican vice-presidential candidate, who held the crowd rapt despite a desert dust storm.
 Waving her ''poor man's teleprompter'' as she called her hand, she hit all the Tea Party high notes about the need to bring the government back in line with the Constitution, as well as some of her now-standard punch lines. (''How's that hopey-changey thing working out for you?'' and, ''We need a commander in chief, not a professor of constitutional law giving us a lecture.'') 
 ''We're saying the big government, big debt, Obama-Pelosi-Reid spending spree is over, you're fired!'' she told the crowd. ''We're not going to sit down and shut up.''
 The four-hour rally was the kickoff to a planned three-week tour by the Tea Party Express, a three-bus caravan that will hold events across the country as it winds its way to Washington for the Tea Party rally on tax day. The group brought in a small fleet of bulldozers and dump trucks a few days before the rally to regrade about 20 acres of land just outside the town's main street, expecting that 10,000 people would show.
 The crowd may not have been quite that big, but recreational vehicles and cars began winding down the dirt road to the rally site 24 hours in advance. Overnight, people set bonfires to keep warm against high winds. A steady stream of cars began arriving at 6 a.m. Saturday and continued until noon, when the rally began. People huddled under blankets with their children and their coffee makers, and walked up the hills around the site carrying American and ''Don't Tread on Me'' flags.
 Mr. Reid, the Senate majority leader, was hardly the crowd's only target. ''Liar, Thug, Traitor, Commie Usurper,'' read one woman's homemade poster, next to a picture of President Obama as the devil. Many signs decried the health care legislation passed last week. ''This is America, how dare they ignore us?'' read one. ''The 219 Yes Voters' Names Go Down in History and in Shame,'' read another. 
 Speaker after speaker denounced Democrats for portraying Tea Party members as angry and violent, saying they did not believe members had been behind the bricks thrown at some Democrats' windows after passage of the health care bill. One speaker doubted Representative John Lewis's account that he had been spat on by a protester at a Tea Party rally on the Capitol, challenging him to a $10,000 bet to produce proof or take a lie detector test. Debbie Landis, the leader of Anger Is Brewing, a Nevada Tea Party group and local sponsor of the event, noted that her group held candidate forums and legislative action alerts: ''not one of those activities involves a brick,'' she said.
 Mr. Reid was in Las Vegas, about 60 miles away, for the opening of a new shooting park with Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association at his side. There, Mr. Reid recalled fondly his small-town upbringing and his first gun, as well as his long friendship with Mr. LaPierre.
 The majority leader, a former lightweight boxer, was not one to completely back away from the showdown: he had set up a ''hospitality tent'' tent in Searchlight at the Nugget casino, the size of a small rest stop and perhaps the largest building in town. There, workers served tea and doughnut holes -- herbal tea, because, a spokesman said, the Tea Party crowd did not seem to need more caffeine. The snacks were a nod to the gap in Medicare prescription drug coverage known as the doughnut hole, which the health care bill seeks to close. 
 ''I'm happy so many people came to see my hometown of Searchlight and spend their out-of-state money, especially in these tough economic times,'' Mr. Reid said in a statement. ''Ultimately, though, this election will be decided by Nevadans, not people from other states who parachute in for one day to have a tea party.''
 Tea Party members shouted out their home states: Illinois! Idaho! Indiana! Many others came from Arizona and California.
 Basil Kelley, 55, drove 1,100 miles from Aurora, Ore. ''We are here because we have got to get off the couch, we got to take this country back, back to the Constitution,'' Mr. Kelley said. ''For the first time in my life I am seeing Congress act in the exact opposite way that people are asking.''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 30, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article in some editions on Sunday about a Tea Party Express rally in Nevada at which several speakers denounced Democrats for portraying Tea Party members as angry and violent paraphrased incorrectly from comments by one speaker who said that he doubted an account of how Representative John Lewis was treated during a Tea Party rally outside the Capitol recently. The speaker said he did not believe that protesters had shouted racial epithets at Mr. Lewis; he did not say the account was about protesters spitting at the congressman. (A spokesman for Representative Emanuel Cleaver II of Missouri said Mr. Cleaver had been spat on by a protester outside the Capitol. )

HEADLINE: States Seek to Tax Services, From Head to Toe

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
In the scramble to find something, anything, to generate more revenue, states are considering new taxes on virtually everything: garbage pickup, dating services, bowling night, haircuts, even clowns.
 ''It's hard enough doing what we do,'' grumbled John Luke, a plumber in the Philadelphia suburbs. His services would, for the first time, come with an added tax if the governor has his way. 
 Opponents of imposing taxes on services like funerals, legal advice, helicopter rides and dry cleaning argue that this push comes as businesses are barely clinging to life and can ill afford to see customers further put off by new taxes. This is especially true, they say, in states like Michigan and Pennsylvania, where some of the most sweeping proposals are being considered this spring.
 But this is also a period of economic gloom for states. Pension funds are in the red, federal stimulus help will soon vanish, and revenues from traditional sources like income and property taxes are slumping ever lower, with few elected officials willing to risk voter wrath by raising them. 
 ''This is born out of necessity,'' said Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, a Democrat. His proposed budget, being debated in Harrisburg, would tax services including accounting, advertising and data processing.
 Mr. Rendell argues that the state's current sales tax system makes no sense. (Why, he asks, is the popcorn in his state's movie theaters taxed, but the candy is not?)
 ''Look, I'm not a crazy tax guy,'' Mr. Rendell said, reflecting on recent trims to the budget. ''I know what we've cut the last two years, and I know how deep and painful the cuts have been. So I know that in the future there's going to have to be a revenue increase, and this is the best of the alternatives, obviously none of which we're happy about.''
 Michigan's revenues, adjusted for inflation, have sunk to a level last seen in the 1960s. And that may be exactly what at long last pushes through wide acceptance for taxes on more services, according to supporters of the idea, who say it makes sense in an economy that has long been service-based. In the past, such taxes have never quite been able to survive the political tussle.
 A handful of states, including Delaware, Hawaii, New Mexico, South Dakota and Washington, already tax all sorts of services. Most states tax at least some services, particularly items like utilities.
 Nevertheless, few states have gone where political leaders in Michigan and Pennsylvania are now suggesting: adding scores of services to their states' sales tax requirement and lowering the tax rate under a widened tax base.
 But from coast to coast, desperate governments are looking to tap into new revenue streams.
 In Nebraska, a lawmaker has introduced a bill to tax armored car services, farm equipment repairs, shoe shines, taxidermy, reflexology and scooter repairs. In Kentucky, Jim Wayne, a state representative, and some fellow Democrats are proposing taxing high-end services: golf greens fees, limousine and hot-air-balloon rides, and private landscaping. 
 In June, voters in Maine will decide whether to accept a state overhaul of its tax system that would newly tax services like tailor alterations, blimp rides, and entertainment provided by clowns, comedians and jugglers. 
 Though some say the proposed service taxes face opposition too fierce to succeed in many places, particularly in an election year, even some of the most ardent opponents predict that some of the taxes will scrape through. The current budget misery will probably ''push the idea over the edge'' in at least some states, said Robert D. Fowler, president and chief executive of the Small Business Association of Michigan. 
 ''And they won't be any better off for it, either,'' said Mr. Fowler, who added that his members detested the notion. ''It's the wrong time, in the heat of just trying anything to find money, to have this discussion. 
 ''Yes, we need more money, but is this a step toward turning the economy around?'' Mr. Fowler asked. ''Taking more money out of peoples' pockets? Putting more burdens on small business? It doesn't seem like a recipe for a state turnaround.''
 In the 1930s, with property tax revenues shrinking because of the Great Depression, states began taxing the sales of items. It was simple, and at the time, the tax matched an economy largely based on goods. 
 But as the nation's economy shifted to one focused more on services, the tax system mostly did not budge. And so, in 2009, states raised $230 billion in sales taxes; had they taxed all services, too, according to Joseph Henchman of the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan research group, they might have raised twice that.
 Advocates say taxing services is simply a matter of fairness and good sense, and of spreading out the tax burden as widely as imaginable. If you pay tax for a ring, why should you be exempt from paying it for a manicure? But even those who agree in principle wrestle with the details. Should a bakery be taxed for the accounting work or lawn care it gets, only to pass along that cost to its customers in the price of cookies? Some in the world of taxes would describe that as pyramiding. And what to do about all the industries that would, naturally, line up for exemptions?
 ''In truth, a lot of people like this concept of being taxed on what they use,'' said Bill Farmer, a Republican state representative in Kentucky, who has suggested a tax on services if it was wed to the demise of the state's income tax. ''Then they say, 'But please don't tax me because I'm a lawyer.' Or 'But please don't tax me because I'm a grass cutter, an accountant, anything.' '' (Mr. Farmer, for the record, is a tax accountant.)
 In years past, large plans to tax services have become law, only to face sudden, sometimes embarrassing repeals in places like Florida and Maryland. In Michigan, lawmakers agreed in 2007 to a tax on services (in an episode Mr. Fowler recalls as ''a last minute, midnight deal''), only to repeal it amid widespread public opposition the very day it went into effect.
 Supporters say the new plan in Michigan, put forth by Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm, a Democrat, would solve some of the earlier complaints. In addition to adding more than 100 types of services to the 26 the state already taxes, she says she wants to lower the sales tax rate to 5.5 percent from the current 6 percent, phase out a surcharge on a business tax and direct savings to education. 
 Ultimately, says Robert J. Kleine, the Michigan treasurer, the tax on services would mean $1.8 billion a year in new revenue.
 ''The basic thing is that we need to update our tax structure,'' Mr. Kleine said. ''We've got a 20th-century tax structure based on a different sort of economy. The tax base doesn't grow as the economy grows.''
 Ms. Granholm, like Mr. Rendell, cannot seek re-election this year because of term limits (something opponents of taxing services say provides a hint at how unpopular the whole idea must be with the voting public).
 Michael D. Bishop, the Republican majority leader in the State Senate, said this was one more case of Michigan's problems being dumped onto consumers who ''cannot afford anything else'' and businesses who ''are being run out on a rail.'' 
 People like Pete Tomassoni, whose third-generation bowling alley in Iron Mountain, Mich., has 20 percent less business so far this year than early last year, deemed taxation of his $3 games ''a terrible idea.''
 Still, some believe the notion is certain to grow more palatable as states grasp the depths of their woes. State Senator Cap Dierks of Nebraska, who has pushed for a services tax in part because of his worries about the mounting burdens of property taxes on farmers and ranchers, said he thought such taxes were inevitable.
 ''I got a lot of negative vibes when I introduced it, but eventually, we'll have to look at it,'' he said. ''What else are you going to do?''

HEADLINE: Obama Bypasses Senate Process, Filling 15 posts

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Steven Greenhouse contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama, making a muscular show of his executive authority just one day after Congress left for spring recess, said Saturday that he would bypass the Senate and install 15 appointees, including a union lawyer whose nomination to the National Labor Relations Board was blocked last month with the help of two Democrats.
 Coming on the heels of Mr. Obama's big victory on health care legislation, Saturday's move suggests a newly emboldened president who is unafraid to provoke a confrontation with the minority party.
 Just two days ago, all 41 Senate Republicans sent Mr. Obama a letter urging him not to appoint the union lawyer, Craig Becker, during the recess. Mr. Obama's action, in defiance of the Republicans, was hailed by union leaders, but it also seemed certain to intensify the partisan rancor that has enveloped Washington. 
 ''The United States Senate has the responsibility to approve or disprove of my nominees,'' Mr. Obama said in a statement. ''But if, in the interest of scoring political points, Republicans in the Senate refuse to exercise that responsibility, I must act in the interest of the American people and exercise my authority to fill these positions on an interim basis.''
 It was the first time the president has used his constitutional authority to fill vacant federal positions by making recess appointments, thus avoiding the requirement for the advice and consent of the Senate. Mr. Obama, who currently has 217 nominees pending and 77 awaiting action on the Senate floor, said Republicans had given him little choice. 
 ''At a time of economic emergency, two top appointees to the Department of Treasury have been held up for nearly six months,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I simply cannot allow partisan politics to stand in the way of the basic functioning of government.''
 With lawmakers back in their home states and Mr. Obama spending a quiet family weekend at Camp David, the White House issued the statement announcing the president's intent to appoint Mr. Becker, and 14 others, mostly to fill positions on his economic and homeland security teams. 
 The White House said the 15 nominees had been waiting, on average, seven months to be confirmed. They are expected to begin work over the next week; the president's action will enable them to serve without Senate confirmation until the chamber adjourns at the end of 2011.
 Republicans, who have cast Mr. Becker as a pro-labor radical, issued a flurry of angry statements. They wasted little time in reminding reporters that when George W. Bush was president, then-Senator Obama had railed against the recess appointment of John R. Bolton as ambassador to the United Nations, saying that Mr. Bolton would be ''damaged goods'' and lacked credibility without Senate confirmation.
 Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, called the president's move ''yet another episode of choosing a partisan path despite bipartisan opposition.'' 
 Another Republican, Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, said in an interview that he could understand Mr. Obama's frustration; he said that most of the other nominees were noncontroversial and that his concern was centered primarily on Mr. Becker. ''He has a precedent,'' Mr. Coburn said of the president, ''Others have done it, so I'm not critical of him doing it. But I am critical of the Becker appointment because he doesn't have the votes.''
 Recess appointments are a common tool for presidents frustrated by the confirmation process. Mr. Obama's action puts him on a par with Mr. Bush, who had made 15 recess appointments by this point in his presidency. Mr. Bush had an especially intense tussle with Democrats over judicial appointees; during the course of his two terms in office, he made a total of 171 recess appointments, although 72 were to part-time positions, according to the Congressional Research Service. President Clinton made 139 recess appointments.
 With the exception of Mr. Becker, the White House said most of the 15 nominees being installed by Mr. Obama have bipartisan support. Indeed, in a sign that Mr. Obama did not want to go too far in inflaming partisan passions, he resisted using his executive powers to install one of his most contentious candidates, Dawn Johnsen, an Indiana University law professor, to lead the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department. Ms. Johnsen has drawn the ire of Republicans for her work as a lawyer for NARAL Pro-Choice America as well as her outspoken opposition to the Bush administration's counterterrorism policies.
 Saturday's announcement is certain to cheer some of Mr. Obama's strongest supporters, who have been arguing that the president should take on Republicans in a more forceful way. Gay rights advocates were elated to see Chai R. Feldblum, a Georgetown University Law professor who advocates on gay issues, claim a spot on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as a result of Mr. Obama's action.
 But perhaps no group will be as heartened as union leaders.
 For months they had complained that Mr. Obama was too timid in responding to Republican opposition to Mr. Becker, a former associate general counsel for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the Service Employees International Union. Labor leaders were also unhappy that the labor relations board has been largely paralyzed since January 2008 because only two of its five seats have been filled since then. Mr. Obama also appointed Mark Pearce, a New York labor lawyer, on Saturday to fill a fourth seat on the board.
 Last month, the Democrats fell eight votes short of the 60 needed to overcome a threatened Republican filibuster of a vote for Mr. Becker. Two Democrats, Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas and Ben Nelson of Nebraska, joined Republicans in the 52-to-33 vote.
 In their letter to the president, Republicans wrote that Mr. Becker, a former law professor at U.C.L.A. and the University of Chicago, ''could not be viewed as impartial, unbiased or objective'' in labor board cases. A law review article he wrote, saying that employers should not have a voice in unionization elections, angered many businesses and Republicans. But in Congressional testimony, Mr. Becker said that those were his personal views and as a labor board member, he would follow the letter of the law.
 Two other candidates who are getting recess appointments, Jeffrey Goldstein, the nominee for a high-level job at the Department of Treasury as under secretary for domestic finance, and Alan D. Bersin, the nominee for commissioner of the Customs and Border Protection division of the Department of Homeland Security, were still being vetted by the Senate Finance Committee. Mr. Obama's decision to bypass the vetting drew criticism Saturday from the senior Republican on the panel, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa.
 Mr. Grassley said Mr. Goldstein was still answering the panel's questions about his work for a private equity firm, and Mr. Bersin was answering questions about ''what appeared to be conflicting information about his documentation and disclosure'' of household employees -- questions that, the senator said, were ''directly relevant'' to the positions they will hold.

HEADLINE: Building a No. 1 Defense From Spare Parts

BYLINE: By JONATHAN ABRAMS

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Everything starts with Raymond Felton. He was the consolation prize in the 2005 draft, picked directly behind the All-Star point guards Chris Paul and Deron Williams. 
 Felton hounds the ball handler much of the floor's distance. Up the court, he is flanked by the lane-clogging Gerald Wallace (left unprotected by the Kings in the expansion draft) and Stephen Jackson (requested and granted a trade from the Warriors).
 If the ball is delivered inside, the long limbs of Theo Ratliff (obtained from the Spurs for what amounted to spare change) and Boris Diaw (packaged by the Suns in a trade for Jason Richardson) are post deterrents. 
 The Charlotte Bobcats -- Michael Jordan's Charlotte Bobcats -- are mostly a collection of malcontents, castoffs and also-rans. They are also the N.B.A.'s top defensive team. 
 ''That's what happens sometimes,'' Felton said. ''The league can be weird. You have to have these types of guys, and we're playing well together.''
 In a throwback to slowdowns, the Bobcats allow a thrifty 93.5 points a game. As they seek the franchise's first playoff appearance, their defensive mind-set bodes well. Only one team in the last seven years, the 2006 Memphis Grizzlies, allowed the fewest points but did not advance past the playoff's first round. 
 Charlotte's scores sometimes resemble those of high school games: 79-68, 83-78, 88-76, 80-74, 77-71. More often than not, though, they win. Charlotte is seventh in the Eastern Conference with 10 games to play. 
 Coach Larry Brown, in search of cleansing after a disastrous 2005-6 season with the Knicks, has molded a team greater than the sum of its discarded parts. He is dispelling a major misconception that N.B.A. players neither play nor care for defense. 
 ''When players know coaches value something, they're going to buy in and do what you want them to do,'' the nomadic Brown said. ''They all want to be coached. I've been around very few guys who don't want to be coached.''
 The name Stephon Marbury eluded him at that moment, but he made his point and the theme is continued throughout the roster. 
 Brown's rotation includes Tyrus Thomas (fell out of favor with the Bulls), Larry Hughes (traded by the woeful Knicks to the hapless Kings and released), D. J. Augustin (many felt the Bobcats should have drafted center Brook Lopez) and Tyson Chandler (traded by the Hornets twice, once unsuccessfully and once successfully).
 The players mirror the organization. Jordan's takeover as majority owner brings guarded optimism. For the fan base, the move was akin to the Wizard of Oz's stepping in front of the curtain. As team president, Jordan was mostly heard about here and seen much less often. 
 The two previous owners, George Shinn, who moved the original Charlotte franchise to New Orleans, and Robert Johnson, ostracized the community in their final acts. 
 Past business decisions and a lack of corporate sponsors in a struggling economy hindered the Bobcats. Long after the Hornets led the league in attendance, the Bobcats crowd is finally on the rise, but the team still ranks 22nd, averaging 15,595 fans. 
 ''He can put his thumbprint on the executive side and in the community,'' Dell Curry, a television analyst who spent a decade playing for the Charlotte Hornets, said of Jordan's influence. ''If the Bobcats can get to the playoffs and play well, that will only give them more momentum for next year.''
 To do so, they will rely on their trademark bend-but-don't-break defense. If it starts with Felton, Wallace is the catalyst. He is nicknamed Crash, for his general willingness to run into anything or anyone. 
 Against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday, the Bobcats had a very un-Brown-like start. The Timberwolves amassed 33 points in the first quarter. 
 In the second, Wallace was everywhere. He blocked a Kevin Love shot, stole the ball from Ramon Sessions and blocked and stole a pass from Ronnie Brewer. He blocked Damien Wilkins at the rim, and the impact sent Wilkins to the floor. When Sessions gathered the rebound, he was met at the rim by Chandler, and Sessions joined Wilkins on the floor. 
 Their defense translated to points. The Bobcats orchestrated a 20-0 run, the same differential they had in fast-break points. By halftime, the outcome was clear. Afterward, Timberwolves Coach Kurt Rambis was unsure if the Bobcats' defense or his team's youthfulness had done it in. 
 ''We don't have any one great defensive stopper,'' Wallace said. ''So in order for us to be great defensively, everybody has to be on the same page.'' 
 In a soundtrack that delights Brown's ears, the Bobcats communicate loudly on defense, a cacophony of calls and codes that is one of the most underrated and most important aspects of defense. 
 ''This was a team with great, young talent,'' Chandler said. ''They were just missing a couple pieces. Now, the pieces are starting to come together.''
 The most significant addition is Jackson, whom Charlotte traded for in November. Without his touch, the Bobcats might also be flirting with the league's worst offense. They managed a mere 59 points in their season opener against Boston.
 Asked if he was playing with the best defensive team in his career, Jackson was quick to reply: ''Nope. When I played with the Spurs, that was the best.''
 He added, ''We have the potential to get there, though.''
 Brown placed his Pistons and his Pacers above his Bobcats on defense. They are still too inconsistent: 4-2 against the Cavaliers and the Lakers, but also one of two teams to lose twice to the nine-victory Nets.
 When Brown took over last season, he was astounded that his players were unaware of basic defensive principles. Brown, Jordan and General Manager Rod Higgins have since made trades involving 21 players, mostly for those who are athletic, fast and long. 
 Brown was surprised by Diaw's defense, pleasantly pleased that Jackson displayed willingness on both sides of the ball and happy that the 36-year-old Ratliff had energy in his tank. After the comings and goings, teaching became easier. Brown is still the taskmaster. He also represents the extremes of a perfectionist and a realist. He is leading a team and himself toward redemption one defensive step, principle and practice at a time. 
 ''I don't love the games,'' Brown said. ''I love practice. My biggest fear is I haven't done enough as a coach where these guys encounter something I haven't prepared them for.''

HEADLINE: The Tiger Bubble

BYLINE: By JONATHAN MAHLER. 
Jonathan Mahler, a contributing writer for the magazine, is the author of ''The Challenge: How a Maverick Navy Officer and a Young Law Professor Risked Their Careers to Defend the Constitution -- and Won,'' which is out in paperback.

 BODY:
Not too long ago, 2010 was shaping up as a good year for Tiger Woods. After knee surgery in 2008, Woods returned to competitive golf in 2009 and logged six victories. He led the PGA Tour in prize winnings for the ninth time and was voted player of the year by his peers for the 10th time in his 14 years as a pro. Because of the fortuitous location of this year's marquee tournaments, Woods seemed primed to approach and maybe even equal Jack Nicklaus's record of 18 major championships. In addition to the Masters at Augusta, Ga., where Woods has won four times, the 2010 United States Open will be played in June at Pebble Beach, in California; in 2000, the last time it was played there, Woods won by 15 strokes. The British Open will be held in July at the Old Course at St. Andrews, Scotland, which has hosted the tournament twice in the last decade; Woods won both times, by a combined total of 13 strokes. 
 But then November and December happened. Woods crashed his car on Thanksgiving weekend, and the collateral damage just kept mounting. Rarely has an athlete tumbled as far and as fast as Tiger Woods. In an era in which stories about athletes behaving badly -- gambling, using drugs, carrying weapons -- barely stand out in the news, the revelations of Woods's epic infidelities created a scandal of a whole different order, landing him day after day on the cover of The New York Post (''Tiger Admits: I'm a Cheetah''). In just a few weeks, an image that took more than a decade and untold millions to construct was destroyed. Like all great tabloid tales of falls from grace, this one was anchored in contradiction. The athlete who dominated a sport of discipline, focus and self-control -- his father, an ex-military man, once compared him to Gandhi -- was a sex junkie. Even as Woods's sponsors quickly began to drop him, their advertisements lingered awkwardly throughout America: a life-size image of the world's most famous philanderer greeted airport travelers over Accenture ad copy that read as if it had been written for the occasion: ''Go on. Be a Tiger.'' And ''Opportunity isn't always obvious.'' The Great Undoing inevitably initiated a cottage industry of its own, including ''Tail of the Tiger'' golf balls with pictures of his supposed mistresses.
 When he issued his public apology in February, Woods sounded as if he didn't plan to return to golf anytime soon. But earlier this month there were reports that the former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer had been retained to help orchestrate Woods's comeback. Soon after, Woods announced that he would be playing in the Masters, which begins April 8. (Fleischer and Woods have since parted ways, according to The Associated Press and the Golf Channel.)
 As far as professional golf is concerned, Woods cannot come back fast enough. The PGA Tour is at a critical juncture. Next year it will begin negotiating new TV contracts with CBS and NBC. In the meantime, the tour is trying to secure sponsors for 10 events in 2011 while economic conditions are not exactly favorable. Two of the hardest-hit industries, financial services and car manufacturing, are responsible for underwriting a third of the PGA Tour's sponsored events. More to the point, the entire economic model of a golf tournament is looking a bit suspect. At the moment, the value of a company's flying clients and employees to a sunny locale to drink Grey Goose cocktails and get tips on their short games from professional golfers is most likely to be lost on many of its shareholders. In other words, drumming up new sponsors and increasing -- or just maintaining, really -- the worth of its TV deals would have been hard enough for the tour even if the world's greatest golfer and most recognizable athlete had not become enmeshed in the biggest tabloid story in years.
 ''Maybe I shouldn't say this, but in the last couple of years the tour has been aware of the fact that the negotiations of TV contracts and sponsorships are coming up, and in advising us on what to do, the one thing they've said is that we need the superstars to play more and no scandals, no controversies,'' Harrison Frazar, a veteran of the PGA Tour, told me a couple months ago. ''Well, it's unfortunate that what's happened right now is the ultimate scandal in the history of professional golf, and it's happened to the absolute wrong person.''
 Woods's return to competitive golf will, of course, be huge. The questions are endless and irresistible. Will his wife, Elin, be there? What about his mom? What will happen when Woods is standing over his first big putt? Will his legendary ability to focus, honed from an early age by his father's Green Beret mind tricks, block out the knowledge that the tens of millions of people watching think he's a cheater and a cad? Will we even want him to sink that putt?
 The same scandal that has battered professional golf for the past several months will now drive new levels of interest in it. Even before Woods announced that he was coming back, Sean McManus, the president of CBS News and Sports, which holds the broadcast rights to the Masters and numerous other PGA Tour events, was quoted as saying, ''I think the first tournament Tiger Woods plays again, wherever it is, will be the biggest media event other than the Obama inauguration in the past 10 or 15 years.'' Woods will certainly remain a news story for the foreseeable future, but will he remain a golf story? For years, Woods fueled a frenzy of investment in the game -- from corporate sponsors, advertisers, broadcasters, clothing and equipment manufacturers, even golf-course developers. It was, you could say, a classic economic bubble, the Tiger Bubble. The question now is whether Woods's crash will end up being just a temporary correction for golf or if the bubble has truly burst. Even if he does manage to dominate his sport again, will investors return to an enterprise whose fortunes have seemed so inextricably linked to a single brand?
 TO SEE WHAT PROFESSIONAL golf looks like without Tiger Woods, I attended the 2010 Farmers Insurance Open in January. The tournament is held at Torrey Pines Golf Course, whose 36 holes are perched spectacularly atop a set of 300-foot cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean in La Jolla, Calif. The event marks the unofficial start of every PGA Tour season. Three tournaments precede it, but it's the first one televised by a major network (CBS). Not coincidentally, it's also where Woods traditionally opens his golf season.
 Woods has a long history at Torrey Pines. Not only did he experience some memorable amateur victories there, but the course was also the site of his unforgettable 19-hole playoff win in the 2008 U.S. Open, which he played on a torn-up knee and a fractured leg. This year, as the tournament unfolded, Woods was reportedly being treated for sex addiction at a clinic in Hattiesburg, Miss., but reminders of him were everywhere. His photograph graced the gallery of past winners ringing the practice green over a long string of dates. (Only one other golfer has won the tournament as many as three times; Woods has done so six times.) One afternoon, an airplane hired by a local strip club flew overhead, trailing a banner that read, ''WE MISS YOU TOO, TIGER! DREAMGIRLS.''
 Without Woods, the tournament's field was disappointing: only 3 of the world's top 20 golfers were there. At least golf's second-biggest star, Phil Mickelson, was on hand. The day before the first round, he came by the media tent for a Q. and A. with the press and began by saying that he wouldn't be answering any questions about Woods. Nevertheless, the subject proved impossible to ignore. When asked by one reporter whether he felt as if he needed to fill the void left by Woods, Mickelson replied, ''I haven't thought about it like that.'' Mickelson paused, then completed the thought: ''Nobody will be able to fill the shoes that are voided right now.''
 After the first round, I watched a golfer named Jay Williamson practice on the driving range in the fading sunlight. Williamson had just shot a 72 on the easier of the two Torrey Pines courses, which was going to make it nearly impossible for him to make the cut. He would probably walk away from the tournament with nothing -- or rather, because golfers are independent contractors who have to cover their own travel expenses, several thousand dollars less than he started with. ''I don't know how much longer I'm going to be able to make it out here,'' Williamson told me, as he sat on a plastic chair beside the now empty range.
 Williamson is 43 years old, well shy of 6 feet tall and not particularly athletic looking. He first qualified for the PGA Tour in 1995. Since then, he has bounced back and forth between the tour and golf's equivalent of the minor leagues, the Nationwide Tour. On six separate occasions, he has finished the season without a strong-enough record to keep his eligibility for the PGA Tour and been forced to earn it back at the tour's grueling 108-hole qualifying tournament, known as Q-School. Williamson has never won a PGA Tour event. Nevertheless, thanks to golf's soaring purses during the Woods era, he has managed to earn more than $5.5 million during his 15-year career. ''I certainly don't live like a king,'' he said, ''but I do have three kids in private school, and that's probably a direct result of Tiger.''
 Paradoxically, even as Woods drove up the earnings of journeymen like Jay Williamson, he was making it increasingly difficult for them to compete on the tour. He did this in the most basic sense, by attracting greater talent to the game. Before Woods, pro golfers weren't easily distinguished -- physically anyway -- from weekend duffers. Woods made golf a sport for elite athletes. Golf tournaments began to look a lot like father-son events, with paunchy middle-aged veterans competing against tall, muscular rookies. ''Every year the guys get bigger and stronger,'' Williamson said. ''You've now got a whole new generation of athletes out here who could be playing another sport but are playing golf, because you can make a lot of money on the tour.'' The game's culture changed along the way as well. Instead of going out for a beer after finishing a round, golfers are as likely to spend that time on the range, the practice green and in the gym.
 Just as Michael Jordan inspired a flood of foreign players to seek their fortunes in the National Basketball Association, Woods helped globalize the PGA Tour. When he first went pro in 1996, 26 of the tour's 200 active members were not Americans; today the PGA Tour has 77 foreign golfers from 21 countries. This is a sore subject among some American golfers who think the tour should do more to cultivate and promote its homegrown talent. ''It's the same thing that's happening in our world right now,'' Williamson told me. ''So many jobs are going to people who aren't Americans.''
 A few weeks after Torrey Pines, I ran into Williamson again at another tournament. Woods had just resurfaced for the first time since Thanksgiving to deliver his carefully scripted mea culpa. ''I kept waiting for him to say, 'Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!' '' Williamson told me one morning on the practice green.
 After Williamson's first round the next day, we talked for a few minutes while he waited outside the clubhouse for his family to pick him up. ''Look, this is an incredible way to make a living,'' he said. ''But it's not as glamorous as people think it is, and Tiger glamorized it. And now I think that has completely changed. I kind of liken it to a terrorist attack on our sport. I just don't think golf will ever get back to where it was. I think we've worn some of our sponsors out, and I just don't think in this kind of economic environment we're going to attract the kind of money we did in the glory days. I hope I'm wrong, but I just feel it.''
 ALL ECONOMIC BUBBLES begin with a fervent faith in the transformative potential of something. As the bubble inflates, demand grows and the optimism of the early evangelists becomes contagious, converting more believers and steamrollering scrutinizers and cynics. But at some point the momentum shifts. Economic reality quickly catches up with the pervasive overconfidence that first set the bubble aloft, and it bursts.
 This was essentially the trajectory of the Tiger Bubble, only the boom was fueled not by a new technology or financial instrument but by an athlete who shattered almost every existing assumption about his sport. The expectation was that Woods would single-handedly alter the future of golf. Culturally, he would redeem the sport's racist history, blot out its stuffy, country-club image and infuse it with Nike cool. Economically, he would give golf the stature of a major sport while raising the levels of fan participation in the game.
 The financial prospectors were circling Woods long before his first win on the PGA Tour. The sports agency I.M.G. started courting his family in 1989, when Woods was only 13, and wound up putting his father, Earl, on its payroll as a ''junior talent scout'' to help ensure that Woods wouldn't sign anywhere else. (He didn't.) Nike closely tracked Woods's amateur career and took approving note of his unusually demonstrative style of play. By the time Woods announced in 1996 that he was dropping out of Stanford to play professional golf, he already had a $40 million Nike endorsement deal. And Nike wasn't just pursuing its usual strategy of locking up the biggest star in every sport; Woods inspired the company to open a brand-new golf division. The enthusiasm spread quickly, attracting additional investors in the Woods brand: Buick, Gillette, Tag Heuer, Accenture, NetJets and others.
 It helped that Woods came along just after Jordan demonstrated that an entire sports-entertainment empire could be built on one man's back. Woods was his natural heir, a fiery, telegenic athlete whose improbable dominance of his sport was easily grasped and appreciated by millions of people who had never much cared for golf. ''Everybody has been looking for the next Michael Jordan, and they were looking on the basketball court,'' Nike's chairman, Phil Knight, said shortly after Woods turned pro in the mid-90s. ''And he was walking down the fairway all the time.'' The passing of the torch from one human sports conglomerate to the next was completed in 2000, when Woods's final round at Torrey Pines drew a larger TV audience than the N.B.A. All-Star Game. That same year, a Gallup poll confirmed that Woods had surpassed Jordan as America's most admired athlete.
 Golf's alluring demographics, which is to say the relative wealth of its fan base, gave Woods even more potential commercial value to his sponsors than his predecessor: Jordan could sell underwear and Big Macs; Woods could sell financial services and Swiss watches. And as a golfer, Woods offered extra marketing opportunities. He could affix corporate logos to his shirt, hat and bag and even wear a watch on the course. Between his endorsements, appearance fees, prize money and golf-course-design deals, Woods became the first athlete to earn $1 billion.
 Professional golf was profiting, too. The PGA Tour's peculiar economics made it particularly well suited to the sort of speculative investment that is characteristic of bubbles. The tour derives almost all of its revenues from two sources: TV networks and corporate sponsors. Factors that constrain growth in other sports, like stadium capacity, don't affect golf. In the summer of 1997, just a few weeks after 44 million viewers watched Woods, then 21 years old, win his first Masters -- far more than had ever tuned in to the tournament -- the tour negotiated new contracts with the networks widely reported to be worth twice the value of its previous deals. (The PGA Tour says these reports were inaccurate but would not elaborate.)
 Before Woods, professional golf was a niche sport watched largely by the same people who played it, its crossover potential limited by the parity among tour members. Sports are driven by stars, and it was impossible to predict who was going to be the big story at any given golf tournament. A leader one day could drop out of contention the next, replaced by someone you never heard of before -- and might never hear about again. Woods changed all of this. He won roughly a third of the time he played, a rate that defied the sport's conventional wisdom. Even when he lost, it didn't much matter. Whether Woods was pumping his fist after an important putt, flinging his driver aside after a disappointing tee shot or just applying lip balm, he was the guy viewers wanted to see. The weekly Nielsen ratings underscored the point: the tournaments Woods played routinely drew twice the audience, including many younger fans, of the tournaments he skipped. To maximize his screen time, I.M.G. and ABC created Monday Night Golf, a series of prime-time, made-for-TV, match-play tournaments featuring Woods and his closest thing to a rival at that particular moment.
 In turn, golf became more attractive to the corporate sponsors whose names were associated with the various tour events. Prices rose accordingly. Golf-tournament sponsorships are enormously complicated financial transactions. To oversimplify, corporate sponsors typically pay the tour about $8 million to $10 million for a title sponsorship. The tour acts almost like a broker, moving money between the various organizations that host its tournaments and the networks. (Title sponsors are obligated to buy ad space for PGA Tour events, and this guaranteed advertising explains why networks televise so much golf.) Roughly $6 million is spent on the purse of each tour event, with all of the players who make the cut -- about half the field -- being guaranteed some prize money. The winner takes home roughly 20 percent.
 Over the course of Woods's career, the tour aggressively raised the price of entry for corporate sponsors. In the process, purses grew by an average of 400 percent. A lot of money found its way into Woods's pocket. Last year alone, he won $10.5 million, bringing his career total to about $93 million. But there was also a powerful trickle-down effect on his fellow golfers. In 1996, only nine players on the tour earned $1 million. In 2009, 91 golfers did. With so much money pouring in, tournaments became increasingly lavish affairs. In 2004, Joe Hardy, the eccentric lumber magnate who hosted the tour's 84 Lumber Classic, flew participating players to their next event on a pair of private planes.
 The Tiger Bubble was kept afloat by a surging economy and a carefully constructed, zealously protected image of Woods himself. We watched him grow up on the golf course, his maturation evident in the changing tableaux on Sunday afternoons: the victory hug from his father giving way to the kiss from his wife, followed by the addition of a daughter and then a son. Off the course, he was a composite character created by the various commercials in which he starred. They supplemented our limited picture of the man, giving him a sense of humor (he walks across water to rescue his ball from a lily pad); whimsy (he bounces a golf ball on the face of his club while passing it behind his back and between his legs before smacking the ball in midair like a baseball); and even a touch of moral bite (''There are still courses in the U.S. I am not allowed to play because of the color of my skin'').
 The more intimate glimpses of Woods's life that were missing from his cursory pre- and post-tournament interviews came via TV commercials, too: his father's death was memorialized with a Father's Day ad featuring home-video footage of the two of them; his son's birth with an ad that conjured the forging of the boy's first set of golf clubs (complete with a personalized bag: ''Baby Woods''). Woods was a turn-of-the-century media creation, and yet there was something old-fashioned about how we treated him; he was a modern-day DiMaggio in his mythic remoteness and athletic transcendence.
 THE MAN WHO PRESIDED over professional golf's boom during the Tiger Woods era is a University of Virginia-trained lawyer and ex-Carter administration official named Tim Finchem. He became commissioner of the PGA Tour two years before Woods turned pro, and like any good chief executive, he took full advantage of his revolutionary new product. Now Finchem finds himself facing a protracted economic downturn, shrinking marketing budgets, increasing competition from the European Tour -- which, unlike the PGA Tour, pays top players appearance fees to participate in its events -- and the equivalent of a massive product recall.
 I spoke with Finchem, a small man with a Southern drawl and the easy yet guarded manner of a former political operative, last month in the clubhouse at a tournament in Arizona. He told me that the tour had been through recessions before on his watch, though he acknowledged that this one has been especially tough. While he cited Woods as a major factor behind the tour's recent growth -- ''he started contributing value pretty doggone quick'' -- he ticked off a number of other factors as well.
 Finchem and Woods have a complicated history. In 2000, Woods publicly criticized the tour for exploiting his image to market its events. Finchem quickly patched things up with Woods, but he's now in an unenviable position. He certainly can't suggest that Tiger Woods is the tour, and in a sense he's right. Woods plays only about 16 of the tour's nearly 50 tournaments each year, 10 or so fewer than most golfers. And for the time being, every one of the tour's events that depends on sponsorship -- the majors don't -- has it. ''Tiger spikes things, but he's spiking things off of a very respectable, very marketable base,'' Finchem told me.
 But Finchem also knows that the tour needs Woods more than Woods needs the tour. This was made clear by Finchem's handling of Woods's apology. Not only did he allow golf's biggest star to make his statement on a Friday in the middle of a PGA Tour event, but he also let Woods use the tour's flagship facility at T.P.C. Sawgrass, outside Jacksonville, Fla., for the occasion. He even left the ongoing tournament to be present himself. A number of the golfers with whom I spoke were less than thrilled with Finchem, but most also recognized that he didn't have much of a choice. ''Tim's hands are tied,'' one tour veteran, Steve Flesch, told me recently. ''How do you tell the guy who is greatly responsible for building that new clubhouse, for generating the revenue that allowed it to be built, how do you tell him that he can't hold a press conference there?''
 With some of golf's most reliable sponsors declaring bankruptcy or narrowly avoiding it with TARP subsidies from Washington, Finchem has been casting a much wider net. The tour is even considering a policy shift that would allow casino resorts and distillers to underwrite events -- not exactly the sort of white-bread image professional golf likes to project. ''It was a seller's market a few years ago,'' says Rick Dudley, the head of the sports-marketing firm Octagon Worldwide, which advises a number of PGA Tour sponsors. ''It's a buyer's market now.''
 When FBR Capital Markets, an investment bank based in Virginia that lost $200 million in 2008, pulled out of its sponsorship of this year's PGA Tour event in Scottsdale, Ariz., Finchem signed up Waste Management to take its place. The tournament is now called the Waste Management Phoenix Open, a name that can't help but telegraph that a new kind of partner is being welcomed to the tour.
 The Phoenix event is not your average golf tournament. It's basically a sprawling frat party, complete with beer gardens and busty women in tank tops handing out discount drink coupons. On the tournament's 16th hole, a par 3 surrounded by a grandstand that seats 15,000, golfers who fail to clear the desert shrubbery fronting the green are lustily booed. Woods has played the tournament only a handful of times, but he is nevertheless responsible for one of its more memorable moments: in 1997, his first full year as a pro, he aced the 16th hole and was approvingly showered with beer cans. (The video is on YouTube.)
 Waste Management flew in about 30 of its senior executives and 100 clients for the event. ''Most of our customers aren't golfers, but they're looking for entertainment,'' the company's chief executive, David Steiner, told me at a pretournament party inside a hangar at the Scottsdale airport. Waste Management also used the tournament to help promote the company's new, greener image: a number of the tee boxes were equipped with solar-powered trash compactors.
 As part of its stepped-up effort to attract sponsors, the tour is enlisting golfers to help ensure that companies feel as if they're getting their money's worth. At tournaments, players are now required to make themselves available to sponsors. Posted on the bulletin board in the locker room in Scottsdale was a note reminding golfers to thank Steiner. (''Cards have been placed in your lockers for your convenience.'')
 In the past, golfers have not always been eager to run putting clinics or play rounds with V.I.P. guests, but right now they seem willing to do whatever the tour asks to keep sponsors happy. Some are even going a step further. ''My daughter had actually done a paper on this company, on Waste Management, and some of the neat things they've been doing with recycling and energy and powering a million homes with the trash that they have,'' Mickelson volunteered in his pretournament interview.
 The tour is also working to combat the image that golf tournaments are essentially just corporate boondoggles. Earlier this year, it rolled out a new marketing campaign to draw attention to golf's charitable giving, which is considerable. All tournament profits are donated to charity; last year, the total came to $108 million, which dwarfs that given by other sports.
 To hedge its investment in Woods, the tour has also been promoting some of its more promising younger players like Rickie Fowler and Anthony Kim. But golf is not like basketball, where highly regarded rookies arrive with public profiles and can have an impact almost right away. That was what was unique about Woods. Not only did he start winning tournaments weeks after turning pro, he brought drama to the sport with a conspicuous intensity that has been impossible to replicate -- and that makes for great TV. ''The TV people come to talk to us every once in a while, and they say that's what we need. We need more emotion. We need the guy out there pumping his fist in the air, jumping up and down when he makes a putt,'' the tour veteran Harrison Frazar told me. ''But as golfers we're taught to be gentlemen and to be respectful to the people we're playing with. And also all of the psychologists and coaches teach us to try to stay level. Yeah, they want emotion, but it's a tough thing to ask of people who are taught to be emotionless.''
 WHEN A BUBBLE POPS, it instantly exposes the false assumptions that fueled its inflation. Tiger Woods didn't suddenly create a new reality for golf when he drove his S.U.V. into a fire hydrant, but he did reveal some troubling indicators that had been easy to overlook while he was dominating the game.
 It turns out, for example, that Woods didn't democratize golf. After the one Nike commercial drawing attention to the game's enduring racism, which aired at the start of Woods's pro career, he avoided the issue altogether. Fourteen years after Woods turned pro, he remains the only African-American on the PGA Tour. (The decline in the numbers of caddies at country clubs, which provided a way into the game for minorities, has actually reduced golf's diversity.) Nor did Woods increase the number of people playing golf. This has left a glut of underutilized courses, many of which were part of unfilled condominium developments built during the real estate boom. According to J. J. Keegan, who runs Golf Convergence, a golf-course consultancy, almost three times as many golf courses closed as opened in the United States last year. ''When I look at the Tiger effect on what we do, I don't see much,'' says Mark King, the chief executive of TaylorMade, a maker of golf equipment. ''There's never been an athlete in any sport who's had a bigger impact on the conversation of a game, but if you really look at the numbers, for most of us in the golf industry there hasn't been any real impact.''
 More people were watching golf, but really they were watching Woods. ''I'll be the first to admit I don't watch golf on TV unless Tiger is playing, and this is what I do for a living, these are my peers,'' is how Steve Flesch put it to me. As a result, two castes inevitably emerged on the PGA Tour: the tournaments Woods played in and the tournaments he didn't. In 2007, the tour's longtime Denver stop, which Woods always skipped, shut down because it was unable to find a title sponsor. It was replaced by a tournament in Washington hosted by the Tiger Woods Foundation, presumably guaranteeing Woods's appearance.
 The attack on corporate excess hit golf well before Woods's image collapsed. Last year, Northern Trust, which received $1.6 billion in TARP funds, got a dressing down from congressmen for flying hundreds of guests to the Northern Trust Open in Los Angeles and treating them to several days of entertainment that included a concert by Earth, Wind and Fire. Sponsors were soon distancing themselves from their own tournaments -- the Wachovia Championship was renamed the Quail Hollow Championship -- and canceling giveaways like free cars to players who hit holes in one.
 WHAT WILL HAPPEN to golf after the excitement over Woods's return subsides? Purses may shrink, as may the number of tournaments, but there is no reason to believe that the tour won't continue to find companies willing to underwrite its events. Indeed in the last year it has signed up five new title sponsors. ''Companies have a right to do business with a client,'' says Bruce Lucker, who runs the golf-marketing company Signature Golf. ''If they do that in an environment where they can get a guy away from his computer and cellphone, get him out on the golf course, why is that a crime?''
 While tournament fairways may no longer be lined with corporate tents filled with buzzed executives in golf shirts, the game's ongoing globalization -- 35 of the top 50 players in the world are not American -- could provide new revenue streams to the tour. And professional golf has the potential to become more interesting than ever as Woods, who will turn 35 this year, tries to maintain his dominance against a new generation of big hitters whom he spawned and who claim not to fear him.
 Once he's back, new endorsement opportunities will no doubt emerge, if not from the same sorts of upscale companies that invested in him during the Tiger Bubble. For now anyway, Woods may not be inclined to raise his public profile any higher than it already is. He certainly doesn't need the money. Even post-scandal, having retained only a fraction of the sponsors he had last year (Nike, Electronic Arts and Gillette), he remains the world's highest-paid athlete, according to Forbes magazine, which recently put the value of Woods's existing endorsement deals at $82 million.
 Unlike Michael Jordan, Woods won't have the option of retiring from his sport as a brand, his carefully manufactured image intact. But this could ultimately present new marketing opportunities for him and golf.
 ''If I were managing his career, I would advise him to keep the conversation focused on golf for the next few years,'' says Matthew Pace, the former head of sports marketing for General Motors. ''Maybe after that, he could become the fallen yet revived saint, the human Tiger Woods as opposed to the idealized one.''

HEADLINE: Struggling Towns Must Evolve or Die

BYLINE: By MITCHELL MOSS

 BODY:
When Buffalo hosted the 1901 Pan-American Exposition, it was the eighth-largest city in the United States and rightly called itself a ''city of the future.'' But for the past half-century, it and other upstate industrial cities have been losing jobs and people. Today, nearly two-thirds of the state's population has concentrated in just 12 downstate counties. 
 The entire state cannot survive if we continue to act as if all 62 counties can flourish. Yet that's how our political and fiscal systems work -- as upstate shrinks, it commands a higher and higher per capita chunk of the state budget. New York City taxpayers send billions of dollars upstate for unnecessary shopping malls, transportation projects and prisons, giving new meaning to the phrase ''welfare state.'' Meanwhile, vital upgrades to transportation and public services essential to accommodate the expanding New York City area are deferred. 
 Instead, Albany needs to make a strategic decision to invest in a handful of places upstate that are willing to do the serious work of revitalizing their own economies and that have the right mix of educational institutions, skilled labor and entrepreneurial know-how to compete in the 21st century.
 For the rest, we must accept the inevitable. Across the Midwest and Great Plains, state governments have allowed towns with a proud past but no discernible future to fade away. New York must do the same.

HEADLINE: Heading Off the Next Financial Crisis

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is an economics columnist for The Times and a staff writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
 [ I. Why We Need Regulation ]
 A public good is something that the free market tends not to provide on its own, to the detriment of society. Pollution laws and police departments are classic examples. In the case of finance -- and of the crisis of the past two years -- this missing good has been strong regulation. A weak system of regulation allowed Wall Street firms to take on enormous debt. Those debts let the firms make more and riskier investments than they otherwise could have, lifting their profits. But when the value of the investments began falling, the firms had little margin for error. They were like home buyers who made a tiny down payment and soon found themselves underwater.
 It was tempting to let the banks fail. They certainly deserved it. But big bank failures often cause terrible damage. Credit dries up, and the economy can enter a vicious cycle of falling asset prices and job losses. That is what began to happen in 2008. To get credit flowing again, the federal government came to the rescue with billions of taxpayer dollars. It was a maddening story line: the government helped the banks get rich by looking the other way during good times and saved them from collapse during bad times. Just as an oil company can profit from pollution, Wall Street profited from weak regulation, at the expense of society. 
 If there has been a theme to the Obama administration's disparate domestic policies, it has been to invest more in public goods. The administration has increased spending on schools, highways and scientific research and tried to play a more active role in energy policy and health care. ''They're all a necessary part of the network of what makes market economies work,'' Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, told me recently, ''and we have not been good enough about doing them in recent years.'' A big part of that network, Geithner added, is financial re-regulation.
 To reduce the odds of a future crisis, the Obama plan would take three basic steps. First, regulators would receive more authority to monitor everything from mortgages to complex securities. This is meant to keep future financial time bombs, like the no-documentation loans and collateralized debt obligations of the past decade, from becoming rife. Second -- and most important -- financial firms would be forced to reduce the debt they take on and to hold more capital in reserve. This is the equivalent of requiring home buyers to make larger down payments: more capital will give firms a bigger cushion when investments start to go bad. Finally, if that cushion proves insufficient, the government would be allowed to seize a collapsing financial firm, much as it can already do with a traditional bank. Regulators would then keep the firm operating long enough to prevent a panic and slowly sell off its pieces.
 Will this work? It is difficult to know. No one can be sure where the next bubble or crisis will come from or, as a result, how to prevent it. You can make a plausible argument for many different forms of regulation, and there has been plenty of debate over the various details of re-regulation. How should derivatives be regulated? Should a consumer-protection watchdog be an independent agency or part of the Federal Reserve? Which agency should be responsible for seizing a failing firm?
 With that being said, the Obama plan has a lot to recommend it. It would close many of the most obvious holes in the regulatory net. Congress could conceivably overcome its partisan divisions and pass an important bill this summer. If it does, the biggest reason to be nervous about the plan will not be any one of those details that has received so much attention in recent months. It will be something more fundamental. Whatever the regulatory apparatus, it will still be operated by regulators. Regulators will have to set capital requirements, decide when to close a struggling firm and find a balance between protecting consumers and still letting them make choices. The legislation does not spell out many of these details, and neither President Obama nor Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, has been especially clear about them. They have not offered much guiding philosophy beyond promising us that regulators will do better next time.
 In a way, this issue is more about human nature than about politics. By definition, the next period of financial excess will appear to have recent history on its side. Asset prices will have been rising, and whatever new financial instrument that comes along will look as if it is safe. ''When things are going well,'' Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chairman, says, ''it's very hard to conduct a disciplined regulation, because everyone's against you.'' Sure enough, both Bernanke and Geithner, along with dozens of other regulators, overlooked many signs of excess over the past decade.
 One way to deal with regulator fallibility is to implement clear, sweeping rules that limit people's ability to persuade themselves that the next bubble is different -- upfront capital requirements, for example, that banks cannot alter. Thus far, the White House, the Fed and Congress have mostly steered clear of such rules.
 So it is worth asking whether the current re-regulation plan has enough of a backstop. Even if Wall Street stays one step ahead of Washington, even if future regulators allow too many loopholes in the capital requirements, even if the government does not seize the next Lehman Brothers until too late, can re-regulation still serve the public good?
 [ II. How We Got Here ]
 For more than a half-century starting after the Great Depression, the United States enjoyed what the economist Gary Gorton calls the quiet period of banking. Before the Depression, financial panics were a regular part of life. They occurred about once a decade. People would get nervous about the health of their bank and, en masse, begin withdrawing their money. The bank, however, had lent the money to other families and businesses and did not have anywhere near enough cash to allow the withdrawals.
 In the wake of the bank panics of the early 1930s, the Roosevelt administration and Congress passed two crucial reforms as part of the Glass-Steagall Act. In one, the federal government set up a new agency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, that would insure deposits and guarantee that savers would get their money back even if their bank went bust. In the other, banks were restricted to traditional lending. They could not use their deposits to speculate in stocks and were no longer allowed to underwrite securities. Together, the two rules shored up the two sides of a bank's business -- its relationships with savers and with borrowers -- and reduced the odds that a bank would go under. The quiet period was born.
 It began to end in the 1980s. Banks started facing new competition for both savers and borrowers. Households could put their money in mutual funds like those offered by Fidelity and Vanguard, which offered better returns than savings accounts and sometimes with little risk. Meanwhile, companies, which had once relied on bank loans for financing, could more easily borrow from bond markets.
 These changes clearly brought some benefits. As Daniel K. Tarullo, a Fed governor appointed by Obama, has said, the New Deal regulations ''fostered a banking system that was, for the better part of 40 years, quite stable and reasonably profitable, though not particularly innovative in meeting the needs of depositors and borrowers.'' In the more competitive new system, borrowing costs fell. Credit cards, debit cards, A.T.M.'s and online banking brought convenience to consumers. The relatively high returns of the stock market became available to a wider group of people than before. Venture-capital firms turned ideas into companies.
 But there was a fatal flaw in the new system. The banks' new competitors received scant oversight. They were not directly bound by Roosevelt's restrictions. ''We had this entire system of outside banks that had no meaningful constraints on capital and leverage,'' Geithner says. Investment banks like Lehman Brothers were able to make big profits in part by leveraging themselves more than traditional banks. To use the down-payment analogy again, it was as if Lehman were allowed to put down only 3 percent of a house's purchase price while traditional banks were still making larger down payments. When the house's value then rose by just 3 percent, Lehman doubled its investment. A.I.G., similarly, created a highly leveraged derivatives business that regulators essentially ignored.
 In response, the traditional banks started advocating for deregulation, so they, too, could plunge into mutual funds and help companies sell stock. In 1999, the Clinton administration and a Republican Congress repealed most of Glass-Steagall, officially allowing traditional banks to engage in other, more risky investments. Even so, the banks' new competitors -- investment banks, insurers, hedge funds and other firms that collectively became known as shadow banks -- continued to face less scrutiny and to grow rapidly. Thanks to their leverage, they could make enormous profits by being just a step ahead of ordinary investors or simply by riding a bull market. ''The profits these firms make are so out of proportion with any contribution they make to the economy,'' Volcker told me not long ago.
 Eventually, so-called shadow banking made up roughly half of the American financial system. It also helped recreate the same preconditions for a panic that existed before the 1930s. The highly leveraged firms were vulnerable to panics. This time, the panic would come not from individual depositors -- who were still insured by the F.D.I.C. -- but from other financial firms. A central part of modern finance is something called the repo market, in which firms lend one another huge sums of money every day. If traders suddenly begin to worry that a second firm borrowing from their firm is in trouble, they immediately demand more collateral on the loan. Once one lender begins asking for more collateral, others get nervous and do the same. It is much like a bank run, this time conducted by phone and computer rather than at a bank's front door. In September 2008, JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup did this to Lehman, effectively dooming it. Lehman's collapse then set off a panic around the world.
 The deregulation of the last few decades has come in for a lot of blame for the current financial crisis. It deserves some blame, too. If Citigroup and Bank of America were still operating under the New Deal rules, they might not have flirted with bankruptcy. But take a minute to think about which firms had the biggest problems. They were the shadow banks: stand-alone investment banks like Lehman, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch; and other firms, like A.I.G., that were not banks at all. They were never fully covered by the New Deal regulation, and they were not the ones most affected by the deregulation.
 The root of the crisis, then, came not so much from the laws that were changed. Finance evolved, and Washington did not keep up. So the creation of another quiet period probably cannot revolve around restoring old rules. It almost certainly depends on new rules, whether they are of the sweeping variety or the more nuanced.
 [ III. Protect Consumers ]
 In 1988, Congress created the Schumer box. Named for Senator Charles Schumer of New York, then a member of the House, the box became a required part of credit-card solicitations, listing the interest rate, the annual fee and other basic numbers. The box serves a useful purpose. Among other things, anyone who does not want to pay an annual fee can quickly toss aside any credit-card offer that includes one. But over time, banks figured out how to charge new fees that were not covered by the Schumer box. They added new billing tricks to credit cards and made millions on overdraft fees in debit cards. Once again, Wall Street remained a step ahead of Washington.
 It would be foolish to imagine that we could come up with just the right mix of rules and regulations to prevent this from happening again. If regulators are entirely bound by rules and the private sector remains flexible, regulators will never be able to keep up. This is why some amount of discretion is a vital part of re-regulation.
 With this in mind, the Obama administration has proposed a new agency -- the Financial Product Safety Commission -- that would allow regulators to rely on their judgment more than they have been able to in the past. They would not simply be enforcing rules. They would have the ability to monitor the marketplace in real time. If banks were hiding debit-card fees or persuading millions of people to take out mortgages their incomes could not support -- practices that brought huge profits over the past decade -- the commission could issue a public warning or even prohibit a practice. Its powers would be similar to that of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which monitors toy safety and other issues. Today, there is effectively no equivalent for consumer finance.
 The agency has become the most contentious part of the regulation debate, much as the public option was to the health care debate. Richard C. Shelby, the lead Republican senator on the Banking Committee, has made clear that he opposes a free-standing consumer agency. In part, the Republican opposition reflects the banks' views. But it also stems from a concern that regulators could stifle innovation or, going the other way, push banks to take unwise risks in the name of consumers. That is what happened with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored agencies that helped support the growth of subprime lending.
 In recent weeks, senators have been discussing whether some version of the agency -- housed inside the Fed, perhaps -- might be able to win Republican support. The Fed, however, has a long history of poor consumer protection. For this reason, Christopher J. Dodd, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has proposed giving the agency a dedicated budget and having its director appointed by the president.
 More important, though, than where the oversight function is housed is how it approaches regulation. In this regard, the administration is on to something. The agency may be the most politically assertive part of Obama's plan, but it also reflects his -- and his advisers' -- fondness for policies based on empirical research. The word they like to use is ''pragmatic.'' As White House and Treasury officials imagine the new agency, it would be an outgrowth of behavioral economics, a discipline that combines psychology and economics to study how people really behave, rather than how they say they will or how academic models predict they will behave. The agency would even be able to run experiments, in which social scientists could study how consumers respond to different financial offers.
 Geithner's assistant secretary for financial institutions is Michael S. Barr, who is on leave from the University of Michigan Law School, where he has studied consumer finance. One of Barr's research collaborators -- Sendhil Mullainathan, a Harvard professor and MacArthur ''genius grant'' winner -- spent last year working for the Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget, focusing in part on the design of the consumer agency.
 Mullainathan likes to say that in many areas of life, the profit motive promotes consumer welfare. People can understand what makes for a good shoe or mobile phone, and companies compete based on quality and price. In other areas, though, consumers are not able to distinguish a good product from a bad one. The issues are too complex. They involve interest rates, for example, or compound returns. Companies could theoretically try to educate customers about these subjects. But this is an uphill battle. It is far easier to appeal to instincts that people already have. So companies selling complex products often do not compete on quality and price. They compete with slick advertising or too-good-to-be-true offers, like those for low initial interest rates.
 ''A lot of people think, Companies are trying to subvert what's good for me,'' Mullainathan told me. ''But think of the guy in charge of a credit-card division. He's doing his job. All he has to work with is the demand curve.'' And the demand curve is based on the factors that actually influence consumer demand, not the ones we might wish influenced it. People really do sign up for mortgages with low initial payments even when they have no realistic hope of making the later payments.
 The only reliable solution to this problem is regulation. Government regulators make sure airplanes are safe, because consumers cannot monitor the workings of aircraft engines. The airlines then compete on things consumers can evaluate, like price, legroom, route convenience and in-flight television. The goal of the consumer-finance agency, Mullainathan says, would be to ''take the powerful river of competition and make it flow in a direction that benefits people.''
 Barr recently showed me a mock-up of a credit-card bill created by a graphic designer -- a new take on the Schumer box that could be updated over time. Even if the box did not become mandatory, banks could be given incentives to use it. Private groups might more easily be able to identify the banks that were hiding fees. Barr also mentioned the idea of replacing the stacks of paper that home buyers receive at a house closing with a simple mortgage-disclosure form. The form could highlight the most relevant information, and, unlike the mass of documents most people now sign, many might actually read it.
 By itself, the consumer-protection agency would be unlikely to prevent the next crisis. Modern financial crises tend to have many of their roots deep inside Wall Street, with complex securities that consumers never see. But the same idea behind the agency exists in other parts of re-regulation, too. In the Senate bill, a council of regulators, presided over by the Treasury secretary, would work with the Fed to monitor risks in the financial system as they developed. Crucially, the council would be able to monitor both traditional banks and shadow banks.
 [ IV. Cushion the Blow ]
 All of this new regulation depends on the wisdom of regulators, who are, of course, human beings with the potential to be swept up in the enthusiasm of a bubble. And Obama administration officials -- especially Geithner, the main architect of re-regulation -- are sensitive to the idea that they are asking too much of human discretion. Their solution is to depend on capital requirements to prevent another financial crash. They refer to these requirements as cushioning or foam on the runway. So long as a firm has enough hard assets -- and can get access to their cash value -- it can survive a lot of bad investments and a lot of ineffective oversight.
 ''We don't know where the next crisis is going to come from,'' Geithner told me. ''We won't be able to foresee it. We're not going to pre-empt all future bubbles. So we want to build a much bigger cushion into the system against those basic human limitations. I don't want a system that depends on clairvoyance or bravery.'' He added, ''The top three things to get done are capital, capital and capital.''
 Many others share this broad view. Shelby has talked about the importance of capital. So has Sheila Bair, the chairwoman of the F.D.I.C., who has occasionally clashed with Obama's economic advisers.
 One good way to understand the importance of capital is to look at the fate of firms that entered the crisis with relatively thick cushions. In 2007, commercial banks had an average leverage ratio of about 12 to 1, according to a recent report by McKinsey & Company. This means the banks had a dollar in assets for every $12 in debt. That was enough for many of them, like Bank of New York, to survive the bust in decent shape. In Canada, financial firms had an average ratio of about 18 to 1, and Canada endured the crisis better than perhaps any other rich country.
 By contrast, the five big investment banks in this country -- Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs, Lehman, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley -- were close to or exceeding a ratio of 30 to 1. Of the five investment banks, Lehman collapsed, Bear and Merrill were sold at cut-rate prices and Goldman and Morgan Stanley might not have survived without government aid.
 The crisis has made Wall Street much more conservative. But this will not last. It never does. Left to their own devices, financial firms will again take on big debts and big risks. They have a lot of incentive to do so. A Wall Street Journal analysis found that if one set of stricter leverage standards had been in place during the five years before the crisis, it would have reduced the biggest firms' profitability by almost 25 percent.
 The model for setting future capital rules is the stress tests that the Fed conducted last year to gauge the strength of individual banks. Geithner convinced Obama to make those tests a core part of the financial-rescue strategy, and they ended up being something of a turning point in the crisis. Banks in the United States are healthier today than in many other countries, and the economy is growing more rapidly. Perhaps most striking, the rescue is on course to cost far less than the average clean-up from a financial crisis, according to International Monetary Fund statistics.
 Beyond the immediate crisis, Geithner saw the stress tests as a way to show what the Fed could accomplish when it had authority over all parts of the financial system, including the shadow banks. Moreover, the tests would be proof that the Fed now believed in regulation after decades of mostly ignoring it. In the new regulatory framework, the Fed -- a repository of well-trained, nonpolitical economists and bank experts -- would be given a vastly bigger role than in the past.
 But there is reason to wonder whether the capital cushions, at least in their current form, will be enough to overcome human limitations. The administration and Congress have been deliberately vague about what the capital ratios will be. They have not given out numbers or explained a myriad of details: how the ratios will vary by firm size, for instance, or how they will deal with so-called off-balance-sheet assets. Their approach has the advantage of keeping technicalities free of Capitol Hill horse-trading, much as setting interest rates is a process left to the Fed, not Congress. Vagueness also allows American regulators more freedom to coordinate with regulators in other countries. On the other hand, by remaining out of the public eye, capital requirements become yet another issue that will ultimately depend on discretion. Wall Street firms will have a chance to persuade the Fed that maybe they do not need as much capital as people first thought. No doubt, the firms will offer some highly sophisticated mathematical models to make their case.
 The stress tests, remember, were conducted when banks were financially and politically weak. When times were good over the previous decade, Fed officials -- and not just Alan Greenspan -- neglected to use the powers they did have. They came to believe the bubble rationales that Wall Street offered. It is not hard to see how that could happen again. The most telling case study may be Geithner himself.
 Despite the criticism that Geithner has faced for being too close to Wall Street, he has never worked there. He is a lifelong civil servant. When the Clinton administration was winding down, his mentor, Robert Rubin, told him he could get a plum job on Wall Street. Geithner instead chose a low-profile job at the I.M.F. And as the president of the New York Fed, he raised more alarms than many regulators did. He pushed his staff and bank executives to think about how much capital banks had and how much they needed. He warned that periods of calm often led to unanticipated crises and that once confidence started to slip, it could quickly vanish. Intellectually, he understood how things could go wrong.
 What he missed, however, was the fact that things were going wrong in some of the very institutions he was overseeing. ''Financial innovation has improved the capacity to measure and manage risk,'' Geithner said in a speech at a Fed conference in Georgia in May 2007. Large firms, he added, ''are generally stronger in terms of capital relative to risk.'' Bernanke, who may have years as Fed chairman ahead of him, made statements that look even worse in retrospect. He did not merely say that bubbles were hard to identify. He actively denied that there was a housing bubble.
 Might future versions of Bernanke and Geithner do better? Maybe. But that does not seem like a great bet. Both men spent their careers studying and working on financial crises. Even some of their critics agree they are unusually bright. By all rights, they should have been the ones to come down with regulatory force, and they didn't.
 What is the alternative? Canada offers another telling lesson. It relies more on blunt rules than the United States does. Canada requires any mortgage with a less than 20 percent down payment to be insured, and those mortgages are much less common there. It also sets a standard leverage ratio of no more than 20. As Julie Dickson, the chief financial regulator in Canada, told me, ''We become nasty when banks get close to it.''
 Blunt rules inevitably have their problems. But they also send signals that can outlast a given administration or a given moment in the business cycle. In Canada, the well-publicized conservative capital rule not only restrained Canadian banks, but it also served as an immutable reminder to regulators and kept them from falling under the sway of bubble thinking.
 Five days before Geithner gave that speech in Georgia, Dickson gave a speech of her own in Ontario. She began by discussing ''Bewitched,'' the 1960s television show. Dickson reminded her audience that Samantha, the lead character, had magical powers and, among other things, could turn sows' ears into silk purses. ''Today,'' Dickson continued, ''markets seem to be producing triple-A instruments from instruments that are not rated triple-A.'' The sow's ears, in her telling, were subprime mortgages that Wall Street repackaged into triple-A, supposedly risk-free securities that were touted as silk purses.
 [ V. Put a Tax on Finance ]
 The blunt, sweeping rule that has received the most attention over the past year is the Volcker Rule. Named for the former Fed chairman and Obama adviser who has been pushing it, the rule would, among other things, prohibit traditional banks from engaging in proprietary trading -- the buying and selling of stocks or other investments for a bank's own profit, rather than as a service to clients. On its face, the rule sounds like a reinstatement of Glass-Steagall. When Obama added it to his regulation plan in January, he seemed to be making a major shift.
 But if you listen to the rule's main advocates -- like Volcker or Austan Goolsbee, a White House economist -- you come to realize that it is often misunderstood. Its goal is narrower: to eliminate one of the subsidies that Washington now bestows on Wall Street. Traditional banks have access to cheap government loans to encourage them to lend freely and also to serve as a backstop during a panic. When banks turn around and use these low-interest loans to make investments they are essentially receiving a government subsidy for stock trading. This subsidy has helped Goldman Sachs and other firms reap big profits over the last year. ''It's just not appropriate for banks to get money subsidized by the taxpayer and use it for their own speculative investments that have nothing to do with their clients,'' Goolsbee says.
 Yet the subsidy is not what caused the crisis. With or without it, a firm can bring down the financial system. Lehman nearly did, and it was not a traditional bank.
 So long as Congress can adequately define proprietary trading -- which will take a little work, but is not as hard as Wall Street has suggested -- some version of the rule seems like a sensible part of re-regulation. But it is not a reform that will serve as a reliable backstop to regulator failure.
 The boldest proposal along these lines would be to break up the banks. Some outsiders, like Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, argue that today's huge banks are powerful enough to resist any effort at strong regulation. Their size alone could make it especially hard for the government to seize a troubled bank and wind it down in an orderly fashion. One middle-ground option would be to give regulators the authority to split up a big bank that began to have problems well before it would need to be seized.
 The flaw in this approach is that size is not the same as risk. Lehman and A.I.G. were not the country's largest financial firms. The well-regulated Canadian financial sector is far more concentrated than the underregulated American financial sector. Canada has 4 of the 50 biggest banks in the world. The United States, with an economy 10 times as large as Canada's, has 5 of the top 50.
 What may be more worrisome than the size of any individual bank is the size of the entire sector. It accounted for about 30 percent of all corporate profits in the decade before the crisis, up from 16 percent in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of that growth no doubt reflected innovations that improved people's lives, like the A.T.M. But a significant portion probably did not. It reflected, among other things, Wall Street's ability to make huge profits in good times and to be bailed out in bad times. It was what some economists have called the privatization of profit and socialization of risk. Wall Street was benefiting at the expense of society.
 There is a commonly accepted strategy for dealing with activities that impose costs on society. You tax them. A tax discourages the harmful activity. It also raises revenue that can help cover the associated costs. Economists refer to such taxes -- on alcohol or pollution, for example -- as externality taxes.
 The regulation blueprint that the Treasury Department released last spring did not include a tax on banks. But Obama has since proposed a tax that would allow the government to recoup any losses from the $700 billion bailout fund -- the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP -- that was passed in 2008. The ideal regulation plan would create a permanent tax along these lines. Such a tax would acknowledge that banks serve a vital function in a market economy but that they also have a habit of taking unwise risks. No matter how hard regulators try and how smart they are, they often cannot keep on top of those risks. Taxpayers are then left to pay the bill, to keep a financial crisis from turning into a depression. A bank tax would force banks to share that cost.
 Obama's TARP tax would be temporary, expiring as early as 2020. But Congress often extends tax provisions that began with a time limit, and the Obama administration seems quite comfortable with the idea of the tax becoming permanent. ''Financial crises cause a huge amount of damage to the revenue base over time,'' Geithner said. ''So there is a very good argument you should put a tax on finance, like a tax on pollution.''
 If you add up the major parts of the Obama plan, you can see how it is meant to replicate Roosevelt's regulatory successes, albeit for a very different banking system. The consumer-safety agency is today's answer to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which was created in 1934 to protect investors. Expanding the regulatory net to cover shadow banking is an attempt to reduce risk taking, just as Glass-Steagall was. Higher capital ratios are meant to make panics less likely. Giving the government the authority to take over dying investment banks simply extends the New Deal law allowing it to take over traditional banks.
 Still, there is a big thematic difference between the Roosevelt approach and the Obama approach. Roosevelt relied on the kind of sweeping ideas that this White House has largely eschewed. Roosevelt guaranteed bank deposits, separated commercial banking from investment banking and banned misinformation about stocks. Obama would hold banks to as-yet-undefined capital and liquidity standards commensurate with how big and how connected to other firms they are.
 It is a crucial step, as are many of the other new regulations in the plan. But it would be easier to have confidence in them if the administration and Congress took a few steps away from discretion and toward clarity. ''Rule-based regimes,'' Kevin M. Warsh, a Fed governor, said in a recent speech, ''are inevitably crude and imperfect.'' But Warsh suggested that they may be better than a system in which banks accept micromanagement under the assumption that they will be able to co-opt their micromanagers.
 To avoid this, the bank tax could move from being a sideshow in the regulation debate to the center of it. Regulators could also forge ahead with tough, well-publicized capital rules. The specific numbers do not need to be included in legislation, but the Fed -- which will have the power to set the rules -- does not need to wait for what may be an elusive global consensus. And, at the very least, the rules should be straightforward enough to be widely understood. ''This whole idea of ultrasophistication -- we're just kidding ourselves,'' Robert C. Pozen, an investment manager and author of a recent book on re-regulation, says. As the crisis showed, intricate mathematical models can too easily produce the answer that their handlers want to hear.
 Whatever their imperfections, simple rules have the advantage of sending signals that can outlast a given administration or a given moment in the business cycle. That is one of the lessons of the Roosevelt reforms and of the quiet period in banking that followed.
 The obvious reason to re-regulate finance is to prevent the next crisis or at least to make it less damaging. But there are other potential benefits to reform. Consider what has happened to the American economy over the last three decades. Highly leveraged financial firms became a dominant part of the economy. Their profits allowed the firms to recruit many of the country's most sought-after employees -- mathematicians, scientists, top college graduates and top former government officials. Yet many of those profits turned out to be ephemeral. So some of the best minds were devoted to devising ever-more-complex means of creating money out of thin air, the proceeds of which then drew in even more talent.
 A more serious approach to regulation could, if indirectly, have a big impact on this situation. By reducing financial firms' profits, it could reduce the industry to a smaller and arguably more natural size. Re-regulation could remove some of the subsidies that Wall Street now receives. The cottage industry of hidden fees, ballooning interest rates and other misleading practices could be brought under control. Higher capital requirements and a bank tax could force financial firms to experience the bad times as well as the good. Above all, re-regulation could acknowledge that modern finance brings both benefits and risks.
 It is worth remembering that Wall Street's long boom has not exactly been shared by much of the rest of the American economy. Wage growth for most workers has been painfully slow over the past three decades. Economic growth over the last decade was slower than in any decade since World War II. Surely, one goal of re-regulation should be to loosen Wall Street's grip on the country's resources, both financial and human, in the hope that they might be put to more productive use.

HEADLINE: Leave the Budget To the Experts

BYLINE: By H. CARL McCALL

 BODY:
The New York Legislature and Gov. David Paterson are deep into negotiations over the state's finances, but one thing is already certain: there will be sharp cuts and palpable pain across the state. To move forward, we must change Albany's budget process. 
 The time-honored approach has been to eschew strategic vision and simply make a cut here, insert a fee there, stitch in a little borrowing and then wait for lightning to strike in the dead of night and -- it's alive! 
 The problem with relying on this Dr. Frankenstein approach is that once we create the monster, we can't control it. Years of decisions dictated by political expediency have led to a chronic budget imbalance that threatens our short-term solvency and long-term economic health. 
 Fortunately, Lt. Gov. Richard Ravitch has put forward a plan to provide sorely needed oversight and discipline. He proposes to create a financial review board that would certify the budget only if it's balanced. The board would employ a smart, multiyear strategy that would weigh significant cuts in spending against limited borrowing. And it would require Albany to adopt generally accepted accounting principles, the standard bookkeeping rules used in business. 
 Some critics have said the borrowing allowed under the Ravitch plan would lay too much debt on our children. It's true that the plan would mean borrowing as much as $6 billion over the next three years. But the new budgeting regimen could give our children a far more lasting and important legacy: the economic discipline necessary to build a competitive state.

HEADLINE: Sweat Equity, the Movie

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
THERE are low-budget films, there are micro-budget films, and then there is ''Breaking Upwards.'' It may be hard to imagine how someone could make a feature-length romantic comedy in New York City for just under $15,000, but Daryl Wein and Zoe Lister-Jones managed to do it.
 The making of ''Breaking Upwards,'' which opens Friday both at the IFC Center and on cable through video on demand, is almost a tutorial in how a do-it-yourself ethos can overcome the tough economics of the movie business. And that is not simply because the couple collaborated on the script, played the lead roles and produced the film together, with him also directing and her in charge of tasks ranging from writing the lyrics for the songs to cooking meals for cast and crew. 
 Most members of that small, young crew was recruited from Craigslist and worked free. PVC tubes were adapted to make a track for their camera dolly, and when Ms. Lister-Jones was given a red carpet as a joke birthday gift, that was also used to help steady the camera. Their director of photography, Alex Bergman, used an inheritance from his grandmother, meant to enable him to go to film school, to buy top-of-the-line equipment instead. 
 Insurance was obtained by piggybacking on the policy of another production, thereby saving thousands of dollars, and because the movie was shot digitally, Mr. Wein was able to edit it in his living room, using a flat-screen television. The couple was also able to get the veteran Broadway actors Julie White, Peter Friedman and Andrea Martin to join the cast, along with their friend Olivia Thirlby from HBO's ''Bored to Death.'' 
 ''You can't put a value on sweat equity,'' said Jonathan Sehring, the president of IFC Entertainment, which is distributing the film. ''If this were just friends and family, that would be one thing. But they've got some very distinguished actors, and it looks great. So it's incredible that they spent so little out of pocket.'' 
 Mr. Wein said the couple began shopping their script, meant to be ''funny and intelligent in a way going back to the early Woody Allen films,'' in 2007, naively hoping to make the film ''through a production company for anywhere between $1 and $2 million.'' But the process was slower than they anticipated and coincided with a retrenchment at studios and production companies, which were closing or downsizing specialty divisions that had been financing quirky low-budget films.
 That shakeout has ''complicated the process for indie filmmakers in the sense that there are fewer distributors, which means there are fewer potential buyers for films, and so the deals are not as attractive because there is less leverage and less money involved,'' said Richard Abramowitz, founder of Abramorama, a consulting company that specializes in production, marketing and distribution services for independent films. ''On the other hand, it's created a bit of a new industry that allows D.I.Y. filmmakers to control the process and the rights themselves.'' 
 ''Breaking Upwards'' is about a pair of Jewish Manhattan 20-somethings who find their relationship foundering; but rather than split up, they choose to alternate days alone and together. Emotions get complicated and feelings get hurt, of course, as they meet potential romantic partners and have to explain their arrangement to their uncomprehending parents, played by Ms. White, Mr. Friedman and Ms. Martin.
 The story in large part echoes the experience of Mr. Wein, 26, and Ms. Lister-Jones, 27. A couple for six years, they ''started having issues,'' as they put it, about two years after they met and decided to try what their parents' generation might term an open relationship but which they (and anthropologists) call polyamory. 
 ''I remember that we were sitting in a coffee shop much like a scene in the film, writing on a paper tablecloth, both of us being so hyper-articulate about the goals and bounds of this experiment we were going to do,'' Ms. Lister-Jones recalled. ''It was definitely a sad moment, but we were also laughing at ourselves. I remember that at that moment Daryl said, 'This would make a really funny movie.' ''
 While the couple was apart, Mr. Wein wrote a script with a friend, Peter Duchan. When he and Ms. Lister-Jones got back together, she was invited to add her perspective to a screenplay that, in her estimation, ''needed the feminine touch'' to tone down a tendency to ''heroize the male protagonist and villainize the female.''
 Many micro-budget films are made by young filmmakers, who often rely on friends and give short shrift to the older generation. But Ms. Lister-Jones has worked in New York theater, including in ''The Little Dog Laughed'' with Ms. White, which helped to recruit actors who have won or been nominated for Tony Awards to play the fleshed-out roles of the couple's parents -- paid at the Screen Actors Guild ultra-minimum of just over $100 a day.
 ''The money was never an issue,'' Ms. Martin wrote in an e-mail message. ''When you sign on to do indie films, minimal salary to no salary is a given. You say yes for many other reasons.'' She added: ''There was something very appealing about the collaboration that reminded me of my early days of Second City. Everyone on the same page, no hierarchy.''
 Ms. Thirlby, who has been a friend of Mr. Wein's since she was in high school and received critical praise for her performances in ''Juno'' and ''The Wackness,'' played his alternate romantic interest. She also remarked on ''the very casual, very low-key'' approach on the set. 
 ''They called me up one day, a Sunday morning, and asked if I could come over because they needed to shoot an additional scene,'' she recalled. ''So I went over in my own clothes and brought a selection of my shirts and earrings for Daryl to pick from.'' And of course, like mostly everybody else, she did her own makeup and hair.
 But once the shoot was finished, in 2008, just as the economy was nosediving, Mr. Wein and Ms. Lister-Jones realized that they had, in their words, ''an even bigger mountain to climb.'' Not only were they first-time feature filmmakers, but they were working in a genre that is an especially hard sell to distributors.
 ''A romantic comedy that doesn't have one of very few leading women or men is complicated,'' said Mr. Abramowitz, who also teaches at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. ''With a horror film the genre is its own star. But with a romantic comedy there are certain conventions that are expected and a level of anticipation in seeing a familiar actor or actress going through those paces. Daryl and Zoe are talented actors and filmmakers with a fine script, but they are starting off with a disadvantage because they are not recognizable.''
 Hoping to overcome that handicap, the couple have been promoting ''Breaking Upwards'' over the last year with every tool available, from the latest in Internet social networking to the most basic: writing the title of their movie in chalk on sidewalks and walls around Manhattan. In advance of taking ''Breaking Upwards'' on the festival circuit -- from South by Southwest, where it was seen by IFC, to places like Little Rock, Ark., and, this month, the Pittsburgh Jewish Israeli Film Festival -- they managed to generate buzz with a series of videos for funnyordie.com that included plot summaries sung as rap and reggae and a sketch in which Ms. Martin plays a vindictive Judge Judy type. 
 With a $40,000 advance from IFC in hand, Mr. Wein and Ms. Lister-Jones decided that having their movie shown in a theater was also a necessary part of establishing its identity. They plowed that money into promotion and marketing, and ''Breaking Upwards'' is scheduled to open in theaters in Los Angeles and San Francisco later next month, even though it will already be available through video on demand. But some colleagues in the micro-budget world disagree and no longer bother to seek a traditional theatrical release.
 ''My feeling is that every movie has a moment when awareness is at a peak, when it is new and exciting and people want to see it, and usually that moment is a festival premiere,'' said the prolific director Joe Swanberg, whose films include ''Alexander the Last'' and ''Hannah Takes the Stairs.'' ''If you have that and then a distributor buys your movie, it becomes all about trying to re-create that moment six or nine months later, spending money to get what you already got for free.
 ''To me, it's better to capitalize on that attention and make it possible for you to watch it right away if it sounds interesting to you,'' he continued. ''There is a kind of national film community that lives outside major cities, is reading blogs and reviews and is part of the cinephile discussion, but doesn't have access to a film until it's on DVD. Video on demand opens up that discussion to everybody right away.'' 
 But, perhaps spurred by the runaway success of ''Paranormal Activity,'' which was made for about the same cost as ''Breaking Upwards'' and has grossed more than $100 million, major studios seem interested in edging into the D.I.Y. game. Paramount, for example, has created a new micro-budget division to be called Insurge Pictures, though the studio would neither confirm nor deny reports that the new unit's initial slate will consist of 10 films to be made for $100,000 each.
 For their part Mr. Wein and Ms. Lister-Jones have three other scripts they'd like to film and, thinking big, suggested a $3 million budget to a studio executive interested in one of the screenplays. ''Unfortunately we don't know how to market a film that is made for just $3 million,'' they recalled being told, which raises the odd prospect that their proven ability to work on a shoestring may keep them confined to the micro-budget niche.
 ''In this market I think the battle continues,'' Ms. Lister-Jones said. ''It feels like a huge success that we've made this movie and sold it and that it will have a theatrical release and will be on V.O.D. and all these things. But I think we've encountered how hard it is still, even with a calling card like this, to get any money, to see any money. We're still a risk, sadly.''

HEADLINE: Seeking Edge on School? It's Just a Fact of Life

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN

 BODY:
As I took my kindergartner to Ravenswood Elementary School last week, most parents were ignorant of the latest Chicago Public Schools ''scandal.'' The few who knew weren't aghast to learn that there's gambling in Casablanca. 
 The Chicago Tribune disclosed a ''secret list'' kept by the public schools during the leadership of Arne Duncan, now the United States secretary of education. The list contained, in part, people who wanted to get children into the best schools. Many, but not all, were from political or other elites, with a C.P.S. official consigned to indicate that he'd help them, though lots didn't get children in and it's unclear how many he or Mr. Duncan did assist 
The finger-wagging implication of criticism is that either there should have been no private memorializing of requests -- it appears that perhaps 25 percent of names on the list were neither big shots nor chums of same -- or that a digital tote board be erected next to the Picasso in Daley Plaza, with 24/7 disclosure of requests. 
 ''It's one more example of how things are done in Illinois,'' harrumphed a Tribune editorial. ''One set of rules for people of clout, another set for everyone else.'' 
 Only later did the editorial concede that one could not definitively conclude that ''clout trumped merit.'' 
 The indignation partly turns on a peculiarly American suspicion of relying on friendship and family to get things, as compared to other cultures where nepotism is often central and associated with loyalty and trust. We are thus rife with hypocrisy. Up and down the socio-economic ladder, door-opening is a fact of life, white collar or blue. Ask generations of firefighters and union tradesmen. 
 We all know examples of a fix being putting in for a friend or relative. I know of friends and former colleagues, including at The Tribune, who used their positions to help a child get a nice, hotly contested job. I've even been a middleman in facilitating, usually not thinking twice.
 It's partly why I suggest we temper our collective moralizing over the ''secret list,'' although I admit I'd be miffed if one of my children was aced out due to favoritism in trying to get into a good school. 
 For more than a century, members of the Illinois General Assembly have had the right to dole out full scholarships to public universities. The original aim involved geographic equity. Tuition waivers sometimes go to children of donors or campaign workers. 
 Similarly, the principals of Chicago's nine ''selective enrollment'' public high schools can fill 5 percent of the slots. The theory is that some talented students just don't test well. A federal investigation is looking into whether there's a disjoint between theory and practice. 
 So what's one to think? 
 If Mr. Duncan felt he was shielding principals from untoward pressure by keeping a centralized accounting, he fell short. Some principals are scared, especially when some influence-peddler suggests that a child's parents would be a big financial contributor to the school. 
 Wouldn't it have been better to tell all requesters quite publicly that Mr. Duncan simply couldn't intercede and that they should either partake in the lottery system or go directly to the principals -- along with an overt directive to principals that decisions should not be based on somebody's real or imagined relationship to Mr. Duncan? 
 Parents and aldermen, among others, will inevitably lobby. Parents do what they feel is best for their children, while politicians look after constituents. 
 The trick may be in how one narrows the yawning divide between haves and have-nots, especially amid godawful poverty. List or no list, will an alderman go to bat for Joe and Donna Nobody? 
 One hopes so, even knowing that playing fields are rarely level. That's the real world, not just some odious, conspiracy-filled ''Chicago Way,'' as some suggest. 
 Given the unavoidably uneven state of schools, ''wouldn't anyone exploit all channels they could?'' asked Wendy Vasquez, a parent at our high-poverty Ravenswood Elementary who oversees a nearby food pantry and knows about inequity. 
 Well, my wife and I -- the only ones on our upscale North Side block to send a child to nearby Ravenswood -- mulled fancier public schools and using influence. We chose not to. I'm not sure if that makes us honorable or just chumps. 
 The real issue is improving schools, especially high schools. If you're just a nice kid who gets A's and B's but isn't in the top 1 percent or 2 percent in the city, where do you go? 
 The choice now is either urban America's grinding mediocrity or the 'burbs.

HEADLINE: Spring-for-It Fever

BYLINE: By HILARY STOUT

 BODY:
THE Columbia is a tall yellow-brick condominium at the corner of Broadway and West 96th Street, populated by many families and professionals. On weekday mornings, the lobby bustles with kids scurrying to school and grown-ups hurrying to work. Lately, though, there has been an addition to the hubbub: Contractors, lines of them, waiting for authorization to ascend the elevator to the apartments they are in the process of renovating. 
 Men with tool belts used to be a common sight around condo and co-op buildings in a city that was renovation-mad. But when the economy collapsed and the real estate market tanked, the contractors, along with the carpenters, plumbers, electricians, floor guys and stone guys, seemed to fade away. 
 Now they're coming back. Across the five boroughs and beyond, the renovation business, which fell victim to tightening credit, declining home sales and overall economic misfortune, is starting to pick up. The increase reflects contradictory forces: a fitful but growing sense that the economy is getting better and, at the same time, more subdued ambitions for the future. 
 ''I think a lot of it has to do with people having a longer-term perspective in their home now,'' said Doug Milles, a member of the condo board of the 300-unit Columbia. He added, ''I've always felt personally that it's a good time to invest in your property during down times, because when things get better, you're going to have a lot more attractive property.''
 Contractors around the region say their phones are starting to ring again.
 ''We've been swamped for the last month,'' said Constantine Rigas, the owner of Bullfrog Builders, which does work in New York City as well as Long Island and Westchester County. ''We're getting just a tremendous amount of people saying: 'I spoke to a friend six months ago and had been meaning to call you. I'm ready to do this now.' '' Business has been so promising for Rikk Davidson, the owner of As You Wish Interiors, a design and building company, that he is opening a showroom in Midtown Manhattan this spring. ''We are putting our money where our mouth is,'' he said. 
 Barry Goggin, the owner of the Barry Goggin Construction Corporation in Ronkonkoma, N.Y., is now booked about six months in advance for remodeling jobs, most of them on Long Island. A year ago, it was two months. 
 ''It's like there's been a pent-up demand,'' he said. ''People needed work done and maybe put it off until times got better.'' Mr. Goggin says he believes that many of the clients now upgrading or expanding their homes would simply have bought a bigger house several years ago.
 Local statistics are hard to find. The New York City Buildings Department, for instance, is responsible for issuing building permits, but doesn't distinguish between projects done for commercial developers and for individual homeowners.
 Moreover, many home renovation projects don't require permits. (Those that do involve structural changes, like rearranging plumbing.)
 The Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, however, predicted in a recent report that the downturn in the home remodeling industry nationwide had hit bottom and that business would steadily increase through the rest of 2010. ''Housing prices in most markets of the country have bottomed out,'' said Kermit Baker, the director of the remodeling futures program at the Harvard center, which does policy research on housing markets. ''People are saying, 'Let's go ahead and do that project.' ''
 In 2004, during the frothy heyday of Manhattan real estate, Joe Laszlo bought the 475-square-foot apartment in Morningside Heights that he had been renting for five and a half years. The building was converting to a co-op, so he got an insider price. He expected, of course, that the market value of the apartment would climb (indeed soar, if the good times continued) and that several years later he would sell it and buy a bigger, nicer place.
 Last spring, Mr. Laszlo realized that his plan probably wasn't going to work. So he is making his place more attractive. This means renovating the ''renter-grade'' kitchen (dated appliances, inefficient storage space, postage-stamp counter space) and bathroom (crummy fixtures, boring tile). 
 Finding a contractor to do the job was no problem, since no one seemed to have much work. ''With one or two exceptions,'' he said, ''folks were interested in talking to me for what seemed like a relatively modest project.'' He got four or five bids and went with a midrange candidate; work began last fall. The renovation was supposed to be completed in eight weeks.
 In fact, it took almost six months (total cost about $36,000). A few foul-ups contributed to the delay -- like the countertop that took weeks to create, and then fell and smashed to pieces the day it was to be delivered. 
 But the contractor's office got busier. Mr. Laszlo felt as if he had ''undivided attention when I started the project,'' he said. ''By the time I reached the midpoint, it felt like it was divided. That was good for them. Not so good for me.''
 Though contractors are again in demand, they have far to go to get back to their boom years, which means homeowners can still get a good deal. 
 Sheri Whitley estimates that by doing renovation work now instead of a few years ago, she and her husband, Mark van Dok, are saving about $10,000. The owners of a co-op in a 19th-century building on Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard, they are having a parlor converted to a master bedroom, and replacing windows and floors in a second bedroom. 
 They bought the apartment for a steal during the height of the boom because the owner had to sell quickly. For a variety of reasons, including a newborn baby, they put off major renovation.
 ''Before, we had thought we would strip the woodwork ourselves,'' Ms. Whitley said. But with prices more reasonable now, ''we said, let's just hire someone to do it.''
 Some renovation projects amount to the extra steps necessary to sell the place in today's uncertain market. Jordan Lippner recently listed his two-bedroom prewar co-op on West 78th Street for $1.595 million, but only after he replaced the floors. 
 When he bought the apartment four years ago, he renovated it, adding built-in bookshelves and installing top-of-the-line appliances (Viking range, Thermador double oven, Bosch dishwasher). But by the time it came to the floors, he'd run out of money. He hid the chipped and worn planks under area rugs. 
 When he decided to sell, his agent, Joyce Bernstein of Prudential Douglas Elliman, advised him that new floors were worth the expense -- and the inconvenience. A few years ago, she said, she would have told him the opposite. 
 ''I'd have said, 'People will pay up and fix the floors themselves.' ''
 But in today's market, ''you really have to give something special to get the money you want,'' she said, adding, ''The rest of the apartment was in such mint condition, the floors would have been the first thing the buyer would notice and want to cut the price.''
 Mr. Lippner got her point. ''If I was going to spend over a million and a half dollars on an apartment,'' he said, ''I wouldn't want to see floors looking like they were 50 years old and crumbling.'' The new ones cost $13,000 and are Brazilian oak.
 Like prospective buyers, however, prospective renovators may still find their visions tempered by financing hurdles. In previous years, owners used home-equity loans and home-equity lines of credit to finance lavish remodeling projects.
 Theproblem with getting one today is not the interest rates: a revolving home-equity line of credit is relatively cheap. (The average rate was 5.52 percent in February 2010, compared with 8.70 percent in February 2007, according to Keith Gumbinger, a vice president of HSH.com, a mortgage analysis and financial publishing firm. The average rate on a fixed-rate home-equity loan was 7.86 percent in February, compared with 8.09 percent in February 2007.) But banks and other lenders have tightened their standards, and home-equity financing is harder to get.
 As a result, many people are paying cash. That's what Mr. Lippner and Ms. Whitley and Mr. Van Dok did. So, too, are Susan and John Gramas, a retired couple who hired Mr. Davidson of As You Wish Interiors to do extensive renovations on their semiattached 1930 house in Bayside, Queens. 
 First came the bathroom. They deep-sixed the tub, installed a shower with a granite bench, and redid the floors and wall with glass tile in shades of brown and beige.
 Then came the kitchen -- an objectionable space, Mrs. Gramas said, with pink and gray Formica. The new space has been reconfigured, and has granite countertops (beige with gray and green flecks), glass tiles, cherry cabinets and a stainless-steel Viking refrigerator.
 Now to the basement. They have upgraded the electricity and are redoing a bathroom and laundry room, as well as creating a special space for their cats and their litter boxes. Mrs. Gramas says they have spent about $120,000 on the renovations and are thrilled.
 ''We knew it was a lot of money,'' she said. ''But we figured you can't take it with you, so you might as well enjoy it.''
 Back in his small Morningside Heights co-op, Mr. Laszlo, too, has found that if he couldn't trade up, the cost and nuisance of a renovation were worth it. 
 ''In the end, I love the new space,'' he said. ''It makes me happy.''

HEADLINE: Theodore S. Hammer

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Hammer, 64, is a managing partner at HLW International, an architectural, interior design and engineering firm based in New York.
 The company, which celebrates its 125th year in business this year, has been involved in projects throughout Manhattan, many involving media companies like Google, News Corporation and the Food Network.
 Q When is the 125th anniversary? 
 A I cannot tell you when the business was exactly opened -- that's something that was lost in history -- but we do know for sure this is the 125th year.
 Q How is the business doing?
 A Pretty darn good considering we're in a Great Recession. We're fortunate that we have five offices. Shanghai, London, Los Angeles and Abu Dhabi are doing pretty well. In New York, things are a bit slow but getting better.
 There's been more activity in New York in the last two months than in the last eight. There are people who are thinking about thinking about doing work, which is two steps removed; there are people actually doing work; there are even some developers planning for the next up cycle.
 Q What projects are you working on in the New York area? 
 A We're finishing up a lot of work at JPMorgan Chase and their revised headquarters at 270 Park. We're finishing work at the United Nations. And we're doing a fair amount of work for ESPN, a new broadcast center in Bristol, Conn.; a network center for HBO out in Long Island; and then we have continuing work for some large corporate clients, mostly in the media and financial services.
 Q Are you doing more interiors? A In every recession our interiors practice grows as people re-evaluate what they have and consolidate, dispose of properties, and reuse existing facilities. The interiors practice has grown to nearly 40 percent of business; normally it's about 30 percent.
 Q What are the trends in office design right now?
 A In the '60s and '70s there was office landscape -- everything was based on being more efficient. And there was a whole wave in the '80s to '90s about technology and being mobile. Now it's more about demographics, with a younger work force coming in and being less concerned with the specifics of the workplace and the politics, but rather just wanting to have what they need to do their job.
 Q So there's less treatment of the corner office as currency?
 A There seem to be more types of spaces being created with a real attempt to make the office more homelike.
 Q How so?
 A Some of the clients in new media have free food, exercise places, game rooms, and they're trying to get employees to be in the office as much as possible and be comfortable there. It's more like a campus.
 Q Are your designs helping to improve productivity?
 A I'll give a couple of examples at Bloomberg's building in London:
 We were walking around with the facilities guy there, and he said they had a group of ''cold callers'' who were not very productive. Cold callers try to make appointments for the sales people to sell Bloomberg. So eight of them were in a room, facing a wall. I suggested creating two teams of four facing each other. We put up a scoreboard above, and for every appointment they made they got a point. Their activity went up 38 percent.
 They also had problems with vendors. So I created a room in the middle of the cafeteria, where everybody could see them in a glass-enclosed conference room. There are four standup positions, and when a vendor came in with a PowerPoint presentation, they plugged in this clock that starts at 30 minutes. When it counts down to zero, the green light flashes red, letting everyone know you're wasting their time.
 Q Do you have favorite projects?
 A In the Middle East, my favorite project is the Kuwait Chamber of Commerce. It's patterned after a building type called a caravanserai, which hundreds of years ago was really the first hotel. They were towers and at the top they had a flame that welcomed visitors. So we designed a tower with a symbolic flame on top. Although quite contemporary, it has old wood doors and portals.
 Q Why are there so many toys in your office?
 A People enjoy playing and listening to lessons each toy might hold. For many new clients and employees, I give them this four-inch sphere, two-thirds filled with water. It's a little ecosphere -- it has fish, algae and shrimp.
 The algae provides oxygen for the fish, the fish eat the microorganisms, the shrimp clean up the algae. It's in perfect balance, just like a real team. And like a team, if any one of those individuals doesn't do its job, this turns into a brown messy gooky scum.

HEADLINE: A Race for Assembly, Strikingly Varied

BYLINE: By DANIEL WEINTRAUB. 
Daniel Weintraub has reported on California politics and policy for more than 20 years.

 BODY:
Given the dysfunction in Sacramento, it is a little surprising that anyone with stature in a community would want to run for the Legislature these days. But in the Democratic Party primary to represent a Peninsula district in the Assembly, three such gluttons for punishment have stepped forward.
 The three, Rich Gordon, a San Mateo County supervisor; Josh Becker, a Silicon Valley investor; and Yoriko Kishimoto, a Palo Alto councilwoman, bring different assets to the race to represent what might be the brainiest -- and wealthiest -- district in the state. 
 Split almost evenly between San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties, the 21st District is home to Stanford University and a large swath of Silicon Valley.
 In this race, you could parse the statements of the three major candidates and discern a difference here or there on some issues. But the truth is that when it comes to voting in Sacramento, any one of the three would probably side with the party's leadership on almost every big decision.
 So the real questions are these: Who are these people? What are their life experiences? How do they think and act, and how might that shape what kind of legislator they will become?
 Here the differences are profound. 
 Mr. Gordon, of Menlo Park, is a former minister and social worker who served on the county school board and then the Board of Supervisors for three terms. He knows government from the inside but also knows how difficult some of the problems on the street are, since he used to work there, counseling troubled youths.
 Mr. Gordon's experience in San Mateo County would arm him with knowledge of two things his county has done that the state has never been able to master: build a reliable reserve and evaluate government programs based on their performance.
 The county has been a leader in embracing a concept known as outcome-based budgeting, where every program is required to show what it has accomplished with its budget each year.
 ''It's changed the culture of our government,'' Mr. Gordon said. ''It's changed it from one that is more of a time clock, of counting the numbers, to one that asks, Are we having an impact?''
 Mr. Becker, also of Menlo Park, is the outsider in this race, a man with no experience in elective office but a record as an entrepreneur and a connector who makes a living bringing people together. He brings investors to people who are trying to start or expand a business. And he brings business owners to nonprofit groups trying to advance social change.
 Much of Mr. Becker's work has been focused on alternative forms of energy. He is especially fond of programs that allow homeowners to finance energy efficiency improvements as part of their property tax bill.
 ''I want to take the smart ideas from this area and bring them to Sacramento,'' he said. ''The Silicon Valley needs someone in Sacramento who understands the innovation economy and understands what we need to do to keep making the Silicon Valley successful.''
 Ms. Kishimoto is probably the candidate most connected to politics and issues on the neighborhood level. She said that her experience as an immigrant child speaking no English gave her an understanding of the new California, and that her education at Stanford gave her a high-level knowledge of how the state's economy works, or does not. In 1988, she was a co-author of ''The Third Century, America's Resurgence in the Asian Era,'' a book pointing the way forward for a United States that was then doubting its ability to compete with an ascending Japan.
 Ms. Kishimoto is a former mayor and member of the City Council in Palo Alto, where her first contact with politics came when she fought City Hall over a proposal to raise the speed limit on her street (she won). That issue reflects one of her passions: walkable communities. 
 She has been a leader in the effort to ensure that a planned high-speed rail line does not destroy the Peninsula's neighborhoods. She said she would take that skill -- connecting big issues to small places -- with her to Sacramento.
 ''Our democracy and our open entrepreneurial economy and our social diversity are our greatest strengths,'' Ms. Kishimoto said. ''We need to understand them and build on them.''

HEADLINE: Closing of Auto Plant Forces Suppliers to Scramble

BYLINE: By FRANCES DINKELSPIEL

 BODY:
For the last nine years Doc Skinner, a plant manager at the Vuteq California Corporation in Hayward, has supervised the 65 employees who build interior trim parts for the Toyota Tacoma truck. But that part of his resume is no longer likely to secure his financial future.
 With the imminent closing of New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., the automobile plant that is Vuteq's primary customer, Mr. Skinner has found himself in a new role: driving around the Central Valley trying to drum up new business and find new markets -- and figure out how to tailor what Vuteq makes to their needs.
''My background is in manufacturing and production,'' he said. ''Marketing and sales are new to me. But I've been spending time in the field visiting different companies and talking to them about what we are doing.''
 A lot of New United Motor Manufacturing's suppliers are finding themselves in a similar situation. While Nummi, which is jointly owned by Toyota and General Motors, will close on Thursday --throwing 4,700 people out of work -- some of its suppliers are scrambling to create new markets and products. It is a race against time, but some may succeed if they are nimble enough to reinvent themselves. 
 Stakes are huge. A recent report prepared for Bill Lockyer, the state treasurer, estimated that Nummi's closing would cost 20,000 jobs in businesses that supply the plant. California stands to lose $1 billion in tax revenue in the next decade, it said, unless some of the suppliers develop new products or new customers or both.
 To that end, Alameda County, which stands to lose more jobs than any other county, has hired Manex, a consulting company in San Ramon, to assess its 31 Nummi suppliers and devise a plan to help them stay in business. The study concluded that only 2 of the 13 companies surveyed were diversified and innovative enough to survive Nummi's closing. But six or seven others might survive if they received money to help them restructure, said Brent Meyers, the president of Manex. 
 The most fundamental skill set required, Mr. Meyers said, is one that is part of the DNA of Silicon Valley: being entrepreneurial in finding and exploiting new markets. The supply companies generally have well-trained work forces and high production quality. They rank high in efficiency, he said, but lack the marketing dimension that is now crucial.
 ''A lot of their business skills atrophied,'' Mr. Meyers said. ''You need people thinking about strategy five years out and thinking 'how do we get there? Who are the customers? What do they want and how do we get them?' ''
 The report concludes that it will take about $2 million to assist these companies in increasing their sales and marketing staffs and helping them innovate. The Alameda County Workforce Investment Board has $500,000 in job-relocation money it can direct toward the effort, said Roy Bertuccelli, the board's program specialist. State support is possible, but uncertain.
 ''I may be a little critical of the action to help suppliers,'' said Ebi Mogharei, plant manager for Injex Industries in Hayward, which makes plastic interior door panels and other parts for Nummi. ''It's not enough, and it's not fast enough.''
 Mr. Mogharei said he was frustrated by the pace of government help. Injex Industries is one of Nummi's on-time suppliers, which means it gets an order each day for a set number of car parts like plastic cup holders and the dashboard covers that frame the gauges, and produces and delivers those parts the same day. Workers can make a door panel every 58 seconds; using all their machines, they produce 400 panels every two hours. The company's culture is built on speed. 
 ''I've only got eight days left,'' Mr. Mogharei said recently. ''Are they going to be able to ramp up and get us some business in eight days? I don't think so. People are trying to do a lot of things, but it's not going to happen fast enough, unfortunately.''
 Mr. Mogharei has told most of his 380 employees that they will be laid off Wednesday, the day before Nummi closes. In the meantime, Mark Petri, the director of marketing and sales, is looking at the packaging industry to see if Injex might make containers for California's fruits and vegetables. He has also talked to green technology entrepreneurs who have good product ideas but little production expertise. There are no firm deals yet.
 ''People are willing to listen,'' Mr. Petri said. But ''the bottom line is paramount.''
 At Vuteq, Mr. Skinner has been looking to industries that import containers and packing materials from outside California. He declined to say which companies he had visited in the Central Valley, now that he was competing with other former Nummi suppliers.
 If Injex Industries or Vuteq succeed, they and their products will reflect the new face of manufacturing in the Bay Area. In the decades after World War II, the region was filled with factories producing cars, trucks and heavy machinery.
 That gave way in the 1980s and '90s to plants making computers and printers, according to a 2004 report by Collaborative Economics. Now those production lines have moved out of state or overseas, and most Bay Area manufacturers produce small component parts or offer engineering, design and production services.
 ''There is manufacturing here, but it's a certain kind of manufacturing -- contract manufacturers, technical companies, companies that provide components,'' said Doug Henton, the chief executive of Collaborative Economics, which is based in Mountain View. ''It is not the large-scale commercial manufacturing.''
 Consultants from Manex plan to meet with Injex Industries and other suppliers in the next few weeks to help them strategize about new approaches to their businesses. Santa Clara County just hired the company to perform the same assessment for its suppliers.
 Mr. Mogharei knows that any transformation of his company will happen after it lays off most workers. He is trying to help employees and has applied for Trade Adjustment Assistance status with the federal government, which would give them extended health and unemployment insurance. He also arranged for representatives from Chabot College to sign up workers for classes on job-searching techniques. 
 Some Injex employees have already started planning what to do next. Marita Modi, a team leader who oversees the construction of door panels, cut back on expenses more than six months ago when she learned Nummi might close. 
 Ms. Modi, whose husband was recently laid off from his job at the Oakland airport, hopes to train for a new field. She wants to become a nurse, taking advantage of the four languages she has learned while working with Injex's multinational staff.
 ''I want to learn different things,'' Ms. Modi said. ''I have savings, and I am O.K. I think I can get another job, so I am not too nervous.''
 And last weekend, Injex Industries rented out a hall at the Santa Clara Convention Center and had a party for 500 people to celebrate the company's 25 years. It was an opportunity for the workers to set aside their worries about unemployment and get together just for fun. 
 By Tuesday, Mr. Mogharei had produced a yearbook-like book was filled with photos of the various production teams, workers dressed in Halloween costumes, party attendees and baby showers over the years. He even left some pages blank so workers could sign one another's books.
 Printed on the cover were the words, ''Injex says goodbye.''

 BODY:
ECO-ISTE/ ($(4$) k st) /n. / A neologism combining 'ecologist' and 'egoiste' to indicate a person devoted to her own green agenda, irrespective of the downside. Often used to describe a style-conscious individual who wears her do-gooding heart on her Balmain sleeve, e.g., She's such an eco-iste. She thinks that recycling her grandmother's vintage Vuitton luggage somehow cancels out her carbon footprnt from chartering that private jet to Brazil. 
 FEral/ (fer$(4$) el) / adj. / Of or like a wild animal; savage. Can describe animals, as in, ''Australia's Kakadu National Park is teeming with feral beasts like horses and buffalo that threaten the natural habitat,'' as well as humans, e.g., He's gone totally feral since he returned from that farm stay in Costa Rica. He's grown a Zach Galifianakis beard and is no longer heatng his loft.
 DISCREET/ (di skrt$(4$)) / adj. / Lacking pretension or ostentation; modest. A word having a recession-era revival for travelers who want to go somewhere with less flash -- Lake Powell, Ariz., over Las Vegas, say, or Palermo over Rome:We love Palermo because it's discreet and not overtly chic, but you'll find extraordinary beauty and culture behind every church door.

HEADLINE: Credit Ratings: The View From Standard & Poor's

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Your March 21 editorial discussing credit rating firms (''Moody's and the Debt Threat'') refers to a 2008 Securities and Exchange Commission report without noting that the same report also stated that there was no evidence that decisions about ratings methodologies or models were based on attracting or losing market share. 
 While there are potential (and manageable) conflicts in any model, the market greatly benefits from the issuer-pays model as it allows us to distribute our ratings to all investors free of charge. That's not the case in a subscriber model that creates information ''haves'' and ''have-nots'' in the marketplace.
 In addition, we have regularly published our rationale for maintaining the United States' current triple-A rating (for example, resilient economy, status of the dollar as the world's reserve currency), but have also cited its huge spending increases and deficits as reasons for concern in the long term.
 Should our opinion ever be that the United States (or any debt issuer) should have its rating adjusted, we will do so without consideration of the impact of that rating change on other entities. To do otherwise would compromise our independence and objectivity.
 Finally, in contrast to your implication that we won't downgrade our bank issuers, since January 2008 Standard & Poor's Ratings Services has downgraded the ratings of more than 350 banks and other financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank.

HEADLINE: A Promise of Jobs Remains Only Partly Fulfilled

BYLINE: By EMMA GRAVES FITZSIMMONS

 BODY:
When Ronald Bender and about 260 other workers were unexpectedly laid off from a North Side window factory 15 months ago, they staged a sit-in and gained national attention as symbols of a work force battered by hard times. 
 A few months later, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. visited the former Republic Windows & Doors factory to herald its reopening by a new company that promised to rehire the workers, and it seemed their immediate troubles were over. Local politicians joined Mr. Biden on a stage to deliver speeches to a cheering crowd, applauding one another and the jobs the factory would create.
Mr. Bender had thought he might be rehired for one of those new jobs, but today he is still living on unemployment benefits. Only about 30 workers have been hired back. The rest are waiting. The new company underestimated the difficulties of refashioning the factory and perhaps overestimated demand for its energy-efficient windows.
 ''It's hard to get up and think, 'Well, I'm not going to work today,' '' said Mr. Bender, 57, who spent 14 years at the factory. '' 
 The struggle of former Republic workers is a reflection of the diminishing job market that has hit the state especially hard. The unemployment rate in Illinois in February was 11.4 percent, the worst it has been since 1983 and higher than the national rate. 
 For Mr. Bender and dozens of other former Republic employees, the difficult circumstances have led to a seemingly endless cycle of job applications and rejections. Mr. Bender has applied for manufacturing and security jobs, and even cleaning work, but he has not been able to find anything. He has tried to stay busy by doing work around the house, but he said that he was disappointed that more workers had not been rehired, and that he hoped to be back with his friends making windows soon. 
 Much depends on the success of Serious Materials, the California-based company that bought the factory last February, which brought with it the favorable publicity from the company's promise to put all of Republic's employees back to work. As a builder of energy-efficient windows, Serious Materials has become a prominent beneficiary of the Obama administration's efforts to create so-called ''green jobs.''
 The company hopes to see increased demand for its windows because of financing for energy-saving building materials included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. At the factory last April, Mr. Biden said the rehired workers would serve as an example of jobs created by the recovery act. 
 It was a highly publicized event attended by Mayor Richard M. Daley and Senators Richard J. Durbin and Roland W. Burris. A Serious Materials promotional flier said all the workers would be back by the end of 2009. 
 After the cameras left, the real picture turned out to be far more complex. 
 In an interview this month, Kevin Surace, the chief executive of Serious Materials, said he had not rehired many workers because it took longer than expected to get the factory running again because much of the equipment was missing or damaged. The weatherization program in the recovery act has also moved slowly, Mr. Surace said. As of February, less than 8 percent of the weatherization money had been spent, according to the Energy Department. 
 Meanwhile, the former owner of Republic Windows, Richard B. Gillman, awaits trial in state court on charges that he plotted to steal money from employees and creditors in what prosecutors called a criminal case of ''corporate greed.'' Prosecutors said Mr. Gillman secretly loaded 10 semitrailer trucks with equipment to furnish a new factory in Iowa, an action that workers had complained about loudly during their sit-in.
 Mr. Gillman pleaded not guilty and was released after posting 10 percent of his $5 million bond. His lawyer, Ed Genson, called the charges a publicity stunt by the Cook County State's Attorney's office and said Mr. Gillman had had permission to remove the equipment. 
 By the time the workers were able to begin producing windows again at the end of last year, Mr. Surace said, it was winter, a period when business slows in Northern cities. 
 ''It took us an awful lot longer than we had hoped,'' Mr. Surace said. ''That's our fault, not anyone else's. It just took that long. We didn't realize what shape things were in. We would have loved to bring everyone back.'' 
 Now that orders have increased and the factory has dozens of dealers carrying its products, Mr. Surace said he hopes to have 100 workers back by the end of the year. They are being rehired based on seniority and on which positions most need to be filled, he said. 
 The Chicago factory is an important element of the future plans of Serious Materials, a private company whose rise was highlighted when Mr. Surace was named 2009 Entrepreneur of the Year by Inc. magazine. The start-up has reported that it has raised more than $120 million in capital. 
 Among five Serious Materials factories across the country, the one in Chicago is the largest and the company's primary supplier to Midwest outlets. Earlier this month, the company was chosen for a high-profile project to retrofit more than 6,500 windows in the Empire State Building. And Mr. Surace said he had toured Willis Tower, formerly called Sears Tower, to explore the possibility of retrofitting its windows. 
 Ricky Maclin, a 56-year-old glass-line worker, was rehired in late January. 
 ''When you're used to working,'' Mr. Maclin said, ''that's just what is in your blood, and that's all we ever really wanted was our jobs. One of the things that for me made unemployment more bearable was knowing I did have a job to come back to, as opposed to millions of people that are just unemployed and there is no light at the end of the tunnel.'' 
 As vice president of Local 1110 of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, Mr. Maclin regularly attends labor rallies and talks about his experience with the sit-in. The union, which helped obtain severance and accrued vacation pay for its members to resolve the dispute, has negotiated a contract with Serious Materials that requires the recall of all members before anyone else is hired. 
 ''We are a family,'' Mr. Maclin said. ''It's not the same sitting at the Christmas table if Grandma isn't there and Aunt Claire and Uncle Bob. You know, you don't feel whole. That is pretty much the atmosphere at the plant now. We win, lose and fight as a family.'' 
 Rocio Perez agreed, saying she has missed the colleagues she had at Republic for seven years. Ms. Perez, 38, a single mother of five, has not been rehired and juggles priorities to pay bills. She has tried to make the most of her free time by taking English classes at night at Truman College. 
 ''He can't recall people without the work,'' she said in Spanish. ''He inherited a disaster of a situation.'' 
 Ms. Perez said she looked back on the upheaval of the last 15 months as a mostly positive experience because she learned to stand up for herself. She was surprised, she said, to discover that her children had learned the same lesson. When their school faced closing, her daughters said they wanted to follow her example by speaking at a Chicago Board of Education meeting in support of their school. 
 ''I really saw the example we had made by taking our factory and fighting back,'' Ms. Perez said. ''It was a way for our children who are the future to defend themselves as well.'' 
 The school, Peabody Elementary School, was saved. Maybe her job will be, too, she said, adding, ''We're going to wait, and we're going to hope.''

HEADLINE: The Pulse: Scrutinizing the Numbers Of Caterpillar's Complaint

BYLINE: By DAVID GREISING

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc. of Peoria has jumped to the forefront of manufacturing companies complaining about the cost of the federal health care overhaul. On March 18 the company sent a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representative John A. Boehner, the Republican leader, saying mandated changes would cost it ''$100 million in the first year alone.'' 
 Caterpillar's complaint led to dozens of headlines, but a closer look at the impact of the new law indicates it is not quite the budget buster that the company's human resources executive, Gregory Folley, implied in his missive.
According to a regulatory filing by the company last week, the $100 million figure is Caterpillar's estimated total cost for as long as the newly enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act remains in effect. And the $100 million charge is an accounting change, a noncash cost that has no affect on the company's operations.
 In addition, the $100 million figure does not arise from changes to decades-long practices at Caterpillar. Rather, it comes about because the new law removes a tax break codified in 2003.
 No company sneezes at the elimination of a $100 million tax break. But in 2008, Caterpillar had $51 billion in sales, and profits topped $3.5 billion for the third straight year. The projected profits for 2010 are a relatively weak $1.56 billion, and the $100 million tax charge would mean an additional 6 percent reduction.
 Most companies steer away from politics, but Jim Owens, left, the company's soon-to-retire chief executive, has held forth on climate change and other controversial issues. Most notably, in February 2009, Mr. Owens contradicted President Obama's claim that the stimulus package would help Caterpillar rehire some of its 22,000 laid-off workers. He did so on the day Mr. Obama visited Caterpillar's Peoria factory.

HEADLINE: Pro-Business Lobbying Blitz Takes on Obama's Plan for Wall Street Overhaul

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU and EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With the Obama administration looking to score another major legislative victory, an array of pro-business groups and fiscal conservatives are mounting a well-financed campaign to scale back or block altogether the Democrats' plan to overhaul regulation of the financial industry. 
 By the time the campaign is over, opponents of regulation plans will probably have spent tens of millions of dollars to lobby Washington lawmakers, run advertisements and start petition drives. It is an effort that many of the players, from the United States Chamber of Commerce down to smaller splinter groups, see as vital to their economic survival. 
 ''This is a re-ordering of our financial institutions for generations to come,'' Paul Schott Stevens, president of the Investment Company Institute, said last week at a meeting hosted by the chamber. 
 Wall Street executives say that although they support increased regulation, the changes sought by Democrats could exacerbate the problems that emerged in the 2008 economic crisis rather than fix them. Among the targets of their criticism are the creation of a consumer fiscal protection agency, the establishment of a multibillion-dollar fund to head off bailouts of companies deemed ''too big to fail,'' and the regulation of derivatives as well as other high-risk trading instruments. 
 On the opposing side, labor unions and other groups are pushing hard to enact tougher measures, including provisions to rein in executive compensation and allow shareholders more say on a company's board.
 Many of the arguments the financial industry is making in opposition to the plan echo the themes heard in the health care debate: more government involvement is the problem, not the solution; tightened regulation risks stifling competition; and the plan is fiscally irresponsible. 
 But the common refrains mask the divisions among the legislation's opponents, who tend to agree that the overhaul is dangerous but point to very different elements of the House and Senate plans. 
 ''I don't think there's a unified business community position yet, nor do I think there will be because there are so many different interests,'' Steve Elmendorf, a lobbyist for Citigroup and other major firms, said in an interview.
 ''There are obviously a lot of stakeholders here -- Wall Street, big banks, hedge funds, insurers, mortgage brokers -- who all care about what happens here,'' he said. 
 Indeed, the issue has attracted a dizzying array of lobbyists since last year, when the House began considering, and ultimately passed, a bill to impose a wide range of new restrictions. The debate has shifted to the Senate, where the banking committee approved a Democratic plan on a straight party-line vote.
 By the end of last year, lobbyists from some 400 businesses and groups, including bankers, beer makers, cruise ship operators and grocery stores, had registered with Congress to weigh in on the regulatory reform, according to data analyzed by the Center for Public Integrity, a research and advocacy group in Washington. That number is expected to climb when new lobbying reports are filed next month. 
 In the last decade, the financial sector has spent more money than any other industry to influence Washington policy -- more than $3.9 billion, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Wall Street's resistance to some of the plan's core elements has already drawn condemnation from the Obama administration. 
 One of the more public campaigns against the Democrats' reforms does not come from Wall Street, however. It comes from an obscure, Republican-leaning group that is seeking to cast the plan as a boon to Wall Street. 
 The group, the Committee for Truth in Politics, has spent an estimated $5 million on advertising against the proposals, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which monitors political advertising. The ads portray the financial reforms -- misleadingly, the administration says -- as a $4 trillion bailout for big banks. 
 The group's membership and financing have been kept secret, and it has refused to divulge its donors; it is suing the Federal Election Commission, claiming the rules for disclosure in political advertising are an unconstitutional impediment to free speech.
 James Bopp Jr., the lawyer and conservative advocate who represents the group in its lawsuit, said in an interview that the ads accurately reflected a section in the House bill that would allow the Federal Reserve to spend up to $4 trillion to stabilize the financial system in a liquidity crisis. He said characterizing the bill as anything other than a bailout ''is a typical Washington lie where politicians do one thing in Washington, which is to advance the Obama socialist agenda, and lie about it when they go home because they don't want anyone to know about it.''
 But Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who guided the bill through the House, calls the ad campaign ''a complete mischaracterization'' of the legislation, which he said would limit the Fed's ability to support otherwise healthy banks during a liquidity crisis and prevent the type of bailouts that have gone to A.I.G. and other giant firms. 
 The ads have run in about 10 states, including those of Democratic members of the Senate Banking Committee. 
 Senator Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, said his office had received ''hundreds'' of calls citing the ''bailout'' language in an ad by the Committee for Truth in Politics, after it started being broadcast in his state in February. ''This is not a bailout,'' he said of the Senate bill. ''I don't support bailouts.''
 The plan's focus on tighter regulation of ''too big to fail'' institutions has also pitted bigger banks against smaller ones, with the smaller, community-based banks generally supportive of the proposed regulations and Wall Street opposed.
 Camden R. Fine, president of the Independent Community Bankers of America, an association that spent about $4.75 million last year on federal lobbying, said his organization was outmatched in finances and resources in the debate by Wall Street's representatives in Washington. 
 ''Literally, when our guys are walking into a key senator's office'' to plead their case on the legislation, ''they can see four or five Wall Street lobbyists walking out, and that can be a little intimidating.''
 The Chamber of Commerce, which spent a reported $123 million on lobbying last year, has already spent $3 million on ads criticizing the reform proposals, and it plans to spend at least that much more on future ads, David Hirschmann, senior vice president of the chamber, said in an interview. The group is reaching out to Democrats and Republicans, he said, on the Senate Banking Committee and elsewhere.
 The intensity of the rhetoric was on display at last week's Chamber of Commerce meeting. The deputy Treasury secretary, Neal S. Wolin, was invited as the keynote lunch speaker and surprised some audience members by offering a bruising indictment of the chamber's position on regulatory reform, calling the opposition ''shortsighted and misguided.''
 ''As the president has made clear, we will oppose efforts to weaken it,'' Mr. Wolin said. ''And my primary message to you today is this: so should you.''

HEADLINE: The Talent to Contend, And the Experience to Win It All

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
SYRACUSE
 This year's March Madness has crystallized the debate over talent versus experience, team building versus quick fixes.
 One night, Kentucky's freshmen-laden team defeats a senior-led Cornell team in a triumph of talent over experience. Forty-eight hours later, West Virginia's convincing victory over Kentucky in the East Regional final intensifies the argument that a team of talented, experienced players will beat a team of talented rookies.
 The tournament makes a strong case for a blend. 
 Butler, with three sophomores, a junior and a senior starting, is making its first trip to the Final Four. Duke, with a heavily junior-senior team, is returning to the Final Four for the first time in six years. And Michigan State, also led by juniors and seniors, is back in another Final Four. Each team makes a compelling case for recruiting with the long haul in mind.
 Kentucky was the only team in the final eight that relied heavily on freshmen: John Wall, Eric Bledsoe and DeMarcus Cousins were first, third and fourth on the team in minutes played. This served Kentucky well in the short run. In the long run?
 Who cares?
 Brandon Knight, the nation's top recruit and best point guard, is reportedly ready to commit to Kentucky. He could be another great young one-and-done player for Kentucky, but will this mean another late March disappointment for Coach John Calipari?
 It's frightening, and a little sad, to think of the kind of team Kentucky would have with Wall, Cousins and Bledsoe returning for a second season.
 ''You and I both know that ain't going to happen,'' Coach Bob Huggins said Saturday night after his West Virginia Mountaineers had flustered, frustrated and pummeled Kentucky.
 Huggins would like to see Walls and Cousins stay, too. 
 ''I would have liked to have coached a lot of kids for all four years,'' he said. ''It is sad. But at the same time, they stay, they get hurt, their stock drops, so what do they do? They go get a job making $22,000 a year -- if they can find a job. Jobs are hard to find. Our economy's a mess. It's really hard. It's a business decision. 
 ''I say this stuff and then people think I don't care about education; I do care about education.''
 Huggins is in favor of the requirement that prevents players from entering the N.B.A. until they are 19 and out of high school for at least a year.
 ''I think you miss a lot when you don't have the college experience,'' he said. ''People say to me, We shouldn't have one and done, we should just let them go. I don't agree with that. I think they ought to have to stay two years. I think every day they spend on a college campus helps prepare them for the rest of their life.''
 That's a debatable point. The idea that a freshman, up to his eyeballs in basketball, with designs on a pro career, can whiz through an institution of higher learning and learn by osmosis seems delusional.
 On the other hand, a two-, three- or four-year process is far more gratifying.
 West Virginia's Da'Sean Butler is Exhibit A for that idea.
 Butler is the senior forward who propelled West Virginia to the Final Four, but as a freshman, his world seemed upside down. He was trapped in a system for which he was ill suited, then Coach John Beilein left. Butler contemplated following Beilein to Michigan anyway, but decided against it after a team meeting.
 ''We decided that whatever comes here, we'll take it on together,'' Butler said. ''We took a big chance, not knowing what they were going to get.''
 The announcement that Huggins would be the new coach did not immediately put the Mountaineers' players at ease. ''I had the same impression everybody had before they ever knew who he was,'' Butler said. ''You hear so much about him, how he cheats, he's a jerk, then you meet him, and he's far from it.''
 Three years later, Butler, his teammates and Huggins have forged the sort of bond that can come only with time.
 ''I'd do anything in my power to make him happy,'' Butler said. ''If he asked me to run through one of these walls, I'd do it, and keep doing it until I ran through.''
 Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski touched on this theme before his team faced Baylor in the South Regional final. Krzyzewski said the central element of effectively building this team -- and all of the great teams he has had -- was trust.
 ''I think it starts with trust from the time they were freshmen,'' Krzyzewski said. ''We've been together for a long time, and we not only like one another, but we respect one another and we trust one another. So you can say things in a moment that you might not say to other people in the manner in which you would say it, whether it be in anger, in joy, whatever. You can express your emotions right away with them. We have those type of relationships. I think in order to be a consistent winner, it has to start with trust.'' 
 We are surrounded by the quick and the instant, but great teams, like solid relationships, are built over time.
 That is the lesson of March Madness, 2010: all things in time.

HEADLINE: Donald N. Frey, Designer of the Mustang, Dies at 86

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Donald N. Frey, the engineer who spearheaded the design and development of the Mustang, the spunky, stylish, affordably priced ''pony car'' that the Ford Motor Company rolled out in the mid-1960s in one of the most successful car introductions in automotive history, died March 5 in Evanston, Ill., where he lived. He was 86.
 The cause was a stroke, his son Christopher said. 
 Though much of the Mustang was borrowed from other Ford vehicles, including a Falcon chassis, the car developed an identity all its own for a younger generation in search of new looks and experiences. It was designed to appeal to both men and women, had a dash of elegance copied from European sports cars, and featured a galloping steed in the middle of its grille that buyers thought was, well, really cool.
 Steve McQueen was almost upstaged by the souped-up Mustang he drove in the movie ''Bullitt.''
 Mr. Frey and his team created the car -- from approval by top management to the showroom -- in just 18 months, and expectations were modest when it was introduced on April 17, 1964, at the New York World's Fair. Ford figured it would sell 80,000 Mustangs in its first year. It sold more than a million in its first two years. 
 Mr. Frey (pronounced fry) would go on to other achievements. He was chairman and chief executive of the Bell & Howell Company, recipient of the National Medal of Technology and a member of the executive board of the World Bank. He was proudest, he said, of helping to introduce safety improvements like disc brakes and radial tires to Ford cars.
 But to automotive cognoscenti and just plain car lovers, the Mustang was his defining accomplishment. At gatherings of Mustang enthusiasts, Mr. Frey was often besieged by autograph hunters in the manner of a rock star. 
 As Ford's assistant general manager and chief engineer, Mr. Frey worked closely on the Mustang project with Lee A. Iacocca, then general manager of the Ford division. Mr. Frey is credited with coming up with the initial Mustang prototype, a mid-engine two-seater roadster unveiled in 1962. He later led all design and engineering work. (Other designers, led by Joe Oros, later added back seats and other features.)
 Mr. Frey pursued the project even though Henry Ford II, the president of the company, had turned it down four times, partly because Ford's new Edsel had just failed so spectacularly. Lacking an official go-ahead, Mr. Frey met with Mr. Iacocca and other engineers and designers in a motel at night and in a storage room by day.
 ''The whole project was bootlegged,'' Mr. Frey told USA Today in 2004. ''There was no official approval of this thing. We had to do it on a shoestring.''
 When Mr. Ford finally approved the project, he looked directly at Mr. Frey and told him in several unprintable words that he would be fired if the Mustang was not successful, according to Mr. Frey, who recounted the episode in 2004 in an interview with Northwestern, the alumni magazine of Northwestern University, where Mr. Frey taught engineering for 20 years, until 2008. 
 When Ford promoted Mr. Frey to vice president of North American vehicle product development in 1967, Time magazine called him ''Detroit's sharpest idea man.''
 In his book ''Mustang: An American Classic'' (2009), Mike Mueller quotes Mr. Frey as saying the inspiration for the Mustang came from watching Chevrolet's successful strategy for improving sales of the compact car Corvair. ''I guess in desperation they put bucket seats in the thing, called it the Monza, and it started to sell,'' Mr. Frey said.
 But he told Northwestern that the spark had come from his children. ''Dad, your cars stink,'' he remembered them saying at the dinner table. ''There's no pizzazz.''
 In addition to his son Christopher, Mr. Frey is survived by his fourth wife, Kay Everly, from whom he was separated; another son, Donald Jr.; three daughters, Margaret Walton, Catherine McNair and Elizabeth Sullivan; a brother, Stuart, who was also a top executive at Ford; nine grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren. 
 Donald Nelson Frey was born on March 13, 1923, in St. Louis and grew up in Waterloo, Iowa, where his father was chief metallurgist for a John Deere plant. He attended Michigan State University for two years, then left to serve in the Army in World War II. After his discharge, he earned bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in metallurgy from the University of Michigan.
 He stayed to teach at Michigan but later left to manage Ford's metallurgy department in its laboratory, hoping to acquire real-world engineering experience, as he told The New York Times in 1965. 
 Mr. Frey left Ford in 1968 to become president of the General Cable Corporation. In the 1970s and '80s he was chairman of Bell & Howell. He divested it of less profitable operations like mail-handling equipment and nurtured its profitable videotape division. 
 Meanwhile, the Mustang gained weight and horsepower before being downsized just in time for the 1970s spike in gas prices. In 1979 it got bigger again and then went through yet more redesigns. Its popularity oscillated, too, but the original boom was never equaled. 
 At his death Mr. Frey owned an original Mustang, his son Christopher said, adding that he liked to drive it fast.

HEADLINE: Japanese Team Wins Pritzker Architecture Prize

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa, partners in the Japanese architectural firm Sanaa, have won the 2010 Pritzker Architecture Prize, the profession's highest honor.
 ''They explore like few others the phenomenal properties of continuous space, lightness, transparency and materiality to create a subtle synthesis,'' the jury citation said. ''Sejima and Nishizawa's architecture stands in direct contrast with the bombastic and rhetorical. Instead, they seek the essential qualities of architecture that result in a much appreciated straightforwardness, economy of means and restraint in their work.'' 
 The pair's buildings include the acclaimed New Museum in New York, a sculptural stack of rectilinear boxes on the Bowery, which was completed in 2007. The first Sanaa project in the United States was a glass pavilion for the Toledo Museum of Art, completed in 2006. It holds the museum's collection of glass artworks, reflecting that city's history as a major center of glass production.
 In The New York Times, the critic Nicolai Ouroussoff said that the pavilion -- which featured an elegant maze of curved glass walls -- ''can reawaken'' the ''belief in the power of glass to enchant.''
 The jury citation highlighted those projects as well as two in Japan: the O-Museum in Nagano and the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art in Kanazawa. The pair formed their firm in 1995. 
 ''I have been exploring how I can make architecture that feels open,'' Ms. Sejima said in a prepared statement after winning the prize, ''which I feel is important for a new generation of architecture.''
 Mr. Nishizawa said: ''Every time I finish a building I revel in possibilities and at the same time reflect on what has happened. Each project becomes my motivation for the next new project. In the same way this wonderful prize has given me a dynamic energy that I have never felt before.''
 Although their work has been concentrated in Japan, Mr. Nishizawa and Ms. Sejima have designed projects in Germany, Britain, Spain, France, the Netherlands and the United States. Among their most recent projects is the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology's Rolex Learning Center in Lausanne.
 The firm's first British project was the Serpentine Pavilion in Kensington Gardens, London, the ninth such commission in the Serpentine's pavilions series. In Lens, in northern France, the firm is designing a 300,000-square-foot branch of the Louvre. 
 This is the third time in the prize's history that two architects have been awarded the Pritzker. The first was in 1988 with Oscar Niemeyer of Brazil and Gordon Bunshaft; the second in 2001, with the Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron.
 The award ceremony will be on May 17 on Ellis Island in New York.

HEADLINE: Going Clubbing By Staying At Home

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
The crowd was about 50 strong, dressed somewhere between postwork casual and preclub glam, when Nicole Atkins plugged in her guitar on Friday evening and began to play. She hawked her CDs between songs, and the sound system was run by a Knitting Factory employee -- all pretty typical for Ms. Atkins, a New Jersey-bred songwriter who has reams of critical acclaim but is still struggling for her big break.
 Yet this was far from a typical gig for her, or for the Knitting Factory. For one thing, she was not performing at that club, but rather in the cavernous, softly lighted atrium of Ohm, a gleaming new residential tower on 11th Avenue in Manhattan, the latest luxury outpost in the real-estate frontier between Chelsea and Clinton. Facing west as she played, she could watch the sunset through the glass walls of the building's exercise room. 
 ''You know what would be really cool,'' she remarked between songs, ''is if somebody could get up on the Cybex up there and entertain me while I'm entertaining all of you.''
 The concert represents a new connection between two forces that have often been at odds in New York: live music and high-end real estate. Last year the Knitting Factory moved to Brooklyn after being priced out of its longtime home in TriBeCa, but its cool factor is still a valuable draw in Manhattan: the club has been hired by Douglaston Development, the developer of the complex, to book twice-monthly private shows there to help attract affluent young tenants. Ms. Atkins's show was the first.
 The 34-story, 288-unit building, at the corner of 30th Street, opened in February and is about 25 percent rented, said Nancy Packes, a marketing consultant to the developer. Monthly rents start at about $1,900 for a studio and $3,600 for a two-bedroom. The architect was Stephen B. Jacobs, who designed the Gansevoort hotels in New York and Miami Beach; the building has the look of a boutique hotel, with multicolored fluorescent lights set into the walls and giant television monitors in the lobby playing abstract, screen-saver-like shapes. 
 Speaking before the show, Ms. Packes said that the building's proximity to the clubs and bars of Chelsea helped define a target clientele: people in their late 20s to mid-30s, probably unmarried, ''on their first or second job'' in high-paying or creative fields.
 ''This is not for people in their 50s, people with kids,'' she said. ''It's for young people whose true religion is music.''
 Much of the crowd on Friday was right within that demographic. Amy Kapnick, 29, had moved from a similar building in Midtown, lured to Ohm by its youthful identity. 
 ''You're not going to have elderly people, people with six kids living in the building,'' she said. ''You're going to have other young professionals looking to have a cool environment to live in.''
 Her friend Liz Stiles, 28, lives on the Upper East Side and was unabashedly jealous of Ms. Kapnick's new digs. ''I live in baby-carriage city,'' she complained. ''I went out last weekend. I tried having a phone conversation, and babies were screaming. I couldn't even talk on the phone.''
 Buildings like Ohm could be seen as one reason that many live music spaces -- the Knitting Factory, CBGB, Tonic, Luna Lounge and Fez -- have shut down or left Manhattan. 
 But the idea to use live music as an attraction to sell property was hatched by Seth Rosner, who besides working with Ms. Packes (he is also her son), is the owner of Pi Recordings, a highbrow jazz record label whose roster includes Vijay Iyer, Anthony Braxton and Marc Ribot. Mr. Rosner said that having the shows gave the building an important competitive advantage in a down economy. 
 ''It's a different city now,'' he said. ''Less people renting and less people buying means you have to do more to make your product more distinguished.''
 Jeffrey E. Levine, the chairman of Douglaston Development, put it even more succinctly: ''Being the better mousetrap saves the day.'' He had his family in tow for the show. For refreshments he served beer and brought in hot dogs and knishes from his favorite deli in Queens.
 The hot dogs, and the music, were a hit on Friday, although a sweep of the room revealed that not every new Ohm resident was likely to step out for a 1 a.m. D.J. set. Will and Nicola Brown, who moved from the English countryside, said the main attractions for them were their apartment's amenities and floor-to-ceiling windows, not the distance to any bar. 
 ''We're not clubbers,'' said Mr. Brown, 32, who works in human resources at Goldman Sachs. His only concern about the music, he said, was that it would be ''too heavy'' and go too late. Like a real club, in other words.
 For the first night there was no such danger. Ms. Atkins, who lives in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in an apartment that she described as ''the polar opposite of this place,'' played a 35-minute acoustic set in which she relished the atrium's natural reverb, and she was done by 8:20 p.m. The shows are free for residents, but Mr. Rosner said the musicians were well paid. He declined to give specific figures, but said that the budget for the year, with 24 planned shows, was more than $60,000, counting production expenses and artist fees. The next event is planned for mid-April, but the Knitting Factory says it does not have an act confirmed yet. 
 Ms. Atkins said she was grateful for the job. But she raised another point that residents may have to contend with: the willingness of musicians to take part in the series, and to take part in the building's marketing plans. 
 ''At gigs like this I kind of feel like hired help,'' she said. ''The music is a decoration, part of trying to sell something.''
 ''But,'' she added, ''there are worse ways to make money.''

HEADLINE: Turning More Women Into Scientists

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Bias Called Persistent Hurdle for Women in Sciences'' (news article, March 22):
 I was not surprised to read that ''any suggestion of advantage based on sex affects results'' on tests given by researchers. I have always believed that the suggestion that girls were not as good as boys in math was detrimental to the self-confidence of many of my female friends in high school, and a factor for some of them who chose college majors with limited math requirements. 
 I decided to inoculate my daughter against this cultural stereotype by mentioning casually every now and then that I thought girls were naturally better at math. She is now pursuing a Ph.D. in applied math at Brown. 
 As a statistics major, I realize that a sample size of one does not prove that a ''reverse stereotype'' will solve this difficult problem. But I encourage parents of young girls to try to collect some more data points. Denise McQuighan

 To the Editor:
 Women are not the only ones struggling in the STEM fields -- science, technology, engineering and mathematics. African-American, Latino and Native American men and women face hurdles before they even reach college.
 Only 4 percent of minority high school graduates have taken the math and science courses necessary to start working toward an engineering degree.
 Since 1974, the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering (Nacme) has worked to improve that statistic. We have numerous initiatives to reach middle school and high school students, and have supported more than 22,000 students with more than $114 million in scholarships at 160 colleges and universities.
 More than 80 percent of our Nacme scholars receive a degree.

 To the Editor:
 In my doctoral dissertation research, in which I surveyed and interviewed students in top-ranked mathematics doctoral programs in the United States, I found that women were more likely than men to have considered withdrawing from their program. 
 In response to real and perceived obstacles in connection with their doctoral studies, women appeared to experience a longer-lasting and more severe erosion of their self-confidence than men.
 Difficulty collaborating with their male peers left some women less socially integrated within their departments. Women have also been discouraged from advancing by the paucity of female professors, though in my case I was lucky to have Prof. Sharon L. Weinberg as my thesis adviser. 
 All universities can help close the gender gap by creating a cultural atmosphere that encourages women to remain in the scientific pipeline.

 To the Editor:
 The American Association of University Women's recent reporton the underrepresentation of women in the sciences has focused attention on an issue that has troubled educators and women's advocates increasingly in recent years.
 But a bright spot is that Mount Holyoke and a number of other leading women's colleges have for a long time been turning out women scientists at a remarkable rate. 
 There are lessons to be learned from our experience. The keys to success are having role models, a lack of gender stereotyping and a hospitable institutional culture that sets no limits on what women can achieve.
 Fifty-seven percent of the members of our science faculty are women, and they are dedicated researchers who draw undergraduate students into their labs. Our students major in math or science at proportions twice that of women at comparable coeducational institutions.
 Our experience shows that women can do science splendidly. All it takes is an institutional commitment to hiring, encouraging and supporting them.

 To the Editor:
 When we asked on our Web site, www.genderbiasbingo.com, for examples of gender bias in science and engineering, we were swamped with more than 400 e-mail messages in three days. 
 One said: ''I am only as good as the last thing I did for someone. My male colleagues seem to do one grand thing every five years or so, and they are considered exceptional.'' 
 Many messages report fathers promoted because ''they have families to support,'' while mothers are denied opportunities because ''they have children to take care of.'' 
 The e-mail keeps on coming. My conclusion: Many women don't opt out of science and engineering -- they are pushed out by gender bias. If our country is to remain globally competitive, we just can't afford this.

 To the Editor:
 In my day, one didn't challenge the geometry teacher on the first day of class when greeted with, ''I know why the girls are here, and I'll be teaching to the boys.'' 
 By the end of the semester I was barely passing, despite having an A in every other class. After recruiting a senior to tutor me, I passed the final with flying colors, earning the response, ''I don't know how you cheated, but I'll find out.''
 Results of the brush-off? I majored in economics in college, spent 25 years in finance and saw my daughter through medical school, where she was second in her class. Seems she also got the last laugh. Gail F. Fletcher

HEADLINE: The Force Of Water, The Power Of Words

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
If words were water, the drought problems so lengthily discussed in the new play by Kia Corthron, ''A Cool Dip in the Barren Saharan Crick,'' would evaporate pretty quickly. The title alone would suffice for a sponge bath. The subject of water actually consumes a large portion of the dialogue in this venturesome but disjointed drama about a young African man studying theology and ecology, and the American family that harbors him during his college years.
 Abebe (William Jackson Harper), the idealistic central character, continually spouts dire prophecies and dismaying statistics about abusive water policy the world over, like a spigot that cannot be shut off. He rails against the World Bank's dam-building ambitions back in his home country, Ethiopia. He reveals that while a person in the United Kingdom uses 31 gallons of water a day, an American splashes through 151. 
 Did you know that in Cambodia the start of the rainy season brings the overflowing of the Tonle Sap tributary of the Mekong River, which is actually a good thing? Or that in 1999 officials in Cochabamba, Bolivia, handed over control of the public's water to private investors?? 
 All these liquid factoids, and many more, are dispensed in the course of Ms. Corthron's unwieldy drama, which also meditates on the spiritual significance of H2O in the baptismal rite and the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina. Eventually ''A Cool Dip,'' which opened on Sunday night at Playwrights Horizons, begins to feels like a cross between a Tom Stoppard play and a water slide. 
 Abebe, who is played with winning charm by Mr. Harper, has been brought to the United States for his studies through the largess of Pickle (Myra Lucretia Taylor), a warmhearted Maryland mother who is grieving the loss of her son, her husband and her father. All three were drowned in Mississippi during Katrina.
 Pickle's daughter, H. J. (Kianne Muschett), worries that her mother is losing her grip on reality. Pickle actually converses with her dead family, in a strange surrealistic scene in which their faces poke out of the cupboards in the kitchen where ''A Cool Dip'' is mostly set. 
 The play, directed by Chay Yew, contains other oddities. Abebe, who was orphaned as a child, strikes up an unlikely friendship with a young boy who has been put in foster care after his father killed the rest of his family, then himself. Tay (Joshua King, adorable) has refused to speak ever since, although you can bet that by the end of the first act, Abebe's befriending of young Tay will coax him into breaking his silence. 
 Tay's jarringly gruesome history is dropped casually into the story, and then mostly abandoned as the second act picks up Abebe's story about eight years later. He has been living in Ethiopia for several years, having given up aspirations to the priesthood to concentrate on his ecological studies. He returns for a visit to Maryland, where he finds that the once-skeptical H. J. has discovered faith, and has been waiting for Abebe to visit so he can baptize her in the same river he used for that purpose on one of his missionary jaunts. 
 Ms. Corthron can write lively, spiky and funny dialogue and create reasonably lifelike characters. Abebe in particular is compellingly drawn, endearing and exasperating in equal measures. But ''A Cool Dip'' wanders without focus through so many different dramatic byways that it never generates any dramatic pulse. Pickle's emotional problems, H. J.'s spiritual regeneration, the tragic story of Tay, Abebe's own trials in Africa -- all are lengthily discussed but minimally dramatized. 
 The passage most charged with real feeling is a second-act scene that finds Abebe heatedly confronting H. J.'s former husband, Tich (Keith Eric Chappelle), over the dining table, both men rising to hurl bitter words at each other as their passions are aroused. The subject of their angry dispute? Tap water.

Another Advantage
 For Biggest Banks
No wonder banks like being too big to fail. The certainty of a bailout, should their bets go wrong, isn't just reassuring to risk-taking employees. Customers also value infallibility. Measured by the interest rates that banks of different sizes pay on deposits, America's 10 biggest banks benefit from this subsidy to the tune of some $30 billion annually.
 Legislators tussling over the details of bank reform might consider the math of deposit funding. Customer deposits are regarded as the cheapest and most stable source of funds for banks. That's because all banks' deposits are insured up to $250,000 for each account by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
 The interest rates paid on those deposits vary widely. In the fourth quarter of 2009, institutions with more than $100 billion of assets paid an average of 0.77 percent annual interest on deposits, according to F.D.I.C. data. By comparison, institutions with less than $10 billion of assets paid an average of 1.73 percent. That difference -- nearly 1 percentage point -- is one measure of the benefit that big banks enjoy from implicit government backing. They can pay less for deposits to customers happy with this assurance.
 And it adds up to quite a bit. The 10 largest banks hold about $3.2 trillion of America's $7.7 trillion of domestic deposits. Apply the differential in deposit interest rates, and those 10 appear be saving nearly $30 billion a year thanks to their size.
 Big banks might argue that lower deposit funding costs reflect other advantages. For example, they offer more services and the convenience of more branches and A.T.M.'s than smaller banks. But that was the case before the government stepped in to save giant banks from the damage inflicted by subprime mortgages starting in 2007. Figures from the F.D.I.C. show that banks in all size categories paid 3.6 percent to 3.65 percent on deposits in the last quarter of 2006.
 A return to that kind of level playing field could be one reasonable long-term goal for legislators and regulators. In the meantime, President Obama proposed that big banks pay a ''crisis responsibility fee'' that would cost them $9 billion a year for 10 years. He may have undershot the value of being too big to fail.
 Private Equity Gap
 Companies owned by private equity groups are suffering a credit -- and possibly credibility -- discount. Harrah's Entertainment, the casino operator acquired three years ago for $27 billion by the buyout firms TPG and Apollo, has outperformed its publicly listed rival MGM Mirage. But Harrah's is still considered riskier. The persistent skepticism may reflect private equity's track record of piling on debt and turning its back on troubled companies. 
 TPG and Apollo have kept Harrah's in pretty good shape given the tough economy. Revenue fell 12 percent last year, but aggressive cost-cutting kept the operating profit margin flat. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization fell in line with revenue -- a rare feat in an industry with high fixed costs. Harrah's also restructured its debt down to about 8.7 times operating cash flow, from 10 at the end of 2008. 
 At MGM Mirage, revenue has fallen about 13 percent after factoring in the effect of selling assets. But its own earnings fell by a whopping 34 percent. As a result, debt that was once seven times Ebitda is now more than nine times. 
 Yet in the eyes of credit ratings agencies, Harrah's is still considered riskier. Moody's rates Harrah's at Caa3 and MGM Mirage at Caa1, while Standard & Poor's rates them the same. Investors also see Harrah's as more likely to default. Its term loan was recently trading at 84 cents on the dollar, according to LSTA/LPC MTM Pricing. MGM's senior debt was at 97. 
 This may be a case of private equity's reputation catching up to it. Public companies tend to take a more balanced approach to raising money when they need it. Listed companies also have more ready access to raising cash. Buyout firms, of course, can inject more equity but also can -- and often do -- walk away more easily from troubled companies. 
 Harrah's doesn't seem as if it will need new equity. It also isn't in a position to lever up again. But the experience in Sin City may be exposing just how private equity is paying for past transgressions.

HEADLINE: Broadway's Unlikely Hit Gives Hope To the Bold

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
Bipolar disorder, electroshock therapy, a yearning for peace of mind: these are not the usual elements of a successful Broadway musical. Yet ''Next to Normal,'' which passed its one-year mark on Broadway on Saturday and is preparing for a national tour in November, now qualifies as a hit: it has earned back its $4 million capitalization, the producers said last week.
 ''Next to Normal'' is among the 25 percent to 30 percent of Broadway shows each year that become commercial hits. And while this musical benefited from positive reviews and three Tony Awards last year, several theater producers and directors said the show's recoupment was as significant as it was unlikely, given the tough subject matter, lack of star performers and shrinking audience in a grim economy.
 ''When financial triumph arrives for a musical like 'Next to Normal' that is so different than the usual Broadway fare, I think it becomes inspiring for a lot of us to take more risks in our shows' storytelling and music,'' said Ira Pittelman, one of the lead producers of the musicals ''Spring Awakening'' and the new ''American Idiot.'' 
 The success of ''Next to Normal,'' about a family facing up to the mother's mental illness, stemmed from several factors. The creators were willing to make major changes after a shaky Off Broadway debut in the winter of 2008. The lead producer, David Stone, committed to spending money on a second tryout of the overhauled show in Washington, and then provided hundreds of free tickets to Broadway tastemakers during preview performances last spring in hopes that they would spread positive buzz. And Mr. Stone managed to keep the weekly running costs unusually modest for Broadway, in the low- to mid-$200,000 range, while sticking with a marketing plan that emphasized the musical's emotional punch.
 Kevin McCollum, a producer of the hit musicals ''Rent'' and ''Avenue Q'' and the recent revival ''Ragtime,'' which lost its $8 million investment, said that low expenses were especially important in helping the six-actor ''Next to Normal'' weather the weeks of soft ticket sales that afflict many Broadway shows.
 ''Many wonderful shows don't recoup because the running costs are too high,'' Mr. McCollum said.
 For Mr. Stone, managing those expenses -- primarily salaries, advertising and theater rent -- was only one of his concerns as he contemplated moving ''Next to Normal'' from Washington to Broadway a year ago.
 ''It took a while for me to get the courage up,'' he said in an interview at his office near Times Square. He added: ''Looking at the possibility of an extended commercial life, most people in the industry thought that it was crazy, including me. Especially me, probably.''
 Among his advantages were loyal investors who had been with him previously on musicals that had turned profits, like ''The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee'' (which recouped in five months) and the monster hit ''Wicked.'' James Lapine, the director of ''Spelling Bee,'' said that Mr. Stone had the sort of track record on Broadway that would help keep people sharing in his belief in a show.
 ''Ironic that his good fortune with 'Wicked' allowed him to take the chance with this show and it also paid off,'' Mr. Lapine said.
 Another early boost came with the choice of theater. The show had been booked for the Longacre, on 48th Street, but Mr. Stone accepted an offer from the space's owner, the Shubert Organization, to switch to another theater it owned, the Booth, on 45th Street, which has more foot traffic outside and 300 fewer seats than the Longacre, a size that suited the intimacy of a family drama.
 The show's director, Michael Greif, also had a vision for ''Next to Normal'' that did not involve heavy costs: the family home is but a skeletal framework, and the set involves minimal automation, with actors moving furniture and props into place. Factor in the lack of star salaries and the decision to run television commercials only in the New York area, which kept the advertising budget to $52,000 during most weeks, and the running costs remained relatively modest for a Broadway musical.
 ''From the beginning I conceived of this production like a modest independent film,'' Mr. Greif said. ''It was never going to have chase scenes. It was going to have interiors of people talking to each other and affecting each other.''
 As previews began last March, Mr. Stone decided to dip heavily into the show's $750,000 reserve, with about half of it chalked up to ''preview losses'' -- free tickets that went to people who might create word-of-mouth excitement (a strategy that many shows use) and aggressive marketing. This spending was offset somewhat by production costs coming in under budget, Mr. Stone said.
 He and his colleagues also decided to build the marketing campaign around what they believed would be a breakout performance by Alice Ripley as the mother, Diana. Her image was featured in print ads and she was central in the commercials. Most critics delivered strong reviews when the show opened on April 15 and singled out Ms. Ripley for raves.
 Daily ticket sales tripled after the reviews, Mr. Stone said, but ''Next to Normal'' did not start breaking even until the week in early May when it earned 11 Tony nominations. The musical was grossing more than $300,000 by the middle of the month, and jumped to more than $400,000 after winning best actress for Ms. Ripley and best score and tying for best orchestration (with ''Billy Elliot'') at the Tony Awards in early June. That $400,000 threshold would prove to be a lucrative milestone (given the modest weekly running costs) that it would maintain until late September.
 For Tom Kitt, the musical's composer, the nationally broadcast Tony ceremony provided a breakthrough. Mr. Stone spent about $100,000 to stage one of the most emotional numbers from the show during the live broadcast, with frequent close-ups of Ms. Ripley and two co-stars. (Most musicals spend even more than ''Next to Normal'' did on their Tony ceremony numbers.) Elton John, who lost the best-score award to Mr. Kitt, paid tribute to ''Next to Normal'' on the broadcast.
 ''It seemed that our performance in a national forum that night created a new interest in the show,'' Mr. Kitt said.
 ''Next to Normal'' now joins ''Billy Elliot,'' ''Hair'' and ''West Side Story'' as musicals from last season that have earned back their money. It will also begin a national tour at the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles in November. Of its Broadway peers from last season, ''Rock of Ages'' is still running strong but has yet to recoup, ''Shrek the Musical'' closed this winter without making its money back, as did many of the plays. 
 While Mr. Stone said he was pleased to return money to his investors, he echoed others in expressing hope that ''Next to Normal'' would encourage those who wonder if unconventional musicals can succeed on Broadway.
 He said: ''It might lead other writers, directors and producers to say: 'Hey, we can try this. It's not such a crazy idea. Sure, it is an unlikely bet, but we're passionate about this and it might just work.' ''

HEADLINE: Scientists Say F.D.A. Ignored Warnings on Radiation Exposure

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Urgent warnings by government experts about the risks of routinely using powerful CT scans to screen patients for colon cancer were brushed aside by the Food and Drug Administration, according to agency documents and interviews with agency scientists.
 After staying quiet for a year, the scientists say they plan to make their concerns public at a meeting of experts on Tuesday called by the F.D.A. to discuss how to protect patients from unnecessary radiation exposures. The two-day meeting is part of a growing reassessment of the risks of routine radiology. The average lifetime dose of diagnostic radiation has increased sevenfold since 1980, driven in part by the increasing popularity of CT scans. Such scans can deliver the radiation equivalent of 400 chest X-rays. 
 An estimated 70 million CT (for computed tomography) scans are performed in the United States every year, up from three million in the early 1980s, and as many as 14,000 people may die every year of radiation-induced cancers as a result, researchers estimate. 
 The use of CT scans to screen healthy patients for cancer is particularly controversial. In colon cancer screening, for instance, the American College of Radiology as well as the American Cancer Society have endorsed CT scans, in a procedure often called a virtual colonoscopy, while the American College of Gastroenterology recommends direct examinations in which doctors use a camera on a flexible tube.
 For patients, navigating the debate can be difficult because doctors, patient advocacy groups and manufacturers often endorse positions that are in their economic self-interest. Radiologists, who often own and use CT machines, for instance, often endorse their use; while gastroenterologists, who often own and use camera scopes, often favor their own methods. Patient groups often get financing from drug and device makers, or physician-specialty groups.
 The Food and Drug Administration, charged with sorting out such competing claims, has been just as torn on the issue. The internal dispute has grown so heated that a group of agency scientists who are concerned about the risks of CT scans say they will testify at the Tuesday meeting that F.D.A. managers ignored or suppressed their concerns, and that the resulting delay in making these concerns public may have led hundreds of patients to be endangered needlessly. 
 Scores of internal agency documents made available to The New York Times show that agency managers sought to approve an application by General Electric to allow the use of CT scans for colon cancer screenings over the repeated objections of agency scientists, who wanted the application rejected. It is still under review.
 After an agency official recommended approving G.E.'s application, Dr. Julian Nicholas, a gastroenterologist who trained at Oxford University and the Mayo Clinic and worked under contract with the agency, responded by e-mail that he felt strongly that approving the application could ''expose a number of Americans to a risk of radiation that is unwarranted and may lead to instances of solid organ abdominal cancer.''
 Dr. Robert Smith, a former professor of radiology at both Yale and Cornell and an F.D.A. medical officer, wrote that he agreed with Dr. Nicholas because ''the increased radiation exposure to the population could be substantial and would raise a serious public health/public policy issue,'' documents show.
 Alberto Gutierrez, deputy director of the F.D.A. office with responsibility over radiological devices, said in an interview that the right course on CT colonography was far from clear. 
 ''This device that you've mentioned has not been cleared or approved at this time, and that should tell you that the process we go through is not done,'' Dr. Gutierrez said. 
 Arvind Gopalratnam, a spokesman for G.E. Healthcare, wrote in an e-mail message that research had shown that ''CT colonography can be a very valuable, noninvasive screening tool to help diagnose colorectal cancer at early stages and ultimately improve overall survival rates.''
 For decades, scientists at the F.D.A. approved many radiological medical devices with minimal oversight, declaring them modest improvements over older devices and thus not needing extensive reviews or clinical trials to prove their safety and efficacy. But these devices now play a central role in American medicine, helping not only to diagnose a wide array of ailments, but also to treat cancers.
 And the agency has done little to assess whether the rapid proliferation of scans is in the best interests of patients, and whether the machines themselves properly protect patients or are beneficial for all of their now-routine uses.
 The Times ran a series of articles this year documenting the harm that can result from mistakes involving medical radiation, leading to a House subcommittee hearing last month and a chorus of calls by radiology groups, researchers, medical physicists and equipment manufacturers for stronger patient protection.
 Even President Obama's recent physical examination became part of the debate when the president had a virtual, rather than an actual, colonoscopy.
 Growing awareness of the risks of scanning led F.D.A. scientists several years ago to begin demanding more and better information from manufacturers to prove that their devices actually were effective for such clinical applications as cancer screening and mapping blood flows in the brain. 
 But agency managers responded that suddenly changing the rules for the devices would be inappropriate and unfair to manufacturers, documents and interviews show.
 The battle between the two sides intensified over a push by some device manufacturers and radiologists to use CT scans routinely to screen healthy patients for lung, colon and other cancers. At stake was another rapid increase in radiation exposures and scans worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually.
 General Electric, one of the biggest makers of the devices, told F.D.A. managers that the company wanted CT scans approved for colon cancer screenings because Medicare officials and private insurers were ''actively discussing whether to reimburse for use of CTC for screening asymptomatic individuals'' and ''to assist their customers in reimbursement for procedures,'' internal agency documents show.
 Even in the absence of an explicit agency approval, doctors are allowed to use approved medical devices however they see fit. But without an explicit approval, manufacturers are not allowed to market CT machines for colon cancer screening, and insurers often refuse to reimburse the costs of the procedure. 
 An agency approval of CT colon screening could lead to extensive marketing campaigns, greater acceptance of the procedure by doctors, changes in insurance policies and millions more people having the tests done. Since the agency had approved similar requests for similar uses of CT scans in the past, agency managers said they had little choice but to approve the G.E. application. 
 The conflict between the two sides escalated throughout 2009, documents show. Minutes of a May 12, 2009, meeting, for instance, reveal that an agency manager, Joshua Nipper, dismissed the scientists' concerns by saying, ''We don't need to be reinventing a big bugaboo about radiation.'' Mr. Nipper did not respond to an e-mailed request for comment.
 Dr. Nicholas refused to budge.
 ''I was first ignored, then pressured to change my scientific opinion, and when I refused to do that, I was intimidated and ultimately terminated,'' he said in an interview. ''And I'm going to tell the committee exactly that at this meeting.''
 As the fight over the G.E. application escalated,Dr. Nicholas, who lives in San Diego, expressed growing concerns in internal e-mails messages that his contract would be allowed to expire -- which it did in October. 
 The day after that expiration, an agency manager, after five months of inaction, began processing the G.E. application by deciding to give G.E. another chance to explain why its application should be approved, documents show.

HEADLINE: Free Advice On Money For Those With Little

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
For three years, Juan Maldonado worked in a sleek skyscraper in Midtown, reconciling stock trades at a Lehman Brothers subsidiary that managed $216 billion in assets. These days, he toils in a cramped, decidedly unglamorous office in southeastern Queens, helping the poor and the unemployed stretch budgets that often amount to a couple of hundred dollars a week.
 Mr. Maldonado is the common man's Charles Schwab, giving free financial advice to people more likely to cash their checks at Western Union than to deposit them in a bank. He might call a creditor to renegotiate the interest rates on an outstanding payment, try to dissuade a widow from selling her jewelry to pay a J. C. Penney bill or try to convince an out-of-work father of four that it still made sense to open a savings account.
 ''Savings is really not an amount; it's an activity,'' Mr. Maldonado told the man. 
 His office in Jamaica is by the second-to-the-last stop on the F subway line, past a discount furniture store, a bankruptcy law practice and a used-car lot with a neon sign that says, ''No Credit, No Problem.'' He arrives at work promptly at 9 a.m., his shoes shined, his shirt pressed and his tie fashioned in a Windsor knot -- his uniform since his days in more luxurious surroundings. Appointments last an hour; Mr. Maldonado was booked solid for two weeks.
 He is part of an ambitious effort to reduce poverty in the city, started about two years ago by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who knows something about money management and sees it as a path to economic stability, even for people of modest means.
 ''As important as education is, when things get really complicated, that's not enough,'' said Jonathan B. Mintz, commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs, which runs the program. ''You need to be able to sit down with a professional who is going to look at your financial problems, at your documents, and help you through the crisis, like folks in higher-income tax brackets do.''
 Nearly 4,000 people have met with the financial advisers since the first office opened, in the Melrose section of the Bronx, in June 2008, before the economy imploded. The advisees' average annual income is $17,000, and their most common problem is debt. 
 The recession has increased demand and has helped broaden the talent pool that the city and the nonprofit groups that help run the program can tap into. Heather Doherty, 31, left the American International Group to oversee the program at the department's Office of Financial Empowerment. 
 ''The underlying fundamentals are the same in this job as they were in my old job,'' Ms. Doherty said. ''It's the solutions, like the financial products and services that people need, that are vastly different.'' 
 To Mr. Maldonado, 30, who left Lehman Brothers months before the bank's cataclysmic bankruptcy, it was a natural transition. He was raised poor in the Bronx, where his mother relied on welfare checks and food stamps. 
 ''I learned the value of money very early on,'' he said. ''I also learned that saving isn't something poor people care about much.''
 Mr. Maldonado, who started with the program in May, is equal parts cheerleader, counselor and money guru. Words like ''leverage,'' ''earning power'' and ''asset-building goal'' spill easily out of his mouth, and they seem out of place in an office where notices about stroller recalls and free cancer screenings hang on the walls. Mr. Maldonado will not hold clients by the hand, but he will show them the way. And instead of admonishing them, he will nudge them into admitting to a financial indiscretion, as he did when he pulled Peyi Bravo's credit report.
 Ms. Bravo, 29, came to New York from Peru in 2003 and settled with her mother in Flushing, Queens. She has a degree in accounting and had been looking for an entry-level job since she graduated from college in June. So she went to a city career center and applied for a job in customer service. It was there that she heard about the program.
 ''I came because I want to understand how my credit score works,'' Ms. Bravo said.
 There was a red flag on her credit report under a cellphone carrier, and Mr. Maldonado asked her if she had made a late payment. Ms. Bravo denied it. Mr. Maldonado smiled, cocked his head and asked if she might have forgotten to pay a bill.
 ''Maybe. I mean, I did, yes,'' she conceded.
 Clients find their way to the financial counseling service in a variety of ways, including through the city's 311 information number, job-training programs, caseworkers and elected officials. The city has a staff of about a dozen people and raises private money for nonprofit groups to run the service and pay counselors in offices, called financial empowerment centers, in every borough except Staten Island.
 The groups have the same philosophy but slightly different approaches. Mr. Maldonado's employer, the Financial Clinic, focuses on unearthing an emotional connection that will give people who are struggling a reason to save. It could be the desire to open a small business some day, as it was for Ms. Bravo, or the hope of sending children to college, as it was for Henry Soto, 34, who has four daughters.
 An accountant referred Mr. Soto to Mr. Maldonado, who set aside his debt and possible tax problems to focus on his application for disability benefits. Mr. Soto, who lives in Maspeth, Queens, has hidradenitis suppurativa, a rare skin disease that makes it painful to stand or sit for too long. He worked in construction but was laid off in the spring when his company downsized because of the economy. Since then, his family has been living on his unemployment benefits, which are due to run out in May.
 ''I have to find a way out, for my girls,'' Mr. Soto said. 
 For Lia Aguirre, the reason for saving was less clear. She is 74 and has lived alone in a rental apartment in Elmhurst, Queens, since her husband died in November. She has three children, who all have lives -- and problems -- of their own.
 ''With this age, without my husband, I have no goals,'' Mrs. Aguirre told Mr. Maldonado.
 ''What would make you happy?'' he asked her. She said she would like to take a trip to her home country, Ecuador, but the ticket cost too much, $840.
 ''See, that's your goal!'' Mr. Maldonado exclaimed.
 Mrs. Aguirre has more than $5,000 in credit card debt, and receives $835 a month in Social Security, about $150 from her husband's life insurance and $65 from her pension as a retired garment worker, she said. 
 This month, she sold an 18-karat gold necklace and medallion so that she could pay part of her J. C. Penney bill. Mr. Maldonado reproached her and sent her home with homework, as he often does after a client's first appointment, to call each of her creditors to negotiate a payment plan.
 ''I need to find out if they're committed,'' Mr. Maldonado said of his clients. Two-thirds of the people who show up for a first appointment at the financial centers do not return. He spends a lot of time on the phone, he said, confirming appointments, following up after a first visit, prodding those who miss a second visit to reschedule. 
 He spoke to Mrs. Aguirre 16 days after they met, and she told him she had signed up for a cheaper telephone plan and downgraded her cable service, and was well on her way to negotiating a lower interest rate with one of her creditors. She sounded encouraged and said she wanted to see him again.
 ''Debt is the scary thing that gets people in here,'' Mr. Maldonado said. ''But once they realize this is about taking control of their lives, they come back for more.''

 Finding a compelling reason to set money aside is a challenge. For Lia Aguirre, it was the prospect of a trip home to Ecuador. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY KIRSTEN LUCE FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) (A19)

HEADLINE: Dreaming of Cuban Profits In a Post-Embargo World

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

 BODY:
CANCUN, Mexico -- Would Americans' playing bingo in a Havana retirement home violate the Cuban government's socialist ethos? How about avowed capitalists living on their 401(k) accounts in condominiums along the Cuban coastline? Or, horror of horrors, fast food outlets offering Big Macs, Whoppers and buckets of fried chicken along the seaside Malecon?
 Although Cuba remains closed to American investment, dreamers in both countries are actively considering the money-making possibilities that the island might offer once the half-century-old travel and trade embargoes imposed by the United States become policies of the past. 
 ''Cuba does have problems,'' said Kirby Jones, a business consultant, stating the obvious at the start of a meeting last week that brought American travel industry executives and Cuban government officials to Cancun to strategize on what might, and what might not, play out in the years ahead. 
 Mr. Jones urged potential investors to banish certain words from their minds -- Bay of Pigs, dissidents, Elian Gonzalez, hijackers and socialism, for instance -- and to focus on the fact that the Cuban government had already joined more than 200 joint ventures with foreign corporations, none of them American.
 ''Everyone is there, except us,'' he told the travel agents, hoteliers, tour operators, charter companies and others with an eye on Cuba. ''There are offices and representatives of over 500 companies around the world. Nobody knows when it will open up for Americans, but it will.''
 But as Cuban officials nodded and participants scribbled notes, the likelihood of wholesale change in American-Cuban relations, widely considered a possibility in the early days of the Obama administration, seemed slim.
 On Wednesday, the day the conference began, President Obama was scolding Cuba for its treatment of dissidents. ''Instead of embracing an opportunity to enter a new era, Cuban authorities continue to respond to the aspirations of the Cuban people with a clenched fist,'' Mr. Obama said in a statement.
 And Cuban papers were reporting Fidel Castro's written comments the same day calling Mr. Obama a ''fanatic'' when it comes to capitalism and dismissing his remarks on Cuba as ''foolishness.''
 Senator Byron L. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat, is pushing legislation that would lift the ban on travel, and he offered an optimistic view of his bill's chance of passing this year. But he also told the Cuban officials at the meeting that they were endangering the legislation by jailing an American government contractor, Alan P. Gross, whom the Cubans accuse of espionage but the State Department says was engaged in democracy-building.
 ''That sort of thing is a problem and a hindrance to change U.S. policy toward Cuba,'' said Mr. Dorgan, addressing the conference by telephone.
 The highest ranking Cuban official in attendance, Tourism Minister Manuel Marrero Cruz, brushed off questions of Mr. Gross's jailing as being outside his portfolio. But he did say that the Cuban government was not concerned about large numbers of visiting Americans prompting any change to Cuba's government or culture.
 As for the likelihood that the embargo would end soon, he shrugged. ''It's impossible to predict,'' Mr. Marrero said. ''We have many scenarios. We are not waiting for the Americans. We're developing tourism for others around the world.''
 The same thing has happened in other aspects of Cuba's economy, as the government, which is dependent on imports, has struck deals with countries like China, Venezuela and Iran as well as Britain, France and Spain. 
 ''Cuba already trades with the rest of the world,'' said Philip Peters, an expert on the Cuban economy at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, a policy research group. ''A lot of the opportunities are taken already.''
 But Cuba may yet offer healthy profits one day to American entrepreneurs who manage to get in.
 ''It's going to be a very slow process,'' said John S. Kavulich II, an adviser to the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council in New York, who criticized the Cancun meeting as a show that would probably not lead any of the attendees to real deals in Cuba. ''The Cuban government is going to be very cautious about turning over the keys to the country.''
 In a telephone interview, Mr. Kavulich said that Cubans already closely identified with many American brands. And he envisions that Coca-Cola, McDonalds and others will have no problem one day establishing themselves, even though Cuban government enterprises now control the market when it comes to cola and fast food.
 Katia Alonzo, director of Cuba's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Investment, made clear that there would be no unregulated rush of outside investment into Cuba. She outlined a few areas the government had identified as essential, including mining, oil exploration and tourism development.
 She left unsaid the risks of doing business in a country where the government is used to operating unchecked, like Cuba's decision last year to freeze hundreds of millions of dollars in bank accounts held by foreign companies.
 Already, there is more of an American imprint on the island than during the Bush years. The Cuban government said that 250,000 Cuban-Americans visited from the United States in 2009, up from roughly 170,000 the year before. Mr. Obama's loosening of restrictions on Cuban-Americans' travel last year prompted such a crush of new visitors that the Cubans have begun remodeling the airport terminal used for flights arriving from Miami, New York and Los Angeles.
 But that is still a long way from opening travel to all Americans, which legislation in Congress would couple with an easing of restrictions on American farm exports to Cuba. The Cuban government has been permitted to buy agricultural products from the United States since 2001, but the Cubans must wire payments to third-country banks before goods are shipped, making other countries' products far easier to buy. All the same, the agricultural exports to Cuba, which include American meat, shellfish, coffee, bread, wine, cigarettes and pistachios, among other products, reached a peak of $710 million in 2008.
 Until other business is allowed, however, the dreaming goes on.
 Frank C. Weed, head of real estate investment for The Americas Group, which helps businesses break into emerging markets in Latin America, envisions retirement communities in Cuba one day and American-run golf courses linked with residences that give buyers longtime rights to their vacation homes.
 ''Not everybody will want to live there,'' he acknowledged. ''They have to be an adventure seeker.''

HEADLINE: An Overhaul Passes, The Vitriol Lives On

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Congress has voted, President Obama will hold a last signing ceremony on Tuesday, and still, Americans are struggling to make sense of the health care debate - what it means for them and their families, for businesses and the economy, for states, for lawmakers in the November elections, for Mr. Obama and his presidency, for the nation's future, and in a most elemental way, for the future of civil democracy.
 People surprised by the visceral - and in some cases vicious and violent - reactions to approval of the legislation have not had the benefit of months of e-mail from readers of The New York Times and this blog. Passions often ran high in these messages.
 Health care is an issue that many Americans feel strongly about, but it also became a touchstone, a proxy for larger disagreements and deeper divisions in an increasingly fractured society. 
 Some recent messages have been ominous in their predictions of what the legislation means for America. ''If the Supreme Court does not rule the individual mandate unconstitutional, then there will be a revolution in this country,'' a reader wrote.
 Reminded that the nation remained peaceable even after the Supreme Court ruled on the disputed 2000 presidential election, the reader replied: ''Valid point. Watch gun sales over the next 30 days.'' Another wrote: ''Perhaps you do not appreciate the degree of resistance by a free people when a law is passed to enslave them. This is not over until it is repealed, or revoked, or we have a civil war.''
 Hate it or love it, a decisive majority in Congress voted at least six times in favor of the health care legislation. The House approved its bill on Nov. 7 by 220 to 215. The Senate voted on Dec. 24 by 60 to 39. The House eventually approved that Senate bill, by 219 to 212, and moments later, also approved a package of revisions to that bill by 220 to 211. The Senate approved those revisions on Thursday by 56 to 43.
 Because of minor, parliamentary changes, the House had to vote once more. The final tally was 220 to 207.
 So how did the debate get to the point of charges of enslavement and threats of revolution? Here is a recap of the discourse over the past year.
 ''If we want to create jobs and rebuild our economy,'' Mr. Obama said last March, ''then we must address the crushing cost of health care this year, in this administration.'' That same day, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and a longtime advocate of universal health care, declared, ''This time, we will not fail.''
 By April, Democrats had made the health care legislation synonymous with the Obama presidency. By July, opposition to it was similarly synonymous with broader opposition to the president.
 ''If we're able to stop Obama on this, it will be his Waterloo; it will break him,'' said Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina.
 In Congress, Democrats struggled to write the legislation. Four of five committees approved bills on party-line votes. A bipartisan group of six senators on the Finance Committee, led by the chairman, Max Baucus of Montana, worked behind closed doors but did not produce a bill before the August recess.
 ''We'll be ready when we're ready,'' Mr. Baucus said, a refrain he repeated until October.
 As lawmakers headed home, they confronted an outpouring of public rancor at public meetings, fueled in part by the false ''death panel'' charge made by Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor, on her Facebook page.
 ''The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's death panel,'' she wrote.
 Politifact.com, a Web site that checks the veracity of political statements, later branded hers ''the lie of the year.''
 On the House and Senate floors, Republicans repeatedly said the bill was being rammed ''down the throats'' of the American people - more than 50 times, according to The Congressional Record.
 ''How dare Congress force government-run health care down the throats of our fellow Americans?'' Representative John Fleming, Republican of Louisiana, said on Sept. 19.
 ''This is a dead, rotten, stinking fish that the speaker is trying to force down the throats of the American people,'' Representative Paul Broun, Republican of Georgia, said on Nov. 5.
 Some Democrats had their own choice words. ''If you get sick, America, the Republican health care plan is this: Die quickly,'' Representative Alan Grayson, Democrat of Florida, said in a floor speech in September.
 When the Senate Finance Committee finally approved its bill on Oct. 13, Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine was the only Republican in favor of it.
 ''When history calls, history calls,'' Ms. Snowe said. But after Senate Democrats made changes to the bill, she essentially took her phone off the hook. Representative Anh Cao of Louisiana, the only Republican to vote for the House bill, also turned against it, basing his switch on abortion issues.
 The Republican opposition was perhaps best defined by the party's Senate leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who derided the legislation as ''slashing a half-trillion dollars from Medicare and raising a half-trillion in new taxes.'' And he led the demands that Democrats throw out the bills they had adopted and ''start over.''
 Speaking to House Republicans in late January, Mr. Obama pointed out that they had left little chance of a deal. ''If the way these issues are being presented by the Republicans is that this is some wild-eyed plot,'' he said, ''what happens is you guys then don't have a lot of room to negotiate with me.''
 But it was later, in a final speech to House Democrats, that Mr. Obama galvanized his party by chuckling at Republican warnings that Democrats would suffer at the polls. ''It could be that they are suddenly having a change of heart, and they are deeply concerned about their Democratic friends,'' he said.
 The next day, the House passed the bill.
 Sitting in his office on Friday, Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who has served in Congress since 1955, reflected on the past year. Mr. Dingell, 83, was presiding over the House when it passed Medicare in 1965 and has the gavel to prove it. He has a pen that President Lyndon B. Johnson used to sign the Medicare law, and now a pen that Mr. Obama used to sign the health care bill last week.
 ''Frankly, we didn't have the nastiness that we have now,'' he said, comparing the two debates. ''We didn't have all the nasty things being said about it inside the Congress and out.''
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Six Districts, Two Sides, One Weekend: The Political Anomaly

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- Welcome to the Bizarro World of health care politics.
 In this world, a Republican congressman explains his vote against the health care bill to a disappointed constituency by pointing out that he voted for and still prefers the original House version -- which was, in many ways, more liberal than what eventually passed. And, he adds, do not forget that his votes have aligned with President Obama nearly 70 percent of the time. 
 At a job fair his office set up on Saturday, Representative Anh Cao walked from booth to booth, hardly noticed by people until he was shaking their hands. 
 Though his constituency is heavily Democratic, no one was railing against him for his vote. For one thing, his constituents are still not entirely sure what to make of him, a political anomaly who won a low-turnout special election in 2008 against an incumbent who was facing a 16-count indictment on federal corruption charges.
 And though many say they respect and even like Mr. Cao, they also assume that he will not be around much longer.
 Mr. Cao, who at 5-foot-2 appears even smaller because of his unassuming demeanor, said the main reason he voted against the bill was that it lacked sufficient guarantees against the use of federal money for abortions.
 And, he added, the original House bill, which he was the sole Republican to vote for, extended coverage to more people.
 It was a tough decision, he said. But there are even bigger issues in his district. ''Jobs are No. 1,'' he said. 
 Henry Smith Jr., 50, an unemployed technician browsing the booths, agreed. But he said he was surprised by Mr. Cao's vote. ''He's trying to please his party. But as far as pleasing the people who put him there, not so much.''

HEADLINE: Senate Candidates Spar Over Spending

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
MIAMI -- Gov. Charlie Crist and Marco Rubio faced off Sunday in the first debate of the race to become Florida's next senator, and each unleashed a line of attack based on dollars and cents. 
 The question posed to the state's Republican voters was which is worse: Mr. Rubio's use of campaign contributions for personal expenses when he served in the Florida Legislature, including as speaker of the House? Or Mr. Crist's support of the federal stimulus package?
 ''Speaker Rubio views public service as a way to enhance his personal enrichment,'' said Mr. Crist, who spoke first, and attacked first, during the 40-minute debate on ''Fox News Sunday.'' 
 The governor went on to criticize Mr. Rubio's use of campaign money for personal expenses, including $134 for a haircut, as well as his billing of what some said appeared to be personal flights to either the Republican Party or the state. 
 Mr. Rubio said that he had proved all the questioned expenses were legitimate or had repaid them. Then he tried to broaden the scope. 
 ''You just don't get it,'' Mr. Rubio said. ''This campaign is not about you, and it's not about me. It's about the people watching this program, that are watching their country being fundamentally redefined by this administration and this Congress.''
 He added: ''This election is about trust. Who do you trust to go to Washington and stand up to Barack Obama?'' 
 Republican voters must decide which of the men will represent their party in the general election this fall. And in the candidates' first face-to-face meeting, there was less bile than there has been in their campaign e-mail messages, perhaps because they were sitting just a foot apart. 
 Nevertheless, there were surprises. 
 Mr. Rubio, 38, said that, if elected, he would consider raising the age for Social Security benefit payouts and slowing the cost-of-living increases for recipients in his generation when they reach retirement age.
 Mr. Crist, 53, said repeatedly and almost unequivocally that although he was behind in the polls by double digits, he would stay in the Republican column and not run as an independent. 
 ''That's right,'' he said when asked about the persistent rumors that he would leave the party. ''I'm running as a Republican.''
 On policy, Mr. Crist emphasized his record of pragmatism. He defended his support for the $787 billion federal stimulus package -- saying it had created or saved 87,000 jobs -- and said that bringing assistance to Florida was more important than ''rattling the cage and saying you're going to do great things and stand on principle or politics above the people.''
 He looked most frustrated, frowning noticeably and complaining, when the Fox News moderator, Chris Wallace, cut him off from talking about his mixed record on taxes. Mr. Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, looked most flummoxed on the issue of immigration, when Mr. Wallace said he had taken a tougher line as a Senate candidate than as speaker of the Florida House.
 On the federal health care overhaul, more differences emerged.
 Mr. Crist said he supported the new law's ban on canceled coverage for pre-existing conditions. But after emphasizing his own efforts in Florida, he had little to say when Mr. Wallace pointed out that the state's program for the uninsured had largely failed, with only 5,000 people signing up for coverage. 
 Mr. Rubio was more direct. He said the overhaul should be rejected for one reason: ''We can't afford it.''

HEADLINE: Six Districts, Two Sides, One Weekend: The Man in the Middle

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
SPARTA, Ga. -- A white man had just finished thanking Representative John Barrow for his vote against the health care bill when Walter A. Collins rose to respectfully disagree. 
 ''I find your vote on health care very disturbing,'' Mr. Collins, 72, a black retiree, politely told Mr. Barrow, a centrist third-term Democrat. ''When you voted no, I really wanted to cry.''
 At constituent meetings in three rural towns, every white speaker, save one, commended Mr. Barrow for his vote. Each black speaker conveyed a deep sense of betrayal, often after talking about hypertension or diabetes that had gone untreated for lack of insurance. 
 ''You align yourself with those who are clearly not with the working-class Americans,'' Mr. Collins said. ''There is a group who have taken a position that at all costs we want this administration to fail.''
 Mr. Barrow, who is white, is running for re-election and faces a black opponent in the primary, has a particularly delicate balancing act. For every white conservative he may have impressed by breaking with his party, he seems to have alienated a black supporter in this district, which is 44 percent black. 
 ''I had lost love for you,'' Johnnie Mae Jones, an uninsured, unemployed 57-year-old woman, told Mr. Barrow. 
 Mr. Barrow emphasized at his meetings that he liked much in the new law. He voted no, he said, because he thought it was too expensive and would exacerbate the shortage of doctors who accept Medicaid.
 ''I hope all of you know,'' he volunteered in Milledgeville, ''that I ended up voting against a lot of the things I believe in.''
 Mr. Barrow, 54, bemoaned a politics that does not allow for nuanced positions on such multifaceted legislation, but rather defines lawmakers as ''either all good or all evil.''
 ''Don't think I'm aligning myself with these people who spat on Emanuel Cleaver, these folks who called John Lewis slurs that haven't been heard in public places in 30 or 40 years,'' he said, referring to actions against black House members outside the Capitol the weekend of the House vote. ''They make me sick.''

HEADLINE: A Course Project Designed by Woods Runs Into Problems of Its Own

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
Tiger Woods has long maintained a cloak of exclusivity, charging top dollar to top sponsors. The same is true for his golf course company, Tiger Woods Design, which since opening in 2006 has designed three courses, two outside the country: in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Ensenada, Mexico.
 The third course, near Asheville, N.C., is perhaps the most ambitious. Woods was reportedly paid millions of dollars to design The Cliffs at High Carolina, a 7,300-yard course nearly 4,000 feet above sea level with 50-mile views of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Around the course, there are plans for up to 1,200 homes, a spa and other amenities. 
 But like the work at so many real estate developments in the last few years, construction at the Cliffs has fallen behind schedule, hampered by weak sales. The course is now expected to open in the spring of 2012 instead of the fall of 2011. Fewer than 40 lots -- at least one for $3 million -- have been sold, and only a few homes have been built.
 The developers plan to borrow up to $100 million from the residents at the Cliffs at High Carolina and seven other communities near the Cliffs to help finish the construction of various amenities.
 Woods, of course, did not cause the recession that has slowed the project. But the scandal that forced him off golf courses and into hiding did not help promote the high-end community, where his course is the main draw.
 The intense scrutiny of Woods, and his desire for privacy, may also make it difficult for him to play a major role in promoting the course once it is finished, particularly if he struggles to regain his top-ranked form as a player. 
 Despite the hit to Woods's reputation, the developers and residents of the Cliffs are sanguine about the development's possibilities. Woods, they say, remains an iconic figure in the golf world, and living near his only course in the United States is seen as a shrewd investment. In fact, his recent troubles mean that the Cliffs at High Carolina could remain the only Woods-designed course in the United States for some time, adding to its cachet.
 ''He's an extraordinary athlete and can design a beautiful course and he hasn't done any other courses in the U.S. and probably won't for a while,'' said Kathryn Levy, who with her husband, Jay, bought a 0.63-acre lot at the Cliffs at High Carolina for $550,000. ''That's where my interest ended in Tiger Woods. End of story. I don't think I'm going to run into him and ask him for a cup of sugar.''
 This month, the Levys were so confident about the value of their investment that they traded in their lot and paid an additional amount for one of the few completed homes on the property. 
 It will be a while, though, before the Levys tee off there. Jim Anthony, the founder and chief executive of Cliffs Communities, said that about three-quarters of the timber had been removed from the course, although the stumps remain in most places. The company is seeking permits to allow grading and to build on a wetlands area.
 Anthony said Woods had visited the site of the course more than a half-dozen times and had fine-tuned the design more than two dozen times. Woods has insisted that each hole include risks and rewards for players regardless of their ability, and that the course incorporate the scenery nearby.
 ''This guy has walked this land more than any architect,'' said Anthony, who attended the news conference last month in Ponte Vedra, Fla., at which Woods apologized for his extramarital affairs. ''He's done more than the contract has called for.''
 Anthony declined to discuss how much Woods was paid, and calls and e-mail messages to Tiger Woods Design were not returned. But an article in The Charlotte Observer said that Woods had received a $10 million fee. Woods does not have a stake in the course or the development, Anthony said. Now that construction of the course is under way, there is less need for Woods to be there.
 Meanwhile, sales at the eight Cliffs communities, including The Cliffs at High Carolina, have started to pick up, despite full golf memberships that cost $150,000. In the last two weeks, 8 sales were completed and 170 tours were booked, Anthony said.
 But work remains. The courses, clubhouses and wellness centers at High Carolina and Mountain Park, another Cliffs community, are not finished. Wellness centers at two other communities are also under construction, along with a variety of smaller projects.
 With sales slowed by the recession, Anthony and his group asked the 2,400 members in the various Cliffs communities for money to help finish common-area projects. The members agreed, partly because the terms were favorable and partly to keep Anthony from seeking an outside investor who might not have the communities' best interests in mind.
 Anyone who participates must lend a minimum of $100,000 to Club Company, a Cliffs subsidiary. The seven-year notes, which pay 12 percent interest annually, are in $50,000 and $100,000 denominations. To protect their investment, the members will elect two representatives to the six-member board of Club Company.
 ''I can't find 12 percent guaranteed income in any other thing these days,'' said Don Tucker, a resident at the Cliffs at Glassy who is on the finance advisory committee there. ''It also provides me with an insurance policy that I will not all of a sudden be placed in a position where the country club is managed by some capitalist vulture who washes out my equity.''

HEADLINE: Health Care Cheers Democrats, but Grim November May Still Lie Ahead

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
In politics, as in sports, the thrill of victory sometimes pales alongside the agony of defeat. In 2010, Democrats remain on track to experience both.
 Achievement of their decades-long quest for comprehensive health care legislation left Congressional leaders and White House aides jubilant. It broke, at least temporarily, the psychology of failure that threatened President Obama's administration as it had burdened President George W. Bush's tenure.
 But the new spring in the steps of Democratic lawmakers has not reversed the likelihood that there will be fewer of them next year. Mr. Obama's signature on the health care law did not reduce a national unemployment rate that hovers around double digits and is likely to stay there through the November elections. 
 What it did was avert the collapse of confidence in Democratic governance that the failure of the president's initiative would have engendered. That in turn could have triggered losses far worse than Democrats will otherwise endure, by dispiriting liberal true-believers even as independents and angry Republicans turned against them.
 ''Our base needed this kick,'' said J. B. Poersch, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Democratic strategists are not counting on much more of a political dividend than that.Aiming for Pelosi's Gavel
 The Gallup Poll encouraged Democrats soon after Speaker Nancy Pelosi mustered the House votes for a health care victory. Mr. Obama's approval rating ticked up slightly, to 51 percent, thanks largely to higher marks among independents.
 Americans describing themselves as ''enthusiastic'' or ''pleased'' outnumbered those who were ''disappointed'' or ''angry.'' Gallup analyst Lydia Saad called it ''a clear political victory'' for Mr. Obama and his party.
 But government data on the job market quickly tempered the Democratic celebration. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the unemployment rate in February had risen in 27 states and fallen in just 7.
 Virginia, with three Democratic House seats at risk, shed 32,600 jobs; Pennsylvania, with five Democratic seats in jeopardy, lost 16,000. In Ohio, where five more seats are on the line, unemployment rose to 10.9 percent - above the 9.7 percent national rate.
 Democratic arguments about health care ''are going to be eclipsed by a generally foul mood unless unemployment starts to drop,'' said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan analyst of Congressional campaigns. Though Republicans need an exceptional gain of 40 seats to take the majority's gavel away from Ms. Pelosi, ''the House is in play,'' Mr. Rothenberg said.
 Republicans can expect to win at least half that many merely by tracking historical averages for midterm losses by a new president's party. But economic hardship and political demographics point toward larger gains.
 Younger and minority voters, so crucial to Mr. Obama's 2008 breakthrough, typically turn out for midterms at lower rates than seniors, the age group most skeptical of the president's performance and the country's direction.
 Older voters have also been most wary of the Democrats' messy, yearlong drive to overhaul health care - in part, as Republicans keep emphasizing, by curbing Medicare expenditures.
 ''The substance is bad, and the process, which they managed to make an issue, is worse,'' said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, former head of the House Republicans' campaign committee. ''They have badly overplayed their hand.''
 Bravado, With Limits
 Democrats now intend to shift the debate about ''the process'' in Washington - away from horse-trading to win votes toward the fact that those votes have now given the country a revamped health care system.
 ''The real 'process issue' for the voters has been the gridlock in Congress and the failure to get anything done,'' said the Democratic pollster Geoff Garin. He added that Republicans will press their case too far by pushing for repeal of the new law, alienating voters eager for popular insurance changes they are just beginning to learn about.
 More important, Democrats will turn unequivocally to the economy, putting forward additional efforts to accelerate the recovery and highlighting improvements already under way. Once the health debate concluded, the White House and Congressional leaders moved to use their advantage on financial regulation legislation with direct challenges to business and Republicans alike.
 ''If they don't want to regulate Wall Street, we do,'' Ms. Pelosi remarked. ''And we will.''
 But Democrats' post-health care bravado has limits. On financial regulation, party leaders believe they can compel enough Republican votes to overcome a Senate filibuster.
 On more divisive issues like immigration and capping carbon emissions, weary Democrats in competitive re-election campaigns will want broader political cover to advance Mr. Obama's goals. Republicans are in no mood to provide it in an election season still tilting their way.
 By winning on health care, Mr. Obama and his party ''avoided disaster'' in 2010, said the Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. But ''this doesn't change the overall dynamic.''
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: NORTH KOREANS USE CELLPHONES TO BARE SECRETS

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN; David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea, one of the world's most impenetrable nations, is facing a new threat: networks of its own citizens feeding information about life there to South Korea and its Western allies.
 The networks are the creation of a handful of North Korean defectors and South Korean human rights activists using cellphones to pierce North Korea's near-total news blackout. To build the networks, recruiters slip into China to woo the few North Koreans allowed to travel there, provide cellphones to smuggle across the border, then post informers' phoned and texted reports on Web sites. 
 The work is risky. Recruiters spend months identifying and coaxing potential informants, all the while evading agents from the North and the Chinese police bent on stopping their work. The North Koreans face even greater danger; exposure could lead to imprisonment -- or death.
 The result has been a news free-for-all, a jumble of sometimes confirmed but often contradictory reports. Some have been important; the Web sites were the first to report the outrage among North Koreans over a drastic currency revaluation late last year. Other articles have been more prosaic, covering topics like whether North Koreans keep pets and their complaints about the price of rice. 
 But the fact that such news is leaking out at all is something of a revolution for a brutally efficient gulag state that has forcibly cloistered its people for decades even as other closed societies have reluctantly accepted at least some of the intrusions of a more wired world. ''In an information vacuum like North Korea, any additional tidbits -- even in the swamp of rumors -- is helpful,'' said Nicholas Eberstadt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who has chronicled the country's economic and population woes for decades. 
 ''You didn't used to be able to get that kind of information,'' he said of the reports on the currency crisis. ''It was fascinating to see the pushback from the lower levels'' of North Korean society.
 Taken together, the now-steady leak of ''heard-in-Korea'' news is factoring into ever swirling intelligence debates about whether there is a possibility of government collapse, something every American president since Harry S. Truman has wished for, and none have witnessed.
 The news the informants are spiriting out is not likely to answer the questions about the North's nuclear program or leadership succession that the United States cares about most. There is no evidence so far that these new sources have any access, or particular insight, into the North Korean leadership or military elite. 
 The informers themselves remain of limited use to American and South Korean spymasters, in part because the North has no broad cellphone network, making it easier for the authorities to eavesdrop on calls and harder for handlers to direct operatives in real time.
 As one senior American intelligence official put it, ''You're not going to find the North Korean uranium project from these guys.'' So the traditional methods of intelligence collection -- using satellite imagery, phone and computer intercepts, and informants and agents of South Korea's intelligence service -- remain the main sources of information. 
 Still, the Web sites appear to have inflicted damage. North Korea's spy agencies, which almost never admit to weaknesses, recently warned that South Korea's ''plot to overthrow our system, employing all manners and means of spying, is spreading from the periphery of our territory and deeply inland.'' They vowed retaliation, especially against ''human trash,'' an apparent reference to the North Koreans who have betrayed their leaders' code of silence out of principle or for pay to supplement their usually meager wages.
 The informers' networks are part of broader changes in intelligence gathering rooted in the North's weaknesses. The first breakthrough came in the 1990s, when famine stoked by a breakdown in the socialist rationing system drove defectors out of the country and into the arms of South Korean and American intelligence agencies. The famine also led North Korea to allow traders to cross the border into China to bring home food, leaving them vulnerable to foreign agents, the news media and, most recently, the defectors and activists intent on forcing change in the North.
 The first of their Web sites opened five years ago; there are now five. At least three of the sites receive some financing from the United States Congress through the National Endowment for Democracy.
 The Web reports have been especially eye-opening for South Koreans, providing a rare glimpse of the aptly named Hermit Kingdom untainted by their own government's biases, whether the anti-Communists who present the North in the worst light or liberals who gloss over bad news for fear of jeopardizing chances at detente.
 ''I take pride in my work,'' said Mun Seong-hwi, a defector turned Web journalist with the site Daily NK, who works with the informers and uses an alias to protect relatives he left behind. ''I help the outside world see North Korea as it is.'' 
 Even in the days of the Iron Curtain, North Korea was one of the world's most closed societies. There were few Western embassies where spies could pose as diplomats. And with citizens deputized to watch one another for suspicious activities, strangers could not escape notice for long. 
 Of the 8,400 agents South Korea sent over the border between the end of the Korean War in 1953 and 1994, just 2,200, or about 1 in 4, made it home. Some defected, according to former agents, but many were killed.
 As recently as 2008, when the North's leader, Kim Jong-il, reportedly had a stroke, it was long-distance sleuthing rather than on-the-ground spying that broke the news. South Korean agents intercepted a government e-mail message containing his brain scans, according to the Monthly Chosun magazine. 
 The Web sites have not uncovered news that delicate, although the implications of their reports on the currency crisis, later confirmed by South Korean government officials, were far-reaching. They said that the North was requiring people to exchange old banknotes for new ones at a rate of 100 to 1, as well as limiting the amount of old money that could be swapped. That suggested that officials in the North were cracking down on the few glimmers of private enterprise that they had tolerated, dashing hopes that the country might follow China's lead of at least opening its economy anytime soon.
 Still, the Web sites are plagued with challenges. The cellphones work on China's cellular networks, so they operate only within several miles of the Chinese border. Because North Koreans cannot travel freely in their country, the Web sites are forced to depend mostly on people who live near China. 
 Beyond that, Ha Tae-keung, who runs one of the Web sites, says that some sources are prone to exaggerate, possibly in the hopes of earning the bonuses he offers for scoops. He and other Web site operators, meanwhile, are vulnerable to ''information brokers'' in the North who sell fake news.
 But Mr. Ha said that the quality of the information was improving as Web sites hired more defectors who left government jobs and remained in touch with former colleagues, often by cellphone. ''These officials provide news because they feel uncertain about the future of their regime and want to have a link with the outside world,'' he said, ''or because of their friendship with the defectors working for us, or because of money.'' 
 While such contacts would have been unimaginable 20 years ago, one thing has notchanged: the danger. 
 Mr. Mun of Daily NK says his informers engage in a constant game of cat and mouse with the authorities. The North Korean government can monitor cellphone calls, but tracing them is harder, so the police rove the countryside in jeeps equipped with tracking devices.
 The informants call him once a week; they never give their names, and they hide the phones far from their homes.
 Despite those precautions, they are sometimes caught. This month, Mr. Ha's Web site reported that an arms factory worker was found with a cellphone and confessed to feeding information to South Korea. A source said the informant was publicly executed by firing squad.

HEADLINE: Overqualified? Yes, but Happy To Have a Job

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

 BODY:
GRANDVIEW, Mo. -- Don Carroll, a former financial analyst with a master's degree in business administration from a top university, was clearly overqualified for the job running the claims department for Cartwright International, a small, family-owned moving company here south of Kansas City.
 But he had been out of work for six months, and the department badly needed modernization after several decades of benign neglect. It turned out to be a perfect match.
 After being hired in December, Mr. Carroll, 31, quickly set about revamping the four-person department, which settles damage claims from moves, and creating tracking tools so the company could better understand its spending. 
 Conventional wisdom warns against hiring overqualified candidates like Mr. Carroll, who often find themselves chafing at their new roles. (The posting for his job had specified ''bachelor's degree preferred but not required.'') But four months into his employment, it seems to be working out well for all involved. 
 It is a situation being repeated across the country as the aspirations of many workers have been recalibrated amid the recession, enabling some companies to reap unexpected rewards.
 A result is a new cadre of underemployed workers dotting American companies, occupying slots several rungs below where they are accustomed to working. These are not the more drastic examples of former professionals toiling away at ''survival jobs'' at Home Depot or Starbucks. They are the former chief financial officer working as comptroller, the onetime marketing director who is back to being an analyst, the former manager who is once again an ''individual contributor.''
 The phenomenon was probably inevitable in a labor market in which job seekers outnumber openings five to one. Employers are seizing the opportunity to stock up on discounted talent, despite the obvious risks that the new hires will become dissatisfied and leave. ''They're trying to really professionalize this company,'' said Mr. Carroll, who is the sole breadwinner for his family of four and had lost his home to foreclosure. ''I've been able to play a big role in that.''
 In some cases, of course, the new employees fail to work out, forcing the company through the process of hiring and training someone else. But Mr. Carroll is just one of several recent hires at Cartwright who would be considered overqualified, including a billing clerk who is a certified public accountant and a human resources director who once oversaw that domain for 5,000 employees but is now dealing with just 65. 
 They represent marked upgrades for Cartwright, a modest-size business with expanding ambitions. The company is benefiting from an influx of talent it probably never would have been able to attract in a better economic climate. 
 ''There's a nice free-agent market right now,'' said Randy Woehl, the human resources director. ''The best it's ever been.''
 Exact numbers for workers toiling in positions where their experience or education exceed their job descriptions are hard to come by, in part because the concept is difficult to measure and can be quite subjective. Several studies have put the figure at roughly one in five American workers, although some doubt the numbers are that high. Economists and sociologists, however, agree that the frequency inevitably increases in hard times.
 Nevertheless, an overriding complaint among many job seekers, particularly professionals, is how often they are rejected for lower-level positions that they desperately want and believe they could practically do in their sleep.
 Academic research on the subject confirms that workers who perceive themselves as overqualified do, in fact, report lower job satisfaction and higher rates of turnover. But the studies also indicate that those workers tend to perform better. Moreover, there is evidence that many of the negatives that come with overqualified hires can be mitigated if they are given autonomy and made to feel valued and respected. 
 The new variable in all of this is the continuing grim economic climate. Many workers' ambitions have evolved, after all, from climbing the ladder to simply holding on to a job, any job. Turnover would also seem to be less of a concern amid predictions that it could be years before unemployment returns to pre-recession levels.
 Jackie Swanson, 44, accepted a part-time job in May as a facilities manager at Conservation Services Group, a Massachusetts company that delivers energy-efficiency programs and training across the country. She had been laid off after 16 years at another company, where she had handled more than 50 offices as a corporate facilities planner. 
 In her previous position, she had been more of a project manager, whereas the new job was mostly about the upkeep of the headquarters building. Ms. Swanson managed to convince the company's recruiter that she was excited about the organization and that her priorities for a job had changed.
 ''I was willing to take a drastic cut in pay just to have stability,'' she said.
 Since then, Ms. Swanson has been promoted to full time. Even though her job still represents a step down in responsibilities, she has no plans to leave anytime soon.
 ''I'm happy here,'' she said. ''I actually feel respected.''
 At Cartwright, Mr. Carroll said he had so far found enough to keep him engaged because he had mostly been given free rein in the department. He has also volunteered to help the company's finance and accounting managers with anything they might need. Whenever he gets a request from someone higher up the ladder, he consciously tries to overdeliver.
 Nevertheless, there are signs of angst. He is being paid a third less than he used to make. He and his wife realize that many of their financial goals could be set back years by this period. He is still paying attention to what is happening in the job market but is not actively looking.
 Mr. Carroll's cubicle mate, Mindy William, a former graphic designer and single mother who had been working at Target before she was recently hired as a claims adjuster, said she had noticed that he seemed to talk about his old job a lot.
 ''I know it's been an adjustment for him,'' she said. ''He's just making the best of it like the rest of us are. We're glad to have jobs in this recession.''
 For his part, Mr. Carroll admitted that he had caught himself often trying to drop his credentials into conversations at his new workplace.
 ''Obviously that stems from maybe some embarrassment at the level that I'm at,'' he said. ''I do want people to know that, to some extent, this isn't who I am.''
 It helps somewhat that most of his former business school classmates are hardly becoming masters of the universe.
 ''It's not like anyone else is tearing it up,'' he said.
 While he is happy for now, Mr. Carroll worries about what will happen once he has finished the more interesting work of overhauling the department. He wonders how long simply having a job will be enough.

HEADLINE: Ford Agrees to Sell Volvo to a Fast-Rising Chinese Company

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting from Detroit.

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Ford Motor reached an agreement on Sunday to sell its Volvo subsidiary to a Chinese conglomerate, in the clearest confirmation yet of China's global ambitions in the auto industry.
 The Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, based in Hangzhou, agreed to pay $1.8 billion for Volvo, with $1.6 billion in cash and the rest in a note payable to Ford.
 Ford paid $6 billion in 1999 to acquire Volvo, leaving the company with a substantial loss on its investment. Ford has shifted its strategy to focus on its core brands and has already sold off other luxury brands, including Jaguar and Land Rover to the Tata Group of India for $2.3 billion a year ago. 
 The purchase of one of Europe's most storied brands shows how China has emerged not just as the largest auto market by number of vehicles sold in the last year, but also as a country determined to capture market share around the globe.
 Zhejiang Geely said it planned to retain production of Volvo cars in Sweden, but it is expected to build another factory for them in China, most likely near Beijing or Shanghai. Ford already builds small numbers of Volvos for the Chinese market at an assembly plant in Chongqing. Most of the vehicles built at that factory are Fords and Mazdas for sale in China.
 China overtook the United States in 2009 as the world's largest auto market in terms of the number of family vehicles sold. But the average car in China sold for $17,000 last year while the average price tag in the United States was close to $30,000, according to the consulting firm J. D. Power & Associates. So the American car market is still bigger by value than China's.
 Zhejiang Geely's majority-owned automotive subsidiary, Geely Automobile Holdings, is China's 12th-largest automaker based on production so far this year. But it is China's second-largest automaker, after the BYD Group, that is not at least partly state-owned.
 Michael Dunne, an independent auto analyst based in Bangkok, said that acquiring a well-known brand was the fastest way for a company like Geely Auto to move up from making affordable cars for the masses to building respected cars for the affluent.
 ''This is all about Geely's efforts to bust out of the basement,'' Mr. Dunne said. ''Volvo happens to be available.''
 Many automakers in China are loaded with ambition, but Geely Auto stands out even by Chinese standards. While making most of its money on inexpensive compacts and subcompacts, it has turned heads at auto shows with ambitious concept cars that look like Western sports cars and even Rolls-Royces.
 Last fall, Ford said that Geely was the preferred bidder for Volvo, but there were a number of problems that needed to be overcome, including ones involving trade secrets, financing and the initial hostility of Swedish labor and political leaders. In late December, the two had settled on most of the details of a deal, but financing and government approvals remained to be completed.
 The parent company has said repeatedly that it planned to keep Volvo as a separate unit from Geely Auto. The company promised again on Sunday to retain Volvo's existing management, but according to people in the industry, the company had already hired several executives with international automotive experience to help it oversee the new subsidiary.
 Zhejiang Geely is dominated by its founder, Li Shufu, the son of farmers from Taizhou, in southeastern China, who turned a small business building motorcycle parts there into one of China's fastest-growing companies.
 ''I want to emphasize that Volvo is Volvo and Geely is Geely -- Volvo will be run by Volvo management,'' Mr. Li said on Sunday at a news conference in Goteborg, Sweden. ''We are determined to preserve the distinct identity of the Volvo brand.''
 Having been scared last year by the near collapse of Saab, Sweden has acquiesced to the sale of Volvo to the Chinese buyer.
 ''The future road for Volvo Cars is now defined,'' said Maud Olofsson, the Swedish deputy prime minister and minister for enterprise and energy. ''Regardless of who owns Volvo Cars, its brand will still be Swedish.''
 The deal is scheduled to close in the third quarter of this year. In the 11 years that Ford has owned Volvo Cars, it has closely integrated the two companies' designs, so that their cars now share many parts.
 Lewis W. K. Booth, Ford's chief financial officer, said Ford would continue to supply Geely with engines, stamped steel body parts and other components for a period of time that he did not specify.
 Yale Zhang, the director of greater China vehicle forecasts for CSM Worldwide, an international consulting firm, said the acquisition would benefit Geely Auto's image at home, because many Chinese were likely to take pride in the acquisition of such a famous brand by a Chinese company. But Zhejiang Geely may also face a difficult time in becoming a multinational concern, since it has focused mostly on its domestic market up to now. 
 ''It will help Geely's brand, that's for sure,'' Mr. Zhang said.''The challenges and the risks are equal to the opportunity.''
 Zhejiang Geely owns 51 percent of Geely Automobile Holdings, which is publicly traded in Hong Kong. Zhejiang Geely also still owns the original motorcycle parts manufacturing operation, along with several technical institutes and a hotel complex in southern China.
 In a letter to the Hong Kong stock exchange last summer, Geely Auto publicly assured its minority investors that it would not try to buy Volvo. Such a deal would have greatly increased its debt at a time when the automaker was already investing heavily to expand in the Chinese market.
 Instead of making a bid for Volvo through Geely Auto, the privately held parent company made the deal. With its pledge to keep Geely Auto and Volvo as separate subsidiaries, Zhejiang Geely may have been trying to address possible concerns in Sweden about the sale of a national icon to a Chinese company.
 Mr. Dunne predicted that the Chinese market for luxury cars would more than double in the coming years, to 650,000 in 2015, compared with 300,000 last year.
 ''There is room in China for a successful Volvo,'' Mr. Dunne said. ''But will Geely know how to make it go?''

 ''Next to Normal'' passed its one-year mark on Broadway, and it now qualifies as a hit, earning back its $4 million capitalization.

HEADLINE: Using Hands and Heads to Help Hearts

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
A campaign intended to better acquaint the public with the technique of hands-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation is getting some, well, helping hands.
 The campaign was introduced last fall by the American Heart Association and created pro bono by Gotham in New York, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. The campaign was produced under the aegis of the Advertising Council, which matches Madison Avenue agencies with worthy causes and encourages media companies to donate time and space to run the resulting ads.
 This month, work is being added to the campaign in the form of digital ads that will appear online, in games played on Xbox and on mobile devices. The new ads were created by two of the four winners of an ''American Idol''-like search for young professional talent that took place in September during the sixth annual Advertising Week in New York.
 The winners, chosen from among eight finalists, received 30-day paid internships with leading agencies in a contest -- held for the first time -- called the Big Ad Gig. The contest required the finalists to create ideas for the heart association to promote hands-only CPR, which they presented to a panel of judges that included an executive of the Ad Council. 
 (Full disclosure: This reporter served as the moderator-host-emcee-court jester of the contest, and enjoyed every minute of it.)
 The judges chose the campaign created by Abraham Truzman, a copywriter known as Avi, to be produced by the heart association and the Ad Council in digital media donated by the Microsoft Corporation. (An executive of Microsoft Advertising, Jamie Wells, was another judge.)
 The theme of Mr. Truzman's campaign, as he summarizes it in an interview, was that ''hands-only CPR is so easy that you may have done it by accident.'' Mr. Truzman also won an internship at the Miami office of Crispin Porter & Bogusky, part of MDC Partners.
 When the time came to produce Mr. Truzman's work, a decision was made to revise it because of some factual inaccuracies in demonstrating how to administer hands-only CPR. (As the name suggests, the technique omits the mouth-to-mouth breathing that makes many people squeamish about trying to resuscitate an adult who suddenly collapses.)
 For the revisions, Mr. Truzman was teamed up with another of the four winning finalists from the Big Ad Gig, Anna Lippert, an art director. The judges had also liked her campaign, which carried the theme ''Push for Life,'' and it followed ''the same train of thought'' as Mr. Truzman's, she says.
 Mr. Truzman and Ms. Lippert worked together by phone, he from Miami and she from New York, where she had won an internship at Atmosphere Proximity, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group. They collaborated with two members of the creative staff at Atmosphere Proximity, Stewart Krull, senior creative director, and Joel Bloom, associate creative director.
 ''One thing about being a digital agency, collaboration is in your DNA,'' Mr. Krull says of the long-distance pairing of Mr. Truzman and Ms. Lippert. ''You get used to zigging and zagging, instead of walking a straight line.''
 The idea that Ms. Lippert and Mr. Truzman came up with for the digital ads shows a pair of hands putting on a performance of shadow puppetry. After making shadow puppets of animals, the hands form a heart, inside of which appears the words ''Hands can do incredible things'' -- the theme of the campaign created by Gotham -- and the address of the campaign's Web site.
 ''We re-applied the concept of showing the benefit of what your hands can do in a not-so-serious way,'' Ms. Lippert says.
 Almost all of the collaboration between Ms. Lippert and Mr.Truzman was done by phone, save for a final meeting in person in New York last month. By that time, Ms. Lippert was working at Atmosphere Proximity -- and so, too, was Mr. Truzman, who came aboard after wrapping up his monthlong stint at Crispin Porter.
 ''Once you get your foot in the door, life becomes a lot easier in advertising,'' Mr. Truzman says.
 ''If there's a chance to be creative,'' he adds, ''take it.''
 Ms. Lippert agrees. ''There's no opportunity you should miss,'' she says.
 That advice is underscored by the experiences of the two other winners of the Big Ad Gig. Jaime Walker, who received an internship at Saatchi & Saatchi Wellness in New York, part of the Saatchi & Saatchi unit of the Publicis Groupe, is now working there full-time.
 And Matt Koulermos, who won an internship at Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide in New York, part of WPP, has a full-time job there.
 ''It was a win-win all the way around,'' says Priscilla Natkins, executive vice president and director for client services at the Ad Council in New York, who was one of the Big Ad Gig's judges.
 Mr. Truzman and Ms. Lippert ''developed some lovely elements that are now part of an important campaign,'' she adds, and the contest help demonstrate to ''professionals and young professionals'' in the ad industry that ''there are many ways to apply their craft.''
 The Ad Council also takes part in another Advertising Week contest called Advertising Futures, Ms. Natkins says, which involves high school classes. The students are paired with agencies to create campaigns based on strategic briefs they receive from the Ad Council; the classes present the campaigns during Advertising Week and a winner is selected from among the entrants.
 The Big Ad Gig ''was an extension'' of the student program, Ms. Natkins says, and the campaign for hands-only CPR presented ''an appropriate issue to offer'' the young ad professionals and would-be professionals who took part in the contest.
 That is because the campaign encourages bystanders to pitch in when they see an adult collapse from cardiac arrest and become unresponsive. And younger people are a good target audience for the message because of the two steps involved in hands-only CPR.
 The first step is to dial 911 -- and is there a younger person who does not have a cellphone or other mobile device handy to do that? The second step is to push hard and fast in the center of the victim's chest until professional rescuers arrive on the scene.
 Hands-only CPR ''gets around the hesitation some have of, quite frankly, swapping spit with a stranger,'' says Dr. Max Gomez, a national board member of the heart association and chairman of the communications coordinating committee. (If his name is familiar, it may be because he is also a medical reporter on WCBS-TV in New York.)
 The campaign is particularly important, Dr. Gomez says, because hands-only CPR represents ''a fairly significant change from what we've been telling people for some time,'' referring to the use of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
 So the addition of the digital work is welcome, he adds, because ''different approaches make for better communication.''
 That the digital ads trace their roots to a contest does not trivialize them, Dr. Gomez says.
 It is not as if they originated ''on the back of a cereal box,'' he says, adding that ''you've got to have some fun'' when tackling a creative challenge.
 Besides, there were ''people with some real bona fides involved with'' the Big Ad Gig, Dr. Gomez says.
 The digital ads join work created by Gotham that includes television and radio commercials, print and outdoor ads and the HandsOnlyCPR.org Web site.
 PointRoll is contributing to the digital part of the campaign, too, by helping with the development of so-called rich media ads; examples of such ads include streaming video for Web sites and online ads that grow larger when they are clicked on or moused over.
 There are plans for a second Big Ad Gig, said Michelle Parks McCourt, communications director at Atmosphere Proximity, who coordinated the first one, and a public service campaign may again be the assignment for contestants. The contest is to be held during the next Advertising Week in New York, she adds, which is scheduled for Sept. 27 to Oct. 1.

HEADLINE: The Legal Assault on Health Reforms

 BODY:
No sooner had President Obama signed comprehensive health care reform than the attorneys general of 14 states scurried to the federal courts to challenge the law. Their claims range from far-fetched to arguable and look mostly like political posturing for the fall elections or a ''Hail Mary'' pass by disgruntled conservatives who cannot accept what Congress and the president have done. 
 They seem unlikely to succeed because the law was carefully drafted to withstand just this kind of challenge. 
 There are two separate suits by the attorneys general. The main one, led by Bill McCollum, a Florida Republican, has been joined by 12 other attorneys general, all but one Republicans. Many if not most are either running for higher office or seeking re-election. A separate suit by Virginia's Republican attorney general is based on that state's attempt (sure to be ineffective) to nullify the federal law by enacting a state law declaring that Virginians need not obey it. 
 A central contention of both suits is that Congress has no power under the Constitution to compel individuals to buy health insurance or pay a penalty. Congress has never before compelled people to buy anything from a private company, so there is no precisely apt Supreme Court precedent. Still, two provisions in the Constitution give Congress broad powers to regulate economic activity -- the power to impose taxes for the general welfare and the power to regulate interstate commerce.
 The new law has been framed to fall within both of those provisions. The penalties for not buying insurance have been structured as a tax, to be collected by the Internal Revenue Service. And the law's text includes a series of Congressional findings: that health insurance and health care comprise a significant part of the economy, that most policies are sold and claims paid through interstate commerce, and that the mandate is essential to achieving the goals of creating effective health insurance markets and achieving near-universal coverage. 
 Such findings don't make the new law bullet-proof, but they help to insulate it from attack. It seems a long shot that the Supreme Court would invalidate the mandate, if the cases ever reach that level. 
 A second contention, emphasized by the 13 state attorneys general, is that the new law amounts to an unprecedented encroachment on the sovereignty of the states. It will require them to greatly expand their Medicaid programs, imposing substantial costs, and add administrative burdens in setting up new insurance exchanges that will offer an array of private policies. 
 That seems a stretch. No state is required to set up an exchange. If states fail to do so, the federal government will take over. Nor is any state required to participate in Medicaid, a joint federal-state program in which Washington pays half or more of the costs.
 It is true, as the suit contends, that it may not be practical for states to drop out of a Medicaid program that serves many of their poorest residents. But it is well established that Congress can attach conditions to the money it supplies, and Congress has long imposed Medicaid requirements that states must meet. 
 The attorneys general are doing a disservice to their constituents by opposing Medicaid expansion and a mandate that everyone buy insurance, with subsidies for low- and middle-income people. The mandates are needed to push enough healthy young people into insurance pools to help subsidize the cost of covering sicker people and make it feasible for insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions. Alternative approaches to entice people to obtain coverage would likely be less successful.
