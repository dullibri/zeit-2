HEADLINE: Don't Make a Deal

BYLINE: By Mathea Falco; Mathea Falco, president of Drug Strategies, a policy research group, was Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics Matters from 1977 to 1981.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The report on Thursday that Myanmar's military rulers have made a new overture to Washington may seem like good news. Lift the U.S. arms embargo, they offered, and the army will defeat Khun Sa, the drug trafficker who controls the mountainous Shan state, where much of the country's opium is grown. Myanmar produces more than half the world's opium, the raw material used in making heroin.
With cheap, high-quality heroin now available in many American cities -- and fears that a new heroin epidemic may be looming -- supplying Myanmar with the helicopters and weapons it needs to fight the drug war may sound like a smart move. But cooperating with the ruling military junta, the State Law and Order Restoration Council, or Slorc, will not solve our drug problem and will further strengthen one of the world's most repressive regimes. 
 The Slorc, which took power in 1988 -- and renamed the country, formerly Burma -- has a long record of human rights violations. It has forcibly resettled ethnic minorities, imprisoned political opponents without trial and killed thousands who protested the regime's suppression of the 1990 election results. The leader of the democracy movement, the Nobel laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, whose party won the election by a landslide, begins her sixth year under house arrest this week.
The United States has led the international effort to end human rights abuses in Myanmar -- cutting off economic assistance and anti-narcotics support, imposing an arms embargo, suspending trading privileges and opposing World Bank and other multilateral loans. So far, these tactics have not produced results. Congress should pass a pending resolution that calls among other things for tighter economic sanctions and for the unconditional release of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi.
But even if Myanmar's human rights record were less egregious, resuming U.S. anti-narcotics assistance would not be a good use of American tax dollars. Myanmar has never successfully asserted authority over the mountainous regions where drug lords like Khun Sa operate with little interference and various ethnic insurgents struggle for independence. Since the Slorc takeover, opium production has doubled, making Myanmar the world's largest supplier.
Although precise numbers are hard to come by, Federal officials estimate that Americans consume 6 percent of the world's heroin -- about 20 tons a year out of a total of 350 tons. Almost two-thirds of the heroin sold in the U.S. comes from Southeast Asia, primarily Myanmar. According to the State Department, Burmese opium production in 1993 exceeded 2,500 tons, the equivalent of about 250 tons of heroin -- enough to supply American demand 10 times over.
As we have learned from earlier skirmishes in the "war on drugs" -- like breaking the notorious French-Turkish connection in the 1970's -- other heroin producers closer to home will fill whatever temporary shortages occur. Mexico, which supplanted Turkey as our major heroin source during the 1980's, and Colombia, which has recently emerged as a new supplier, both have the capacity to meet American demand. So even if the U.S. made a dent in Myanmar's opium production, it would have little impact on the availability of heroin here.
Moreover, according to a February 1994 poll by Peter D. Hart Research Associates, Americans would rather provide funds for community drug prevention, treatment and enforcement programs than for foreign eradication and interdiction efforts. They know that the answers to America's drug problems lie at home, not in the hands of Myanmar's military dictators.

HEADLINE: We Don't Need a Rerun of Cold War in Bosnia;
Bolster the U.N.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
All nations have agreed that no territorial acquisition resulting from aggression shall be recognized as lawful. David Gompert (Op-Ed, July 3) is to be applauded for opposing the partition plan in Bosnia -- a reward for Serbian aggression. To repudiate international law is to invite international lawlessness. But suggesting that the remedy lies in unremitting economic sanctions until Serbs overthrow their criminal leaders is a cure worse than the disease. 
 Economic war in perpetuity against an unrepentant Serbia penalizes the innocent more than the perpetrators. Instead, let us finally start the process of creating an international order that will not require the United States to police the world.
We need new international institutions to guarantee that aggression and crimes against humanity will no longer be tolerated. The new tribunal for the punishment of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia is an important step forward; it should not be undermined. Peace without justice cannot endure.
The Security Council is authorized and competent to maintain peace, but nations must give it the rules and the tools to do its job. A reliable security system requires a United Nations military force if economic sanctions fail or falter. Procedural changes that enable the Council to act for people everywhere -- not merely a few favored nations -- can be brought about without Charter amendment or veto. New Security Council organs can be created quickly to make sanctions more effective, create an international police force and improve human rights everywhere.
Until powerful nations muster the political will to change a war system for a peace system, no expedient palliative can prevent such tragedies as Bosnia, Rwanda and Haiti. It is high time for new thinking and new solutions.

HEADLINE: Despite Awareness of Risks, More in U.S. Are Getting Fat

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS 

 BODY:
American adults may be more aware of the need to exercise and count calories than they once were, but more of them than ever are overweight.
The number of overweight adults, which had remained stable at about a fourth of the adult population from 1960 through 1980, suddenly jumped to a third of all adults between 1980 and 1991, according to a recent study by the National Center for Health Statistics in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
 For purposes of the study, obesity was defined as being 20 percent or more above a person's desirable weight. That is about 25 pounds for an average 5-feet-4-inch woman and 30 pounds for an average 5-feet-10-inch man.
The increase in obesity rates continues despite a growing awareness that it has a negative effect on health and despite the continued growth of the diet industry, now estimated to have revenues of $40 billion to $50 billion a year.
The study's figures on children were not available last week, but several experts who had seen the data said that obesity among the nation's youth was increasing at an even faster rate than it was among adults.
Although the study confirms what experts have said they suspect, it is the first time the growth of the problem in the 80's has been measured.
The data on American weight patterns have been collected in several Government surveys that began in 1960. The studies are designed to determine the relationship between diet and health and help the Government run its food-assistance programs.
The latest study found that the groups with the highest proportion of overweight people were black non-Hispanic women, at 49.5 percent, and Mexican-American women, at 47.9 percent. Those levels represent increases of 12.2 percent and 15.7 percent, respectively, compared with the 1980 rates.
Although the percentage of white non-Hispanic women who were overweight was lower, 32.4 percent, obesity in that group increased at a much higher rate, 35.6 percent, from 1980 to 1991.
 
Support for Obesity Action
 The study offers additional support to health and nutrition professionals who argue that a national campaign to reduce obesity is essential to contain health care costs.
Dr. Philip R. Lee, assistant secretary of health in the Department of Health and Human Services, said on Friday: "The Government is not doing enough. It is not focused. We don't have a coherent across-the-board policy. We are in the process of developing one."
On Tuesday, the Journal of the American Medical Association will publish an article based on the study's findings about adults. In an editorial that will accompany the article, Dr. F. Xavier Pi-Sunyer, director of the division of endocrinology, diabetes and nutrition at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center and a professor of medicine at Columbia University, wrote: "The proportion of the population that is obese is incredible. If this was about tuberculosis, it would be called an epidemic."
Dr. Pi-Sunyer added: "The problem with obesity is that once you have it, it is very difficult to treat. What you want to do is prevent it."
Despite the relationship between obesity and chronic diseases of the heart and other organs, obesity is usually defined not as a disease, but as a condition that will yield to good old-fashioned willpower.
Neither the Federal Government, insurance companies nor the medical profession devote many resources to preventing obesity. But the food industry spends $36 billion a year on advertising designed to entice people to eat, the Agriculture Department says.
 
Little Spent on Education
 Federal expenditures for nutrition education are minuscule. For example, the Government allots states $50,000 each for nutrition education in schools. The annual advertising budget for Kellogg's Frosted Flakes is twice the budget for the National Cancer Institute's entire "5 a Day" program, which promotes the consumption of fruits and vegetables.
Obesity cost the nation an estimated $68.8 billion in 1990, according to a study by Dr. Graham A. Colditz, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. His study, which appeared in 1994 in PharmacoEconomics, an international journal devoted to evaluations of drug economics and quality, drew its estimates from the costs of medical problems that have been linked to obesity, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, adult-onset diabetes and gallbladder disease.
Few insurance companies or health maintenance organizations will reimburse the cost of medical or nutritional counseling to help patients lose weight. The health care bills being considered by Congress either do not include preventive nutrition programs and reimbursement for nutrition counseling or make those services optional.
"There is no commitment to obesity as a public health problem," said Dr. William Dietz, director of clinical nutrition at the New England Medical Center in Boston. "We've ignored it and blamed it on gluttony and sloth."
 
Life Style Changes Needed
 Experts agree that the root causes of obesity in this country -- a sedentary life style and an abundance of food -- are very difficult to change.
"It's what I call the 3,700-calorie-a-day problem," said Dr. Marion Nestle, chairwoman of the Department of Nutrition at New York University and managing editor of the 1988 Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health.
The Department of Agriculture reports that the American food supply produces 3,700 calories a day for every man, woman and child in this country. Women need only about half that number of calories, and men need about two-thirds of that. But people are constantly bombarded with advertisements that encourage them to eat far more than they need, Dr. Nestle said. "Advertising budgets for food that no one needs are astronomical. Compared to what is spent on nutrition education, it's laughable."
Health experts say the level of physical activity among Americans has decreased because of people watching television and riding in automobiles instead of walking and because of the disappearance of physical education classes from school programs.
"TV-watching figures are shocking," said Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nutrition advocacy group in Washington. "Adults watch between four and five hours a day; children watch three to four hours a day. Only 36 percent of elementary and secondary schools offer physical education classes."
Dr. Dietz said television's contribution to obesity was compounded because watching television was often accompanied by eating food, especially snacks that are high in calories and fat. "Just turn off the television and almost anything you do will be less sedentary," Dr. Dietz said. "And if you turn off the television, you are less likely to consume food."
In the last few years, there has been a tendency to say that since diets do not work, people should give up dieting and that people should be allowed to attain their biologically natural weight. This attitude frustrates researchers in the field.
 
'Mixed Messages'
 "We have got to stop saying that diets don't work, that obesity doesn't matter," said Dr. George Blackburn, an associate professor at Harvard and director of the school's Center for Study of Nutrition and Medicine at Deaconess Hospital in Boston.
"There is an anti-dieting movement out there," said Dr. Pi-Sunyer. "But weight is not like body temperature; it keeps climbing. And there are so many mixed messages out there. People are confused."
The experts agree that it will be difficult to change attitudes. Dr. Jacobson has suggested that a President's Council on Diet and Health be established, and Representative Edolphus Towns, Democrat of Brooklyn, will introduce such legislation on Tuesday.
Dr. Jacobson also said that states should require schools to provide daily physical education classes and that any health overhaul should include community-wide strategies to promote health. He suggested that the Clinton Administration sponsor an annual national "No-TV Week," encouraging children and adults to exercise instead of watching television.
"In order for the Public Health Service to address the problems, they have to do more than just educate," Dr. Nestle said. "They need to look at more structural changes: restrictions on children's television advertising, major campaigns in schools, some of the same incentives that have been used to get people to stop smoking."

HEADLINE: NEW YORKERS & CO.;
Save the Business, Keep It in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
AS chief executive of a sprawling computer plant in the unlikely setting of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Wesley D. Ratcliff has received a wealth of mail from civic boosters in the South, the Middle West and elsewhere, suggesting that he move his company out of Brooklyn.
"Those letters are in the trash," he said with a sweep of the hand. "You could say I owe my soul to this place." 
 Indeed, Mr. Ratcliff and his 260 employees at Advanced Technological Solutions Inc. have invested heavily in Brooklyn. A year after raising $6.5 million to purchase the 16-year-old Bedford-Stuyvesant plant from I.B.M., which was about to shut it down, they have taken charge of what experts say is the nation's largest company that is both minority-owned and employee-owned.
Although long-term success is by no means assured, the A.T.S. workers have salvaged one of the last major manufacturing operations in New York City. In doing so, experts say, they have beaten long odds against new business development in a poor inner-city neighborhood.
"They are doing something almost unique and very important," said Corey Rosen, executive director of the National Center for Employee Ownership, a California advisory group that tracks the success of 9,500 employee-owned companies that have been formed since the mid-1970's. One of the largest and newest is United Airlines.
"What is special about A.T.S. is that it provides a model of black entrepreneurship," he said. Unlike many black-owned companies, which owe their success to an individual, "here you have a large group that is spreading the entrepreneurial culture," he added.
The history of A.T.S. goes back to 1967, when Senators Robert F. Kennedy and Jacob K. Javits lent their political weight to the creation of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation to help revive the neighborhood's blighted central business district.
One member of the corporation board, recruited by the two powerful senators, was Thomas Watson Jr., chairman of I.B.M. In 1968, when I.B.M. was expanding its manufacturing around the nation, Mr. Watson promised a new plant to Bedford-Stuyvesant.
For a decade, with I.B.M. growing rapidly as the world's predominant computer maker, its Bedford-Stuyvesant operations were split between several factory buildings. Then, in 1978, it completed construction of the current plant, a vast, block-long structure on Dekalb Avenue that remains an incongruous site across the street from the Pentecostal House of Worship and the Sugarhill Disco.
The plant prospered through the 1980's, when it was used mainly by I.B.M. to assemble and repair its computers, and employment peaked at 400 in 1986. But by 1990, times had become tough for both I.B.M. and its Bedford-Stuyvesant plant, which was reduced to under 200 workers.
The ax fell in 1993 when I.B.M. said the plant would close. All the Brooklyn workers, including Mr. Ratcliff, were to lose their jobs, as were more than 100,000 other I.B.M. employees in a grim worldwide program of layoffs and plant closings.
"I.B.M.'s options were simple," said Mr. Ratcliff, 50, a native of Texas who had 17 years as a manager with I.B.M. "They could shut this plant, which seemed the obvious choice. They could find another company to buy it, which seemed unlikely. Or, maybe, they could sell it to us."
What followed were months of frantic negotiations.
As a first step, Mr. Ratcliff and 15 other managers at the Bedford-Stuyvesant plant pooled their personal resources, coming up with $300,000 to offer I.B.M. The New York State Job Development Authority then pitched in $2.8 million in low-interest loans.
Although Mr. Watson was no longer I.B.M.'s chairman and was near the end of his life (he died in December), he remained a board member and lent his support to Mr. Ratcliff's group. I.B.M. said it would invest $1 million in nonvoting A.T.S. stock if the Brooklyn employee group succeeded in its buyout.
Still left out of the equation was bank financing, which Mr. Ratcliff said his group ultimately obtained from the Chase Manhattan Bank, enabling it to meet I.B.M.'s sale price of $6.5 million.
As in most other employee buyouts, the workers at A.T.S., besides Mr. Ratcliff's management group, were not asked to invest their own money. Instead, when the buyout was completed, they were given the option of remaining but with pay cuts that weretypically 20 percent. In return, the 180 former I.B.M. workers who stayed -- and others who have been hired since -- receive stock y as a supplement to their paychecks. The success of their company will determine the value of their shares.
The company, which opened its doors under employee ownership on Oct. 1, has so far benefited from a continued relationship with I.B.M., which has relied on it even more heavily for computer repair than it did before the buyout. A.T.S. said it was repairing 600 to 1,000 I.B.M. terminals a day, double the amount before the buyout.
Such continued reliance on a single corporate patron could make A.T.S. vulnerable. "It is very important that A.T.S. diversify," said Mr. Rosen. "If I.B.M. were to withdraw suddenly, it could threaten their survival."
Still, Mr. Ratcliff said, A.T.S. has made quick strides toward diversification. Chief among them is a $25 million contract it won in November to produce cable television circuit boards for Philips Broadband Networks Inc., the Syracuse subsidiary of a Dutch electronics company.
To meet the new demands, A.T.S. has added 60 workers -- for a total of 260. Sixty percent of the workers live in Brooklyn.
Mr. Ratcliff, who said he was seeking other new contracts for manufacturing and computer repair, said he hoped to increase employment to 600 within the next three years.
In the meantime, he said, he sometimes finds himself working as hard to sell the merits of Bedford-Stuyvesant as he does the products and services of A.T.S.
"Brooklyn does have negative connotations to a lot of people," he said. "But the first thing I do with customers is have them visit this plant. Once I can get them here, the job becomes easy."

Talk Often and Be a Soft Touch

BYLINE: MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
PRESIDENT CLINTON is a big man, with a famously big brain, who runs an enormous country. Sufficiently riled, he could tell his army to rout any tinpot dictator who dared to smart off, and he obviously knows enough about practically everything to argue any enemy into intellectual submission. He has enough heft, and probably enough reach, to deck most Republicans with one punch, not to mention upstart foreign heads of state -- although maybe not Yeltsin. All right, probably Yeltsin, because he's older, but definitely not Helmut Kohl. But he likes Kohl, so that doesn't count.
The point is, this is one mighty powerful leader. It raises a question: Why doesn't that intimidate anybody any more? 
 Go figure. Presidential power is a queer thing; it attaches to the office but sometimes, it seems, not necessarily to the person. When George Bush was Vice President, satirists laughed at his cloth watchbands and nasally whine and deference to Ronald Reagan, and said he had put his manhood in a blind trust. Then he became President and invaded Panama, crushed Iraq and, before the economy went south, reigned as the most popular leader in opinion-polling history. This from the fellow who reminded many a woman of her first husband.
Now comes the robust Mr. Clinton, and suddenly the image is more that of a certain type of ex-boyfriend, the one who seemed dashing until girls discovered they could walk all over him. Smart, persuasive, eminently likeable and eager to be liked, he believes the nation and the world should follow him to greatness. It's the leading part he hasn't mastered.
"We don't give him enough credit on one level for seeming to be a genuinely nice person," said Stephen Hess, the student of presidents at the Brookings Institution. "That doesn't fit our list of presidential qualities. We really do elect a President to be our very own sonofabitch. Clinton hasn't gotten it yet."
There have been many indications of this. Mr. Clinton could not wrangle his own Democratic Congress last year into approving a measly $20 billion in what he called economic stimulus, and some others called pork, and he had to plead -- not bully -- lawmakers to approve the first Democratic budget in a dozen years. He swept into office pledging to bring homosexuals into the military and to end handouts of Federal grazing rights to Western ranchers, and gave up both battles.
Bob Woodward, in his new book "The Agenda," recounts a telling incident in which a Democratic foe of Mr. Clinton's spending plans, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, ended a telephone conversation with the President by shouting and cursing him with the most potent of the four-letter words. Until now, this has generally been a privilege reserved for Presidents, not their political subordinates.
But the sweeping nature of the Presidential mutation became apparent only this month in Europe. In fairness, Mr. Clinton won raves in Yankee-loving Berlin. But mostly, he got sand kicked in his face. Curiouser still, he seemed to enjoy it.
Mr. Clinton wanted to announce a new round of global trade talks at the Naples economic summit. But President Francois Mitterrand, being French, deftly and publicly unmanned that idea by talking other leaders out of it. Mr. Clinton first told Baltic leaders and then Mr. Yeltsin, in "strong" terms, that he expected Russia to hold to its promise to remove its troops from Estonia by an Aug. 31 deadline. Mr. Yeltsin said he would ignore it.
Mr. Clinton took to his Naples podium to express confidence in the dollar's ability to withstand speculation that had driven it to near-record lows against the yen. The dollar then plummeted to historic lows. Back home, Administration officials warned that they were running out of patience with the brassy defiance of Haiti's tinpot military dictatorship. The dictators then threw all United Nations observers out of the country.
Brassier still, maybe, was President Guillermo Endara of Panama, who lacked a nation to run until Mr. Bush's invasion put him in power in 1989. He undercut Mr. Clinton's Haiti policy by reneging on a promise to put up Haitian refugees while the White House figured out how to get rid of the dictators.
The President's men had a word for this studied nonchalance toward the White House: refreshing. "There has been an evolution in America's appropriate role in the world," one said. "There was a time when America could, in effect, lay down a proposition and expect others to agree with it. That's not the type of leadership Bill Clinton is trying to bring."
Fair enough; nobody likes a bully. If Mr. Clinton is evolving into a Labrador retriever instead of a Doberman, his pack of leaders should be happily chasing sticks with him by now, not nipping his flanks.
 
Musclebound Kittens
 Theories abound as to why they feel so free to bite. "Dean Acheson once said we're the engine that draws the rest of the train," said Stephen E. Ambrose, biographer of Eisenhower and Nixon. "Well, we ain't anymore. We're musclebound, but economically we're just weak kittens. What can Clinton threaten anyone with?" By this theory, foreign leaders do not reject Mr. Clinton; they reject an America that no longer awes them.
Ernest R. May, the Harvard historian, says Mr. Clinton probably is not defied much more than most Presidents -- De Gaulle tormented Eisenhower -- but that he is worse than most at keeping failures under wraps. Blame his town-meeting style of governing.
Then there is the explanation favored by Leslie Gelb, the journalist and ex-Carter aide who is president of the Council on Foreign Relations. He says the President gets snubbed for two reasons that ring true to any parent of an unruly child. One is that Mr. Clinton often leaves it unclear where he stands, and stays rooted to the stand de jour even less often. The other is that nobody ever gets punished for sassing him. So there is no reason not to. "If people think you really don't mean what you say, and they don't think you'll follow through on it, and if there's no cost in opposing you, then they'll do it every time," he said.
In that view, Senator Kerrey could safely rebel against the President's fiscal policy and not only escape punishment, but also be rewarded with the chairmanship of a panel on deficit reduction. North Korea, having ignored previous White House warnings over its nuclear program, may well feel no need to heed another. And France can just be France.
This was not the manner of Mr. Clinton's role model, John F. Kennedy. In 1962, big steel makers defied him and hiked prices amid hard economic times. Mr. Kennedy groused, but did not stop there. He ordered an F.B.I. inquiry and shifted Pentagon steel contracts to mills that did not raise prices. Big steel soon asked: What would the President say to a 50 percent rollback of the price increase?
"I wouldn't say a damn thing," Mr. Kennedy told an aide. "It's the whole way." Not much later, the steelmakers withdrew the increase.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 24, 1994, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about President Clinton's use of Presidential power referred incorrectly to a published account of an argument he had last summer with Senator Bob Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat, over the Senator's vote on the President's budget package. The account, in "The Agenda: Inside the Clinton White House" by Bob Woodward, said Mr. Clinton cursed at Mr. Kerrey, not vice versa.

How a Hot Investment Lost Its Air

BYLINE: By Andrea Adelson 

 BODY:
MARTIN CHOPP had big dreams when he began a company last year. His last venture, a video duplication business, fell on hard times, but this was supposed to be his ticket to fame: a featherweight, inflatable car seat for toddlers.
Such a product, he reasoned, would easily appeal to baby-boomer parents, who would appreciate a mid-priced car seat that weighs 5 pounds rather than the customary 18. 
 And from the beginning, Babystar Inc., the Brooklyn-based company he started, bore the immodest bravado of its founder. It was even savvy enough to arrange a cute stock symbol -- BABY -- to help investors remember it.
Investors, who forked over $6.3 million to the company in its initial public offering in June 1993, have been on a rough ride. Shares that were once worth almost $4 apiece are now down to less than 60 cents. And while Mr. Chopp remains optimistic that he can grab a chunk of the estimated $400-million-a-year car seat market with his $99 Air Seat, others doubt Babystar's prospects.
Either way, his story illustrates the importance of keeping an eye on the stock market. Investors quickly saw what consumers and retailers missed: the product has trouble staying inflated.
The company has had an easier time keeping its reputation pumped-up. It won favorable publicity in January when the company got the go-ahead to market the seat in Europe and again in April, after it won a patent in the United States. Ad copy boasts that the seat "meets or exceeds" all Government safety standards, and Mr. Chopp is quick to beat the company's drum.
"We are elated," he said, for instance, in January after clearing the regulatory hurdles in Europe. Whatever delay had occurred in securing the approvals, he said, was "caused primarily by the fact that the product is so unique and revolutionary."
Maybe too revolutionary. The car seat, it seems, has a slight problem. Air escapes when it is exposed to heat or sunlight.
The first hint of trouble was tucked away in an April 29 statement, shortly after shipments began. The company acknowledged having had some returns but said it was "able to determine the manufacturing adjustments which Air Seats need for day-to-day use in the real world."
By May 26, however, the company amplified that statement. It reported that returns were "greater than expected" and that more "manufacturing adjustments need to be made." The problem? "It appears that as a result of severe heat and direct sunlight into the back of some cars, the seats are losing air," the statement said.
This time, Babystar said it was unsure that it would "be able to overcome this challenge without increasing prices excessively." More ominous was its statement that it was "examining whether to invest cash and other resources in related or other industries."
Investors got the message loud and clear. The company's stock plunged below $1 a share, where it has remained. Friday's close was 56 cents. "Sounds to me like it's over," said Stan Williams, senior editor of Children's Business, a trade magazine.
How the Air Seat slipped past the regulators is not hard to fathom. In this country, the Department of Transportation can penalize companies that fail to meet its standards by forcing a recall. But the system relies heavily on self-policing. Each manufacturer hires an independent laboratory to test whether its product meets 20 pages of Government safety standards before going to market. The Government gets involved only if it receives consumer complaints or if it discovers that advertising claims are untrue.
And while the rules cover things like how well a seat withstands a head-on collision and whether it works upside-down, there is not one word about how it holds up under ordinary temperature changes. In Britain, Anthony W. Stenning, head of testing for the Vehicle Certification Agency in Bristol, said the inflation problem had been overlooked because of the seat's "unconventional materials."
How the flaw escaped the people who most need to know, namely new parents like the 6.2 million who bought safety seats last year, is more of a mystery. Of the thousands of Babystar seats sold, only one resulted in a complaint with the Transportation Department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration about lost air. A safety defect investigation, which could force a recall, is being considered, said Tim Hurd, an agency spokesman.
Retailers also seem blissfully unaware of the seat's shortcomings. "It's the ultimate in a car seat," said Wendy McLean, merchandise manager for the Right Start catalogue in Westlake Village, Calif. "Customers love it." Told of the company's May 26 announcement, she said, "This is news to me."
Toys R Us, the nation's largest toy retailer, hopes to carry the seat next year. "They don't have enough production yet to supply us," said Carol Fuller, a spokeswoman.
For now, Babystar, which spent $1 million to develop Air Seat, has no plans, or financial means, for a voluntary recall. It lost $581,000 on sales of $151,000 in the quarter ended March 31 and has no reserves to cover the cost of dealing with the nearly one out of 10 seats that are returned, Mr. Chopp said.
In an interview, Mr. Chopp defended the seat and his failure to do anything more than advise retailers to inform customers to check the air before each use. "There's nothing to inform them about," he said. "Even without air, the seat is as safe as any other."
Maybe, but in April, Mr. Chopp, aglow over having won a patent for the seat, was quoted saying that the seat worked in part because the cushion of air surrounding a child would absorb the blow in an accident.
Now there are only two things that might absorb the blow at Babystar if the car seat cannot be fixed. The company is developing an inflatable crib, and it bought the rights last year to proprietary technology for installing air bags in older cars, what it termed a "major breakthrough" that could benefit "tens of millions of cars on the road."
For a maker of child restraints, restraint has never been this company's strong point.

HEADLINE: Credit Robert Moses for Lower East Side's Hamilton Fish Pool

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While the architects Carrere and Hastings deserve credit for designing Hamilton Fish Park in 1898 (news article, July 10), your attribution of the pool to them doesn't hold water. 
 It wasn't until the third stage of the park's development in 1936 that the outdoor swimming pool was constructed. The original plan, well meaning in its mission to provide open space in the teeming immigrant neighborhoods of the Lower East Side, imposed an uptown esthetic on the downtown population.
Dominated by a splendid Beaux-Arts brick and limestone gymnasium pavilion, the aristocratic park opened in 1900 with grass parterres and formal paths, a bathhouse but no swimming pool and no outdoor recreational facilities.
The predominately Jewish, Irish and Italian neighborhood kids were not interested in quiet strolling; they wanted a safe place to play, away from the crowded streets. Within a year of opening in 1900, the grounds were ruined and the park was closed. In 1903 a more realistic park opened with asphalt walks, an eight-lane running track, basketball and tennis courts, but still no outdoor pool.
It was Robert Moses, an enthusiastic Yale swimmer, Oxford water polo team captain and the city's first Parks Commissioner, who was responsible for the swimming pool at Hamilton Fish Park. And he did it with a splash, in 1936 opening not 1 but 11 public swimming pools throughout the city at a cost of $1 million each.
Over the years the actively used Hamilton Fish Park and pool, neglected by the city, began to deteriorate, and in the 1970's it became a center for drug activity. A neighborhood activist, Sammy Fleischer, led a campaign for city funds to renovate the park and pool.
In 1992, after a four-year hiatus, the present park opened to the delight of the local population, now largely black, Hispanic and Asian. Redesigned by Paul Spears of John Ciardulio Associates, it now includes a year-round community center in the restored Beaux-Arts building, two swimming pools and newly landscaped areas.
Hamilton Fish Park continues to serve the community, but other parks remain neglected. Isn't it curious that in the midst of the Depression money could be found to finance city pools on a large scale while today in a rebounding economy the budget for the Parks Department is being squeezed dry?

DATELINE: CHAPPAQUIDDICK ISLAND, Mass., July 17

 BODY:
From his lemonade stand at the intersection of Chappaquiddick and Dyke Roads, 12-year-old Louis Becker offers tourists directions to the beaches, the wildlife reservations or the Mytoi Preserve, a Japanese garden where a red wooden footbridge crosses a pine-shaded pond.
But most visitors here have another bridge in mind: the Dyke Bridge. Twenty-five years ago, on the night of July 18, 1969, Senator Edward M. Kennedy drove his Oldsmobile off the bridge into Poucha Pond, and his passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne, drowned. Senator Kennedy, who did not call for help or report the incident for 10 hours, later pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident. He received a two-month suspended sentence and his driver's license was revoked for a year. 
 Dyke Bridge has crumbled in the last quarter of a century, as hurricanes and souvenir collectors have taken a toll. All that remains are 23 weathered wooden pilings jutting crookedly out of the water, connected here and there by a few jagged, graying beams. Still, the bridge has earned a distinction that is envied by many small innkeepers: a boldface entry in "Fodor's Travel Guide."
 
Handling the Curious
 Many people who live on Martha's Vineyard, which includes Chappaquiddick, are more interested in the tricentennial of the town of Chilmark than in the silver anniversary of a drowning. Like them, Louis finds it hard to understand the fascination that the bridge holds for people from the mainland.
"It's sort of regrettable to see how many people come just to see a bunch of pilings and wreckage and wood just because somebody famous drove off it in a foolish accident," said Louis, who runs the stand with his 7-year-old sister, Margot, and charges 50 cents a cup.
There has been some inflation since Susan McHugh and her sisters, who grew up nearby, sold lemonade on the same spot in the years after the accident. "We'd usually charge between 10 and 25 cents to tell people where the bridge was," recalled Ms. McHugh, who is now 28. "If they didn't pay, we would give them directions to the dump."
Sometimes the McHughs could be enticed to give short Chappaquiddick tours: down to the gray-shingled cottage known as the "party house," where Senator Kennedy and Miss Kopechne attended a party before the accident, then back to the intersection where Senator Kennedy took a wrong turn, he says, missing the road to the Edgartown Ferry, and finally to the bridge itself.
The anniversary comes in the middle of Senator Kennedy's re-election campaign. In the fall, he is likely to face Mitt Romney, a Republican businessman whose father, George Romney, was the Governor of Michigan.
"I bear full responsibility for the tragedy, and I always will," Senator Kennedy said last week in a statement. "I have expressed my remorse to my family, the Kopechne family and the people of Massachusetts. I only wish I had the power to do more to ease the continuing pain I feel and that Mr. and Mrs. Kopechne feel for Mary Jo's loss."
Some of his critics are seizing the opportunity to remind voters of the incident. The party house has been rented by a radio talk-show host from Boston, Howie Carr, who will broadcast his show from a clambake there on Tuesday. "We tried to get permission to broadcast from the Dyke Bridge, but the selectmen turned us down," said Mr. Carr, who also writes a column for The Boston Herald.
One visitor to the bridge on Saturday was Joe Corvino from Everett, Mass. He said that his whole family disliked the Senator and that he had once written a high school history paper on the drowning. "We're here to see what kept another Kennedy from being President," said Mr. Corvino, who came with Genine Swanzey, a classmate from the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass.
As they donned their white helmets and prepared to ride their moped back to the ferry, the bike lurched out from under them and they skidded along the pebbly road. "What are you trying to do?" Ms. Swanzey asked. "Recreate the accident?"
Mr. Corvino could have researched his Chappaquiddick paper at the Bunch of Grapes Bookstore in Vineyard Haven, which features stacks of three paperbacks with remarkably similar titles: "Chappaquiddick: The Real Story," "Teddy Bare: The Real Story of Chappaquiddick" and "Senatorial Privilege: The Chappaquiddick Coverup."

Parents Deny Getting Apology
 SWIFTWATER, Pa., July 17 (AP) -- The parents of Miss Kopechne say they believe that their daughter was asleep in the back seat of the car and never knew Senator Kennedy was driving the night she was killed. And they say they have never received an apology from the Senator, though they say other members of the family, like Senator Kennedy's mother, Rose, and Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel, have written them letters.
In an interview with The Times-Leader of Wilkes-Barre, the Kopechnes, Gwen and Joe, said they had not used Kennedy money to buy their retirement home. The couple received $140,923 from Mr. Kennedy's insurance company, but they said they had always planned to use their savings to retire. "We worked," Mrs. Kopechne said. "Kennedy didn't buy this house."

HEADLINE: The Moon Landing: 25 Years After Apollo 11;
Wistful Pride and Cynicism Color Americans' Memories of Apollo 11

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 17

 BODY:
Twenty-five years after the United States put a man on the moon, Americans still take great pride in that stirring, epochal achievement. But it is a tempered pride.
Conversations with dozens of Americans find a pensive, even melancholy longing for the heady days of July 1969, when the nation, despite crippling divisions over issues like the Vietnam War and racial equality, somehow still managed to pull together and collectively focus on and attain an awesome goal. 
 Today, many Americans say, that special measure of togetherness has been lost while the divisions remain.
Like millions of people in the United States and around the world, Diana Birchall, a 48-year-old script analyst for a Los Angeles studio, remembers spending July 20, 1969, in front of her television set, filled with pride for mankind and America and transfixed by the scratchy sounds and images coming back from the moon.
 
Moment Lacked Momentum
 "Sadly, it turns out that what everybody thought would be a new epoch after the moon walk didn't last much longer than the moon walk itself," Ms. Birchall now laments. "I have always been shocked by how little that moment carried forward. It's as though it was a big hoax shot on the back lot of a Hollywood studio."
Many people repeated a phrase that has become almost a cliche since the Apollo 11 mission, asking why a nation that put a man on the moon cannot seem to achieve earthly goals like ridding itself of racism, finding food, shelter and jobs for the poor and extending health care to everyone.
"It was this great unifying moment, a kind of new frontier," Barbara George, a bookstore manager in Palo Alto, Calif., recalled of the moon walk. "But we have the same problems today as we had back then -- poverty, wars, racism."
Don Oldham, a homeless 70-year-old elevator operator in Seattle, offered a starker reflection. Sitting outside a shelter and watching other homeless people shuffle into line for a hot meal, he said, "Moon walk didn't change my life -- and didn't change their life."
But there is still huge national pride in what was achieved when Neil A. Armstrong, the commander of the Apollo 11 mission, first stepped on the moon's dusty surface and proclaimed, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."
At that time, said Kevin Fogarty, a 56-year-old Boston bus driver, "the U.S. was supreme."
Yet the random conversations, as well as national polls, indicate that there is no real national yearning for another multibillion-dollar manned thrust into space toward more distant moons, planets and stars.
To the contrary, there are some second thoughts about whether the Apollo project should ever have been attempted, even if it did take man farther than he had ever been before.
Many people now see the project as mainly a costly mano a mano competition with the Soviet Union. They say, a bit uncomfortably, that they cannot cite a single specific example of how the science and technology used to put a man on the moon has benefited man here on earth.
 
A Bit of Imperialism
 To Rick Parfitt, a 41-year-old speech researcher from San Francisco, the moon mission produced "great things like the hand-held calculator and the integrated circuit." But he, too, views the mission as a costly product of a cold war mentality -- and also as a bit of colonial imperialism by the United States.
"I thought it should have been the United Nations flag," Mr. Parfitt said, recalling that the Apollo astronauts left an American flag on the moon's surface. "The political part of the flag business disturbed me."
Mary Flood, 41, is a lawyer who hails from Houston, the site of Mission Control for the space flights and thus, in a sense, Apollo's hometown. But Ms. Flood also has mixed feelings about the moon mission and where the United States should head next with its space program.
"I remember being proud of my country and disappointed with my country," she said, recalling July 20, 1969, when Mr. Armstrong and his fellow moon walker, Col. Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin of the Air Force, took their first tentative steps on the lunar surface. "We were capable of doing so much out there and incapable of doing that here. We're in the same place today."
What about another manned space mission toward the moon or even farther out?
"I love the space program and I'm fascinated by the universe," Ms. Flood replied. "But there are problems that need to be solved in our own backyard. It's like buying a new car when your kids are hungry."
 
A Fiscal Impossibility
 Doug Lynch, a systems analyst in Boston, was only 5 years old when the moon walk took place. But like almost every other American, he has seen numerous television reruns of the historic event and has given some thought to future space exploration.
His conclusion? The Apollo project was "the last large-scale project we could successfully complete in this country," because "everything is too expensive at the moment to do anything of that scale." There are many people, of course, who still favor manned space missions. But, in contrast to 25 years ago, they now seem to be a minority.
One of them is Ellen Dugan, a 37-year-old art curator in Atlanta.
She says American astronauts should go back into deep space, beyond the low orbits of today's space shuttle, but she also says the exploration should be carried out only in the interest of pure science, not for the purpose of flying the Stars and Stripes on some distant planet.
And, given the state of the American economy in the 1990's, Ms. Dugan tempers her expectations about further space missions, comparing Federal financing of the space program with Federal financing for the arts. "Both are now seen by a lot of people as being peripheral to daily life," she said.
To W. Herbert George 3d, a 27-year-old bar manager in Richmond, going back into deep space, whatever the cost, is a "moral imperative" because if human beings do not explore and press outward, they will stagnate. He also believes that vexing social problems will always be around and should not be an excuse for withdrawal from outer space.
"We do have other problems," Mr. George said. "But to wait is to limit ourselves."
More than most other Americans, Roger Christensen, 54, worries about the nation putting limits on itself in space exploration.
Mr. Christensen is an aerospace worker, and helped build the Apollo 11 command capsule at the North American Rockwell plant in Downey, Calif., where he still works, now mainly on space shuttle projects.
 
The Best of Times
 The Apollo days were the headiest of his life, he said, month after month of 100-hour weeks, seeing the capsule take form right before his eyes, even under the guidance of his own hands. But these days, he often feels like a Vietnam veteran or an old high school football hero.
"You tell people that you're a space worker and helped put together Apollo and now work on the shuttle," he said, with hurt in his voice, "and they say, 'So, what?'
"Well, the goal of man is to continue -- on anything. And that's what we need to do with space exploration."
And if we don't?
"Well," Mr. Christensen replied, "I can always say that while I didn't get to help build the pyramids in this life, I got to work on Apollo and the moon shot. I was part of history."

Armstrosng at Air Show
 NEW KNOXVILLE, Ohio, July 17 (AP) -- Mr. Armstrong, who left the first footprints on the moon, returned to his boyhood home today for a celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission.
The 63-year-old former astronaut shook hands, signed autographs and spoke briefly to reporters at an air show at the Neil Armstrong Airport in this western Ohio community, about 80 miles from his farm in Lebanon.
"The Earth was sinking away from us at a fairly prodigious rate," he recalled of the lunar mission. "That was a special time, because you know you're committed. We felt we had everybody behind us.
"The final descent and landing were far and away the most difficult part of the flight."
Mr. Armstrong has granted no interviews with news organizations in the United States for the lunar landing anniversary and did not attend commemorative ceremonies at Cape Canaveral, Fla., the launching site.

HEADLINE: Nigerian Rulers Said to Reach An Accord With Opposition

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LAGOS, Nigeria, July 17

 BODY:
Nigeria's military leaders have reached an understanding with democracy advocates under which the imprisoned opposition leader, Moshood Abiola, would be released, the Government said today.
But the agreement, reached late Saturday night with officials of the Nigerian Labor Congress, would mean in effect that Mr. Abiola and his supporters would have to cease demands for democracy, a prospect that seems unlikely given the increasingly bold pro-democracy movement here. Under the plan, the military Government would allow Mr. Abiola's "unconditional" release if he and other political detainees agreed not to resort to further "disturbances of the peace," according to a statement issued after the meeting. 
 Mr. Abiola, who was widely believed to have won last year's presidential election, which was annulled by the previous military leader, is being held by the military authorities at an undisclosed location. He is charged with treason.
The fact that the authorities are even considering Mr. Abiola's release underscores how concerned the Government is about the crisis here.
"Time and the tide do not seem to be going in Abacha's favor," said a commentary today in The African Guardian, Nigeria's largest-circulation weekly. "Latest indications from both the political and economic fronts are of a meltdown -- indeed, the destruction of civilized society."
Since Mr. Abiola's detention in early June, no less than 10 major industrial unions have gone on strike, including those representing banking and financial workers, local and federal government employees, nurses and midwives, teachers, food, beverage and tobacco workers, and air-transport workers.
But the most important walkout has been that of the 12,000-member oil workers union. That strike has crippled Lagos, Nigeria's largest city and commercial center, where petroleum, diesel, cooking gas and kerosene have become virtually impossible to find at legal outlets. On the black market a 13-gallon container of fuel, which formerly cost the equivalent of $10, now costs as much as $180.
Oil exports account for more than 90 percent of Nigeria's foreign exchange income, which amounted to about $10 billion last year. And as fears increase that the oil strike could further disrupt Nigerian exports, oil prices have risen steadily in recent days. Most exports are destined for the United States, and a long strike could increase prices there.
For his part, General Abacha is generally believed to be facing a dilemma of his own. If he clamps down even harder on dissent, he risks a police overreaction that could work to the opposition's advantage. If he appears to be too soft, however, he risks unsettling hard-line generals from whose ranks he came and whose support he needs.
 
Pledge of Democracy
 The current crisis began when the military Government, which said for eight years that it would return Nigeria to democratic rule, abruptly reneged on the promise after presidential elections in June 1993. Amid street protests, the military leader, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, handed power to a transitional government nominally headed by a civilian, Ernest Shonekan.
General Abacha then took over, abolishing all political parties, dissolving the newly elected national assembly and local and state governments, and banning strikes and political gatherings.
Last month, the military authorities charged Mr. Abiola with treason for declaring that he was assuming the presidency. Mr. Abiola was denied bail on Friday and a trial was set for July 28.

HEADLINE: In Oregon, Christian Right Raises Its Sights and Wins

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., July 12

 BODY:
As the struggle intensifies around the country between more traditional Republicans and fellow Republicans on the religious right, the first battle here in Oregon, a state long known for it political tolerance, is already over. And the fundamentalists have emerged triumphant.
Candidates backed by religious conservatives have defeated more moderate opponents in the Republican primaries for governor and for three seats in the House of Representatives. They have also posted successes in state legislative races. 
 Representative Mary Alice Ford, defeated after 15 years in the State Legislature in a primary that highlighted her stand for abortion rights, is not pleased. "Quite frankly, I don't consider them Republicans," she said of her party opponents. "I consider them religious opportunists."
Still bitter from her defeat, Ms. Ford said there was "now a litmus test to be elected to office." She said, "I'm angry that I'm not considered a real Christian because I happen to be Episcopalian and I'm not born again, whatever that means."
While the religious right's success in Oregon is so far unmatched in any other state, a pattern is nonetheless apparent nationwide. Religious conservatives who once concentrated on school boards and other local races are looking at higher offices as they try to pull the Republican Party to the right.
 
30 Aggressive Campaigns
 At least 30 Republicans who are waging aggressive campaigns for the House this year have strong ties to the Christian right. While several states have not yet had their primaries, these candidates have won nominations or party endorsements in California, Idaho, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming and elsewhere.
"You're seeing the pro-family movement on the cusp of that transition from being a social protest movement to being a mainstream political force that can win elections," said Ralph Reed, executive director of the Christian Coalition.
Yet, it is not clear how much appeal these candidates will have as they venture beyond local races. The danger for the religious conservatives here and in other states, and for the Republican Party, is that many moderates in own party may be turned off by the hard-line positions of these candidates and sit out the election or defect to the Democrats.
While critics of Christian conservatives accuse them of intolerance, the candidates insist they have no radical agenda and are being unfairly smeared by the Democrats. In the primaries, many of them emphasized fiscal issues, though their supporters were active in the churches.
"It's a tremendous overreaction; it's hysterical," said Bill Witt, a businessman who helped establish the Oregon Christian Coalition in 1992 and won the Republican nomination for a House seat from the Portland area. His affiliation with the Christian coalition was not noted on his campaign biography.
While Democrats describe the gains of religious conservatives as a danger to the American political system, many of them see the trend as their road to re-election. Already, the successes of religious conservatives are spurring many Oregon Republicans to switch to independent.
"As a Democrat, I can take some pleasure in the destruction of the Republican Party," said Dick Springer, the Oregon Senate majority leader.
The three Democratic nominees for the House seats are women, who are expected to raise money nationally from groups that support women in politics. Representative Elizabeth Furse, a Democrat from a Portland, barely won her first term two years ago and was viewed in her own party as an underdog who was too liberal for her district. That was until the Republicans nominated Mr. Witt.
Between handshakes at a fund-raising reception here for the Right to Privacy Political Action Committee, a political group seeking equal rights for homosexuals, Ms. Furse sought to paint the Republicans as extremists. "We used to be known for things like land-use planning -- the bottle bill for God's sake," she said. "We are a progressive state, and yet Oregon has become a real test case for the radical right. If they can do it here, they can do it anywhere."
Mr. Witt looked more like a Wall Street executive than a radical. Sipping a lemonade at a hotel cocktail lounge here, he presented himself as a mainstream candidate who wants to go to Washington to cut taxes, not regulate social behavior. Allowing that he was against expanding civil rights for homosexuals, but not against homosexuals, Mr. Witt said, "One of my sons had a gay music teacher in a Catholic school. It didn't bother me."
In a further public relations effort, Mr. Witt dispatched an adviser, Jack Lansing, to meet a reporter to assure him that he was not an extremist. "He's no nut," Mr. Lansing said.
 
Crucial Endorsement
 Still, Mr. Witt and the three other Republican nominees -- former Representative Denny Smith, who is running for governor, and State Senators Jim Bunn and Wes Cooley, who are running for the House -- might be hard-pressed to portray themselves as moderates.
Based on their hard-line positions on abortion, homosexuality, pornography and other social issues, all four Republican nominees in Oregon were endorsed by the Oregon Citizens Alliance, which drew national attention in 1992 for forcing on the ballot a referendum on allowing bias against homosexuals and calling homosexuality abnormal, wrong, unnatural and perverse. The measure was rejected.
"We walked precincts and handed out literature for all four of them," Lon T. Mabon, the alliance's director, said. "We mailed out thousands and thousands of our endorsement letters. I think all that had a major impact on them getting the numbers they did."
Mr. Mabon also said these candidates fell "strong in the category of pro-family conservatives."
The alliance recently submitted signatures to force a new measure on homosexuals on the November ballot -- this time without the sharp language of the earlier proposal -- and several Republicans said they feared that such a measure could energize their opponents, thus balancing one of the main benefits of endorsements by the religious right: organization.
Religious conservatives are among the most reliable voters, and they contributed greatly to the strong showing by these candidates in the primaries here. The work in years past of the Oregon Citizens Alliance and one of the lowest voter turnouts in Oregon history, 38 percent statewide, are given much of the credit for the conservative victories in the primaries.
But William M. Lunch, a political science professor at Oregon State University, said: "These are folks who have views which are sufficiently out of the mainstream that they may hurt the political party that they call home."
As the Republican candidates here seek to broaden their appeal for the general election by emphasizing economic issues, they are playing down their ties to the Oregon Citizens Alliance, which polls have shown holds an extremely negative image among most voters in this state. Nor have any on the candidates announced their positions on the alliance's anti-homosexual measure.
"I honestly have not read it," Mr. Bunn said.
He said he had not sought the alliance's endorsement. "I didn't ask for it but they provided it," Mr. Bunn said. "But it was only natural that they pick a pro-life individual who had the best chance of winning."
Mr. Witt said that the alliance's endorsement "puts you on the spot" but he would not repudiate the group.
"People who want to help you -- it's not necessarily smart to spit in their face," he said. "But it may reach a point where I may just ask them to stay out of my race."

HEADLINE: Patents;
A small company offers a scanning device to make faxes private by encoding their computer bits.

BYLINE: By Sabra Chartrand 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE convergence of computers and telephones has created a whole new industry for moving information around the globe. With it come new economic opportunities as well as challenges to social and legal standards. A good illustration may be in the evolution of the facsimile machine.
When they first appeared, fax machines could send and receive documents on heat-sensitive paper, but not much else. Now they are programmable, use plain paper and laser printers, and can send one document to multiple places. There is even a car fax machine. In spite of these advances, faxes still have a basic handicap -- they are not private. Anyone can read documents as they emerge. 
 A small company in Pelham, N.Y., has patented a scanning device that makes faxed documents private by first encoding them in computer bits. The company, the Kryptofax Corporation, does not yet have a product -- its patent may be its most valuable commodity. But in the eyes of the Patent and Trademark Office under the Clinton Administration, that is exactly as it should be.
Right now Kryptofax employs three and a half people, counting a part-time hardware designer. The company was set up to sell a scanning device that uses encryption algorithms to turn fax text into indecipherable dots on a page.
The device comes in two sizes similar to those of standard desktop fax machines. After documents are inserted, a user types details about the fax's title and its destination on a keyboard. That information appears on a display panel.
"Then the most critical thing is to provide a password," Richard Virga, a former computer programmer who is the president of Kryptofax, said. The sender can choose any combination of letters; the recipient would use the same password to decode the document. The password can be used repeatedly, or it can be changed for each new document.
With the routing information and password in place, the machine scans the document. Software using a common encryption algorithm -- a formula for rendering letters into computer bits -- turns the words into dots and then compresses the data. Mr. Virga said the scanner could read printed text, graphics or handwritten notations.
The encoded page emerges with the title and addressee name appearing in plain language at the top. The rest is a grid of random dots. That page is then faxed on any fax machine. On the receiving end, only someone who knows the password can decode the document by inserting it in their scanner.
"As the Kryptofax machine reads the encrypted grid, it begins simultaneously to print a decrypted version of the page," Mr. Virga said. "It will look identical to a fax of the original -- about 200 pixels per inch."
"The marketplace we're aiming at is the large workplace where people share fax machines," Mr. Virga said, especially businesses where documents written by one person to a second are faxed and received by secretaries or clerks.
If the pages are put in upside down or out of sequence, the Kryptofax will tell the user to straighten things out. Mr. Virga said his company hopes to sell Kryptofax software that can be embedded directly into personal computers or fax machines.
"We use an encryption algorithm called seeded pseudo-random number generator," Mr. Virga said. That is a string of random bits set off by giving the computer a "seed," or string of characteristics or numbers. The company chose that algorithm because it is in the public domain, he added.
Mr. Virga said Kryptofax hoped to write its own encryption algorithms for future versions of its device. But first Kryptofax has to find manufacturers for its product, which Mr. Virga said should cost about $3,000 at first. The company is not planning to produce the device itself.
"It's too expensive to tool up a line to manufacture circuit boards or do cabinet molding," he said. Paradoxically, only the circuit board and the software will be domestically produced.
"We can't find a U.S. company to make the guts of the fax machine," Mr. Virga said. "The Japanese own that market."
The KryptoFax Corporation's patent is 5,321,749.

HEADLINE: North Korea Said to Dip Into Rice Reserves to Bar Unrest

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SEOUL, July 17

 BODY:
Reports are circulating here that North Korea's Government, fearing unrest, is dipping into military rice reserves to relieve the hunger of people who have flocked to the capital to mourn the nation's late leader, Kim Il Sung.
Like many reports from the secretive Communist country, this one is difficult to verify. But it reflects what analysts say will be the reality facing Kim Il Sung's son and expected successor, Kim Jong Il: The way to his people's hearts will not be through his father's revolutionary slogans but through their stomachs. 
 Saving North Korea's plummeting economy will be the biggest challenge confronting Kim Jong Il. If he fails, some analysts say, the 52-year-old "Dear Leader" will probably be stripped of office, and the country might collapse, forcing a hasty and disruptive reunification with the richer South.
"He has no choice but to open the economy," said Dr. Park Jin, associate fellow at the Center for North Korean Economic Studies, which is affiliated with the South Korean Government.
Kim Jong Il, he said, lacks the ability his father had to hold the country together through charisma and credentials as a nationalist hero. "The only way out for him is to feed people more and make them warmer," Dr. Park said.
 
Output Has Been Shrinking
 North Korea's economic output has been shrinking about 5 percent a year for four consecutive years, according to analysts in South Korea. People are said to be eating only two meals a day, electricity supply is spotty, and factories are shut for long periods for lack of work or fuel.
Saving the economy carries its own risks. Many experts say Mr. Kim will have to open the virtually sealed country to more foreign investment and trade.
But economic liberalization is often accompanied by political liberalization. Increasing contact with the outside world might lead North Koreans to realize how poor and repressed they are, increasing discontent.
North Korea might also have to give up its efforts to develop nuclear weapons to benefit from aid that the United States and other advanced nations would then offer.
Mr. Kim is expected to try to avoid simultaneous economic and political liberalization, which helped bring down Communist governments in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. He is expected instead to attempt what China has been trying to do, with mixed success -- free up the economy while keeping strict political control. Indeed, China itself has been urging such a course for North Korea.
 
Information Is Scarce
 Like everything about North Korea, information on its economy is scarce and somewhat untrustworthy. Economic figures are based on estimates by South Korea. First-hand accounts come from a few visitors, who are shown only what the North Korean authorities want them to see, or from North Korean defectors, who say what the South Korean authorities want them to say.
In May, a family of five defectors arrived in Seoul telling of starvation that was so severe that elderly people were going off to the fields to die to relieve the burden on their families. But analysts here say that while there appears to be enough food for only two meals a day, it is unlikely that people are starving to death because the food is rationed.
Thursdays are said to be no-electricity days in Pyongyang, the capital, while rural areas are without power several days a week. In December, in a highly unusual move, the Government acknowledged that the economy was faltering.
The gross national product of North Korea is estimated to be about $20.5 billion, only one-sixteenth the level of South Korea. Per capita output of about $900 a year is one-eighth of that of South Korea.
 
Hurt by Soviet Collapse
 The biggest factor in the economic decline, analysts say, is that with the collapse of the Soviet Union, North Korea lost its economic lifeline -- subsidized Soviet oil. China is now North Korea's largest supplier of oil and food, but Beijing has normalized relations with South Korea and is becoming less interested in supporting the North's ailing economy indefinitely.
Other problems abound. Cold weather last year contributed to a very poor harvest. Centralized planning is as inefficient here as it was in Eastern Europe, and the country has the burden of supporting a 1.1 million-member military.
Foreign trade is very limited, amounting to only 13 percent of North Korea's gross national product, compared with about 50 percent for South Korea.
There are only two industries in North Korea that seem at all competitive. One is weaponry, for which North Korea has found markets in what Washington considers rogue nations of the Middle East. The other is apparel manufacturing, for which North Korea's low wages are a big factor. Some discount shops in Tokyo, for instance, now sell cheap suits made in North Korea.
Analysts here differ over how swiftly Mr. Kim will move on economic reform and what path he will take. Some say that since his claim to office is that he is Kim Il Sung's son, he will be forced to follow his father's philosophy of "juche," or self-reliance, and will liberalize only slowly.
But Yu Suk Ryul, a professor at the Government-affiliated Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul, said that the younger Mr. Kim had been behind the ever-so-slight economic liberalization that has taken place in the last decade, and that he surrounds himself with reform-minded technocrats.
In a step toward liberalization, North Korea has set up a free trade zone to attract foreign companies near the city of Najin in the northeast.
But the Government is said to be taking steps to keep the region isolated to prevent North Koreans from being "contaminated" by foreign influences. And North Korea still lacks the transportation and communications needed by businesses.
Dr. Park of the Center for North Korean Economic Studies said North Korea might also have trouble attracting foreign companies because its wages, while low, are not as low as those in China and Vietnam.
For South Korean companies, however, the absence of a language barrier compensates for any difference in wages between North Korea and other Asian nations. A few years ago, South Korean conglomerates, which are losing competitiveness in labor-intensive industries because of rising wages, began avidly exploring possible business ventures in North Korea.
But such moves ground to a halt after Pyongyang announced last year that it would pull out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Since then, the Seoul Government has been withholding the approvals South Korean companies need to engage in business in the North.
The desire for low-wage labor is not the only reason South Korean companies are interested in investing in the North.
South Korea wants to avoid a collapse of the North Korean economy, which could lead to flood of poor refugees to the South and a possible shotgun reunification, which would severely strain South Korea's resources and perhaps end its economic miracle. Studies have estimated that it will cost South Korea as much as $1 trillion to absorb its neighbor.
"On the one hand, the absolute majority wants to see reunification," said Kil Jeong Woo, director of policy studies at South Korea's Research Institute for National Unification. "That's the emotional side. On the economic side, after witnessing the German experience, we should be more realistic."

HEADLINE: For Cultural Institutions, Art of Collaboration Is Biggest Show in Town

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Veronique LeMelle, executive director of the small Jamaica Arts Center in Queens, has grown weary of waiting in dread for each year's budget to emerge from City Hall. Whether the news is good or bad, the anxiety and uncertainty can be devastating for a small institution such as hers, planning only a few months ahead on the cultural calendar.
In 1991, her innovative combinations of art and social-service programs -- including an H.I.V. risk-reduction program in several Queens shelters for the homeless using quilt-making and theater -- suffered significant cutbacks. This year, to her amazement, she got a slight increase. 
 "It was miraculous," she said. "I was expecting the worst."
But municipal generosity is fleeting, and Ms. LeMelle is no longer taking any chances on it. For the first time, the Jamaica Arts Center has begun collaborating with other cultural institutions and community groups, joining forces in both programming and applying for crucial private grants. The center is about to announce several joint programs with the Black Spectrum Theater, a performance group not far away in Jamaica, and is also working closely with Red Hook Arts in Brooklyn.
 
New Strategies
 "Instead of competing with each other, we've started saying, hey, why don't we pool our money and do it together," said Ms. LeMelle. "You've got to do the ground work and make sure you've got a compatible marriage, or else it could be a nightmare. But it's really something you've got to do. If we spend all our time fighting with each other, someone else will come along and take the money."
Uneasily at first, but with a growing sense of necessity, the city's smaller cultural institutions are developing strategies to survive an uncertain economy. Particularly in the boroughs outside of Manhattan, boroughs where tourism is skimpy and the attention of corporate givers is flickering, institutions are teaming up and devising new ways of attracting both visitors and donations.
In those boroughs, even the larger institutions have decided to cooperate. Four of Brooklyn's largest institutions have just unveiled a joint campaign to get city residents and tourists to "Try a Day in Brooklyn." Working together on signs, brochures and advertisements, the Brooklyn Museum, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, the Prospect Park Wildlife Center (formerly the zoo) and Prospect Park are touting their close proximity to each other and even the "fabulous shopping" at their gift shops.
In Flushing, where the Queens Botanical Garden nearly failed two years ago after a city investigation revealed mismanagement and corruption, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx have stepped in. Executives from the two larger gardens helped find a new director for the Queens garden and are providing horticultural assistance.
 
The Collaborators
 Not far away, the Flushing Council on Culture and the Arts, which operates the recently restored Flushing Town Hall, will be presenting a series of jazz concerts and exhibits in connection with the large retrospective on the life of Louis Armstrong that opens this fall at the nearby Queens Museum of Art.
Collaboration is not always easy for nonprofit institutions. The outgoing director of the Queens Botanical Garden, for example, objected to the presence of the other garden officials on her board of directors, complaining that they could not help raise funds for her organization when they remained loyal to their own.
"If I am Chrysler, I do not want General Motors on my board or anyone else who is or could be my competition," wrote Palmina R. Grella, the garden's acting director, in a memo to the board earlier this year.
But officials elsewhere said Ms. Grella -- who was not hired as the permanent director -- was taking a shortsighted view. "All of us have to go out there and make a strong case for all the botanical gardens working together as a group," said Lois Carswell, the chairwoman of the Brooklyn garden, who serves on the Queens garden's board.
 
Success Isn't Automatic
 Working together does not always produce results, particularly for smaller organizations. For the last three years, four regional black theaters -- the Black Spectrum Theater, the New Federal Theater in Manhattan, the Billie Holiday Theater in Brooklyn and the Theater of Universal Images in Newark -- have tried unsuccessfully to get a grant for joint productions.
But many larger institutions have found they can actually attract more money together. Alan J. Friedman, executive director of the New York Hall of Science in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, said that when the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City opened a year and a half ago, he was worried. But shortly afterward, the New York hall agreed to help train some of Liberty's staff, and the two centers went in on several joint grant proposals.
The borough cultural institutions also share a cherished sense of independence from the Manhattan cultural establishment and its internationally known museums, galleries and performing groups. Ms. LeMelle says that she remains wary of allying with the large Manhattan institutions.
"Sometimes I get calls from the big guys," she said. "They decide they need to diversify their audience, so they come out here. My feeling is, O.K., I'm helping you, but what am I getting in return? So I've been very cautious about working with them."
Manhattan continues to get the largest portion of the city's cultural budget -- 42 percent of $89 million in the last fiscal year -- but the percentage for other boroughs has grown in recent years under pressure from City Council members and borough presidents, many of whom use their own discretionary funds for borough arts groups. Getting private foundations to consider the other four boroughs remains difficult, however.
"You have to work twice as hard as a Manhattan institution," said Rochelle Slovin, executive director of the American Museum of the Moving Image in Long Island City, a film and broadcasting museum that is one of the most successful fund-raisers outside Manhattan. "But we've all learned to live within these constraints. It's not fair, but it's a fact of life."
Even more challenging is raising significant sums from corporations within the boroughs. Small galleries or arts troupes can get neighborhood funds from local businesses, but a large institution like the American Museum of the Moving Image gets almost none of its private funds from Queens, Ms. Slovin said. The borough has none of Manhattan's large corporate headquarters, and smaller or medium-size firms remain concerned about their bottom line and have not entered the philanthropic stream.
"Even in Brooklyn, some of the private funding there comes from people who were born there and made their fortunes elsewhere," Ms. Slovin said. "Queens has had a somewhat different socioeconomic trajectory. So I guess what we have to do now is find all the rich and famous people who grew up in Queens."

HEADLINE: Portrait of a Fund-Raiser: Seeking G.O.P. Friends

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

 BODY:
When Rudolph W. Giuliani first ran for mayor in 1989, William W. Koeppel raised money from everyone he knew. He even asked his tenants and contractors in his buildings for donations, amassing more than $100,000 for the campaign.
The young real-estate executive wanted to be sure he was the top fund-raiser at a dinner for Mr. Giuliani where President Bush was to speak, political associates said. The winner of the fund-raising contest would introduce the President. 
 Mr. Koeppel won, but the honor was not enough. During the dinner, he talked the President into giving him a ride in the motorcade to the airport, then letting him fly to Washington aboard Air Force One.
Mr. Koeppel, it seems, has a knack for getting close to Republican leaders. Last week that penchant landed him in the news when it was disclosed that he had provided choice apartments during the campaign and the early months of the administration to 15 Giuliani aides under leases that allowed some of tenants to put off paying rent for one to three months.
The leases raised questions about whether the apartments amounted to an illegal campaign contribution. But the disclosure also focused attention on a more fundamental issue: What does Mr. Koeppel want from Mr. Giuliani?
In recent months, city officials say, Mr. Koeppel has tried to influence senior mayoral aides on minor policy matters, from the cost of conventions to raising city revenues. But most of all, his acquaintances say, Mr. Koeppel (pronounced koh-PELL) has gotten immense pleasure simply from being associated with the Mayor, whose political style he would like to copy. Mr. Koeppel lost a race for Congress in 1990 and may still harbor political ambitions.
Still, it is Mr. Koeppel's role as landlord that has gotten the most scrutiny. Like most major landlords, Mr. Koeppel's company, Koeppel & Koeppel, has dozens of appeals to city assessments on his company's properties pending in court, some going back as far as five years. Favorable settlements with the city could save the Koeppels tens of thousands of dollars in taxes.
Two weeks after Mr. Giuliani took office in January, city lawyers reached an out-of-court settlement with Mr. Koeppel on two of his appeals, agreeing to reduce the assessments on a Brooklyn apartment building at 140 Bay Ridge Avenue. The city agreed to cut the assessment on the building by $60,000, from $400,000 to $340,000 in the tax years 1989 and 1990.
 
An Annual Challenge
 Apart from that case, Mr. Koeppel and his father, Robert, have challenged the annual assessments on at least seven other buildings. The city will probably negotiate settlements in about five of those cases this year, rather than going to court, officials said.
The city Corporation Counsel, Paul A. Crotty, a Giuliani appointee, has tremendous discretion over the out-of-court settlements that end the vast majority of such appeals. But James I. Lauer, who heads a team of lawyers who negotiate tax appeals for the city, said the lawyers who handled the Koeppel settlement were holdovers from the previous administration and knew nothing of Mr. Koeppel's role in the campaign.
Mr. Lauer said that major landlords challenge the city's estimates of the value of their properties every year as a matter of course, and that no one is given special treatment. The corporation counsel's office handles nearly 25,000 appeals a year, he said.
"This is not political," Mr. Lauer said. "This is based on numbers."
Mr. Koeppel and his father refused to be interviewed for this article.
Mayoral aides say Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Koeppel are not close friends. Mr. Koeppel is not, for instance, influential enough to have access to the Mayor whenever he likes. And in putting together his administration, Mr. Giuliani has hardly treated Mr. Koeppel as a favored son despite his financial support.
Senior Giuliani aides said Mr. Koeppel, who contributed $5,700 to Mr. Giuliani's 1993 campaign and raised a total of $78,000, wanted to be named the Consumer Affairs Commissioner, a highly visible position that can be a launching pad for politicians. But in the end, Mr. Giuliani selected Alfred Cerrullo, a Staten Island Councilman, and offered Mr. Koeppel a lesser job -- an unpaid position on the board of the Off-Track Betting Corporation.
"We didn't even reward him for being a fund-raiser," said the campaign aide, who requested that his name not be used. "We certainly wouldn't reward him for giving apartments to low-level campaign staff."
Members of the Koeppel family say Mr. Koeppel's eagerness to please Mr. Giuliani flows not only from political ambition but also from an almost boyish admiration for the Mayor and his staff.
"His generosity got him into trouble," said Howard Koeppel, a cousin. "He likes Giuliani and he likes the people the Mayor surrounds himself with. He wants to be a friend. He wants people to like him."
John Gross, the Giuliani campaign treasurer, said Mr. Koeppel looked up to the Mayor. "He has an incredible admiration and affection for Rudy that is more intense than I've seen coming from almost anybody else," Mr. Gross said.
Since Mr. Giuliani won office, Mr. Koeppel has used his contacts in City Hall to suggest some minor policy changes, city officials said.
For instance, Mr. Koeppel approached John S. Dyson, the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, after a North Carolina boat company from which he had bought a fishing boat complained about the high cost of showing at a boat show in the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. Mr. Koeppel helped set up meetings between Mr. Dyson and the sponsors of the show to discuss the high costs, Mr. Dyson said.
Some family members said Mr. Koeppel has courted Mr. Giuliani because he hopes to someday win elective office, despite a crushing defeat in his 1990 Congressional race.
"He aspires to have a political career," said his aunt, Nancy Koeppel. "I guess he felt if he could associate himself with someone successful and popular he could climb up the ladder."
Mr. Koeppel, who is 34 years old, grew up in a wealthy New York real-estate family, dividing his time between his parents' Fifth Avenue apartment and a summer home in West Palm Beach, Fla. He has lived a life of private schools, yachts and country clubs, secure in the knowledge that he would inherit a substantial real-estate business from his father, his family members said.
Mr. Koeppel attended the Bentley School in Manhattan and graduated from Adelphi University in 1981. After college, Mr. Koeppel attended Cardozo Law School in New York, though his study habits were irregular and he used to regularly fly to Florida on Thursday nights for long weekends, family members said. He graduated in 1984, but failed three times to pass the bar exam. He later sued the bar, saying the test was unfair to him because he was dyslexic. The case is pending.
Boats are Mr. Koeppel's private passion, said his spokesman, Gary Lewi. He owns a 46-foot Hatteras fishing craft, the Sahara, moored at the Tide Mill Yacht Basin in Rye, N.Y. He has spent over $1 million on the boat, adding such luxuries as chrome finish for the engines and a high-tech satellite navigational system.
As a real-estate executive, Mr. Koeppel has neither expanded the family's holdings nor hurt them, real estate executives said. He has yet to develop any property and has no projects in the works that would need city approval.
From an early age, Mr. Koeppel was sometimes hostile in dealings with cousins and siblings, several family members said, but the source of the animosity is hard to pinpoint.
In January, he used his influence in the new Giuliani administration to persuade the Finance Department to start a tax investigation of his relatives, Alfred and Bevin Koeppel, who own a separate real-estate company by the same name.
In 1964, the orginal Koeppel & Koeppel company was split in two by its owners, Max and Harry Koeppel, two brothers who over the previous three decades had built a small portfolio of properties into a sizable real- estate conglomerate controlling several office towers and East Side apartment buildings. Mr. Koeppel's father, Harry Koeppel's son, inherited several residential buildings in Manhattan and Brooklyn.
Max Koeppel's sons, Alfred and Bevin, ended up with several office towers in Manhattan. Having lost many tenants in the recession, they have fallen behind on mortgage payments and taxes on their office tower at 575 Lexington Avenue and are in danger of losing the building.
Only a few weeks into the new administration's term, Mr. Koeppel requested a meeting in person with the Finance Commissioner, Marc V. Shaw. He charged that his cousins had cheated on their taxes by having work performed on their private homes paid for by their company, city officials said. Mr. Shaw referred the accusations to city investigators.
Alfred Koeppel denied the charges and said Mr. Koeppel had tried several times in the past to discredit his relatives. In the late 1970's, he said, Mr. Koeppel spread a damaging rumor in New York and Palm Beach business circles that his cousins were going bankrupt, he said.
"Billy has had some kind of perceived vendetta on my brother and me for a number of years," Alfred Koeppel said. "He was like a gnat. I had to swat him away. But now he's turned into a hornet."
Through his spokesman, Mr. Koeppel maintained that the feud began after his relatives tried to block him from membership at various country clubs on Long Island.
The family dispute reached an apex this year when Mr. Koeppel boasted to a reporter from The New York Observer that he had used his influence with Mr. Giuliani to denounce his relatives as tax evaders. In the article, Mr. Koeppel said of his relatives: "They're snakes and when you get a snake on the ground, you cut its head off."
Mr. Koeppel later sent copies of the Observer article to contractors and vendors with whom he does business to show that he has nothing to do with the other side of the family, his cousins said.
Mr. Koeppel's desire to distance himself from the financial troubles of his relatives may flow from his political ambitions. He got involved in Republican politics in 1987 when he became a fund-raiser for the Bushcampaign. He was also a major fund-raiser for Mr. Giuliani in 1989, collecting $103,400 from dozens of people, including many of his tenants and contractors.
The next year, Mr. Koeppel mounted a quixotic campaign to unseat Representative Theodore Weiss, the longtime Democratic Congressman from the Upper West Side of Manhattan who was considered to have an impregnable hold on the 17th District until his death in 1992.
Despite the odds, Mr. Koeppel ran anyway, spending nearly $264,000 of his own money and $150,000 from other contributors on a campaign that earned him little respect even in Republican political circles. He got less than 20 percent of the vote. "That campaign proved one thing," one Koeppel campaign adviser said. "Money alone can't beat a candidate."

HEADLINE: Contradiction Marks Revival In Real Estate

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
As the region's real-estate market slowly emerges from a five-year hibernation, buyers and sellers in both New York City and the surrounding areas are finding what seems to be a very selective and at times contradictory recovery.
Long spoiled by years of having the upper hand in most transactions, some buyers are finding that owners cannot be squeezed on prices anymore; others have found a dearth of available homes in good locations. 
 Yet a look through real-estate classified advertisements makes clear that many sellers of both apartments and houses are still desperate for deals. "Priced to Sell," "Owner Anxious," and "No Reasonable Offer Refused" were the come-ons some sellers used in their newspaper advertisements on a recent Sunday.
In Manhattan, for instance, there is a premium on family-sized apartments, priced between $200,000 and $250,000, especially those in buildings that were put up before World War II and have doormen. Since the year began, the most sales activity for Manhattan co-ops was seen in that price range, according to the Real Estate Board of New York.
But for studios and run-of-the-mill one-bedroom apartments, bank foreclosure auctions seem to be the only enticing bait.
In the suburbs, town houses in condominium developments are still a hard sell. But real-estate brokers say owners who have not priced their homes above the market and who live in neighborhoods with highly rated schools often have buyers waiting in line.
And while sellers have found the market a bit topsy-turvy, buyers are finding their expectations confounded by the new realities. Sean Kiely, who wants to move his family from Yonkers to Scarsdale or Eastchester, says he has seen a steady decline in the number of available homes in his price range -- up to $350,000.
"It's gotten to the point where brokers are beginning to take me to places I have already seen," said Mr. Kiely, who has passed on many homes he felt were not worth the money.
The partial recovery, real-estate brokers say, reflects a renewed faith among buyers in the economy and in their own financial situations. The recent increases in mortgage interest rates have been a further prod for many buyers who worry that the rates could go even higher. But if they do rise much further, potential buyers could be forced to the sidelines.
Statistics provided by industry trade groups reflect the inconsistency of the market.
In Westchester County, the median price of single-family homes has inched up a bit, to $279,500 in the first quarter of this year from $271,350 in the same period of 1993, according to the local Board of Realtors. But during the same time, co-ops lost value, dropping to a median of $71,000 from $75,000. The median price is a middle value, with half of the sales prices above the median and half below.
In Manhattan the Real Estate Board of New York reported that values for co-ops on the Upper West Side were 24 percent higher during the first quarter of 1994 than in the first quarter of 1993. But for reasons the board cannot explain, on Riverside Drive and West End Avenue the median price dropped to $388,556 during the first quarter of 1994 from $414,875 in the first quarter of 1993.
On the East Side of Manhattan, the board figures showed, the median price for co-ops increased 12 percent between the last quarter of 1993 and the first quarter this year. Yet prices for the first quarter of 1994 were 13 percent lower than for the same period in 1993.
For years, the region's real-estate market was essentially frozen, with many potential sellers refusing to take losses on property they bought when the market was high, and buyers fearful of putting money into homes they might not be able to sell.
 
Voracious Appetite
 This created a pent-up demand that brought buyers out in droves last winter, despite the region's record snow storms. In part, brokers said, the money driving the market came from New Year's bonuses from Wall Street and other industries that have seen good years recently.
"I can only describe the appetite of buyers last winter as voracious," said Bud Prince, a partner in Prince & Ripley, a real-estate brokerage company in Rye, N.Y. Mr. Prince said he brokered one deal last winter in which a potential buyer was so anxious to be first in line to bid on a house that he made an offer even though he had not set foot inside in 10 years.
"He had seen the house the last time it was on the market," Mr. Prince said. "He was sorry he did not buy it then."
That same sort of appetite may have been at work in Trish Hogan's neighborhood in Summit, N.J. After accepting a job in Virginia earlier this year, she told her new employer not to expect her until summer, figuring she might need a few months to sell her home. But the week after her open house in February, Ms. Hogan watched with amazement as a bidding war broke out. When the dust settled, Ms. Hogan got $507,000 for her three-bedroom Colonial -- $18,000 more than her asking price.
The five-bedroom red-brick house next door is under contract for $579,000, the asking price, and the owners of a three-bedroom English Tudor nearby have a deal close to their asking price of $549,000. "Summit is a great community," Ms. Hogan said before leaving for Virginia. "I knew I'd find a buyer. But I thought the economy would make it harder for me to sell."
Marcia Miller, on the other hand, who owns a four-bedroom Colonial in the Westchester County community of Crestwood, has had no such luck. Since January dozens of prospective buyers have seen the house, but so far there have been no serious bids on the $249,000 price she and her roommate are seeking. "We didn't necessarily expect it to be easy," she said, "but we thought we would have some offers by now."
One thing that has surprised brokers has been what they say is a significant demand from families who want to stay in the city -- or even to come back again after having moved away earlier.
"Two years ago many of our listings came from families trying to get out of New York," said Jo Anne Kennedy, a principal in Hunt Kennedy, a brokerage company in Manhattan. "People are still moving away, but there is not this desperate desire to leave the city as there was before."
She credits the election of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani as a factor in the turnaround because buyers believe he has made the middle class a priority.
One family moving back to the city is Edward and Leslie Powers and their children, who moved from Manhattan six years ago to live in Caldwell, N.J. After selling their home the weekend it was put on the market, the couple saw dozens of apartments before settling on one in a prewar building on the Upper West Side. Even then, they almost lost their apartment to another couple in a bidding war. Mr. Powers declined to say how much he and his wife paid, but two-bedroom apartments like theirs are selling for $369,000, according to the Real Estate Board.
In the city, the market's wallflowers continue to be mainly dark and dreary studio apartments and most of the thousands of charmless one-bedroom units that went up during the 1980's building boom. For several consecutive Sundays, Taylor Hanex watched potential buyers poke around the studio she is trying to sell on West 69th Street. Despite a price cut, from $92,000 to $85,000, she has had barely a ripple of interest.
The paradox for Ms. Hanex and others in her situation is that as a rental, her apartment has held its value. She has been able to get as much as $1,350 a month for her apartment, which is completely furnished, but her co-op limits renting to two years. She has run out of time.
Foreclosure auctions continue to be magnets for bottom fishers. Celestina Dadzie emerged from an auction last month with a $120,000 contract for a two-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath apartment on York Avenue with views of the East River. In that neighborhood, some sellers are asking $200,000 and more for similar apartments.
"I've been looking for years," said Ms. Dadzie. "I kept hearing that prices were dropping and the market was bad. But I did not see anything I thought was worth the money."
While many real-estate agents and executives view the current changes with optimism, they do not believe the market is headed toward its giddy heights of a decade ago.
"Even in categories where the market is very strong, buyers and sellers seem to be more realistic," said Christopher Thomas, a vice president of William B. May, a real-estate company. "Sales are faster because both sides are close when it comes to prices," said Mr. Thomas, who is based in Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope.
Not all sellers would agree.
Cheryl Dent, who put her four-story limestone row house on the market for $250,000, said the first offers were so low as to be "insulting."
"One couple offered $150,000," said Mrs. Dent whose house is on a landmarked block in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. But Ms. Dent held her ground. Last month she signed a contract to sell it for $230,000.
"These homes are the kinds of places they are not building anymore," said Ms. Dent, who has a home furnishing design business. "People appreciate that. You just have to wait until they come along."

HEADLINE: How Low the Dollar?;
U.S. Wants Currency to Reach Own Level To Help Economy and Clinton's Re-election

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration keeps insisting that its decision to let the dollar reach its own level is the right one, even though currency traders plainly do not: the dollar has sunk by one-sixth against the German mark this year and reached a postwar low against the Japanese yen.
Strikingly, though, President Clinton is winning points from economists who are more concerned about jobs and corporate profits than the number of yen or marks that a dollar will buy next Tuesday. The White House's "rhetoric has been a heck of a lot worse than its policy," said Peter Kenen, an economist at Princeton University. 
 In fact, said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, what has been dubbed President Clinton's "benign neglect" of exchange rates is an evolving policy intended to serve both the American economy and the President's prospects for re-election. "The average person could care less about the dollar's decline," he said.
 
Above the Record Low
 On Friday, the dollar fell to 97.86 yen in late New York trading, though still above the record low of 96.60 yen set on Tuesday. The dollar was little changed at 1.554 marks.
If exchange rates could be stabilized without pain or fuss, the industrial countries would no doubt choose to stabilize their currencies at exchange rates that reflected their competitiveness in world markets -- rates that make the dollar worth more, the yen and the mark, less. That is what they have tried to do half-heartedly for the last month, purchasing tens of billions of dollars on the currency markets.
But the intervention has not worked, and for reasons that (after the fact) seem obvious. With corporations and investment institutions holding trillions of dollars worth of liquid assets that can be turned into other currencies at the touch of a computer key, the sums necessary to turn the stampeding herd have become staggering.
Indeed, Mr. Kenen said, it is now conventional wisdom that currency market intervention is effective only when it is reinforced by changes in underlying economic policies. For example, a Government-engineered rise in America's short-term interest rates combined with reductions in rates available in German marks might accomplish what buying dollars and selling marks did not.
 
Reason for Every Country
 Why, then, didn't the Group of Seven choose this route? For reasons peculiar to each of the major economies, said Van Doorn Ooms, research director of the Committee for Economic Development in Washington. All of this boils down to the reality that exchange rate stability is nobody's highest priority.
Arguably, Washington should be under the most psychological pressure to act since the dollar is the weak link in the currency chain. But as Mr. Hormats said, the howls for higher interest rates from Wall Street are more than offset by the White House's conviction that higher rates would undermine domestic policy.
America's economic recovery, it is widely agreed, is on track. But few of the President's men and women would be happy to risk another interest rate increase that would cut into private spending sometime in 1995.
Inflation is, of course, a concern to some. And the depressed value of the dollar does translate into higher prices for imports and American-made goods that compete with imports. But with foreign products and services representing just 10 percent of American consumption and the Consumer Price Index climbing at a leisurely 3 percent pace, no one in the White House sees inflation as a clear and present danger.
Indeed, some increases in prices could buttress the President's re-election campaign. Thanks to the high-flying Japanese yen (which makes Toyota and company less competitive in American markets), the Big Three auto makers will set profit records this year. And what's good for Detroit is good for those on its payroll. Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich has bragged that since the start of President Clinton's tenure, some 150,000 jobs had been created in the auto industry.
What's good for American producers, of course, is bad for their European and Japanese competitors. That, in fact, is why currency speculators figured that Washington had quietly abetted a decline in the value of the dollar after the collapse of trade talks with Japan last spring. Why, then, don't Europe and Japan fill the void left by the passive Americans, depreciating their own currencies through interest rate cuts or fiscal stimulus?
Mr. Kenen said that Europe (dominated by Germany) had yet to feel sufficient economic pinch to act. The European Union is growing, though with less vigor than the American economy. And German policy makers who wish to stimulate output in general and exports in particular still have less influence than the conservatives who control monetary policy at the central banks.
"The Europeans," Mr. Ooms said, "have learned to live with very high unemployment."
Japan is the more puzzling case since the overvalued yen seems destined to price Japanese companies out of world markets -- and price the Japanese economy back into recession. But the crazy-quilt political coalition now in charge seems unable to act decisively in the face of opposition from the inflation-obsessed bureaucracy at the Ministry of Finance. As Mr. Kenen puts it, "nobody's there to answer the phone."
All this suggests that currency neglect, benign or otherwise, is the order of the day. Does it also mean there is no bottom in sight for the dollar? While "currency speculation is self-limiting," Mr. Ooms said, there is no solid theory to explain when the brakes will catch. In fact the only circumstance in which almost everyone agrees that currency intervention would be inevitable is the "free fall" -- in which the dollar's use as a global store of value and means of exchange is threatened.
If speculation fed speculation -- if, for example, the dollar fell by another 10 or 15 percent in a matter of weeks -- the Group of Seven would most likely halt the process with coordinated changes in interest rates backed by huge purchases of dollars.
But the very fact that most experts assume that the free fall would bring on decisive intervention makes free fall very unlikely. Hence for the foreseeable future, Mr. Hormats predicted, "Main Street's interests will diverge from Wall Street's," and the dollar's exchange value will remain a low priority.

Nagging liquidity questions put a damper on T.W.A.'s stock.

BYLINE: By Adam Bryant 

 BODY:
DONALD F. CRAIB Jr., the chairman of Trans World Airlines, has made good on several predictions he made when he took over in January, save for a crucial one: the company has had to seek additional capital, despite Mr. Craib's statement that it would not need to do so.
And it is the specter of a liquidity crisis at the nation's seventh-largest airline, raised recently in reports by the Standard & Poor's and Duff & Phelps credit rating agencies, that has weighed heavily on the airline's stock price in recent weeks. T.W.A. has missed out on the modest rebound of several airline stocks recently, and many industry analysts are skeptical about its future. 
 "There are too many airlines, and T.W.A. is a vulnerable franchise," said Kevin C. Murphy, an airline stock analyst at Morgan Stanley.
T.W.A.'s shares were unchanged on Friday at $2.6875 on the American Stock Exchange.
The airline certainly cannot be accused of sitting still. Since January, for example, the chairman and two vice chairman of T.W.A. have been replaced.
On Thursday, the company said it had "empowered a companywide task force to remake the airline."
T.W.A. employees, who own a 45 percent stake in the carrier after giving up $660 million in concessions over three years, also said recently that they would cover lease payments on a jet the carrier wanted to add to its fleet.
The airline's new president, Jeffrey H. Erickson, said he was halfway through his goal of cutting $135 million from the company's expenses to insure it had enough cash to make it through the winter.
T.W.A. recently laid off 255 employees at its aircraft overhaul base in Kansas City, Mo., and said it might lay off several more hundred by the end of the year.
Despite the cuts, the airline said it expected to expand its route system by 10.9 percent by the end of the year, fulfilling one of Mr. Craib's early promises. Mr. Craib also said he would foster a sense of urgency at the airline and involve employees more in the company's day-to-day operations.
The challenge Mr. Erickson faces is to cut costs without hurting revenues. In a recent interview, he said he was also trying to refinance $190 million of asset-based loans extended by Carl C. Icahn, the airline's former owner, that come due in January.
If it does not fulfill those goals, "T.W.A. could face a liquidity shortfall during the winter of 1994-1995," Standard & Poor's said in a recent report.
In a recent Duff & Phelps report, the agency said it did not believe the airline would be able to obtain additional financing like a revolving line of credit because of its "current capital structure, poor operating performance and limited prospects in an industry characterized by overcapacity."
In the first quarter, T.W.A.'s revenues increased 8.2 percent, to $760.6 million from $702.7 million, after the airline increased its capacity 8 percent. Its operating loss narrowed to $79.6 million in the quarter, from $93.4 million.
Its cash position at the end of the first quarter was $134.9 million, compared with $170.4 million in the quarter a year earlier. At the end of 1993, the airline's cash position was $163 million.
If a cash shortage at T.W.A. sounds at all familiar, it should. Industry analysts have been predicting since 1992 that the airline would not make it through the following winter.
And like T.W.A. executives before him, Mr. Erickson, the former chief executive of Reno Air, dismisses predictions of the carrier's demise.
"We can accomplish what we need to accomplish," he said. "Otherwise, I wouldn't have joined the company."

HEADLINE: Shipbuilding Pact Reached Amid French Protest

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: PARIS, July 17

 BODY:
Major shipbuilding nations agreed today after five years of negotiations to scrap subsidies to their shipyards, but France rejected the deal, negotiators said.
The accord between officials of the United States, the European Union, Japan, Korea and the Nordic states was hammered out at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and is seen as the widest plan yet to impose discipline on the ailing industry, delegates said. 
 "If we had failed there would have been a subsidy war, that is quite clear," said the Swedish Ambassador to the Paris-based organization, Staffan Sohlman, who was chairman of the final round of the talks.
The unsigned agreement must be ratified by all participants and would take effect on Jan. 1, 1996, he said. It would be reviewed three years later.
But France swiftly divorced itself from the pact and made clear it would oppose it inside the European Union, delegates said. Union member nations were represented at the talks by the Brussels-based European Commission.
France's opposition came in a statement read to a special final session by a French delegate, who went to the organization's headquarters after Paris tried unsuccessfully to have the proceedings adjourned.
Details were not made public, but one delegate said, "The French are not behind the agreement."
Paris argues that scrapping subsidies would harm it against competitors, including some European Union partners, who indirectly aid the ship industry in ways that France cannot, officials said.
Several delegates said the question of jobs at France's two big shipyards, Saint-Lazaire and Le Havre, appeared to be particularly sensitive a year before presidential elections.
France alone could not stop a qualified majority vote in the European Council of Ministers, except by invoking the "Luxembourg Compromise," a GATT-related formula seen as a powerful but possibly contentious tool, diplomats said.
The issue could be raised as early as Monday, when the union's General Affairs Council meets in Brussels.
Meanwhile, delegates highlighted the ambitious scope of the draft shipbuilding accord, described by a United States official as "much more comprehensive than any other sectoral agreement."
If ratified, it would be the first legally binding international trade pact ever negotiated by the organization, normally a sedate economic research center for industrialized nations.
The accord came almost exactly 24 hours after the United States and the European Commission, in an all-night session, buried differences over the Jones Act, which bans foreign-built or foreign-owned ships from United States coastal trade.
Long decried as unfair by Europeans, and regarded as politically sacred in the United States, the act will remain in place, delegates said. But unspecified countermeasures will be available if it is shown to be misused.
A proposal before Congress to fine subsidized ships on entry would also probably be sidelined, they said.
The 100-page deal includes the first "injurious pricing" code for the ship industry, drawn up in response to European concerns over Japanese and Korean pricing and regarded as a quid-pro-quo for the abolition of subsidies, delegates said.
It also overhauls dispute settlement procedures and creates a new procedure for export credits, they added.
But the effect on shipyard jobs as subsidies decline remains less clear. "To the extent that the agreement leads to a more stable situation, it should make jobs, if not more secure, then less influenced by fluctuations," Mr. Sohlman said.
Other delegates acknowledged that less competitive yards might have to close without state support, but said a price free-for-all would be worse.
"The point is that we'll at last have a reasonably level playing field," one negotiator said.

HEADLINE: Telmex in Competition, So Far With Just Itself

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO

 BODY:
It took a four-mule team to carry supplies to the top of the 6,000-foot mountain where a crew from Telefonos de Mexico built a relay station that only recently connected this desert mining town to Mexico's telephone network.
Telefonos de Mexico, or Telmex, as it is known, has little chance of making money in this town of 1,500 separated by 10 miles of desert and a craggy mountain range from the United States border. The town is too isolated and too small for profitable service. 
 Yet Telmex has been adding or improving service anyway in towns like this all across Mexico, because in return, this national telecommunications company -- until 1990, a state-owned enterprise -- was allowed to keep its monopoly on long-distance service, at least until the end of 1996.
 
Open Market Planned
 But with the end of that monopoly growing nearer every day, Telmex has learned -- to its dismay -- that the Government is planning a telecommunications market that will be more wide open than the company had expected. Regulators now say that there will be no limit to the number of competing companies that can enter the long-distance market.
 While the Government plan should benefit consumers by making calls cheaper, it will deprive Telmex of some revenue, and Telmex stock has fallen from earlier this year.
Still, most brokerage houses aggressively rate the company's stock a buy. The potential for growth is enormous. As the North American Free Trade Agreement encourages trade and development, the need for modern telecommunications will increase substantially over the next decade.
Telmex knows this market better than any potential competitor, and investors are impressed with its successes in improving local service. To add to Telmex's attractiveness, the company will keep its local-service monopoly until 2026.
"The theme is perfect," said Ricardo Peon, a telecommunications analyst with the Baring Securities office in Mexico City. "You've got Nafta, very low line density, rising per capita income -- all the perfect ingredients for strong telecommunications growth."
That of course is a prime reason that nearly every major telecommunications company in North America is interested in a piece of the long-distance action. Already, more than a dozen companies, including Bell Atlantic, MCI and Motorola, have formed joint ventures with Mexican banks and telecommunications companies. AT&T, which already handles 60 percent of long-distance calls to the United States, is thought to be ready to join with Telmex in a separate long-distance subsidiary.
At stake are more than just the profits and losses of one of Mexico's largest companies. Because Telmex stock accounts for 26 percent of the total capitalization of the Bolsa, the Mexican stock exchange, and 23 percent of its daily volume, even a rumor about disappointing earnings can cause the market to stumble.
Telmex is also important outside Mexico. The company's stock, through substitute paper called depository receipts, is usually among the most active issues traded on Wall Street. Since it was privatized in 1990, Telmex has served as one of Mexico's most reliable sources of foreign capital. Of the company's $33.5 billion capitalization, 60 percent is held by foreigners, mostly Americans.
 
A National Issue
 For Mexico, there is an even larger issue: how prepared is the nation to embrace open competition.
The privatization of Telmex in 1990, part of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's larger plan to modernize the Mexican economy, was one of the largest and most ambitious such efforts ever undertaken. Under a $1.76 billion contract, the Government sold its controlling stake in Telmex to a consortium comprising Southwestern Bell, France Telecom and Grupo Carso, a Mexican holding company owned by Carlos Slim Helu -- one of the richest men in Mexico, who soon became even richer.
Now Mexican regulators must decide how to enforce the privatization contract without harming Telmex and, by extension, the Mexican economy. They also have to figure out how to provide the competition that would help consumers with better service and lower rates without hurting Telmex's ability to fulfill its social obligations -- providing Manuel Benavides with phones, for example. Serving ordinary Mexicans has become more compelling since an armed rebellion shook the southeastern state of Chiapas early this year.
The rural program that just reached Manuel Benavides is one of Telmex's successes, and it illustrates how sensitive the regulators' decisions are likely to be.
Situated in a desert bowl surrounded by high mountains, Manuel Benavides is typical of the small communities bypassed by Telmex before the company was required to install at least one telephone in every town of 500 or more people before the end of 1994, as a quid pro quo for its six-year monopoly on long-distance service.
Until recently, said Baltazar Trujillo Chavez, a former mayor of Manuel Benavides, long-distance communication was possible only by shortwave radio.
 
Expensive Satellite Service
 In 1986, the state of Chihuahua hired a private company to install a satellite phone in Manuel Benavides, a service residents say was unreliable and quite expensive. With the new Telmex radio relay, the town will have three lines, much clearer connections and service that is significantly less expensive, said Gerardo Garza Varela, a Telmex engineer. If 100 residents are interested, Telmex may someday install home phones.
"We used to be an almost forgotten place, like many in Mexico," Mr. Trujillo said. "But with these new services, we can have a much more satisfactory life here."
For years, telling stories of Telmex's ineptitude and corruption was a favorite pastime throughout Mexico -- except in communities like Manuel Benavides that did not yet have telephones. Crossed lines, erratic service and bungled connections were for years the order of the day. Many public phones in downtown Mexico City are free because that is the only way to keep them from being vandalized by frustrated callers.
Some things have changed. Half the lines now in service in Mexico have been installed since 1990, and this year Telmex expects to put in 1.5 million more, at a cost to the consumer of about $600 a line. There is room to grow. Mexico has 8.8 phone lines per 100 inhabitants, far lower than the ratio of 51.5 per 100 in the United States, but a 33 percent rise over its 6.6 lines per 100 in 1990. Telmex has doubled the number of public pay phones, provided digital service on nearly 70 percent of its lines and built a national fiber optic network.
"They've generally met the conditions of the concession," said Gabriel Szekely, a Mexico City consultant who has studied Telmex operations for several years. "They've been doing the right things but doing them too slowly, considering they've got competition coming in."
 
Telmex Is Shocked
 The process of ending the long-distance monopoly started last year with a general proposal from Telmex, as Government regulations required. The potential competitors then had six months to review it and file objections. But to Telmex's shock, regulators from the Communications and Transportation Ministry rejected the Telmex plan for 10 interconnection points, through which all long-distance calls would have to pass no matter which company handled them. Instead, the regulators approved a plan for 200 such points, to be available by the year 2000.
The Telmex plan had obvious benefits -- for Telmex. All its long-distance competitors would have had to pay fees, based on time and distance, for the use of local telephone lines to the interconnection points. With 200 rather than 10 interconnection points, long-distance callers will be spending far less time on Telmex's local network, and Telmex's competitors spending far less on fees.
Regulators here said there would be no limit on the number of competing companies that can enter the long-distance market. But they did not set a date for selecting them. The issue is politically sensitive. Presidential elections are scheduled for Aug. 21, and for the first time in decades, the outcome is uncertain. The regulators did, however, authorize presubscription plans similar to those in the United States in which customers contract with a long-distance service for a set time.
Local service now makes up 43 percent of Telmex's $7.4 billion a year in sales, while long-distance calls generate more than half the company's revenues and much of its profits. Telmex has started preparing for competition, limiting its reliance on long-distance by lowering those rates and at the same time raising the cost of local calls.
"In the long run, what's best for efficiency is best for the economy," said Santiago Levy Algazi, head of the newly created National Commission on Competition.
But is stiff competition best for Telmex? "Maybe yes," Mr. Levy said, "maybe no."

HEADLINE: DANCE REVIEW;
A Bawdy and Comic Thai Troupe

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING 

 BODY:
The performers of the Pathumsilp Troupe of Phetburi, Thailand, find work by hanging out their sign in the courtyard of the city temple and waiting for patrons to come by. It is hard to imagine they are unemployed for long, given the irresistibly goofy humor and quick improvisatory skills the company displayed in a program of Lakhon Chatri, one of Thailand's oldest forms of dance-drama, on Saturday night at the Asia Society.
After three short traditional music and dance introductions, the troupe presented selections from "Phra Apaimani," which tells the story of a prince with a magic flute and his escape from a seductive sea-demon that once kidnapped him and wants him back. A burst of flute music eventually does in the demon, who dies with all the gurgling pathos of Margaret Hamilton in "The Wizard of Oz." The story then switches to a boy's attempts to save his mermaid mother from a lustful pirate. 
 Lakhon Chatri is performed by groups who travel through the Thai countryside, their services in demand as payment to the gods for favors received by grateful supplicants. The relatively modern style presented by the Pathumsilp company draws on traditional Buddhist tales, but departs from them with vernacular, often bawdy comic embellishment.
The selections from "Phra Apaimani" incorporated jokes about New York's high-rise buildings, french fries, Levi jeans and the air-conditioning in the Asia Society auditorium. One prop was a large plastic bottle of Coca-Cola. When the prince's traveling companion asked the demon for water to block his ears from the flute music, a musician ambled offstage and returned with a paper cup into which the demon pretended to urinate. The performers chatted with one another throughout, and one absent-mindedly used a handy prop to sweep a bit of debris from the floor.
One of the great charms of the evening, aside from the idea of such wild humor enlisted to appease the gods, was the way the performers and narrator frequently burst into infectious laughter over one another's antics. But this spirited play was clearly the work of trained and gifted actors and musicians who smoothly blended high chanting song, a simple gliding form of dance with palms upturned and undulating, and most of all, quick comic inspiration. Instrumentalists offered witty commentary and encouraging bursts of gleaming, lilting, raucous sound on drums, finger cymbals, wooden clappers and a wooden xylophone with a splendid musical life of its own.
Anucha Tang-on played a prince with long false eyelashes and blusher, and Pipila Tang-on was the delightfully shrewish demon. Pornthip Boonnung was the hyperactive son, Charan Chaithong the demure mermaid and Boontham Kaewprasit the determined pirate. But the show was almost stolen by Khanittha Chantrarasuk, whose nonchalant clowning in a variety of roles seemed to embody the tradition of Lakhon Chatri. Surapone Virulrak was the wry narrator. The troupe, which is directed by Temduang Wanna, also included Janya Kalnin and Chamroen Kerdrod.

HEADLINE: The German Special Relationship

 BODY:
Germany marked the passing of an era last Tuesday with the departure of U.S. troops from Berlin and the formal end of four-power occupation. President Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl stood side by side at the Brandenburg Gate, where the Berlin wall once divided and disfigured the city. Germany's highest court that very day confirmed that the country's Constitution poses no impediment to involving German troops in military operations abroad. That is reassuring for those who believe Germany needs to carry its weight in securing Europe.
But the issues of America's troop presence and Germany's military role have obscured the changed relationship between the two countries. Once Germany was militarily dependent on NATO and deferred to American wishes; now the two cooperate as equals with common interests. 
 Those interests are now more economic than military. Both countries -- unlike much of Western Europe -- see the need to open markets to struggling economies in the East and to integrate all the East and West politically. As President Clinton said in Berlin, "trade, as much as troops," will bind nations in the next century.
The U.S. commitment to German security remains firm, though its importance has declined with the Soviet Union's demise. Continued cooperation between the countries is still essential, however, to deal with today's security concerns -- instability in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union resulting from traumatic economic and political transformation.
German troops must play their part; Germany is now a normal nation capable of sharing the security burden.
German politicians had hidden behind the Constitution whenever the question of committing troops abroad came up. But the real impediments remain historical and political. They accounted for the reluctance to join the coalition against Iraq: Germany did not want to give any sign of military assertiveness at the time of unification. Later, Germany hastened to recognize the independence of Croatia and Slovenia, which was right. But Germany was irresponsible to urge others to stand up to Serbia while it was inhibited from taking its own advice by its World War II legacy.
Now that the court has said a majority vote of Parliament will suffice to send troops abroad, the political impediment remains. No German government is likely to plunge ahead without a sizable majority and strong international approval, and Germany is likely to confine itself to peacekeeping.
But Germany's military contribution may be less important to future German-American relations than the economic and political commitments it shares with the United States.
Both countries have a stake in promoting the East's recovery by giving it access to Western markets. Both want to see Europe's political culture and security community extended eastward to Russia. Neither can afford a resumption of Russo-German rivalry over Eastern Europe. Together, they could reassure Russia and its neighbors; that means finding new ways to work with Moscow on security matters. Those shared values make the German-American relationship special.

HEADLINE: DIALOGUE: Arsenals Abroad;
Export Control For the 1990's

BYLINE: By Sam Gejdenson and Toby Roth; Sam Gejdenson, Democrat of Connecticut, and Toby Roth, Republican of Wisconsin, are members of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Policy, Trade and Environment.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The United States' system for controlling sales of technology abroad was built in the cold war, a time when the U.S. and its allies dominated export markets and controlled critical technologies. That world no longer exists. As Congress begins debate this week on a new Export Administration Act to replace the one that expired in June, it has a chance to transform the system from a cold war relic into one that responds to the security needs and economic challenges of the 1990's.
The stakes are high. The Export Administration Act governs the export of "dual use" goods and technologies -- computers, telecommunications equipment, machine tools, electronics, aerospace products and other commercial items that can also have military applications. These are our most technologically advanced industries. They offer high-wage, high-skilled jobs. Growth in these job-creating sectors depends on exports. If export controls are poorly conceived, these sectors -- and U.S. competitiveness -- will suffer. 
 Our bill would reshape the system in three ways. First, it would toughen U.S. policies to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, perhaps the most serious national security threat in the post-cold-war era. Second, it would reduce unnecessary and burdensome controls on exports to friendly countries. Third, it would set new deadlines to eliminate export licensing delays that harm U.S. exporters and U.S. workers.
 To meet the threat of proliferation, the bill would prohibit the export of any item that an exporter knows would contribute to the design, development or manufacture of a weapon of mass destruction or a missile, even if the item was not on any international export control list. This would be the most far-reaching provision of its kind ever enacted. The bill would block the sale of dual-use technology to terrorist countries. No item that could be used in nuclear, chemical, biological or even conventional warfare could be sold to Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya or North Korea. This would be the most restrictive export control ever imposed on countries that support terrorism.
 We should not, however, treat our allies the same way we treat terrorist countries. To remove unnecessary burdens on U.S. exporters, the bill would allow American businesses to sell high-technology items without licenses as long as the foreign buyer participated with the U.S. in an export control agreement. For example, computers could be sold to Britain and machine tools to Japan without first coming to the U.S. Government.
 This provision simply recognizes reality. The European Union will soon abolish export licensing among its members, and this provision would allow U.S. business to operate on a level playing field with foreign competitors. It would also provide an incentive for other countries to sign up: they could receive our exports much more quickly.
 The bill would cut back on U.S. reliance on unilateral export controls, which in today's world are rarely successful in keeping technology from nations that are determined to get it. As the National Academy of Sciences put it in a 1991 report, "Unilateralism disadvantages the U.S. economy and can rarely be justified in a competitive world economy by security concerns."
 The U.S., for example, recently imposed unilateral sanctions on China for its sale of missile technology to other countries. The effect was to prohibit American companies from selling communications satellites to China, jeopardizing thousands of jobs in California, a state hard hit by military spending cuts. After the U.S. action, Germany cinched a deal for $1.5 billion in satellite sales to China. The Chinese got their satellites, the Germans got their windfall and U.S. workers could now get pink slips.
 While reducing reliance on unilateral controls, the bill would preserve the President's ability to impose unilateral controls when our national security was at stake and when unilateral controls were likely to achieve their objectives.
 The bill would also expedite licensing. American companies suffer a competitive disadvantage because of endless bureaucratic infighting. Three years after President George Bush approved a license for a supercomputer sale to India, for example, the license was still stalled in the bureaucracy -- and India has now replicated the 11-year-old technology. No wonder U.S. companies have a reputation for being unreliable suppliers. To correct this problem, the bill would require that all licenses be processed in 40 days or less, leaving plenty of time for interagency review.
 Export control policy must be changed to reflect reality, to meet new security threats and competition for world markets. By passing a strong measure this summer, Congress can improve our nonproliferation efforts -- and our living standards.

HEADLINE: DIALOGUE: Arsenals Abroad;
Proliferation In Disguise

BYLINE: By Gary Milhollin and Gerard White; Gary Milhollin is director and Gerard White assistant director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
This week the House takes up a bill that would make it easier for terrorist nations to build nuclear weapons, chemical weapons and the missiles to deliver them. The fateful debate will focus on the sale of strategic technology -- items like the high-tech furnaces, presses and machine tools that almost gave Saddam Hussein an atomic bomb.
The bill, whose chief sponsor is Representative Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut, would leave U.S. controls no stronger than those of Germany, Switzerland and Italy, the main suppliers of Iraq's nuclear, chemical and missile plants. The stated goal is to protect American exporters from unfair competition; instead, the bill would end American leadership in export control. 
 Since World War II, U.S. strategy has been to adopt strong controls first and then persuade other countries to follow. Mr. Gejdenson's bill would allow such unilateral controls only for six months -- too short a time for diplomacy to work. The controls could be extended but only if the President determined, among other things, that "no other means" could stop proliferation.
The Pentagon and other national security agencies would be squeezed out of export regulation; power would shift to the Commerce Department, whose main job is to promote exports, not regulate them. Mr. Gejdenson also wants to shorten the time allowed to decide on export license applications from 120 days to 30 days -- a step the Administration has said "would preclude meaningful review."
The sponsors boast that the bill would be the strongest prohibition ever enacted against exports to countries like Iraq and North Korea. But U.S. regulations have barred sales to these countries for years. The problem is that by loosening controls on exports to everyone else, the bill makes it easier for terrorist nations to buy U.S. goods abroad.
To garner support, exporters and their Congressional allies are peddling a set of myths. The cold war is over, they say, so export controls are becoming obsolete. But regional tensions are growing and so are appetites for weapons of mass destruction. As James Woolsey, the Director of Central Intelligence, said at his confirmation hearings last year, "We have slain a large dragon, but we live now in a jungle filled with a bewildering variety of poisonous snakes."
Another myth is that dropping export controls would create jobs. Only $10 billion worth of high-technology products -- less than two-tenths of 1 percent of the U.S. economy -- even go through export licensing. And the total value of exports denied under the existing controls is about $700 million a year -- less than half the price of a B-2 bomber. Gutting export controls would stimulate bomb making, not the U.S. economy.
Supporters say that too many exports are subject to controls. In fact, the Commerce Department has been steadily cutting back on the number of items it screens for export licenses; only a tenth as many items are controlled now as in 1989, and the department is cutting its staff. Export controls are but a shadow of what they were before the cold war; now the exporters want to get rid of the shadow.
Mr. Gejdenson's measure would encourage the Commerce Department to drop items from the list of controlled products as soon as they were superseded by an improved version. But "obsolete" technology can still be deadly. After the Persian Gulf war, U.N. inspectors discovered that Iraq had nearly made an atomic bomb using calutrons, a primitive technology that the U.S. abandoned in the 1940's. It is no consolation to be killed by a bomb made with obsolete equipment.
In April, the General Accounting Office reported that the Government had approved more than 1,500 nuclear-related exports from 1985 to 1992 to countries "involved or suspected of being involved in nuclear proliferation activities." A military buyer in Pakistan got two high-tech grinding machines "capable of manufacturing critical nuclear weapon components," even though the U.S. Government knew the buyer was involved in "the design, manufacture, or testing of nuclear weapons."
Instead of fighting export controls, U.S. manufacturers should welcome them; they protect companies' reputations by keeping dangerous goods out of the wrong hands. Which U.S. company would like to have seen its logo on the Russian- and German-supplied Scud missiles that hit Tel Aviv?
Officials at the United Nations have told us that they expect the embargo on Iraqi oil to be lifted next spring. The petrodollars will revive Mr. Hussein's procurement network. If Representative Gejdenson's bill passes, the companies whose products showed up in Iraqi bomb factories last time could see them there again. Mr. Gejdenson and his backers can then share the blame.

HEADLINE: REBELS IN RWANDA CALL A CEASE-FIRE; EXODUS CONTINUES

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GOMA, Zaire, July 18

 BODY:
The rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front announced a cease-fire today and declared victory in its four-year battle against the Government. But representatives of relief agencies said they still faced another huge surge of refugees.
"We have captured all of Rwanda up to the French protection zone and a cease-fire is effectively in place," the rebel leader, Paul Kagame, said today in Kigali, the capital. French troops have carved out an area in southwestern Rwanda to offer a haven for civilian refugees. 
 "There is no need for anyone to flee Rwanda," he said, according to The Associated Press. "We guarantee all Rwandans stability and security." But he warned that there were some Rwandans who "can't forget they have a lot of blood on their hands and will have to answer for it."
International relief agencies had been pleading with the rebels for more than a week to declare a cease-fire, but the reaction to the announcement today was subdued. The cease-fire came only after the front's military operations had forced more than a million Rwandans to flee into Zaire, and relief agencies are exhausted in trying to cope.
No one expects the refugees to begin returning to Rwanda soon. Most are Hutu, members of the majority group, which dominated the Government, and they are convinced that if they go back they will be killed by Tutsi, who are now dominant.
And another refugee crisis looms. In the last 24 hours, more than 100,000 refugees have fled to Bukavu, Zaire, about 70 miles south of Goma and across the border from the French-patrolled area of southern Rwanda. Another half a million may be on the move toward Bukavu, relief officials here said.
"We do not need another exodus into the Bukavu area," said J. Brian Atwood, administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, who visited here today. "We could not handle that."
He noted that Bukavu is smaller and less developed than Goma, and "it remains to be seen if we can handle" the refugees in Goma.
"It is the most extraordinary thing I think I have ever seen in my life," said Mr. Atwood, who advises President Clinton on international disaster assistance, speaking at the French airbase here. The road past the airport was clogged with refugees trying to move north, where relief agencies hope to establish a camp.
"This is 1.2 million people looking desperately for food, for medicine, for care," he said. "That's more people than live in the cities of Boston or Denver, or Seattle or Baltimore."
For the first time in many days, the border crossing here was quiet. Fields near the border that had been jammed with refugees were empty. It was the silence of death.
In a field 50 yards east of the border, down by Lake Kivu, there was a large area of debris -- straw mats, gourds, an open umbrella, suitcases, clothes. There were several dead goats -- and 15 dead humans, most of them children. Several were naked. They were clustered together. They had been trampled to death, trapped between the lake and a high wall that protected an expensive two-story, lakeside house with a Mercedes Benz in the driveway.
Charles Cyirabo, 68 years old, found his 12-year-old grandson among the dead. As he picked through the rubble, Mr. Cyirabo, who was barefoot and wore a long coat that was torn and tattered, said he was looking for a shirt to wear. He also picked out a hoe. He would use it to dig a grave for his grandson, he said. A few weeks ago, when the rebels attacked his village, 18 members of his family were killed, Mr. Cyirabo said.
 
100 Trampled to Death
 Up the road, the bodies of at least 100 refugees were found on the Zaire side of the border. They had been trampled to death on Sunday when the thud of mortars and ferocious firefights caused panic among thousands of refugees packed into a small area. Next to one rock wall was the body of a woman lying on a straw mat where she had apparently been resting, unable to move before the surge.
On the other side of the wall were the bodies of at least 35 refugees, many of them children, who were camped in a garden with a large cactus and a mango tree when a mortar shell caught them. Next to the body of one woman was a tiny baby, still alive this morning.
There were others living among the dead this morning. They were in shock, their bodies shredded by mortar fragments, still breathing. People who had escaped the attack moved slowly and silently through the carnage, a scene out of Dante's hell.
 
Search for Mother's Milk
 Martin Rwagasore held his tiny 5-month-old daughter against his chest, wrapped in a goat skin. Her mother was among the dead under the cactus tree, where he had found his daughter. "I don't know what I am going to do," he said, as he tried to convince Red Cross workers to take the little girl. Another man searched about for a woman who might provide milk for his 2-month-old son, whose mother had been killed.
In the middle of the carnage, children were sobbing. "My parents sent me to get water," said a 13-year-old boy, wiping his eyes with the sleeve of a filthy, torn shirt. "Now I don't know where they are."
A Zairian Red Cross worker, Antoine Barumwete, walked along the dusty road leading five small children; one girl carried her brother on her back. "I found them on the road," Mr. Barumwete said. Asked how many children had become separated from their parents, he said, "There are so many it is impossible to know."
A man with a withered left leg dragged himself along the dirt road, past the dead and wounded and lost. In his right hand was his brace and a crutch. Farther ahead was another crippled woman who crawled along on her hands and knees.
A Red Cross truck could not take them. The Red Cross's mandate is to take care of war victims, and there were more of those today than the agency could handle.

HEADLINE: Clinton and Haiti: Domestic Issues Complicate Choice

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

 BODY:
As its showdown with Haiti's military leaders enters its tensest stage, the White House risks being besieged with problems on at least three major fronts.
The confluence will almost certainly make the month ahead the most perilous of President Clinton's term. With Congress bitterly divided over health care and Congressional hearings on the Whitewater case coming to a crest, his advisers say that Mr. Clinton probably cannot wait much longer before deciding whether to invade Haiti and roust the Caribbean nation's ruling junta. 
 The extent to which so much at the White House this summer is shaping up as a kind of carom shot has become apparent in the calculations of aides about how a decision on Haiti, for one, might affect the President's battle to get health care legislation through Congress before the Aug. 12 recess.
If the President ordered a military strike soon, one argument goes, it would steal so many headlines and so much attention that health care could only founder. A dissenting theory (sometimes advanced by the same aides) holds that success in Haiti could so enhance Mr. Clinton's stature that his uphill struggle in Congress might become more like coasting.
 
Health, Haiti, Whitewater
 Add to this mix the Congressional hearings on the Whitewater matter, which begin next week, and the agonizing has made for more than a little midsummer uneasiness.
"Health care is the one that we want to get done," one aide to Mr. Clinton said in diagramming the tangled midsummer agenda. "Haiti is the one that we have to get done. And Whitewater -- Whitewater is inevitable."
At least for now, officials say, questions about how to attack each of the problems have been compounded by anxiety and uncertainty within the White House about what further personnel changes will be made by Leon E. Panetta, the new chief of staff, who formally took charge yesterday.
Apart from Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the White House officials most directly responsible for leading the the day-to-day battles on the major fronts have been Mr. Panetta and his deputy, Harold M. Ickes, on health care; Lloyd N. Cutler, the White House counsel, and John D. Podesta, the White House staff secretary, on Whitewater; and Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, and his deputy, Samuel R. Berger, on Haiti.
 
Competing With Recess
 But the discussions until now have also involved a constellation of other officials, some of them in ill-defined roles. Several senior officials now say that Mr. Panetta will seek at least to make more precise the responsibilities assigned to senior advisers like Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the former chief of staff, and George Stephanopoulos, a sort of troubleshooter without portfolio who has been spread thin by the proliferation of troubles.
But even aides to Mr. Clinton respond uneasily when asked how the White House, which this time last year was devoting nearly all its energy to passing its economic plan, hopes to manage the three competing tides as Congress heads toward its Aug. 12 recess. "You just do the best you can," one senior official shrugged.
It has been evident since the year began that if the White House hoped to win passage of a health care plan this autumn, its first battles on the House and Senate floors would have to be fought before Congress left for the summer recess. Since March, when the Whitewater matter exploded into new public prominence, it has also been clear that Republican pressures will force Congressional hearings about it onto the midsummer calendar.
What has emerged as its most unexpected test has been the showdown with Haiti, which after an on-again, off-again unfolding appears to be approaching its most dangerous phase just when the White House would have preferred not to be distracted.
 
Little Time Is Bought
 By Sunday, the drop-off in the number of Haitian refugees taking to the seas appeared to be holding, a trend greeted with relief by officials who had regarded that human flow as the greatest source of pressure for quick American action. By denying boat people the right to seek asylum in the United States, one senior official said, the Administration bought some time by "demagnetizing" the lure most responsible for impelling Haitians to flee.
But no one was arguing that any time bought would be very long. After insisting for weeks that a decision whether to invade could be months away, Administration officials now cite increasing violence against Haitian civilians as the issue most likely to force Mr. Clinton to show his hand.
Administration officials still insist that the President has not decided whether to use force to oust Haiti's leaders. But now that the White House has spent its quiver of economic sanctions, few say they can envision an alternative to force if the ruling junta refuses to step down soon.
With pilgrimages to Capitol Hill and television studios and calculated disclosures in the press, it has also become apparent that the White House has begun an aggressive effort to build public and Congressional support for such an operation.
As Mr. Panetta was appearing on television to warn that the Administration could not "allow the status quo to eat us up" in Haiti, other senior White House officials were looking back with grim satisfaction on a week of television news coverage that gave prominence to scenes of brutality there.
"It's helped us," said one Administration official who advocates an invasion. Among other factors that may make it easier for Mr. Clinton to turn to military force more quickly, that official emphasized "the outrage" generated by Haiti's decision last week to expel United Nations human rights observers.
It is events in Haiti and not the President's calendar, his advisers insist, that will determine when and whether he will invade the Caribbean nation. Similarly, they say they are at the mercy of any Republicans who might seek to use the Whitewater hearings, which begin July 26, for personal attacks even at the height of the health care debate.
But in a month when each stream now appears likely to spill into the others, White House strategists are pondering how to prevent the cumulative flow from engulfing them.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE STATES;
Democratic Governors Avoid Mandates

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 18

 BODY:
One day before President Clinton is to address the National Governors' Association, Democratic members of the group today endorsed his goal of health insurance for all Americans but withheld their support for the centerpiece of his proposal, a requirement that employers pay most of the cost.
The Democratic Governors' Association did not say how it would finance health insurance for the 39 million Americans who have no coverage. Without being specific, the group supported efforts by Congressional leaders to find "an equitable and reliable financing mechanism." 
 White House officials who came here to lobby for the President's health plan welcomed a statement from the Democratic governors that endorsed the goal of "providing every American guaranteed health benefits that cannot be taken away."
Marcia L. Hale, assistant to the President for intergovernmental affairs, said: "They're for us. The Democratic governors passed a resolution in support of the President."
But the Democrats' silence on the employer mandate issue was not a good omen for the President or for the many Democrats in Congress who say that such a requirement is the only feasible way to guarantee health insurance coverage for all.
If Mr. Clinton, a former Governor of Arkansas, cannot win an endorsement of the employer mandate from Democratic governors, it is unclear how he can push such a proposal through the United States Senate.
Mr. Clinton would require employers to pay 80 percent of health insurance premiums for their workers, and he would give subsidies to small businesses with low-wage workers to help defray the cost.
 
Specter of Stalemate
 Governors of both parties, gathered here for the annual meeting of the National Governors' Association, said it was imperative for Congress to pass health care legislation this year.
Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, a Democrat who is vice chairman of the National Governors' Association, said he was gravely concerned about signs of intransigence on Capitol Hill as partisan lines harden on the issue. Mr. Dean said he had urged Democratic leaders in Congress to make "good-faith efforts at compromise."
Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr., a Republican who is chairman of the association, has offered similar advice to Republican leaders in Congress.
 
Same Party, Different Ideas
 In an interview, Mr. Dean said, "The employer mandate splits Democratic governors." He proposed such a mandate for Vermont as part of an ambitious Clinton-style health plan, but the proposal died this year in the State Legislature.
Gov. Evan Bayh of Indiana, chairman of the Democratic Governors' Association, said the employer mandate was one way to achieve universal coverage. But he added, "I haven't reached a conclusion yet in my own mind" as to whether it is the best way to achieve that goal.
President Clinton and Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, are scheduled to address the national governors' group on Tuesday.
Gov. Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania and Gov. Mike Lowry of Washington, both Democrats, said that they, like Mr. Dean, supported a requirement that employers pay for health benefits for their workers.
But four other Democratic governors here -- Ben Nelson of Nebraska, Jim Folsom of Alabama, Bruce King of New Mexico and Mike Sullivan of Wyoming -- said in interviews that they opposed the idea.
The Governors of Tennessee, North Carolina and Missouri, all Democrats, expressed neutrality, ambivalence or cautious interest in an employer mandate, without endorsing the idea.
 
'Not Much on Mandates'
 Mr. King, who has been Governor of New Mexico for 12 of the last 24 years and is running for re-election, said: "We're not much on mandates. We'd rather do it with voluntary participation. The poor businessman already has enough problems trying to meet a payroll. Another mandate is not exactly what he's looking for."
Mr. Nelson said, "I don't favor an employer mandate, but I'm the first to admit that I don't have an alternative" to pay for universal coverage.
Mr. Sullivan said: "I oppose employer mandates. We have to be very careful what we impose on business as an additional burden."
Mr. Folsom said the major health care proposals now pending in Congress were "somewhat nebulous to the average voter in Alabama."
"It's not a high-priority issue among our voters back home," he added. "It doesn't get as high a priority as crime, education reform, jobs and economic development."
 
Views From the Fence
 Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina said of employer mandates, "I'm open to that idea as long as we don't hurt small-business people." But he said that education, crime and jobs had higher priority for him too.
Gov. Mel Carnahan of Missouri, who takes over next year as chairman of the Democratic Governors' Association, said he supported the President's goal of health care for all Americans but had neither endorsed nor opposed the employer mandate.
Governor Ned McWherter of Tennessee said he favored universal coverage, but added, "I don't know if I would go about doing it through mandates."
Gov. Joan Finney of Kansas, a Democrat, said that employers should make some contribution to the cost of health insurance for workers but that the 80 percent share proposed by Mr. Clinton was too large.

HEADLINE: Japan's New Prime Minister Promises a More Open Economy

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to the New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 18

 BODY:
The Japanese were cynical and angry three weeks ago when a Socialist became Prime Minister by joining forces with his party's longstanding conservative foes and ousting a reform coalition. But in his first policy address today, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama sought to reassure a wary public by abandoning the Socialists' opposition to the country's military and vowing to open the economy to a freer flow of goods.
Mr. Murayama, 70, who came into office with about the lowest public approval rating of any postwar Prime Minister, focused on persuading the public that his Government was interested in more than seizing power and that the Socialists' far-left policies were a thing of the past. 
 His odd coalition, he insisted during the address in Parliament, is committed to lowering the trade surplus, improving strained relations with the United States, cutting taxes, reducing astronomical consumer prices, giving the public freer access to information and cleaning up a political system that often looks, he said, like "some kind of underhanded scam."
"I intend to travel the road to reform no matter how difficult the path ahead may be," he said, trying to counter an impression that his Government, dominated by the conservative Liberal Democratic Party, may just defend the status quo.
The normally frumpy Mr. Murayama, once known for his loose-fitting pale blue suits and pale blue ties, delivered his spirited address in a smart dark blue suit accented by a wine-colored tie. He sought to deliver a reassuring message, promising continuity in Japan's foreign policies. But he did underscore a subtle but important shift.
Mr. Murayama abandoned the Socialist Party's traditionally anti-American stance and characterized the United States-Japan security treaty as the centerpiece of Japan's foreign policy.
He also apparently dropped his party's longstanding claim that the mere existence of Japan's military forces violates the Constitution, which prohibits the use of force for resolving international disputes.
He said he supported a military with "the necessary minimum defense capability."
Mr. Murayama also indicated that he had little interest in pursuing a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, at least in the short run, saying further discussions were necessary before Japan could make such a leap.
"We should strive not to be a powerful country, but to be a caring country," he remarked.
That policy is reminiscent of the cold war, when Japan kept a low profile in foreign affairs while focusing on building its economy. It also defies growing demands that Japan contribute more. The United States Senate recently adopted a resolution calling on Japan to make troops available for United Nations peacekeeping operations.
On one other issue, Mr. Murayama described a slight shift from the previous Government, which had urged big income tax cuts to stimulate consumption and lift the economy from a long recession. The previous Government also favored a large increase in a national sales tax to make up for the lost revenues.
Some economists, and the United States, oppose the sales tax increase, saying it would counter whatever benefits the income tax cuts would bring. Mr. Murayama hinted that the Government would enact the income tax cuts and get the economy out of its rut before pushing any increases in the sales tax.
Opposition politicians sought to paint the Murayama speech as a cynical effort to woo public support.
"Apparently he was attempting to change his policies almost overnight," said Motoo Shiina, a former Liberal Democrat and now an independent. "A man or a group that changes overnight like that can change again, anytime. People have to decide if that is the group they want representing Japan."

HEADLINE: Huge Water Project Would Supply Beijing By 860-Mile Aqueduct

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DANJIANGKOU, China

 BODY:
One of the largest public works projects ever conceived -- a plan to divert water from the huge reservoir here to Beijing 860 miles north -- has been proposed by China's Communist Party leadership to save the capital from perpetual drought in the next century.
Rivaling even the construction of the 1,500-mile-long Great Wall, in the words of one Government engineer, a huge aqueduct starting here in central China and running north to Beijing and Tianjin seems the only solution to maintaining China's capital as a center for industry, commerce and government. 
 But because the project would cost billions of dollars and would benefit a relatively small part of the Chinese population -- less than 10 percent -- it is certain to ignite debate among China's regional leaders competing for scarce budget resources.
 
Leaky Toilets Are Priority
 Southern provincial officials complain, as President Jiang Zemin did recently, that Chinese cities waste billions of gallons of water each year through poor conservation practices and leaky toilets. Conservation should be tried first, they say.
"If a country can send satellites and missiles into space, it should be able to dry up its toilets," the Chinese President complained last month, sending Communist Party cadres skittering to mount a nationwide campaign against makers of shoddy toilets.
The aqueduct's path across China would equal the distance from Washington, D.C., to the Mississippi River and it would deliver a volume of water each year -- almost 4 trillion gallons -- that is more than 7 times the volume used annually by New York City, and equal to nearly half that of Lake Mead behind Hoover Dam. This volume is twice as large as the amount delivered by California's largest water-diversion system.
During the late 1950's, 100,000 Chinese peasants, seized by the political fever of Mao Zedong's call to catch up with the West in the Great Leap Forward, muscled a mountain of stone to block one of the Yangtze River's largest tributaries here and build a dam that would control floods, generate electricity for China's modernization and irrigate the land into a new era of agriculture. They abandoned their farms, lived in mud huts and ate starvation rations for the glory of Communism.
 
Completing Great Leap
 But the Great Leap's economic flaws instead brought famine to China, killing tens of millions and scaling back huge projects like this one. The hills here remain denuded, stark evidence of the desperate years that followed.
The aqueduct project has rekindled the hopes of the local population that this dam, after it is raised another 50 feet to create a mighty new reservoir to feed a northbound aqueduct, will finally fulfill the expectations of the ill-fated Great Leap.
The aqueduct's enormous flow, contained in its manmade channel, will have to cross 219 rivers and streams along its path, including the Yellow River. To accomplish this, Chinese engineers are prepared to dig either a five-mile-long water tunnel under the Yellow River or erect an elevated aqueduct over it supported by 160 giant pylons.
 
Mao's Brainstorm
 Details of the plan for the water project, conceived by Mao Zedong on a trip down the Yangtze River in 1958, are to be presented to the Chinese leadership next spring and comes at a time when China is facing a huge bill for new building that is necessary to sustain its economic boom.
"Every province has its own very ambitious plans to build bridges and power plants and infrastructure and they are all competing for national resources," said Fan Gang, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
One Chinese official predicted real opposition when the water project is submitted to the National People's Congress, where party members can press regional claims against it.
"I think this project will be more politically complicated than the Three Gorges Dam," Mr. Fan said.
 
Taming the Yangtze
 The Three Gorges project, a 20-year, $10 billion undertaking, was approved after four years of contentious debate within the Communist Party leadership. It is the largest public works project in China today and is designed to tame the Yangtze River while also generating 17,000 megawatts of electricity. But it has drawn opposition from environmental groups inside and outside China because it will flood one of the most scenic river settings in the world.
The South-North Water Diversion project, as the aqueduct is formally known, would be the second largest national construction project. It would require a six-year effort to expand the reservoir to roughly the same size as that of the planned Three Gorges reservoir. The expansion would displace 225,000 people, mostly farmers, in Hubei and Henan provinces.
The rescue of northern China's two most important commercial and government centers represents a large and, so far, unfinanced liability threatening the pace of China's economic expansion. Moreover, half of China's 570 cities suffer serious water shortages and Communist Party officials estimate these shortages cost the country nearly $14 billion a year in lost economic output.
The water crisis in northern China is also an indicator of how China's environment is struggling under the demands placed on it by 1.2 billion people, demands that can only grow.
 
Political Order Threatened
 China's economic expansion coincides with its greatest surge in population, which is expected to peak at 1.6 billion to 1.7 billion in the third decade of the next century.
Any threat to China's ability to provide enough water for food production, job creation and overall economic growth is a threat to the established political order.
The plan for the aqueduct project underwent final design reviews late last year, and an initial cost estimate of $5 billion was tallied. But that is certain to grow, just as the Three Gorges estimate grew -- by a factor of 10 -- during its planning stages.
"This is a bottleneck for the development of the whole north China area," said Luo Xuliu, the chief engineer at the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission, where the aqueduct was designed.
 
As Crucial as Three Gorges
 "If they cannot get enough water supply through this bottleneck," he said at the commission's headquarters in Wuhan, "they will not be able to sustain rapid development."
"There are dissenting opinions," he conceded, but, he added: "This has to be looked at from the standpoint of the whole country. I personally believe that the significance of this project is no less than that of the Three Gorges in terms of its importance to the nation."
"Guangdong Province," he continued, "doesn't have coal, so the country has found ways to send coal from Shaanxi Province down south. The south in turn has water, so it should provide water."
In the last three years, a deepening drought, the worst in 30 years, has combined with a construction boom in the capital region to accelerate the rapid drain on the region's water reserves.
 
Day of Reckoning Nears
 Local reservoirs that once fed the agricultural belt outside Beijing have been cordoned off and dedicated to urban consumption. Farmers, meanwhile, have drilled deeper and deeper into diminishing ground water supplies to irrigate their fields.
Now, Beijing's top water expert says that a day of reckoning is almost here, though the drought was weakened by three days of heavy rain recently.
"The reserve storage of water will be used up in the next few years without effective water-saving measures with the prolonged scorching weather," said Teng Shutang, chief engineer at the capital's water conservancy bureau. After that, he said, "it will be a crisis" and the capital's economic development would come to a "standstill."
If nothing is done, Beijing's annual water deficit could exceed 250 billion gallons a year by 2010, a figure equal to half the current annual consumption.
Perpetual drought, shortage and rationing are images of life in Beijing that its leaders cannot afford as they market the Chinese capital region as a future home for multinational corporations, luxury hotels, shopping districts and housing developments to support an ever larger foreign community in a population of 12 million.
 
Water Table Is Sinking
 More than two million pipe wells have been sunk in northern China to exploit once plentiful ground water supplies, but progressive overuse that came with a doubling of population since 1949 has led to huge areas of ground subsidence, or the sinking of the earth, due to loss of underground water. The water table has been retreating at least one meter a year and in 1993, it dropped 1.73 meters, or 5 feet 8 inches.
The zones of ground depression in northern China now cover an area as large as Hungary.
Early water diversion projects focused on the Yellow River, whose waters spawned Chinese civilization 5,000 years ago. But demands on the Yellow River for agricultural irrigation have left its flow dangerously oversubscribed.
That left the Yangtze River and its major tributaries, like the Han River, which feeds the Danjiangkou reservoir.
 
3 Projects Designed
 Three engineering projects, each traversing different south-to-north routes, have been designed, and Chinese leaders will have to choose among them. The leading candidate from the engineers' standpoint is the one that begins here and is called the "middle" course.
With the source waters 300 feet higher than Beijing, the aqueduct would be all downhill to its destination and would be able to irrigate a swath of farmland larger than the state of South Carolina along the way.
With a minimum of six years needed to build the "middle course" aqueduct and its related structures, Mr. Teng and other Beijing officials fear a long, drawn-out national debate. The water storage in two smaller reservoirs at Miyun and Guanting that are now flowing into Beijing "will not last beyond 1999," he said, adding, "I wish this project could start as soon as tomorrow."
But a long debate is more likely. Some Chinese officials said they fear the country will violate the spirit of the old Chinese proverb:
"Don't wait until you're thirsty to start digging the well."

HEADLINE: Congressional Memo;
In Jargon-Filled Talk About Budgets, A Debate of Politics Over Substance

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18

 BODY:
People who have been listening to conservative talk radio recently or watching the House of Representatives on C-Span have heard an earful of exercised talk about expedited recissions and the A to Z budget plan and discharge petitions and lock boxes and closed rules.
These arcane terms may not make sense to the untrained ear, but it often sounds as if grave matters of public policy are at stake. One side makes it appear as if die-hard deficit hawks are battling the entrenched establishment to force a reduction in Federal spending. Those on the other side paint themselves as devoted lawmakers holding the line against radicals who would severely weaken the power of Congress to control the purse strings. 
 In fact, all this ventilating is much more about politics than it is about substance. This is what is going on:
Last year, two junior Congressmen, Robert E. Andrews, a Democrat from New Jersey, and Bill Zeliff, a Republican from New Hampshire, introduced legislation that would force a special session of Congress this year in which any lawmaker could bypass committees and other normal procedures, offer a proposal to cut Government spending and be guaranteed a vote on the proposal.
 
Opposed Clinton Budget
 Democratic leaders did not take the idea seriously. Both Mr. Andrews and Mr. Zeliff had voted against the Clinton budget, a measure that indisputably lowered the Federal deficit by raising taxes and limiting spending. The Congressmen's idea, which they called the A to Z Spending Cut Plan, was seen as a way to re-establish their deficit-cutting bona fides.
But several conservative talk-show hosts and editorial writers took up the A to Z cause. The idea appealed not only to Republicans, who chafe at their lack of power in the House, but also to some Democratic backbenchers who are frustrated at the extent to which the House is run by committee chairmen and party leaders. In a blink, more than 230 representatives, a majority of the 435-seat House, signed on as co-sponsors, a step that carried no responsibility but looked good in letters to constituents.
The Democratic leaders, who set the schedule for the House, refused to allow the plan for a special session to be brought to a vote. They do not want to subject their members to what might be embarrassing votes. The Speaker of the House, Representative Thomas S. Foley of Washington, said such a session would amount to a three-ring circus.
 
Seeking a Floor Vote
 So, unable to get a vote in the ordinary fashion, Mr. Andrews and Mr. Zeliff turned to a procedure that is almost never used: the discharge petition. Under the rules of the House, if 218 members, a majority, sign such a petition, the matter in question must be released by the committee with jurisdiction, in this case the Rules Committee, and brought to the floor for an up or down vote.
By early this summer, the A to Z sponsors were on the verge of success. Almost all of the 178 Republicans, eager to portray the Democratic majority as free spenders, and about 30 of the 257 Democrats had signed the petition. To prevent enough renegade Democrats from putting the tally over the top, the House majority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, promised last month that a succession of votes on the budget process would be taken this summer and fall.
The first such vote came last Thursday on something called expedited recissions. The House voted, 298 to 121, to require a speedy vote every time the President asks Congress to withdraw appropriations it has already approved. Presidents routinely ask for such withdrawals, called recissions, but under current procedures, Congress can block a recission simply by failing to vote on it.
This change is unlikely to save much money. "It is always easier to vote for process changes than for actual spending cuts," said Stanley E. Collender, a budget specialist at Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm.
 
No Support in Senate
 Votes are expected later this year on potentially more meaningful measures, the precise nature of which are not clear. One may place a cap on spending for entitlements, programs like Medicare in which benefits are automatically paid to everyone who meets the eligibility requirements. Another may limit annual cost-of-living increases in Social Security benefits and Federal pensions. Still another, called a lock box measure, may require that money cut from appropriations bills be used only for deficit reduction and not be spent elsewhere.
In a sense, these will be free votes for the representatives. The measures will not become law this year because the Senate has no intention of considering them. This is similar to the way Democratic representatives were free to vote for tough campaign finance restrictions in the Bush Administration because they knew the President would veto them.
The sponsors of the A to Z plan have something of a point. Measures dealing with Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the Government's costliest programs, are always handled under what are known as closed rules. That means, basically, that they are not subject to amendments. And, as Mr. Gephardt noted last week, "There has not been a debate on reforming overall entitlement policies here in the House in recent memory."
Even so, it is hard to believe that many representatives will vote in an election year to reduce these benefits. Yet, this is where the money is.
 
Raise Taxes or Cut Benefits
 The budget deficit cannot be reduced substantially, economists agree, unless lawmakers raise taxes on the middle class or reduce the Federal benefits that a large number of their constituents receive.
If the people want higher taxes or lower benefits, that is certainly not apparent. It is also not clear that very many members of Congress want to take those steps. The complaint that the House is run by a small clique may be valid, but it is rare that a measure supported by a majority of members is not approved.
The truth is, the sponsors of the A to Z plan may be more interested in talking about reducing the deficit than in actually doing so. In the last two months, the House has voted on all 13 appropriations bills. These measures provide money for about one-third of the Federal budget, including all of what anyone regards as wasteful pork barrel.
The A to Z sponsors did not propose a single amendment to reduce the amount of money for spending in any of these bills.
Asked why, Mr. Zeliff said, "I could have spent my time coming up with amendments, or I could spend the time trying to get A to Z home."

HEADLINE: Severe Ancient Droughts: A Warning to California

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
BEGINNING about 1,100 years ago, what is now California baked in two droughts, the first lasting 220 years and the second 140 years. Each was much more intense than the mere six-year dry spells that afflict modern California from time to time, new studies of past climates show. The findings suggest, in fact, that relatively wet periods like the 20th century have been the exception rather than the rule in California for at least the last 3,500 years, and that mega-droughts are likely to recur.
The evidence for the big droughts comes from an analysis of the trunks of trees that grew in the dry beds of lakes, swamps and rivers in and adjacent to the Sierra Nevada, but died when the droughts ended and the water levels rose. Immersion in water has preserved the trunks over the centuries. 
 Dr. Scott Stine, a paleoclimatologist at California State University at Hayward, used radiocarbon dating techniques to determine the age of the trees' outermost annual growth rings, thereby establishing the ends of drought periods. He then calculated the lengths of the preceding dry spells by counting the rings in each stump.
This method identified droughts lasting from A.D. 892 to A.D. 1112 and from A.D. 1209 to A.D. 1350. Judging by how far the water levels dropped during these periods -- as much as 50 feet in some cases -- Dr. Stine concluded that the droughts were not only much longer, they were far more severe than either the drought of 1928 to 1934, California's worst in modern times, or the more recent severe dry spell of 1987 to 1992.
In medieval times the California droughts coincided roughly with a warmer climate in Europe, which allowed the Vikings to colonize Greenland and vineyards to grow in England, and with a severe dry period in South America, which caused the collapse of that continent's most advanced pre-Inca empire, the rich and powerful state of Tiwanaku, other recent studies have found.
Does Tiwanaku's fate await modern California?
Dr. Stine, who reported his findings last month in the British journal Nature, says that California, like Tiwanaku, presents "a classic case of people building themselves beyond the carrying capacity of the land," which is determined not by wet times but by dry ones. "What we've done in California is fail to recognize that there are lean times ahead," said Dr. Stine, "and they are a lot leaner than anything we've come up against" in the modern era.
How far ahead that reckoning might lie is, of course, uncertain. But one ominous sign may be that the earth's climate as a whole is now warming up, whether from natural causes or because of heat-trapping atmospheric gases emitted by industrial society. Any significant global warming would probably cause changes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns, and the new findings suggest that "during much of medieval time the planetary ocean-atmosphere system operated in a mode unlike that of modern time," Dr. Stine wrote in Nature.
This alteration of the system could well have been caused by a natural global warming, he said. He believes that one long-term effect was to steer storm tracks and rainfall away from California. If this pattern was indeed brought about by a medieval global warming, he said, a future global warming -- whether natural or human-induced -- might bring back the decades-long droughts of yore.
Dr. Stine's findings, combined with similar evidence he turned up in Patagonia, strengthen the case of those who believe that the earth experienced a general warming at the time of the Middle Ages, Dr. F. Alayne Street-Perrott, a paleoclimatologist at Oxford University in England, wrote in a commentary accompanying Dr. Stine's report in Nature. Other experts maintain that the medieval warming was not global but instead affected only some parts of the world.
"I'm not prepared to believe that the whole world was warmer," said Dr. Malcolm K. Hughes, a paleoclimatologist who directs the Laboratory of Tree Ring Research at the University of Arizona in Tucson. Nor is it possible to say for sure that future global warming would bring back the large-scale droughts of the past. "We've not done the work on the actual mechanisms," he said.
But he said that Dr. Stine's findings, coupled with similar conclusions that can be drawn from other tree-ring studies by scientists in his laboratory, are a "serious cause for concern." There appears to be little doubt that the epic dry spells of the past did occur, he said, adding that "what has happened can happen."
The findings also emphasize the importance of precipitation changes, rather than simply changes in temperature, when weighing the potential impact of future global climate change, Dr. Stine wrote in Nature.
 
Periods of 'Epic Drought'
 The Sierra Nevada, where Dr. Stine conducted his study, is California's most important area for the collection of water. Runoff from the Sierras provides two-thirds of the state's surface-water supply for cities and farms. The study involved trees at four places: Mono Lake, Tenaya Lake, the West Walker River and Osgood Swamp. Dr. Stine's tree-ring analysis found that live trees had covered dry beds of lakes, streams and swamps for overlapping periods of 50, 100, 141 and 220 years and that these "lowstand" periods were clustered in two major dry spells separated by a century-long wet period. "Epic drought," he wrote in Nature, is "the only plausible explanation for the site-to-site contemporaneity of the stumps."
In the period separating the two long droughts, Dr. Stine said, the water in Mono Lake rose to a level higher than any in the last 150 years, suggesting that the California climate was even wetter then than it is today. The last century and a half, Dr. Stine found, has been the third wettest period in the last three millenniums. But, he said, "the vast majority of years during the past 3,500 years have been much drier than what we've come to expect to be normal in California."
The evidence for the medieval drought periods is especially strong, Dr. Hughes said, because the lake basins are closed, with no natural outlets; consequently, their water levels are influenced only by inflow and evaporation, making them ideal gauges of drought. And even though radiocarbon dating is somewhat imprecise, he said, it is good enough "to show two major phases of tree growth and lowstands; there's no doubt about that." This, he said, shows that "often, for sure, there have been periods of 100 years or more" that have been "markedly drier" than the 20th century.
The 10th to the 14th centuries, encompassing the prolonged droughts reported by Dr. Stine, saw "dramatic changes" in Western Hemisphere civilizations, Dr. Street-Perrott wrote in Nature, and some have been attributed by archeologists to changes in rainfall. One example is the sudden decline of the Anasazi cliff-dwellers in the American southwest at about the year 1300. Another, even more striking, is the collapse of Tiwanaku.
Tiwanaku was a flourishing empire that lasted seven centuries and reached its zenith near the end of the first millennium A.D. It commanded an area about the size of California, extending from the Andean plateau around Lake Titicaca to the Pacific Coast and covering parts of present-day Bolivia, Chile and Peru.
The empire's economy was based on intensive agriculture carried out on raised fields: acres of end-to-end rectangular platforms created by digging the dirt from areas between them. The dug-out areas became canals from which silt was taken to provide fertilizer. This highly productive and environmentally sound system dominated Latin American agriculture for centuries.
 
Death of a Civilization
 But several lines of evidence, including analyses of fossilized pollen grains and isotopes of oxygen in lake sediments, make it clear that an extended drought afflicted the region starting between A.D. 950 and A.D. 1000 and continuing, with fluctuations, until 1410, concluded a study last year by Charles R. Ortloff, a fluid-mechanics specialist at the FMC Corporate Technology Center at Santa Clara, Calif., and Dr. Alan L. Kolata, an archeologist at the University of Chicago. That period mostly overlaps the one in which the California mega-droughts occurred.
The South American drought was of "horrendous proportions," said Dr. Kolata, and it destroyed Tiwanaku's agricultural base. The empire's cities were abandoned by about 1000. Dr. Kolata believes that the raised fields could no longer support the cities, and archeological evidence shows that the fields were abandoned between 1000 and 1100. The political state collapsed, the population dispersed and, with agriculture no longer possible, the people relied on raising alpacas and llamas.
Tiwanaku's agricultural system had been able to adjust to the less drastic cycles of drought and inundation that were thought to be normal, but "Tiwanaku agro-engineers were incapable of responding to a drought of unprecedented duration and severity," Mr. Ortloff and Dr. Kolata wrote in a 1993 paper in The Journal of Archeological Science.
Like Tiwanaku's engineers, those who draw up California's water-management plans do so on the basis of what are believed to be normal droughts but in fact are not nearly as severe as what has occurred in the past and can occur again, said Dr. Stine.
"The assumption they've made for a long time -- that California is subject to droughts of a maximum of seven years -- could be harmful in the long run," he said, because "they have doled out water on that assumption.
"This could be destructive if you get hit with a 9th or a 10th or a 15th year of severe drought."
In gauging the length and frequency of droughts for planning purposes, California officials rely on a tree-ring study extending back to about 1560. Over that period, the 1928-1934 drought was the longest and worst. The problem, said Dr. Stine, is that the study period includes not only the wet 19th and 20th centuries, but also the even wetter 16th and 17th centuries. "They're using the wettest period of the last 3,000 years to define the duration and severity of the droughts we can expect in the future," he said.
Maurice Roos, the chief hydrologist of the California Department of Water Resources, said he had not read Dr. Stine's report in Nature. But he did acknowledge that a mega-drought of the kind described in the report would probably cause much of the state's lush irrigated cropland to cease producing. The cities would probably have the money and political power to appropriate enough water to get by, he said, adding, "There will always be some water; there is not going to be no water." He said he would not expect farming to cease altogether, or cities to be deserted.
Modern California has at least one coping weapon that Tiwanaku did not: the ability to turn sea water into fresh water. The 1987-92 drought did, in fact, prompt Santa Barbara to build a desalinization plant, Mr. Roos said, though he was quick to point out that this solution at present would be "enormously expensive."
At the very least, Dr. Stine wrote in Nature, a recurrence of the medieval droughts "would be highly disruptive environmentally and economically." Planning for a mega-drought now, while heads are a little cooler, would help, he says. The planning might include, for example, deciding which crops are to be taken out of production first, what restrictions to place on the pumping of groundwater and how cities are to obtain water.
But in the end, he said, a reprise of the medieval droughts would simply overwhelm California's efforts to cope. And he said: "We don't need 200 years of drought to bring us down. At some point, in the 9th year, or the 15th year or the 19th year, the damage is done and it doesn't matter any more."

Chart: Sierra Mega-Drought -- About 1,100 years ago, severe droughts lasting decades depressed water levels in Sierra Nevada lakes, allowing trees to grow on exposed land.
 
Telltale Tree Rings -- When water rose again, the trunks of trees were preserved. Modern scientists analyzed trees' annual rings to date and measure the big droughts.
 
Living on the Edge -- Drawing water for irrigation has caused present-day natural level of Mono Lake (top of page) to drop nearly to level of 12th-century drought (below). New mega-drought would depress it much farther.

HEADLINE: NASA's New Ploy: Meld With Moscow

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
HAVING achieved a host of spectaculars in its 35 years of existence, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has now embarked on a goal so bold, risky and surprising that the venture at times seems to unnerve the most daring of its visionaries. The agency is merging many of its leading activities with those of the Russian space program, its preeminent foe and rival during the long decades of the cold war.
The East-West partnership involves much more than building an orbital outpost for astronauts, which is to be assembled piecemeal in space between 1997 and 2002. The two sides are also cooperating in manned space flights, aeronautics research and Earth monitoring, and are talking about joining forces to fire robotic probes toward such distant and mysterious worlds as Pluto. 
 "We're merging our programs even more," Daniel S. Goldin, NASA's Administrator, said in a recent interview. "Given the tight budgets, it would be very wasteful to duplicate efforts. So we're trying to bring them together."
Mr. Goldin conceded: "Yes, there's risk and, yes, we may have a few failures. But in the long run, it's the right thing to do. Prudent interaction will strengthen the science programs of both countries. We're at a turning point."
Cooperation with the Russians in space is an important foreign-policy initiative of the Clinton Administration. It is intended to symbolize a new era of East-West cooperation and to engage Moscow in constructive space work in return for ending practices that upset Washington, like exporting advanced rocket gear to developing countries.
"The space program has always been about the relationship between Washington and Moscow," said John E. Pike, director of space policy at the Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington. "Clinton's just reversed the spin that Kennedy put on it."
From its earliest days, the space agency was dedicated to one main job: fighting Moscow symbolically in the space race and showing the world that America was the planet's technological leader. On the heels of Moscow's triumphs in lofting big rockets and satellites, the message was to be that capitalism, not Communism, was the best way to conquer space, lift the human spirit and generate a flood of material benefits.
In May 1961, NASA's Administrator, James E. Webb, and Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara joined forces to send a memorandum to President John F. Kennedy, warning that "lunar and planetary exploration" were increasingly important weapons in "the battle along the fluid front of the cold war." Two weeks later, President Kennedy began the Apollo program, which culminated 25 years ago, in July 1969, with the landing of two Americans on the Moon.
Russia threw its best technology into the race, but failed to get its enormous Moon rockets into space. Four of them exploded on the launching pad or in flight.
After the American triumph of landing men on another world, the space program still had ambition but lacked focus. The agency was given no overarching goal by the White House and soon settled into a broad technological rivalry with the Soviet Union. Its approach tended to be revolutionary, while that of the Russians was evolutionary. NASA shot planetary probes past Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, even as the Soviets had trouble sending spacecraft to such nearby worlds as Mars.
Closer to Earth, the United States used its technological edge to embark on the world's first winged, reusable spaceship, known as the shuttle. It devised extraordinarily high-powered engines for the craft that though temperamental, were wonders of miniaturization. In contrast, the Soviets were forced to rely on big, bulky engines and rockets that were thrown away after each use.
In 1984, the agency got permission from the Reagan Administration to push ahead into the one sphere where the Russians were unquestioned leaders -- the building of space stations in Earth orbit. The American outpost was to be bigger, better and more expensive. By 1990, plans called for the station to measure a staggering 508 feet in length, nearly the size of the Capitol building in Washington. Costs over its 30-year lifetime were estimated at up to $120 billion.
"NASA's argument of choice was always heroic exploration -- the great mission on which the future of humankind would depend," Alex Roland, a former NASA historian who now teaches history at Duke University, said in an interview. "But it never hesitated to invoke the Russians when it served its purposes."
 
Lost in Space
 By the early 1990's, with the cold war won, battling the Russians was no longer relevant and the agency seemed to lack the will to probe the unknown for its own sake. NASA seemed adrift, if not lost in space. Shuttle launchings were repeatedly delayed by mechanical snags. Satellites mysteriously failed in orbit. Space probes broke down on the way to Jupiter and Mars.
As the competitive frenzy of the cold war ended, President George Bush in March 1992 appointed a new NASA Administrator, Mr. Goldin, who pledged an era in which the agency's endeavors would be "smaller, cheaper, faster, better," ending a trend to bigness and complexity that marked many aspects of NASA's rivalry with Moscow.
The Clinton Administration married this cost-cutting goal with a broad initiative to join the Russians in cooperative space projects. Last year, it hammered out a plan to have the Russians become partners in the space station project, which was mired in design studies after expenditures of more than $10 billion. The White House said the East-West outpost, in addition to rewarding Russia for good behavior and helping stabilize the Russian economy, would do more, cost less and be in orbit faster than it would if America did the project exclusively with its Western partners, Europe, Japan and Canada.
Vice President Al Gore, speaking recently in Washington, hailed the joint outpost as "a powerful physical symbol of what can be done here on Earth when governments replace obstruction with partnership."
Another area of accord is Earth-resources monitoring. For instance, NASA and the Russians are working to monitor the volcanoes of the Kamchatka Peninsula in eastern Russia, 29 of which are active, at times explosively so. Last August and September a NASA research jet, with a Russian co-pilot, carried a $1.2 million infrared multispectral scanner and an advanced camera over some of the volcanoes in a study meant to help predict eruptions. It was a first for such American gear. The area, rich in top-secret facilities, has been off limits to Westerners.
Analysts say such collaborations are likely to expand to satellites and environmental monitoring in general, where Russia has much experience and the United States has embarked on ambitious, multibillion-dollar plans for new fleets of spacecraft. In one developing program, NASA is to fly gear for mapping atmospheric ozone and aerosols aboard a Russian satellite. Another would have American teams fly as many has five new Earth-monitoring experiments aboard Russia's Mir space station.
 
Missions to Other Planets
 Another area where NASA is forging a broad alliance with Moscow is aeronautic research. It is negotiating to test American scramjet engines on Russian rockets, and plans to use the Russian Tu-144 supersonic transport jet from the Tupolev Design Bureau as a flying test bed for high-speed aeronautic research.
"The Tu-144 is a perfect fit between our needs and their capabilities," said Louis J. Williams, NASA's director of high-speed research. "This effort will give us up-to-date information on the real-world conditions that a supersonic airliner operates in -- data we wouldn't otherwise be able to obtain easily."
Perhaps the most visionary aspect of the emerging alliance centers on joint missions to send robotic probes to such places as Pluto, the outermost and most mysterious of the planets, the only one never visited by a spacecraft. Seeds of the union were sown as NASA planners found that tight budgets allowed them either to design a probe or buy a rocket for its launching -- but not to do both. That led to serious discussions with the Russians about their launching the probe, and evolved into plans to have them help design the robotic mission as well.
Mr. Goldin has asked his Pluto team to cut projected costs from $600 million to $400 million, and NASA officials believe that the goal may be possible only with the aid of the Russians.
NASA is also working closely with Moscow on the possibility of joint explorations of the planet Mars. Again, Russia would provide a rocket for the launching and some of the exploratory gear, including vehicles that would descend through the thin atmosphere to crawl on the planet's surface. The United States would provide the overall carrier vehicle, which would probably orbit the red planet to make remote observations after releasing the descent module.
The general merging with Moscow is seen by some experts as not only bold but laden with political and technical risks. An economic or political crisis in Russia could leave the United States suddenly partnerless, its joint endeavors on hold. More subtly, some experts say, the high-stakes politics of the merger could kindle disaster.
 
Fostering World Peace
 "Whenever a technical project is subordinated to political ends, the temptation grows to underestimate the technical problems that will arise and substitute enthusiasm for sound engineering," James E. Oberg, author of "Red Star in Orbit" and a long-time advocate of joint East-West programs, said in an interview.
"The end result can be a series of shocking technological surprises that everyone but the enthusiasts had forecast all along. We can hope it doesn't happen. But hoping is no substitute for realism."
NASA says it is taking every precaution to make sure the merger works as well as possible, and adds that not everything it plans to do in the future is tied to the Russians. New programs are getting under way that are entirely indigenous, such as a series of small satellites for solar-system exploration and Earth monitoring.
The White House says the merger is a judicious gamble needed to help Russia maintain its equilibrium and good behavior as centrifugal forces vie to tear that country apart. Most importantly, it says, such engagements and relationships can help foster global peace.
"Our partnerships and efforts to work together in space benefit the world, not just the United States and Russia," Vice President Gore told a gathering in Washington last month. "There are important real benefits for each country, not only in terms of technology, but also in terms of bridges of understanding that develop when we work toward common goals."

HEADLINE: Europe Ponders Future Outpost on the Moon

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE 

 BODY:
A MOVE is afoot in Europe to establish a manned scientific station on the Moon, an initiative that may eventually challenge America's primacy in space exploration.
Officials of the European Space Agency, a consortium of scientists from 14 countries, are seeking some $350 million from member nations to pay for the first in a series of lunar programs that could culminate in a manned Moon station within 25 years. Dr. Roger Bonnet, science director of the Paris-based agency, said in an interview that the first European emissary to the Moon, a small, unmanned craft named LEDA (for Lunar European Demonstration Approach) could land on the Moon by 2001. 
 LEDA, weighing only a few hundred pounds, would carry instruments to measure the darkness of the lunar sky, the frequency of meteorite impacts and the stability of the ground, all factors that would affect the functioning of a future astronomical observatory. Among the lander's other tasks would be an analysis of the lunar soil for components that could be used in the construction and operation of a permanent station.
Subsequent lunar landers carrying increasingly sophisticated equipment would pave the way for the establishment of a permanent manned lunar station in about the year 2020, Dr. Bonnet said. The new European initiative, which was enthusiastically endorsed at an E.S.A. workshop earlier this summer in Beatenberg, Switzerland, would bypass the large orbiting space station NASA plans as a preliminary to manned solar-system exploration.
For astronomers, an observatory on the far side of the Moon would allow telescopes and antennas to be shielded from light and radio interference from Earth. Like a space station, a lunar observatory would avoid the problem of atmospheric turbulence that afflicts Earth-based telescopes, but unlike a space station, it would rest on solid ground -- a more stable platform than an orbiting spacecraft.
European space officials acknowledge that the United States, despite the difficulties it faces, is still the world's leader in space technology. Dr. Bonney had particularly high praise for the Defense Department's recent Clementine mission to the Moon, the first American lunar mission since 1972. For a cost of only $80 million, the little spacecraft, which had been developed as part of a ballistic-missile defense program, carried out a major mapping project during the two months it spent in lunar orbit. Clementine was praised as an example of the kind of lean space program that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration should try to emulate.
But the European Space Agency has become disenchanted with some aspects of its collaboration with America's space programs. For example, the 14 full members of the European agency and an associate member, Canada, have so far invested about $850 million in the space station, an American initiative that has had international investment from the outset and whose continued financing by Washington is uncertain.
Dr. Bonnet joins many other European scientists in asserting that the United States is no longer a reliable partner in major scientific undertakings requiring multinational cooperation.
"Even when American scientific agencies intend to cooperate with foreign partners," he said, "they cannot commit themselves to more than one year in advance, which is the time necessary to review next year's budget. As long as this system exists, there will be a big risk in engaging in big cooperation with the United States in space as well as in other big science fields."
This is clearly bad news for many American scientists, who increasingly depend on international collaboration for jobs as well as research support. Another major American science project, the superconducting supercollider, was killed by Congress last year, casting hundreds of American physicists adrift and stunning European partners who had invested money, equipment and talent in the $8 billion project.
American high-energy physicists have been scrambling for jobs at the European community's CERN accelerator laboratory, whose Large Hadron Collider, currently under construction, seems destined to lead the world in particle physics research.
A similar collaborative challenge to American astronomy has come from the European Southern Observatory, a European consortium whose astronomical observatories in Chile are already among the world's most important. By the end of this century, the European Southern Observatory will have completed its Very Large Telescope, a monster array of instruments at Cerro Paranal, Chile, equivalent to a telescope about 52 feet in diameter. The device is likely to remain the largest telescope in existence through much of the 21st century.
 
Americans as 'Poor Relations'
 Some American astronomers work at the European consortium's observatories, just as some American physicists work at CERN, but increasingly the Americans are treated as poor relations, and unless they begin bringing American funds with them they are expected to find jobs in Europe scarce.
France's latest heavy-lift rocket, Ariane 5, is scheduled for a maiden flight next year, and if it works as expected, it could transport nearly one ton of equipment to the surface of the Moon, Dr. Bonnet said. An existing rocket, Russia's mighty Energia, could even place astronauts on the Moon right now, if Russia had the funds to prepare and launch a lunar mission, he said.
But European Space Agency officials hope to persuade the space ministers of their respective countries that a stepwise approach to colonizing the Moon (and then reaching out to the planets) will be both effective and economical.
"This may not be the best time to ask for more money for space ventures," Dr. Bonnet said, "but you have to start somewhere. Japan is very interested in this and wants to collaborate with E.S.A. on a Moon project. The Russians would like to join, but their idea of collaboration right now is asking for money, and we don't have any to spare."
Asked if the United States could be accepted as an associate member of the European collaboration, Dr. Bonney laughed and said, "It's probably possible in principle, but no one envisions it."
While aware of the risks involved in an American collaboration, European science administrators are willing to join forces with American counterparts under certain circumstances.
"But to minimize the risk," Dr. Bonnet said, "we have to know that there is at least consensus between all the American players -- NASA, the Congress, the White House and the scientists themselves. If that consensus is not total, the system can break down very quickly and end a project, as it did with the supercollider."
In the past, many European space projects have depended upon collaboration with outsiders, particularly with NASA. "But it's certainly time to change our attitude in E.S.A. and look for what is possible to do ourselves," Dr. Bonnet said.

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL;
A Judge Comes Down Hard On the N.B.A. Players Union

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
Pro basketball players' quest for unfettered free agency in the National Basketball Association was dealt a major setback yesterday when a Federal judge in Manhattan ruled that the league's salary cap, college draft and right of first refusal do not violate antitrust law.
The union immediately filed a motion of appeal in the 2d Circuit Court of Appeals, where it hopes to have its case heard in early September. 
 "You'll recall that the judge said that anyone who thinks this fight will end here needs a psychiatrist, not a lawyer," said Charles Grantham, the executive director of the National Basketball Players Association. "Well, we don't need a psychiatrist and we're appealing expeditiously. We knew this would be a long fight."
 
Clearly Disturbed
 United States District Court Judge Kevin T. Duffy clearly seemed disturbed that the impasse found its way into his court. The parties, he wrote, were "using the court as a bargaining chip in the collective bargaining process."
The disputed policies have been central elements of N.B.A. economics for a decade. Without them, Commissioner David Stern argued, the league would be in chaos. The union said there would be greater player freedom, without anarchy.
Although the league and the union have portrayed theirs as a model labor relationship, their negotiations have often been fractious, and the union has sued the league several times in the past before labor agreements were reached.
 
Wins Its Point
 But the league wants to stay out of court, and it won the point.
"The judge said it's a labor matter and it has to be resolved in collective bargaining," Russ Granik, deputy commissioner of the N.B.A., said. "He's saying that the benefit of being a union is you have the right to strike. If the union wants that remedy, it can't also use the antitrust law."
Duffy's decision forces the league and union to continue their collective bargaining relationship although their 1988 labor agreement expired on June 23. It also lets teams sign rookies and veteran players to new contracts.
The union had obtained a temporary restraining order against any signings, but Duffy lifted the ban.
Grantham said he is advising players' agents to have their clients sign new contracts with one- or two-year "out clauses."
The N.B.A. launched the legal fracas last month by filing suit to prove that its labor stalemate with the union did not belong in Federal court, but at the negotiating table. The union countered by securing the restraining order and making its antitrust claims against the N.B.A.'s policies.
In its papers and in a one-day trial ordered by Duffy last Tuesday, the union argued that the N.B.A.'s policies restrained players from selling themselves to the highest bidder starting with their rookie days.
 
Judge Has His View
 The union, the judge said, "failed to show that the alleged restraints of trade are on balance unreasonably anti-competitive" and the "maintenance of competitive balance may outweigh their restrictive consequences."
The union failed to persuade the judge that the N.B.A.'s policies violate antitrust law because their 1988 labor agreement had ended. He said that a "nonstatutory labor exemption" immunizes the league from antitrust laws.
"The challenged measures," Duffy wrote, "do not violate the antitrust laws as long as the collective bargaining relationship exists" -- even if a new agreement does not.
The union has argued that although the players had gone along with disputed policies to help the N.B.A. during trying economic times in the early 1980's, they were no longer necessary to insure the league's financial future.
 
The Union View
 "It's not good law to have a rule that says employees who have agreed to some restraints, because the employer says it's in financial difficulty, must be struck with the restraints as long as it continues to be a union," said Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr., a union lawyer.
Duffy said the players are not "stuck" with the N.B.A.'s polices, suggesting they can strike, or decertify the union as its collective bargaining agent, as the National Football League Players Association did to fight the N.F.L. in Federal court.
Schwarz said if the union wins a reversal in the court of appeals, the league may be liable for damages, based on the difference between what players signed for under the current system, and what their market value would be in an unrestricted environment.

HEADLINE: Governor Hasn't Changed on Death Penalty;
Time to Exit Gracefully

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's grandstanding on the death penalty is just his way of grasping at straws in an attempt to get re-elected. 
 Mr. Cuomo has vetoed the death penalty ever since he has been Governor. He even went so far as to have a convicted murderer extradited from Oklahoma. Taxpayer cost to house this convicted murderer in New York's penal system will run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars because Mr. Cuomo refused to allow him to be executed.
The time has come for Mr. Cuomo to leave political office gracefully and allow someone else to pull this state out of its economic demise. The Governor has done nothing to bring industry back to the Big Apple. During his tenure we have faced increased taxes, increased crime and the downfall of quality of life.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Can health maintenance groups maintain better stock prices?

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim 

 BODY:
MOST health maintenance organization stocks headed south in the last few weeks, after news that three large health care purchasers in California had negotiated decreases in the premiums they will pay to health maintenance organizations next year.
What pulled the stocks lower, some analysts said, was the fear that the glory days might be ending for the H.M.O.'s, where profits have regularly exceeded analysts' estimates for several years. H.M.O. membership is high in California, and the state has long been regarded as a bellwether for managed health care. 
 But other analysts argue that California is a special case, which the rest of the country is following only slowly. And the California-based H.M.O.'s do not seem to be hurting. A number of them are still gaining business; some are expanding into nearby states, and some are even jumping cross-country to Florida.
Moreover, with medical inflation dramatically lessened, some analysts say the health maintenance organizations have been able to cut their own costs and force doctors and hospitals to accept lower payments for each person covered, relieving the H.M.O.'s of much of the pain.
Reductions in 1995 premiums were negotiated by the Bay Area Business Group on Health, a San Francisco-based employers group. It announced last month that a dozen big employers -- including the Bank of America, Bechtel, Chevron, McKesson, Pacific Telesis, Safeway and Wells Fargo Bank -- would receive cuts in premiums averaging 5 to 10 percent. Together, they cover 300,000 employees, retirees under 65 and dependents.
The California Public Employees Retirement System also negotiated cuts of at least 1.1 percent for the 920,000 people it covers. And the Health Insurance Plan of California, a state-sponsored small-business group covering 45,000 employees, won reductions averaging 6.3 percent.
Margo Vignola, a Salomon Brothers health care analyst, said the stocks of California-based H.M.O.'s, which fell as much as 24 percent since late May, have always traded below comparable companies in the Midwest and the East because of worries about competition. For years, prices and profits have been lower because of competition from the giant, nonprofit Kaiser Foundation H.M.O.'s. Even so, she said, "the California H.M.O.'s have generated better than expected growth."
Ed Keaney, an analyst in St. Louis at Stifel Nicolaus, said that in the San Francisco Bay area negotiations, Healthsystems International and Pacificare agreed to the deepest premium cuts. But he said they could offset most of the lower premiums by reducing payments to doctors and hospitals compensated on a per-person basis.
Both analysts recommend the shares of Healthsystems. They also like Foundation Health Plan, which has been aggressively gaining new business to make up for big military dependents' contracts it lost in December to a lower bid by Aetna Health Plans, a unit of Aetna Life and Casualty.
And investor gloom about H.M.O.'s may soon lift a bit, Mr. Keaney said, when the companies report what he expects will be another round of 20 to 25 percent earnings gains and strong increases in enrollment in the second quarter. "I think the stocks will come back to life soon," he said.
But Kimberly A. Purvis, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said per-person payments to California doctors and hospitals, and the utilization of hospital beds there, were already "at a low base level, to a point where it would be hard to extract another pound of flesh." She added: "The H.M.O.'s can pass along some of the pain, but not all of it. They are victims of their own efficiency."
No California H.M.O. is on her "buy" list, but Pacificare is "worth a look," she said. It focuses on Medicare patients "and is doing an excellent job of managing an older and sicker population."
Shares of Healthsystems closed at $27.75 yesterday, up 50 cents, and Foundation Health declined 12.5 cents, to $39, both on the New York Stock Exchange. Pacificare class A shares fell $1, to $51.

Chase and Nationsbank Earnings Rise

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Strong growth in lending and higher fees from consumer banking services increased second-quarter profits at two leading banks. The Chase Manhattan Corporation saw earnings rise 31.8 percent, while those at the Nationsbank Corporation were up 42.8 percent.
Consumers charged more on their credit cards while businesses borrowed more money to pay for expanding operations, fueling double-digit loan growth. But the banks felt a pinch in their mortgage businesses, as fewer consumers sought to refinance housing loans because of the higher interest rates. 
 Checking account fees and service charges helped lift fee income at many banks. With loans up, banks earned more from interest payments than they paid in interest on deposits. Fees from managing money for individuals and businesses also rose in the second quarter.
Chase, which is based in New York, earned $307 million, or $1.46 a share, compared with $233 million, or $1.20 a share, in the comparable period a year earlier.
 
Global Corporate Banking
 Fees and commissions from consumer and global corporate banking activities grew 24 percent, to $480 million. Credit card fees, as well as fees from money management and corporate finance were up, too. Unlike many banks, Chase booked higher fees from mortgage banking activities, which the company attributed to its acquisition last year of a mortgage company and because the bank booked losses in its mortgage business a year earlier.
But a downturn in the stock and bond markets and volatility in foreign exchange caused Chase to make less money from buying and selling securities and currencies on behalf of clients and for their own accounts.
Trading revenue fell 19 percent, to $151 million. Foreign exchange trading revenue fell $7 million, to $78 million, while trading account revenue dropped $29 million, to $73 million.
Bad loans and foreclosures were down 53 percent, to $1.46 billion, compared with the corresponding period a year earlier.
In the first six months of the year, Chase earned $671 million, or $3.27 a share, compared with $386 million, or $1.95 a share, a year ago.
Chase's shares closed down 12.5 cents, to $38.625, yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.
At Nationsbank, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., earnings totaled $437 million, or $1.58 a share, compared with $306 million, or $1.20 a share, a year ago.
The number of new loans and leases rose 11 percent, to $94.6 billion. Loans to consumers were the biggest contributor to the overall increase, the bank said. Loan growth was also higher because Nationsbank bought several banks last year.
Net interest income -- representing interest earned on loans minus interest paid on deposits -- grew by 18 percent, to $1.3 billion.
The growth came from making higher-interest loans while keeping interest rates on deposits steady.
Nationsbank continued to make improvements in its problem loan portfolio. The number of loans that are in default fell 13 percent, to $1.4 billion.
Profits for the first six months rose 8.5 percent, to $854 million, or $3.10 a share, compared with $787 million, or $3.09 a share after a gain of $200 million, 79 cents a share, from a adjustment in accounting in the corresponding period last year.
Nationsbank shares rose 62.5 cents, to $55.125 yesterday, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Weaker vs. Mark But Gains Against the Yen

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar ended mixed against other currencies yesterday as foreign officials offered a variety of views about America's economic policy and exchange rates.
In Germany, a Bundesbank Council member, Otmar Issing, said the United States was "expanding its position as the world's biggest debtor almost on a weekly basis." 
 The central banker's comments came on top of numerous statements from German officials recently, many of whom have criticized the Clinton Administration and its stance toward the dollar.
Traders said Mr. Issing's remarks prompted an early bout of dollar selling, leaving it at 1.5485 German marks in late New York trading, off from 1.554 marks on Friday.
Against the Japanese yen, however, the dollar finished firmer, aided by official Japanese concern over the yen's strength.
In his first speech before the Japanese Parliament since taking office June 30, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama emphasized the need for the "stabilization of currency exchange markets," a problem he said was compounded by "the yen's rapid appreciation."

The dollar rose to 98.45 yen in New York, from 97.86 yen on Friday.
U.S.-Japan trade relations remain at the center of the dollar's recent troubles, and late yesterday there were reports that the Clinton Administration might impose trade sanctions later this month.
Administration officials said there had been insufficient progress between the two countries.
"We're willing to negotiate, but obviously we are realistic," one senior official said. "There is a much greater desire on our part to have a results-oriented package, but we have this deadline."
Last month, the Administration gave Japan until July 31 to avoid trade sanctions by opening up its public contracts business in telecommunications and its purchasing of medical technology.
Several dealers said there was concern about the potential for a further deterioration in the United States trade balance. The Commerce Department will release May trade figures today.
"The trade numbers could underline problems for the market," said Dennis Pettit, chief dealer at the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan.
Separately, the Italian lira came under severe downward pressure amid fresh political turmoil. The lira's troubles erupted after Interior Minister Roberto Maroni said on Sunday that he was ready to step down in a political dispute. While the lira ended little changed against the dollar at 1,549 versus 1,550, it plunged to 1,003 against the mark, its lowest level this year.

HEADLINE: Dow Edges Ahead 1.62 in Light Trading

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
After a remarkable two weeks in which the Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 107 points, or 3 percent, the stock market barely roused itself at all yesterday. The Dow gained just 1.62 points to close at 3,755.43 on light trading volume.
Still, the market, as measured by the Dow and other major leading indexes, has returned to its mid-June highs, prompting talk that the summer rally is around the corner. 
 True, the rally has been around the corner since Memorial Day. But bears have dominated market sentiment for so long since the Federal Reserve Board raised interest rates last February, that traders feel the market is headed for a major tectonic shift toward bullishness simply because everyone has been so bearish.
Indeed, a few analysts say the rally is already here. Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at Kemper Securities in Chicago, said, "The summer rally is already occurring -- it just started late and will probably extend into September." Mr. Chalasani said the currency markets seemed to be betting that the dollar had either reached bottom or was close to it and that the United States' strong economic fundamentals will eventually assert themselves and steady the dollar. That in turn helps the bond market.
Essentially, currency traders will simply tire of outmaneuvering themselves, he said. "You have to remember that less than 15 percent of daily currency trading is for business purposes," he said. "The rest is speculation."
While the Federal Reserve may still raise interest rates in the short run, he said, defending the dollar is unlikely to be the main reason. "The Fed wants the dollar to strengthen on its own and it can," Mr. Chalasani said. Many stock traders are betting that the Fed won't raise rates until later this year, thus helping corporate earnings and stock prices.
David Shulman, chief equity strategist for Salomon Brothers, said the Dow could rise 100 points or more over the next three weeks, especially because traders see rising inventories and flattening car and home sales as evidence of a slowing economy with little inflation.
But Mr. Shulman cautions that a large market decline, of up to 400 points in the Dow, is still possible by the end of the year because of market skittishness over sensitive and volatile numbers, like monthly unemployment figures.
The market evidence yesterday was far from ferocious in either the bullish or bearish direction. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 1.06 points, to 455.22. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 1.26 points, to 722.62.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was somewhat below normal at 227.5 million shares, or more than 20 percent below this year's average of 288 million shares.
Rising software issues, especially Microsoft, and retail stocks offset declines in telephone stocks. Microsoft rose because Wall Street analysts said that, despite criticism from the Justice Department, there was little in the antitrust settlement that would hurt Microsoft's business. Wal-Mart, Kmart and Dayton Hudson saw their shares rise following strong rises in June retail sales announced earlier this month.
But U S West and AT&T declined after U S West agreed to buy cable-television properties and the Justice Department cleared AT&T's merger with McCaw Cellular. Such mergers acquisitions often hurt profits in the short run.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.38 point, to 251.44, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks by 1,135 to 1,023. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 1.04 points, to 432.59.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 13 rose, led by Aluminum Company of America, which rose 2 1/8, to 82 1/2, on no immediate news. Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, only 131 rose, led by Wal-Mart, which rose 1/2, to 25 7/8.

HEADLINE: High-Tech Taiwanese Come Home

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HSINCHU, Taiwan

 BODY:
By most measures, Wu Tao-yuan had it made. As head of a research and development lab for I.B.M. in the Silicon Valley, he was at the peak of his profession.
But still, he was itchy. 
 "I'd been at I.B.M. long enough," said Mr. Wu, a Stanford University Ph.D. in electrical engineering. "I saw that my future was limited there because of the nature of the beast. Taiwan presented a much greater opportunity for me."
And it was to here that Mr. Wu and hundreds of other American-educated engineers from Taiwan came, to the high-technology companies grouped in an industrial park and processing zone created by the Chinese Nationalist Government 15 years ago to encourage the growth of applied science and technology.
After a slow and hesitant start, the Science-Based Industrial Park, home to 150 high-technology businesses, generated nearly $5 billion in sales last year, propelling Taiwan into the ranks of major high-tech producers. It has, for example, about half the world market in scanners and monitors, about 30 percent of the market in network cards and terminals and about 10 percent of the personal computer market.
The park is also changing the kind of goods Taiwan makes. In the last decade, much of the labor-intensive, low-tech industries such as clothing, shoe and toy manufacturing that spurred the island's economic growth have been displaced by high-tech industries, which make up a rapidly growing percentage of its exports.
"I think the park is very important for Taiwan, especially during industrial restructuring," said Wu Rong-i, the president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, a private research and consulting firm. "It took five or six years really to see a response. But then it started to demonstrate good performance."
The idea for this park -- about 1,000 acres of silicon chip factories, computer and telecommunications manufacturing, research labs, office buildings, schools and restaurants -- sprang from the early successes of the Silicon Valley, the swath of computer industries that spilled south from Palo Alto and Stanford University.
"The original thought was that since there were so many Taiwanese scientists and engineers in Silicon Valley, that if we could get some of them to come back and start businesses, they could help us start a high-tech industry here," said H. Steve Hsieh, the director general of the science park and a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin. "Many people went to the United States and stayed forever, many for political reasons because Taiwan was under martial law. Some of these people got into middle-age crisis. So we've tried to recruit them to come here and start high-tech companies."
Today, the 150 companies here cover an array of high-tech industries, including the manufacture of personal computers and peripherals, the fabrication of integrated circuits, specialized telecommunications equipment and design, optical-electronics and, less successfully, a handful of biotechnology companies.
While the companies here are privately owned and managed, Taiwan's National Science Council has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the park to buy land, erect buildings and to provide grants for research and development, spending Mr. Hsieh says has paid off.
 
Help, if Less of It
 "We do not interfere in the daily business of the companies," he explained. "The are on their own. But if the company would like government equity, the government will be willing to chip in. But actually, this was significant only in the early history of the park. Sentiment has changed and the Government role is diminishing."
For Mr. Wu, president of Umax Data Systems, which designs and manufactures high-resolution color scanners, it was the precisely this challenge of succeeding or failing without government intervention that helped lure him to a company that was floundering when he joined it three years ago.
"The company was static," he explained. "It really needed to take off. To grow it, to become a full-fledged market player, to have a consistent, long-range strategy, it really needed someone with some experience and seasoning. I looked at the management and the product and said this is the place for me."
Today, Umax has taken 11 percent of the world's scanner market -- Taiwan is the world's largest manufacturer of scanners -- behind Hewlett-Packard, which dominates the market with about 30 percent of worldwide sales. The third-largest scanner manufacturer, Microtek International, is another company based in the science park.
With Umax scanners, a user can feed up to 25 documents into the machine, which will scan each page and convert it into a text-editable file in a variety of formats used in popular word processing programs. The scanners can also be used to scan and edit color photographs and transparencies.
Mr. Wu has no doubt that his company's success has been enhanced by conditions in the park. "We enjoy all kinds of benefits," he said. "The customs service is here to simplify imports and exports. We enjoy a five-year tax holiday. All the banks are here. The skill pool is here. There are two very good bilingual schools, Chinese and English. All these integrated services and the people resources are one of the reasons to be in the park."
When he arrived in 1991, Umax had sales of about $10 million. This year, Mr. Wu said, he expects sales to reach $90 million, up nearly 50 percent over last year's sales of $62 million. "We've grown from 70 people in 1991 to 450 people today," he said.
Umax's success is typical of most companies in the park, said Mr. Hsieh, the park's director, but that success is creating tremendous strains on the park. "We are now looking at eight new companies who want to come in," he said. "But one of the most serious stumbling blocks is to find land. Land is not only a monetary issue but a political issue. Land is very hard to come by."
The park has been so successful that foreign companies have set up operations here, making up nearly one-quarter of the companies in the park. Altogether there are 30 American operations here, including subsidiaries of AT&T and Litton Industries.
But more than American companies, it is the engineers trained in the United States that have made the park, and Taiwan's high-tech industries, a success. From only a trickle in the mid-1980's, the return of graduate engineers from American universities has increased, with 851 returning in 1992 and 1,004 last year, all to create, manage or oversee the technology of the park's companies. Altogether, 73, or almost half, of all the companies here were started by Taiwan engineers who returned from the United States.
Yau You-wen was one of the 1,004 who returned home last year. "I was at Stanford in applied physics," he said, "and went on to Honeywell, and later I.B.M. What brought me back were the opportunities. The gap is disappearing between the U.S. and Taiwan." Now, Mr. Yau is the director of quality and reliability at the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the largest fabricator of integrated circuits in Taiwan.
 
Hybrid Corporate Culture
 Mr. Yau said that the corporate culture of Taiwan Semiconductor was more American than Taiwanese. In part, this is because the company has an American president, Donald W. Brooks, and because of the predominance of American customers. Indeed, the company's success has come not from creating its own chips but from building the factories and the technology to manufacture designs for integrated circuits created elsewhere, usually in the United States.
Last year, Taiwan Semiconductor had sales of $473 million, with profits of $165 million, according to the company's annual report. The importance of American chip design companies, many of which are in Silicon Valley, was demonstrated by the fact that 61 percent of the company's total revenue was based on sales to the United States, revenue that grew by 122 percent from 1992.
Taiwan, like Japan, has also been weak in software, a situation the leadership here will try to remedy in a fashion similar to this high-tech park. Over the next year, a software park will be set up in a suburb of Taipei, in Nankang, where officials hope it will be able to attract American-trained software engineers.

HEADLINE: 5 Mutual Funds in New York Inquiry

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
The New York State Attorney General is investigating whether five mutual funds may have misled investors into thinking the funds were safe investments when they were high risk.
Looking at mutual funds that invested in mortgage derivatives and posted sharp declines this year, Investigators for Attorney General G. Oliver Koppell identified eight, with $3.6 billion in assets, whose share prices dropped an average of 20 percent in the first six months of the year. 
 "Based upon our review of the sales materials for five of these funds we fear that thousands of investors have been sold these funds based upon misplaced emphasis on their credit quality, which is invariably high grade, while omitting disclosure of their emphasis on mortgage-backed derivatives," Mr. Koppell wrote in a letter to Representative Edward J. Markey, who has also been looking into mutual funds' use of derivatives.
The five funds all owned a lot of what the Attorney General called "exotic mortgage derivatives: primarily inverse floaters, principal-only strips and inverse interest-only strips." Wall Street creates these securities out of home mortgages. The recent rise in interest rates has decimated the market for such derivatives.
William H. Mohr, an assistant attorney general and chief of enforcement, declined to name the five funds under investigation.
 
 
Small Group of Candidates
 But the pool of candidates is not large. Morningstar Inc., the Chicago fund tracker, finds just eight funds that meet the state's criteria.
Six funds -- those with the steepest losses -- are managed by Piper Jaffray, the Minneapolis brokerage firm. They are Piper Jaffray Institutional Government Income Fund, Managers Intermediate Mortgage Fund, Monitor Mortgage Securities Fund, American Government Income Fund, American Government Income Portfolio and American Opportunity Income Fund. The latter three are closed-end funds, which trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
"Our policy is to cooperate with government inquiries but beyond that not to comment," a spokeswoman for Piper said.
The portfolio of another closed-end fund, TCW/DW Term 2000, fell by 19.2 percent. A spokesman for Dean Witter, Discover, which sponsors the fund, could not be reached for comment yesterday.
The eighth fund, Fundamental United States Government Strategic Income, fell by 19.7 percent. A spokesman for Fundamental Portfolio Advisers said he was unaware of any investigation but that the fund's risks were fully disclosed.
In April, the same company's municipal bond fund, New York Muni, settled a complaint by New York State, which accused the fund of failing to tell investors that 40 percent of its assets were invested in risky derivatives. In 1990, the state sued the First Investors Corporation for hiding the risks of its junk bond funds. The firm later settled with New York and other states.
The state's investigation was disclosed by a letter from Mr. Koppell to Mr. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, who is chairman of the House subcommittee on telecommunications and commerce. Last month, Mr. Markey, asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to produce a study of mutual funds' use of derivatives.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Climb On Hopes Fed Won't Act

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The bond market resumed its rally yesterday amid speculation that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to raise interest rates again in the next few weeks.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 13/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, fell to 7.50 percent from 7.54 percent on Friday. Since July 11, the bond market's rally has pushed the yield on the 30-year bond down 23 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent. 
 Growing expectations that the Fed will not raise rates quickly "helped the market," said Terrence Crowe, a trader at the Nikko Securities Company. "It lent a base of support to a market that was cheap and oversold," he said.
Since February, the Federal Reserve has raised the Federal funds rate on overnight bank loans four times, to 4.25 percent, in an effort to rein in inflation, which diminishes the value of bonds.
 
 
Signs of Fed Success
 There is some evidence the Fed's rate increases did their job. Producer prices stayed flat in June, while consumer prices rose an expected three-tenths of 1 percent. On Thursday, bond yields fell 14 basis points in the biggest one-day rally in two months.
Still, traders cautioned that the bond market's gains yesterday came amid light trading.
Wayne D. Angell, a former governor of the Federal Reserve, said yesterday that the Fed's policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, was unlikely to raise overnight bank loan rates again before its meeting next month.
Mr. Angell, who left the Fed in February to become chief economist of Bear, Stearns & Company, said he expected the Federal Open Market Committee to push up rates by about half a percentage point at that meeting, cutting in half his estimate last week. The increase is needed to head off inflation, he said.
"It's already evident that the rate of inflation is on an upward track," he said in an interview. The question, he said, is "where the peak of inflation will occur in this cycle."
Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index is likely to rise to an annual rate of 2.8 percent by the end of 1994 from a 2.5 percent rate through the first half, Mr. Angell said. Treasury 30-year bond yields may reach 8 percent by the end of 1994, he said.
Changes in Treasury bond yields help determine the interest rates on auto and housing loans. Some investors are not expecting the Fed to raise rates much more because the previous rate increases are already slowing the economy.
"We're already seeing housing construction coming off," said Casey Colton, a portfolio manager at the Benham Group of Mountain View, Calif.
More consumers are taking out adjustable-rate mortgages, suggesting they "can no longer afford 9 percent fixed-rate mortgages," he said. The fact that the economy is expanding at a slower pace probably means "the Fed is more than halfway done" raising short rates, he added.
Bond prices already suggest investors and traders are less concerned about the Fed. The so-called yield curve, or spread between short and long rates, is steeper than it was a week ago.
Still, many investors share Mr. Angell's view that the Fed will ultimately raise rates. "Inflation will rise and short-term rates will rise," said Robert Dow, who manages more than $10 billion in fixed-income securities at Lord Abbett & Company.
Treasury prices were also bolstered yesterday by a rise in the dollar against the Japanese yen. For international investors, a stronger dollar produces gains in dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities. In New York, the dollar rose to 98.45 yen, from 97.86 yen on Friday, slightly above its record low of 96.60 yen.
"We're still paying quite a bit of attention to the yen," said Mr. Crowe of Nikko. "The yen's fall lent credibility" to the market rally, he noted.
The following are the results in the Treasury's regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE CAMPAIGN;
COVERAGE OF 95% MIGHT BE ENOUGH, CLINTON CONCEDES

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 19

 BODY:
Suggesting that he was ready for compromise on health care legislation, President Clinton today softened his call for insurance coverage for all Americans, saying 95 percent or 98 percent might do.
One day after the National Governors' Association declined to endorse his proposal that employers pay much of the cost of their workers' insurance, Mr. Clinton repeated his willingness to consider other ways to pay for coverage. But he said his advisers had found serious problems with other methods they had studied, and he repeated his contention that making employers pay was the fairest and most efficient way to finance expanded coverage. 
 In a speech to the governors' group, Mr. Clinton said that his litmus test for any health care legislation would be whether it amounted to "a phased-in, deliberate effort" to achieve universal coverage, and that a plan that would reach at least 95 percent of Americans might be acceptable. Up to now, he has emphasized coverage for "every American."
Currently about 85 percent of Americans have health insurance. Most people who lack coverage live in working households.
Mr. Clinton spoke after Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, delivered a tough speech to the governors in which he staked out a hard-line position on the coming debate over health care. He said the President's proposals for universal coverage and employer mandates were "dead" on the Senate floor, and he accused Mr. Clinton of pushing too hard for too much too quickly.
Hillary Rodham Clinton, in an appearance today on the ABC television program "Good Morning America," said, "The only thing that will work is to get everybody into the system."When Mrs. Clinton was asked if the White House would insist on universal coverage in any bill, she replied, "Well, I think that if you don't insist on it, at least being phased in at some point, you will make the problem worse."
The President's remarks instilled fears among his allies on Capitol Hill that he was retreating even as they tried to shore up his support, and the White House immediately began trying to dispel the impression that he was backing down.
Leon E. Panetta, Mr. Clinton's chief of staff, said: "The President's bottom line is what it has always been -- guaranteed health coverage for every American. And that's what he said to the governors today. Are we willing to discuss ways to guarantee universal coverage? Absolutely. Are we changing the goal? Absolutely not."
Indeed, what Mr. Clinton said today reflected the Administration's longstanding unspoken position: Although Mr. Clinton and his wife have repeatedly talked about "universal coverage," their model is the Social Security system, which reaches about 98 percent of Americans.
But the Administration had never said that in public before. That Mr. Clinton did so today was an important signal to Congress, the governors and the public that, as Congressional leaders prepare their final drafts, he is ready to make a deal.
"We know we're not going to get right at 100 percent," Mr. Clinton said in response to a question after his speech, "but we know that you've got to get somewhere in the ball park of 95 or upwards so that you stop the cost shifting and you have economies of scale for all the small businesses that are participating." Cost shifting occurs when medical care providers raise prices for patients with insurance to cover the cost of care for those who do not.
White House officials said the President had wanted to inject realism into wrangling over what universal coverage might mean and wanted to advertise his flexibility in working with Republicans to find common ground. But they and the President insisted that his comments should in no way be seen as a sign that he had moved his bottom line.
 
Deep Rift Remains
 In particular, Mr. Clinton's conciliatory language did not obscure the clash between the White House and Mr. Dole about how far to go toward meeting the President's goal of providing insurance coverage for all Americans.
In his own speech, Mr. Dole repeated his call for subsidies and changes in insurance regulations to make coverage more widely available. He warned against those who would "push and push and push, and try to have it all."
With the battle over the shape of health care legislation moving into its most crucial phase, the presentations by Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole to the annual gathering of the National Governors' Association added a personal dimension to a debate that has been waged for months at a distance and in abstract terms.
Although the two men never appeared on the stage together, the session otherwise brought some of the theater of a Presidential debate, with their aides scurrying to press rooms afterward to try to manipulate reporters' perceptions.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole were both clearly determined not to be seen as obstructionist, and both were careful to pad their thrusts and to cushion their words with language more typical of veteran negotiators than politicians.
 
Clinton Still Skeptical
 Mr. Clinton also made clear that he still looked with great skepticism on Mr. Dole's plan, which the President warned could raise costs and lead to a decline in the number of Americans with coverage. For example, if insurers were required to offer coverage to all, regardless of their health, but not all people were required to buy insurance, some might put off buying it until they became sick. That would raise the rates for the healthy and cause some people to drop their insurance.
"I am not willing to do something that doesn't work," Mr. Clinton said after his speech. "We must not do something that is a fraud."
On Saturday, the governors said they opposed the Senator's call for strict limits on Federal spending for Medicaid; today, Mr. Dole went out of his way to assure them that he was not committed to that plan and hoped to work with them to resolve the issue.
Mr. Clinton, in turn, went out of his way to reach out to Democratic governors, who on Monday endorsed his goal of universal coverage but remained silent on the question of how to pay for it. While Mr. Clinton said his proposal to require employers to shoulder most of the burden was "the best and fairest way," he was more explicit than he had been before in saying that he would be open to alternatives.
The President's remarks, regardless of how he intended them, added to the anxiety level on Capitol Hill and might make the Democratic leaders' already difficult job that much harder. Particularly in the House, the leaders have been trying hard to get members to commit themselves to a requirement that employers pay for the bulk of their workers' insurance.
But the melding process continued on Capitol Hill. The House leadership met with the committee leaders who are trying to get a consensus bill, largely patterned on a measure passed by the Ways and Means Committee. They expect to have this bill ready by the end of the week and will begin shopping it around to members of the Democratic caucus, looking for further refinements that can get them up to 218 votes, the number needed for passage.
 
Watching Mitchell
 But they are also hoping for some signal, by the end of the week, of what Senator George J. Mitchell, the majority leader, will be able to accomplish. Representative Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the House, was asked today what he would do if Mr. Mitchell reported that he simply did not have the votes for any kind of employer mandate.
Mr. Foley replied, "I will say, 'George, I'm sure you're wrong.' "
Mr. Foley today reiterated his determination to get a vote on a health care bill before the House adjourns for its August recess. That is scheduled to begin Aug. 12, but many predict that the date will be pushed back.
In their appearances at the governors' conference today, both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole cast themselves as tireless fighters who are determined that health care legislation will clear Congress by fall. Mr. Dole said he would ask Congress to forsake its summer vacation if necessary, a move Mr. Clinton praised as "most encouraging."
But while the President did not do so directly, he plainly referred to what he regards as the greatest flaw in Senator Dole's health care plan: its reliance on an overhaul of insurance rules. Several times, Mr. Clinton reminded the governors that efforts by the states to expand access to health care through similar changes had met with little success.
For his part, Senator Dole said: "As far as the employer mandate, that may happen sometime. It's not going to happen this year." He added: "You only have to count to 100 in the Senate. I think we've got the votes, and I don't think that's going to change in the next 30 days."
"I think the seeds of a bipartisan plan still exist," Mr. Dole said, "if the Administration is willing to come our way."

HEADLINE: TO THE MOON;
Earthly Worries Supplant Euphoria of Moon Shots

BYLINE: JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
Twenty-five years ago today, much of humanity listened to Neil Armstrong's first words on the moon and pondered the implications of his "giant leap for mankind." It was a day for taking stock and looking ahead, for prophesying the technological marvels and perils of the next quarter-century, and as usual it turns out that the prophets erred.
Their two biggest mistakes were failing to foresee two things: 
 As of 1994, the Moon still is not habitable for humans.
As of 1994, the Earth still is.
From today's perspective the moon landing looks like a spectacular achievement with few immediate practical consequences, but 25 years ago it inspired happy predictions of nuclear-powered space colonies as well as apocalyptic laments that technology was destroying Spaceship Earth. Like so much else in the late 1960's, the moon walk was a polarizing event, greeted by street celebrations of Yankee ingenuity and by protest demonstrations against American wastefulness.
The ambivalence was reflected in The New York Times's coverage, which featured its largest headline ever, photographs of enraptured crowds watching television screens in Central Park and Trafalgar Square and an editorial hailing "a new era leading to realms beyond comprehension." But the paper also quoted some remarkably gloomy intellectuals and warned in the editorial, "As man gains another world -- with the prospect of adding another and still another, literally ad infinitum -- he stands in imminent danger of losing his own."
The most unusual news judgment of the day was exercised by Communist journalists. The moon landing was the fifth story on the Soviet Union's nightly news program -- well behind the lead items saluting Soviet metal workers and Polish Liberation Day. The official Chinese media preferred to ignore it altogether. A headline in Hong Kong's Communist newspaper ran "The American People Pray: God, Give Me a Piece of Bread, Don't Give Me the Moon."
But just about everywhere else on Earth people followed the Apollo 11 mission. They listened to transistor radios around fires in Zambian villages and in the courtyards of Buddhist temples in Bangkok. They shouted "formidable" at the Science Museum in Paris and sang a new hymn in Greek churches. Holidays were proclaimed around the world. Babies were named Apollo and Luna.
From the Vatican observatory Pope Paul VI offered greetings to the "conquerors of the moon, pale lamp of our nights and our dreams." The director of Britain's Jodrell Bank Observatory, Sir Bernard Lovell, said the landing "opens the most enormous opportunities for future exploration of the universe."
President Richard M. Nixon told the astronauts that it was the proudest day of every American's life. Later, upon their return to Earth, he would call it "the greatest week in the history of the world since the Creation." Former President Lyndon B. Johnson said the landing proved America "can do anything that needs to be done."
A future President, Ronald Reagan, was one of thousands who joined the waiting list that summer for the first commercial flight to the moon. It was scheduled for the year 2000, which today looks a little early technologically and a little late commercially, since the reservations were being taken by the now-defunct Pan American World Airways.
But 2000 seemed a conservative schedule to some experts in July of 1969. Thomas Paine, the administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, was quoted in Time magazine predicting a $5,000 lunar vacation by 1990: "There is no question that we can reduce the cost of travel to the moon to the cost of traveling through the air today." The magazine went on to describe the low-gravity appeal of the diving board at a domed lunar resort.
 
Mars and Beyond
 Isaac Asimov wrote that the moon's rocks might contain clues to the evolution of life and thereby lead to a cure for cancer. Another science writer, D. S. Halacy Jr., predicted that by 1994 there would be teen-agers who had been born and bred in of Lunar City. Plans for lunar laboratories, mines, and factories were common.
"By the year 2000," the rocket scientist Dr. Wernher von Braun forecast, "we will undoubtedly have a sizable operation on the moon, we will have achieved a manned Mars landing and it's entirely possible we will have flown with men to the outer planets."
That sense of optimism was shared by some of the prominent figures who contributed statements to The Times the day of the moon landing. The Dalai Lama envisioned space travel imbuing human knowledge with "a new dimension of infinite scope, development and dynamism." The architect R. Buckminster Fuller advocated further space exploration and called the moon landing "the dead-center of evolutionary events." The poet Rod McKuen urged people to love the astronauts.
But others were not impressed. "It means nothing to me," Picasso said. Some were downright hostile. The novelist Arthur Koestler lamented humanity's "unprecedented spiritual vacuum" and declared: "Prometheus is reaching out for the stars with an empty grin on his face."
Lewis Mumford, the historian and urbanologist, called the moon landing "a symbolic act of war" by a "megatechnic power system, in the lethal grip of the 'myth of the machine.' " He predicted that the "very triumphs of technology" would soon turn the planet into either a lunatic asylum or a crematorium.
Rene Dubos, the microbiologist, called the "incredibly efficient technology" controlling the astronauts a "dreaded portent of what could happen to our lives," and he hoped the moon missions would lead ecologists to create "a theology of the earth." The psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton said the moon landing was a "painful reminder of the terrible gap between technology and imagination."
There was so much angst that the psychologist Kenneth B. Clark, after bemoaning the social needs neglected during the moon mission, added a reminder to everyone: "But our triumph on the moon need not be an occasion for despair." And Eugene Ionesco, the playwright, complained that writers and intellectuals were showing "an astonishing lack of good will" toward "an extraordinary event of incalculable significance."
The lack of good will was partly a reflection of the era. The Vietnam War engendered hostility to the government, and urban riots made social problems seem more pressing than ever. Ecologists had published best sellers predicting catastrophic cancer epidemics, planetwide famines and resource shortages; those doomsday forecasts, along with photographs of Spaceship Earth taken from the moon, helped launch the environmental movement on Earth Day, the spring after Apollo 11.
The lack of good will also reflected a traditional suspicion of new technology. Tom Wolfe, who chronicled the early space program in "The Right Stuff," explains the hostility to NASA by citing Thorstein Veblen's "Theory of the Leisure Class."
"Veblen's great insight was that anything that is useful does not indicate high status," Mr. Wolfe said recently in an interview. "That's why intellectuals don't like science, and why engineering particularly has been considered low rent. The moon landing was an astonishing accomplishment -- it was staggering that we happened to be alive at the moment -- and it should have gladdened even the heart of an intellectual. But that's a project almost as difficult as getting to the moon."
According to Veblen's theory, the Apollo program's status should have improved since 1969, because the moon landing is not looking very useful from today's perspective. The collapse of Soviet Communism has eliminated one of the rationales for the space program, and in retrospect it is debatable whether the manned missions made much practical difference in the cold war beyond serving as sensational propaganda.
The Apollo program did yield scientific findings and technical innovations, but most of them could have been obtained more cheaply through unmanned missions, which have become an increasingly attractive alternative, thanks to advances in computers, robotics, and communication equipment. And the once-popular idea that a giant bureaucracy like the Apollo program could be a model for technological problem solving has lost favor now that corporate and government engineers -- even at NASA -- are stressing small, decentralized operations.
Mining on the moon seems even less economical now that most earthly mineral prices are lower than they were a quarter-century ago, and the $5,000 lunar vacation gets more remote every time the space shuttle has another delay and cost overrun. Some enthusiasts support expensive new missions for the sheer adventure and glory of exploration. But they haven't had much luck persuading politicians and the public ever since 1972, when Eugene A. Cernan got into the Apollo 17 lunar module and muttered just before liftoff the last words on the moon: "Let's get this mother out of here."
"People lost interest once the Apollo landings became routine," said Joseph Corn, a historian at Stanford University who has analyzed past technological predictions in several books, including "Imagining Tomorrow: History, Technology, and the American Future." He said the reaction to the moon landing 25 years ago resembled the overenthusiastic reaction to the first airplane flights, when some predicted a plane in every garage. But at least the plane enthusiasts had something tangible to help sustain interest.
 
'Never a Necessary Technology'
 "The barnstormers would visit every tiny community and take someone up for a ride, and everyone could imagine exactly what purpose a plane served," Dr. Corn said. "But nothing really came of the Apollo program. It was never a necessary technology -- like the need to pump out a coal mine that led to the steam engine -- and they never offered the vacations or anything that was meaningful to people in economic or social terms. Its only purpose seemed to be philosophical or religious."
It's possible, of course, that today's lack of enthusiasm for manned space exploration will seem terribly shortsighted 25 years from now. New technology might somehow make lunar settlements practical. But that is not the prediction of Dr. John Maddox, a prophet with the distinction of having a decent track record going back a quarter-century.
 
Rebutting the Catastrophists
 Mr. Maddox, now the editor of the British science journal Nature, was busy during the Apollo program debunking the technological enthusiasts as well as the pessimists. He not only criticized manned moon missions as an extravagance that would lead nowhere, he went on to publish a book, "The Doomsday Syndrome," in 1972, rebutting the catastrophists of the 1960's. He argued that Spaceship Earth had a lot more carrying capacity and ecological resilience than any spaceship envisioned by the doomsayers.
Dr. Maddox is sticking with those predictions for the 50th anniversary of the moon landing. On this planet, he expects a continuation of the technological changes that have been gradually increasing the food supply, income and life expectancy of the average human. And away from this planet, he doesn't expect much of anything for the average human.
"This business of carting people around the solar system is going to remain enormously difficult," he said, "and for the foreseeable future there's no worthwhile purpose for it." He can imagine humans someday scanning for dangerous earthbound asteroids from an observatory on the moon, or perhaps a satellite of Jupiter, but not until much better spaceships are available -- which he does not expect soon.
"I hope this won't make me sound too crusty," he said, "but my guess is that this sort of space travel is 250 years down the road." He did not venture to guess whether Pan Am would be back in business by then.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE PUBLIC;
STRONG SUPPORT FOR HEALTH PLANS

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

 BODY:
Amid the cacophony of warring health care plans and partisan jibes, the public remains strongly committed to getting a plan passed and continues to endorse universal coverage.
Americans are now as concerned about health care as they are about crime, and a majority say they are willing to pay higher taxes to make sure everyone is insured, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. 
 Eight in 10 polled continue to say that it was "very important" that every American receive health insurance coverage.
"The President should not compromise on that," said Roberta Lake, a 21-year-old graduate of Wooster College in Ohio who has moved back to her mother's house in Maryland until she begins an internship with the dean of black students at Wooster. "This is a biggie for me because I was diagnosed last summer with multiple sclerosis, and I'm not insured. The percentage of Americans who would get left out are those who need it most."
Miss Lake was one of the respondents who agreed to follow-up interviews after participating in the nationwide telephone poll of 1,339 adults, taken Thursday through Sunday. The poll has a margin of sampling error plus or minus three percentage points.
President Clinton is still having trouble getting traction on a spectrum of issues. His overall job approval rating slipped slightly to 42 percent, just about the same percentage that elected him in 1992, and public confidence on his foreign affairs performance continues to erode.
While he has succeeded in pushing health care to the top of the national agenda, Mr. Clinton has not benefited from it politically because he is mired in growing skepticism about Washington's ability to quickly pass any sort of health care plan.
Most people said they would be disappointed if Congress never passes a health care plan, and a substantial number -- 39 percent -- said they would be less likely to re-elect a member of Congress who voted against a health care plan.
The yearning for overhauling the health care system and attaining universal coverage clearly has a wistful side, since 78 percent of those polled now say they think Congress will not be able to agree on a plan before the end of the year.
Leonard Smith, 40, an unemployed plumber and part-time farmer from a town in southeastern Iowa called Figourney -- "You know, like that actress Sigourney Weaver" -- sees it this way: "Clinton's trying to do something that needs to be done, but he himself doesn't have the power to do diddly squat. If the Democrats are for something, the Republicans automatically think they have to be against it. They won't work for what's right."
If Mr. Smith was resigned, Estia Douglas, 68, a grandmother and Democrat from Orlando, Fla., was riled. "The Republicans are coming up with a lot of garbage about how we can't afford to cover everybody," she said. "Well, we couldn't afford to send a man on the moon either, but we did, didn't we?"
Although the public has a clear preference for universal coverage, a slight majority believed that it would be all right if Mr. Clinton compromised at 95 percent coverage.
"It'll have to be scaled down, it'll never pass the way it is," Mr. Smith said. "Clinton is like the guy who wants $75 for his bicycle so he asks $150 to start with. It's just a selling game."
 
Clinton Compromise Urged
 Roma Templeton, 39, an office supervisor from League City, near Houston, agreed that the President "should compromise on a few things to get it passed and then work on those things later."
She said she was not averse to higher taxes. "Either you pay more in taxes or you pay more in health care," she said. "It's one or the other."
Like others interviewed, she suggested that perhaps Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, should have brought the country along a little more slowly. "The way he presented it, he just threw this whole big, huge issue at you. No one had time to digest it or pick it apart. Whenever someone acts like it's his way or no way, I just draw a line in the dirt and say I ain't crossing that line."
Reflecting the deepening disillusionment with Washington, there has been a slight erosion in the size of the majority that believes it is the Government's responsibility to guarantee medical coverage, and in the size of the majority that is willing to pay higher taxes to get universal coverage.
 
Split on Employer Mandates
 The public was split on the issue of employer mandates and abortion coverage.
Forty-nine percent said employers should be required to pay most of the cost of health insurance for all their workers, while 40 percent said employers should only be required to offer their workers a chance to buy their own health insurance.
Fifty-three percent said abortion should not be covered by a basic health care plan, but 16 percent wanted abortion automatically covered, and 28 percent said it should be an available option.
As the Clintons lead a selling blitz this week on their health care plan, they will at least find an audience that agrees that the problem is pressing. For the first time this year, when asked to name the most important problem facing the country, 19 percent chose health care, equal to the 19 percent that cited crime and violence.
Hillary Rodham Clinton's favorability rating has risen slightly from last spring, with 38 percent now expressing a positive view and 26 percent a negative one.
Some of the male respondents interviewed after the poll talked about their lingering difficulty in adjusting to a First Lady with overt power.
Charles Jansen, a 72-year-old retired electronic technician from Wichita, Kan., said Mrs. Clinton should not be helping make appointments since she was not elected. Mr. Jansen, a Democrat, was asked what his wife, a Republican, thought.
"I'm afraid to ask her," he replied.
Summoning up his nerve, he asked his wife, Dorothy, how she felt about the First Lady and reported back: "She gave a typical wife answer, that the woman should have input into White House decisions."
The President's rating on handling the economy has been stable for months at 43 percent. But, peppered by stories about Haiti, Rwanda, Bosnia and North Korea, Americans are more dubious about the 47-year-old President's ability to navigate the gray waters of this nerve-racking post-cold war world. The approval of his foreign policy stewardship has slipped to 36 percent, from 50 percent in January.
Asked about Mr. Clinton's ability to deal "wisely" with a difficult international crisis, only 32 percent expressed confidence, while 64 percent said they were uneasy.
"He drifts a little bit too much," Mr. Jansen said. "Right or wrong, he should pick out a way and stay with it."
"He's a great talker, he says a lot of stuff I like to hear, but then nothing happens," Mr. Jansen continued, adding somewhat cheerfully, "I'm not going to be around in another 10 years, so I won't have to worry about it anyway."
 
Integrity Rating Is Steady
 Although some White House officials worry that Paula Jones's sexual harassment suit might be a drag on the President's poll numbers, a majority of those surveyed continued to say that Mr. Clinton has "about the same honesty and integrity as other Presidents."
With Congressional hearings on the Whitewater matter starting next week, nearly half of those polled continued to reserve judgment on whether the Clintons did anything wrong.
Her words laced with the twang of her native West Virginia, Mrs. Douglas, the Orlando grandmother, declared that Mr. Clinton was "the greatest President we've had in my lifetime."
"We never had a President who didn't go golfing or messing around all the time, making it a play day up there at the White House," she said indignantly. "Bill Clinton's up there working with all his might, even with all the garbage that's thrown at him. Sooner or later, intelligent people will catch on that they're not doing the man justice. He's giving his all."
 
How the Poll Was Taken
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted July 14 to 17 with 1,339 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age, and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups, the potential sampling error is larger. For example, for blacks, it is plus or minus nine percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in question wording or the order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.

Chart: "DIARY: Health Care Developments"
 
YESTERDAY
President Clinton and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, addressed the nation's governors on health care while leaders in Congress continued their work on legislation.
 
GOVERNORS
 In a speech to the National Governors' Association, President Clinton softened his call for insurance coverage for all Americans, saying that 95 percent or 98 percent might do. One day after the governors rejected his proposal that employers pay much of the cost of their workers' insurance, Mr. Clinton suggested to the group at its meeting in Boston that he would consider other financing methods, though he thought employer payments were fairest and best. Senator Dole, speaking before Mr. Clinton, said the President had tried to do too much, too soon. He added that the President's proposals for universal coverage financed in large part by payments from employers were "dead" in the Senate.
 
WHITE HOUSE
 In an appearance on the ABC News program "Good Morning America," Hillary Rodham Clinton endorsed coverage for everyone. "The only thing that will work is to get everybody into the system," she said. Asked if the White House would insist on universal coverage in any bill, she replied, "Well, I think that if you don't insist on it at least being phased in at some point, you will make the problem worse."
 
CONGRESS
 The Democratic leadership in the House met with heads of the health committees, who are putting together an initial effort at a consensus bill. They expect to have it ready by the end of the week, and will begin showing it to members of the Democratic caucus, looking for further refinements that can get them to 218 votes, the number needed for passage. Speaker Thomas S. Foley repeated his determination to get a vote on a bill before the House adjourns for its August recess, now scheduled to begin Aug. 12, but widely predicted to be pushed back.
 
LOBBYISTS
Rock the Vote, the group that organized a campaign to get young people to register to vote in 1992, began an effort to distribute a million copies of a nonpartisan guide to health proposals. Organizers also released a survey that found that many young people had to forego medical care in the past year because they could not afford it. (pg. A12)

HEADLINE: Italian Withdraws Divisive Edict That Freed Corruption Suspects

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ROME, July 19

 BODY:
Bowing to a revolt within his divided coalition Government, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi today withdrew a six-day-old decree that had been widely denounced as an effort to cover up white-collar crime.
Mr. Berlusconi, whose coalition emerged from elections in March, said the decree, which changed the rules on preventive detention, would be replaced by a bill to be sent to Parliament. The bill, said a Government spokesman, Giuliano Ferrara, would also allow detention for serious crimes against the public, including bribery and corruption. 
 The crisis began last week, when the announcement of the decree prompted investigating magistrates in Milan to threaten to resign. The magistrates, whose role is similar to that of a district attorney in the United States, were led by Antonio Di Pietro, who has guided the two-year corruption investigation. Prosecutors investigating the Mafia also warned that they would be hamstrung.
After the announcement today, the Milan magistrates' supervisor, Francesco Saverio Borelli, called on them to withdraw their threats of resignation. But it remains unclear whether they will heed the call.
In the first days after the announcement of the decree, more than 1,100 suspects were released from jail. The measure of public anger became evident in angry scenes at prison gates, where crowds gathered to shout insults and toss coins at prominent politicians and former Government ministers as they left.
One of those released was the former Minister of Health, Francesco De Lorenzo. The number also included business executives and common criminals, all of them under investigation for crimes ranging from corruption to extortion. Those suspected of more serious crimes and those who might tamper with evidence or seek to influence the corruption investigations were placed under house arrest.
It remained unclear whether judges would be able to return those freed to jail. Giovanni Palombarini, a member of the Superior Council of Magistrates, a kind of judicial oversight body, said the release of suspects would be difficult to reverse.
At a news conference this evening, Mr. Berlusconi described himself as "saddened and bitter" at the charges that he had pushed the decree past his Cabinet in order to favor friends or associates. "Perhaps we communicated poorly," he said.
As the crisis evidently passed, the lira revived on foreign exchange markets and stock prices recovered from their recent tumble.
Until now the Government of Mr. Berlusconi, a successful businessman before he entered politics in January, has done virtually nothing to tackle Italy's economic problems, focusing its first steps instead on replacing the directors of state television, appointing new directors for the intelligence services and then issuing the decree on preventive detention.
The decree, issued less than a week after Mr. Berlusconi's younger brother, Paolo, was indicted on corruption charges, provoked a storm of protest. Paolo Berlusconi was detained briefly earlier this year but he has not been in preventive detention; thus he was not affected by the decree or its rescinding.
But several senior officials of Mr. Berlusconi's big Fininvest holding company are also under investigation, prompting accusations that the decree was aimed at taking the pressure off close associates and friends of the Prime Minister.
 
Coalition Cracks
 In one bitter cartoon, the opposition daily La Repubblica showed a smiling Mr. Berlusconi standing on the beach and welcoming former Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, suitcase in hand and an oriental carpet slung over his shoulder, as he emerges from the waters of the Mediterranean. Mr. Craxi, a close personal friend of Mr. Berlusconi, was the focus of many of the investigations but he has chosen self-exile in Morocco in order to avoid trial.
But the challenge for Mr. Berlusconi came when his coalition partners, the right-wing National Alliance and the separatist Northern League, withdrew their backing and threatened to bring the decree down in Parliament. Cabinet decrees remain in force for 60 days unless they are rejected by Parliament; they are ordinarily reserved for emergencies that require immediate action.
The decree would have prevented judicial investigators from ordering preventive detention for suspects in cases of corruption and certain other offenses, and barred journalists from identifying suspects before their judicial investigations were complete.
On Monday Mr. Berlusconi went on two of the television stations owned by Fininvest to defend the decree, arguing that it was aimed at protecting suspects' civil liberties. But he did give his first signs of relenting, saying the decree was subject to improvement.
 
Coalition Regroups
 Preventive detention sometimes offered investigators the only means of extracting confessions in the vast web of kickbacks that for years financed Italy's political parties, and often their leaders' luxuries. Moreover, the publishing of the names of prominent suspects was a potent tool used by investigators to prevent having their inqiries swept under the rug.
Mr. Berlusconi's coalition partners welcomed the reversal.
Gianfranco Fini, leader of the National Alliance, called it "an act of reason."
"There are neither victors nor vanquished," he said, in words evidently intended to heal wounds.
Umberto Bossi, head of the Northern League, said, "Good sense has prevailed."
In a letter today, both men had indicated to Mr. Berlusconi that the decree was politically untenable because it had generated "vast opposition" and had created a "clear political division within the Government."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Citicorp and Chemical Report a Solid Quarter

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
The environment for banks remained surprisingly fertile in the second quarter, as big banks continue to report solid profits despite the sharp rise of interest rates.
Citicorp, the nation's largest bank, said yesterday that its second-quarter profits were $877 million, nearly double the level of a year ago. Its profits were increased by tax benefits and the restructuring of Brazil's long past-due debt. But the bank's core business still performed slightly better than expected. 
Similarly Chemical Bank, the nation's fourth largest, and a host of regional banks including Wells Fargo and Banc One, all reported profits yesterday that met or exceeded analysts' expectations.
To be sure, rising interest rates and volatile currency markets continued to be a dark cloud over bank trading rooms. At Citicorp, the largest currency trader in the world, trading revenue was $159 million for the second quarter, down 72.5 percent from $572 million a year ago. But that level was up from its particularly meager $71 million in the first quarter of this year. Chemical's traders performed slightly better, posting revenue of $203 million in the first quarter, down 31.9 percent from $298 million a year ago and up from $185 million last quarter.
But generally most banks have been helped by increasing loan demand and declining write-offs from bad loans. These gains have only partly been offset by narrowing of margins from higher interest rates.
Nonetheless, bank stocks fell sharply yesterday. For example, Citicorp fell $1.25, to $40.75, in part because investors were concerned by the high level of special items that increased the bank's earnings, said Diane B. Glossman, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. Nonetheless, she said that even before the unusual items, the bank earnings have met expectations.
Citibank's revenue, other than trading, was up 6 percent from the previous year. "We're not satisfied with that level," said Thomas Jones, the company's principal financial officer. "Revenue will be a key issue for us from now on."
Citicorp's consumer business earned $411 million in the quarter, up 39 percent from a year ago. The biggest gains resulted from lower losses from bad credit card loans in the United States.
The Brazilian debt agreement affected $2.7 billion in old loans to Brazil that the bank had written down to a value of 30 cents on the dollar, or $818 million. As part of the debt restructuring agreement, Citicorp traded its old loans and $221 million in cash to Brazil in return for bonds worth about $1.4 billion. It used the gain of about $318 million to increase its reserve set aside to cover future loan losses and, therefore, this gain did not add to the bank's earnings.
The bank's pretax profits for the second quarter were increased by a $173 million gain from Brazil's payment, with bonds, of past-due interest. In the quarter Citicorp also earned $71 million from selling other Brazilian bonds and it lost $157 million from writing down some other bad Latin American investments.
Citicorp's holdings of problem North American real estate fell by $343 million in the quarter to $3.4 billion, down a third from a year ago.
Citicorp also recognized $150 million in tax benefits left over from its losses in the late 1980s.
The bank continued to rebuild its capital base, which still trails its competitors. Citicorp's Tier 1 capital, the Government's main measure of a bank's ability to withstand financial shocks, increased to 7.1 percent of its assets, from 6.9 percent at the end of the first quarter.
Over all, Chemical Banking said it earned $357 million for the second quarter, down 6.3 percent from $381 million a year ago. But since last year's figure included $54 million in tax benefits, Chemical's earnings were up 9 percent on a comparable basis.
The bank's earnings from interest rose slightly, to $1.19 million, from $1.18 million a year ago. But noninterest revenue fell by 17 percent, to $867 million, mainly because of the decline in trading.
Bad loans were $2.5 billion, down $710 million, or 22 percent, from March 31 and were half the level of a year ago. And the provision for bad loans fell to $160 million, from $363 million a year ago.

HEADLINE: Number of Haitians Fleeing by Sea Drops Off Abruptly

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, July 19

 BODY:
The number of Haitians intercepted by the United States Coast Guard while trying to flee their country aboard boats has dropped sharply in recent days.
Not a single Haitian was reported to have been picked up on the high seas last weekend, compared with 1,344 people aboard 30 vessels the previous weekend and 12,345 during the first week of July. For Monday, the figure was a single boat with 170 people on board, the Coast Guard reported. 
 "The numbers look good," Stanley Schrager, a spokesman for the American Embassy here, said today. "They look down."
 
A 'Pressure Point' Eased
 The decline, which began a week ago, "takes one pressure point off the board for the moment, and allows a little more time for the sanctions to work," Mr. Schrager added, apparently alluding to the possibility of an American invasion to remove the military junta that has governed Haiti since the ouster of the elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, by a coup in 1991.
After visiting processing centers for Haitian refugees at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station in Cuba and in the Turks and Caicos Islands, Representative Bill Richardson, Democrat from New Mexico and the deputy majority House whip, arrived in Haiti on Monday and met with Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras and his chief of staff before leaving for the Dominican Republic this morning.
American officials said Mr. Richardson had sought to convince General Cedras that Congressional support for the Clinton Administration's policy on Haiti remained strong and, in Mr. Schrager's words, also discussed possible "modalities of the general's departure."
General Cedras was said by American and Haitian officials to have reiterated his longstanding position, which is that he will step down only when his three-year term as commander in chief of the Haitian military expires early next year.
Mr. Richardson said in a telephone interview today that he came away from the meeting with General Cedras only "mildly optimistic that perhaps there's a chance to resolve this issue without using military force."
"One of my objectives was to disabuse them of divisions in American policy, and that the Congress would ultimately support the President if he took military action," said Mr. Richardson, who said he opposed an invasion.
He said tighter sanctions were having only mixed success. For example, while crossing into Haiti from the Dominican Republic, he saw rowboats carrying containers of gasoline across Lake Jimani to Haiti.
Mr. Richardson said he was not carrying any messages from the Administration and had not delivered any ultimatums to the junta.
 
Meets Dominican President
 Before arriving here, Mr. Richardson met in the Dominican Republic with President Joaquin Balaguer, to discuss the Haitian crisis and efforts to improve enforcement of economic sanctions along the Dominican border.
Though the flow of refugees from Haiti has begun to fall, government repression of political activities continues unabated. On Monday night and again today, the police raided separate meetings called by two nascent political parties, including one sponsored by Mayor Evans Paul of Port-au-Prince, who remains loyal to Father Aristide. Local radio reports said several people had been arrested, and others in attendance beaten. This afternoon, Mr. Paul took refuge in the French Embassy here.
The initial decline in departures of boat people was apparently partly because of choppy seas. In addition, relief workers and diplomats said, some Haitians may have decided to delay their departure until they had a chance to watch the World Cup final on July 17, which brought most activities here to a virtual halt.
More fundamentally, word has now filtered into the hinterlands that Washington will no longer allow refugees intercepted at sea to settle in the United States.
Members of the clergy and relief workers in areas that have produced large numbers of boat people also report that the military government's efforts to prevent an outflow of refugees have increased. The military is said to regard a large and uncontrollable exodus of boat people as the only phenomenon certain to provoke eventual military intervention by the United States.
As a consequence, "the repression has become ferocious" in some of the coastal towns that are popular staging areas, said a Roman Catholic volunteer who works in one such place in Haiti's southern peninsula.

HEADLINE: Democrats Pick Chicago for Convention

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 19

 BODY:
Hoping to erase the stain of the violent 1968 convention from the image of the Democratic Party and the city of Chicago, party officials said today that they had selected this proud Midwestern city as host for their 1996 Presidential nominating convention.
Mayor Richard M. Daley is clearly eager to burnish the image of the Daley family and the city itself. His father, the late Mayor Richard J. Daley, was seen on national television during the 1968 convention cutting off irate delegates and defending the brute force used against Vietnam War protesters by his police officers. 
 Indeed, the Mayor, who said he had not received word of the party's decision, became somewhat defensive about 1968 in an interview today. "It could have been any place in the country," he said. "It was the right place but the wrong time, 1968, with Vietnam, the Kennedy assassination, the King assassination."
Asked whether Chicago could erase the negative image from 26 years ago by acting as host to the convention, Mayor Daley snapped, "Take New York. You have your images. I don't know if you've erased your images."
 
No Convention Since 1968
 Beginning with the Republican convention that nominated Abraham Lincoln in 1860, Chicago has been the site of 24 major party conventions, more than any other city. But the parties have stayed clear of it since 1968, when Hubert H. Humphrey won the Democratic Presidential nomination here. That convention was thrust into turmoil when the police attacked thousands of Vietnam War protesters who had come to Chicago from around the country.
Now, Democratic officials say, it is time for the party to come back. Although they have not yet completed a contract with the city, several senior officials from the party and the White House, speaking on the condition of anonymity, described that as a technicality because President Clinton had signed off on the choice.
The Democrats have tentatively scheduled an announcement for late next week by the party chairman, David Wilhelm, a former Chicagoan who has made clear that this city is his sentimental favorite.
"There's nothing here that's deal threatening," said one official, who refused to be identified. "It's just nailing down the fine print." The officials cautioned that the timing of the announcement could be put off as final details were worked out.
While not confirming the choice, Gordon Giffin, an Atlanta lawyer who heads the Democrats' site selection committee, acknowledged that the talks with Chicago had progressed far beyond those with other cities. Chicago's bid, Mr. Griffin said, was "probably the most comprehensive response of any city."
 
$32 Million Bid
 The officials said Chicago's offer of $32 million in the form of facilities and services was more generous than the bids of the other contenders -- New Orleans, New York and San Antonio. Chicago was also compelling for political reasons: Mr. Clinton carried Illinois in 1992 and desperately needs to win it again to retain his base in the Rust Belt. A convention here would highlight the importance of Middle America to the Democratic Party.
Other advantages for Chicago are that Hillary Rodham Clinton was reared in the area, and the President owes political debts both to Mayor Daley and his brother, William, a lawyer who coordinated last year's White House drive for passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Besides the $100 million economic boon that city officials estimate a national convention would bring, this city's political and business leaders view it as an opportunity to redeem Chicago's reputation.
"New York got it. Why shouldn't we get it?" Mayor Daley asked in the interview. "We're centrally located; we got the hotels; we got the new stadium, things like that."
 
A Gala TV Show
 William Daley also dismissed the talk of 1968. "It's not something that people in Chicago think about," he said. "Most people who will come for the convention weren't even born then."
But conventions these days are nothing more than gala television shows, and the risk for the Democrats is that the images in '96 would undoubtedly be juxtaposed throughout the weeklong event with film of the beatings by police outside the Conrad Hilton Hotel in 1968.
The hotel is a 10-minute cab ride from the United Center, where the 1996 gathering will be held. It is a 25,000-seat complex adjacent to housing projects in poor neighborhoods on the city's West Side, across the street from the old Chicago Stadium. Construction workers today were putting the final touches on the sidewalks around the gray and beige center, which is scheduled to open by September.
Some Democrats are also fearful that a Democratic convention here would be marred by stories about Representative Dan Rostenkowski, a Democratic titan on Capitol Hill -- and in this city -- who was indicted on May 31 on 17 felony counts.
"What are they going there for? To exorcise old demons?" asked Martin P. Wattenberg, a political science professor at the University of California at Irvine, who said the choice of Chicago was a political mistake. "The first President of the Woodstock generation goes back to Chicago to say, 'We're all together now.' "
Chicago has also bid for the Republican convention, but that party is not expected to select a host city until next January. The Democrats have insisted on an exclusivity clause prohibiting Chicago from also acting as host to the Republicans in 1996. Mr. Daley said today that while he had hoped the city would be the site of both conventions, he would agree to the clause.
 
Longtime Favorite
 Some civic and political leaders have said they would prefer that Chicago host the Republicans instead because there would be fewer comparisons to 1968 and because, by some estimates, the Republican delegates would spend more. The Democratic convention is scheduled for the last full week in August; the Republican convention would end a week earlier.
Chicago had been the Democrats' favorite all along, followed by New Orleans and San Antonio. New York was out of favor since it had the 1992 convention; officials also said the city was not as appealing politically because Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is a Republican.
Donald R. Sweitzer, political director for the Democratic National Committee, emphasized that there was never a flawless convention city. "Any city or region you pick, there will be problems," Mr. Sweitzer said. "But there's a lot of enthusiasm in our party to go to Chicago, a great Democratic city."

HEADLINE: Mastercard Plans to Move 540 Employees to Westchester

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
Mastercard International will move all of its 540 employees in New York City to Westchester County next year, the company said yesterday.
While negotiations on a new building have not been completed, real-estate brokers familiar with the situation said the most likely new site is a vacant building owned by I.B.M. in Harrison, N.Y. 
 In June, company officials had said that they were considering moving most of the New York employees to a new suburban site. But they had insisted that the company would at least keep its global headquarters division, about 90 people, in the city.
"Employees and managers alike kept asking us, wouldn't it make more sense to keep everyone together in one place," F. David Brangaccio, a senior vice president of Mastercard, said in an interview on Monday. "So we reopened that question."
 
Turnaround for Company
 Although the number of jobs moving out of the city is small, the symbolic impact could be greater. "This is a sign that a major company feels it can operate effectively outside New York," said the chief executive of a large New York real-estate company, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Officials of the New York City Economic Development Corporation declined to comment on Mastercard's plans, since the company has not officially announced its move. Mastercard has scheduled a meeting to announce the move to its employees tomorrow.
The planned move represents a major turnaround for Mastercard.
Four years ago, the company, which was fast outgrowing its space at 888 Seventh Avenue at 53d Street, began an intensive study of where to set up shop. Last year, it announced its decision to stay in Manhattan. It leased nine floors at 1345 Avenue of the Americas at 55th Street, the old Burlington Industries building, and began making plans to move in by next May.
 
Seeking Option to Buy
 But Alex W. (Pete) Hart, who was Mastercard's president and was one of Manhattan's biggest champions, resigned in January, and his successor, H. Eugene Lockhart, decided that Manhattan was too expensive.
An internal memo faxed to The New York Times by an employee yesterday said that by moving to Harrison rather than to Burlington House, Mastercard will save $200 million over 20 years. The company has already sublet most of the Burlington House space, Jana Weatherbee, a spokeswoman for Mastercard, said.
The company is down to the wire on negotiations with the International Business Machines Corporation to take over the vacant I.B.M. building, at 2000 Purchase Street in Harrison, N.Y. I.B.M. had wanted to sell the building, which it vacated as part of its retrenchment, but Mastercard is holding out for a lease with an option to buy. But Mr. Brangaccio said the company was also still talking to Gateway One, a 525,000-square-foot building on North Lexington Avenue in White Plains, and may announce the move to its employees without specifying a new location.
The I.B.M. building, at 425,000 square feet, is much larger than the 350,000 square feet that Mastercard had leased in Burlington House. It could easily accommodate the 55 data-processing employees Mastercard has working in rental space in Lake Success, L.I., and the company is considering moving those employees to Harrison, too, when its lease at Lake Success expires at the end of 1997.
Mastercard had considered nine office buildings, primarily in White Plains and Stamford, Conn. The I.B.M. building in Harrison quickly rose to first-place status, real-estate brokers said. The 11-year-old building, on a 47-acre site that has turned into a luxury corporate park, was designed by the architect I. M. Pei. Mastercard would be the only tenant in the building, which would carry Mastercard's name.
"It's a special building that makes a really special statement," Mr. Brangaccio said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rallies Against Yen As Japan Trade Gap Is Cut

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rallied against the Japanese yen and most other leading currencies yesterday after the Government reported that the trade deficit with Japan narrowed in May, even though analysts doubted that the one-month decline marked a turning point in the American trade imbalance.
The dollar also gained amid talk in the currency market that the Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, might hint at raising interest rates when he testifies before Congress today. Higher interest rates would make dollar-denominated investments more attractive. 
 Yesterday's gains prompted speculation that the dollar's five-month slide against the yen and the German mark might be ending.
"I think the dollar's slump is over," said John Hardy, managing director at Intercap Investments Inc. "Traders sold it without much regard for logic, and now it's coming back."
Some traders also said rumors of a power struggle in North Korea led to a brief flurry of dollar-buying.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 99.30 yen, up from 98.45 yen on Monday.
The dollar's resurgence was especially evident against the mark. The dollar jumped two pfennigs, to 1.5682 marks, up from 1.5485 marks.
The dollar started rising after the Commerce Department said the merchandise trade deficit with Japan narrowed to $4.39 billion in May from $5.48 billion in April.
Many analysts cite the United States' $60 billion annual trade deficit with Japan as the most compelling reason for the dollar's slump against the yen this year.
But a number of analysts questioned whether the May trade numbers represented more than a one-month blip. "This isn't a turning point in Japanese-U.S. trade," said Mark Vitner, economist at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C. "The deficit is going to get worse before it gets better."
Analysts said the slide in the dollar's value would widen the deficit in dollar terms, even though in volume terms Japanese exports to the United States were falling as the country's imports from America rose.
Mr. Vitner said the Japanese trade number was deceiving because it was not adjusted for seasonal factors.
Despite this skepticism, the dollar held onto its early gains amid speculation that Mr. Greenspan might hint at raising interest rates in his Congressional testimony today, even though many bond trader believe that the Fed is unlikely to push up rates in the next month. Still, many currency traders who sold dollars short earlier in the week bought them back yesterday to cover their positions in case Mr. Greenspan calls for higher rates to keep inflation in check.

G.E. Earnings Up 14% Despite Some Setbacks

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
The General Electric Company, the nation's fifth-largest industrial concern, reported yesterday that its profits jumped 14 percent in the second quarter, as strong gains in many of its manufacturing and financial operations offset weakness at NBC, G.E. Aircraft Engines and Kidder, Peabody, its troubled brokerage subsidiary.
G.E., based in Fairfield, Conn., said its second-quarter net income totaled $1.52 billion, or 89 cents a share, up from $1.33 billion, or 78 cents a share, in the comparable period last year. Revenue rose 10 percent, to $16.2 billion from $14.76 billion. 
 "G.E. once again demonstrated the earnings power from its diverse mix of businesses, which are continuing to expand their global presence," said John F. Welch, the company's chief executive. He noted that G.E.'s profit margins averaged 15.3 percent for the company's 12 major businesses in the second quarter.
 
Letting the Fittest Survive
 "We never did 10 in 116 years," he said in a recent interview, "and now we're doing 15 with lower prices." G.E. has been focusing on businesses where it is No. 1 or No. 2, shrinking or selling weaker operations and pushing productivity higher.
G.E.'s second-quarter results were close to what Wall Street analysts had expected and what Mr. Welch had estimated earlier this month. Nonetheless, the favorable earnings report pushed G.E.'s stock up $1 to close at $48.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Martin A. Sankey, an analyst at CS First Boston, was upbeat about G.E.'s near-term prospects, saying that the company's cyclical businesses should do well enough to offset the drag from weak businesses like jet engines. "This has essentially been the pattern for the last several quarters and should continue," he said
Profits were down from a year ago at G.E.'s jet engine division. The division has been struggling for several years as military and commercial aircraft orders have dried up and the company has been forced to slash thousands of jobs. And since December, the division has also been the target of an unusual Federal investigation into an employee's allegations of military contract fraud and safety violations.
Earnings were also lower at NBC. Last year, the highly rated broadcast of the final episode of "Cheers" -- with its increased advertising revenues -- helped give NBC's profits a one-time lift.
 
Leading Businesses Booming
 But most of G.E.'s leading businesses are thriving. Appliance sales have received a strong lift from consumers who are remodeling their homes as well as from a rebound in new house construction. G.E.'s plastics division is busy meeting heavy demand from car factories and computer makers. And its power systems division is shipping a lot of electrical generators and gas turbines overseas, particularly to vibrant emerging markets in Asia.
Despite a $90 million decline in profits from last year at its Kidder, Peabody brokerage subsidiary, GE Capital Services managed to post a 12 percent earnings increase in the second quarter, to $463 million. That gain dwarfed the already-announced $29.3 million loss at Kidder, mostly related to its huge mortgage trading operation. The huge financial services arm does everything from financing retailers' inventories to leasing aircraft, and most of its businesses are booming.
Kidder, whose chief executive resigned earlier this month, is still struggling to overcome a scandal on its bond trading desk that resulted in a $210 million charge against G.E. earnings in the first quarter.

HEADLINE: Classrooms on the Information Highway

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C.

 BODY:
Prof. Maria Domoto stood alone in a quiet broadcast room on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, ready to teach her Japanese course to high school students. She checked the television monitor. The large screen was divided in four and all of the quadrants were on. She could see her three high school classes taking their seats.
"Jamie, you don't have your glasses on today," she said, glancing at the lower left quadrant of the screen, the North Mecklenburg High School class. 
 "Contacts," said Jamie Stubbs, a sophomore, who was sitting eight miles from the teacher.
Professor Domoto viewed the upper right quadrant, her Harding High School class. "Where's Calvin?" she said.
"He's at executive council inductions," answered Eric Riggs, who was sitting 15 miles away.
 
Moans From Over the County
 "O.K., you now have the tests for Chapter 18," Professor Domoto said. "I faxed them to you a half hour ago."
From all over the county, she could hear the moans.
In the last year, educators and officials in business and government from across the United States and 20 foreign countries have made the pilgrimage to North Carolina to see what the information highway is going to do to the classroom. "North Carolina's out in front, no question about it," said Linda Roberts, a technology expert for the Federal Department of Education.
Visitors are impressed. "People are amazed at how well the technology works," said Jane Smith Patterson, the technology adviser to Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina. "As soon as they see it, they realize what we have here."
It is this interactive: Jason Puryear sneezed at East Mecklenburg High, and before classmates could react, Professor Domoto, 20 miles away but visible in a quadrant of all screens, said, "Bless you."
 
New Course Opportunity
 The new technology excites educators because it can be used to give students in poor and rural parts of North Carolina their only chance at courses like Japanese, Latin and statistics.
But all this carries a sizable price tag at a time when public school budgets are being pared. State officials estimate that a high school must spend $110,000 to $150,000 to buy the equipment to hook into the fiber-optic system that instantly transmits these images, another $40,000 to $50,000 a year in telephone company user fees, as well as hire extra employees to maintain the system.
While the state heralds a futuristic technology that "increases efficiency" and "saves taxpayer dollars," many experts say that is stretching the system's attributes. "It's never going to be less costly," said Dennis Bybee, associate executive director of the International Society for Technology in Education. He compares the changes the new communications technology will bring to the classroom with the changes that have already occurred in modern business offices.
 
'Need More Teachers'
 A few years ago no one had a fax, Mr. Bybee said, but now every business needs one. "It's not less costly, but it will be better -- and better will be the standard," he said. "You actually will need more teachers," but he added they would be able to do more.
North Carolina began its pilot program last year with 16 public schools. The Legislature recently passed a bill to take the program beyond the experimental stage, providing $7 million for start-up costs. By January nearly 100 schools are expected to be hooked up, from Cape Hatteras High School on the Atlantic Coast to Tri-County Community College in Murphy, 400 miles away on the state's far western end.
The fiber-optic cable connection between sites allows electronic signals to travel so rapidly, back and forth, that interaction is instantaneous to the eye and ear. Last year it meant that several isolated schools had access for the first time to courses usually limited to well-to-do suburbs.
Ricky Poovey, a junior ranked No. 10 in his class of several hundred at East Lincoln High School on the rural outskirts of Charlotte, had long wanted to take Latin. He plans to study marine biology in college and knows that Latin would help with species identification. But there were not enough students interested for his school to create a course.
As part of the pilot program, however, Ricky and six other East Lincoln students were hooked up via two-way video with the 22 students in first-year Latin at suburban East Mecklenburg High, 50 miles away.
At a parent-teacher night last fall, the East Lincoln parents visited their children's East Lincoln classroom and met the East Mecklenburg Latin teacher, Joan Lewis, over the two-way system.
The parents were not used to meeting strangers on two-way television. "My dad didn't say too much," said Christian Lucas. "He's kind of shy."
As with any cutting-edge venture, a leap of faith is involved on everyone's part. While a consortium of telephone companies here, led by Southern Bell, GTE Telephone and Carolina Telephone, is putting fiber cable in the ground, the state's Public Utility Commission has not yet set tariff rates.
The agreement calls for the phone companies to build and own the system and for the state to be its biggest user. Though high schools and colleges are expected to be the major customers in the first phase, hospitals, government offices and prisons are also expected to apply for state financing to participate in the program. The expectation is that business will soon follow government and will be willing to pay the phone companies a higher fee for commercial interactive service.
From the start, the Governor's office has insisted that poor andrural areas be included. This has not been the rule in many states. A recent study by the Consumer Federation of America criticizes efforts in other parts of the country for not including the poor and, instead, letting market forces dominate, so that well-to-do communities are the main beneficiary of fiber-optic systems.
The new technology is also creating new quandaries. For example, what is the optimum size of the video classroom? Technology experts give the impression that money will be saved because two-way video can match one teacher with several classrooms at once. A representative from Northern Telecom, one of the companies providing equipment for the North Carolina system, emphasized in an interview the economies of pairing one teacher with 100 youngsters in six classrooms across the state.
But several teachers who worked with the technology last year, including Professor Domoto and Ms. Lewis, say they cannot handle more than a normal high school classroom of 20 to 30 students. "Beyond 20 to 30, you lose any personal contact," Professor Domoto said. "I want to see the students I'm teaching."
This year's oceanography course, for example, originated 200 miles of here on the Atlantic coast, at Haggard High in Wilmington, and included 58 students at five schools. Students here at East Mecklenburg High, a "receiving site," say that with so many schools on the screen at once it was hard getting noticed by the Wilmington teacher. "It's a big process to jump in with a comment," said Kim Miller, a senior.
Next year, instead of using two-way video to teach oceanography, East Mecklenburg will use its own teacher in a standard classroom.
 
Extra Help a Problem
 The new technology requires extra manpower. Each school needs a technician to run the equipment and supervise the video classroom at a cost of about $30,000 in salary and benefits, Ms. Patterson says.
Teaching assistants may be necessary, too. If a teacher is 15 or 50 or 300 miles away, a student who needs help after school has a problem. Professor Domoto's college-level Japanese class started with 26 high school students last fall and by the end of the year was down to 11 because of youngsters who failed or dropped out. This fall, two teaching assistants will be available for extra help, either by telephone or on visits to the high schools. It is likely that on-screen time for remedial help will also be scheduled, but that, too, adds to costs.
Nor do all subjects seem well suited to the new medium. Two-way video is impressive in foreign language classes like Professor Domoto's. Her homework typically involves preparing a passage, and it is easy to determine who did the work by how well they recite in class.
But a course like English composition, with written homework, would be harder to conduct long distance. It could mean either hiring an aide to handle the fax machine or using computers with modems to transmit the compositions back and forth. Both methods add costs.
And while the new teaching medium offers immediacy, it is not the same as being there. For example, Jon Leary, an East Mecklenburg senior on the receiving end of a three-day-a-week oceanography course, said the course was a much richer experience for the originating class in Wilmington. "They get to play with the plants and we get to look at the pictures," he said. "They'll show us an octopus over the TV so we get the visual idea. They tell us it's gooshy. We don't feel it's gooshy."
Also, the video classroom where East Mecklenburg students go for two-way learning has no running water, exhaust fans or other basic necessities of a science laboratory.
 
Rethinking Workplace Rules
 Improved technology is generally equated with efficiency, but efficiency requires lots of planning. For the oceanography course, science teachers from the five schools were supposed to meet via the two-way video system regularly after school to coordinate lessons.
But Walt Modrell, an East Mecklenburg science teacher, said there was only 90 minutes a month available to them on the network for five-way planning conferences. "It wasn't enough," he said. As a result, instead of team-teaching, the course was run from the Wilmington school. And Mr. Modrell spent several days a week sitting with his East Mecklenburg class in the video room watching his students being taught.
The new technology will force educators to rethink workplace rules. Ms. Lewis, the Latin teacher, said that she was supposed to have a maximum of 150 students a semester, but that if her video students were counted, her load exceeded 160 each semester last year.
Discipline is another uncharted area. Thus far, most distance learning classes have involved motivated high school students taking specialized courses, often for college credit. But as the technology reaches more average students or those who need remedial help, how will a teacher handle a problem youngster 300 miles away?
There is no question that the technology has a powerful, almost hypnotic effect. As Julie Yin, an East Mecklenburg student who took psychology on the system, says, "You grow up with TV, you pay attention more. You stare at the monitor and just listen -- it really holds you."
But the power of the medium cuts two ways. You expect more from TV -- a fast pace, good editing, quick cuts, some laughs. "A bad teacher," Ms. Patterson said, "looks even worse on a TV screen."

Bonds Extend a Rally; Traders Await Fed Chief

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The bond market extended its rally yesterday as traders awaited Congressional testimony by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve's chairman.
Treasury prices were bolstered in part by strong international demand for dollar-denominated securities. 
 The Treasury's 30-year bond rose 14/32 of a point, or $4.38 for $1,000 of bonds. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 7.46 percent, from 7.50 percent on Monday.
Bonds rallied amid "a change in sentiment as the market went from expecting a Fed tightening soon to expecting the Fed to wait" before raising interest rates, said Fred Leiner, market strategist at the Continental Bank in Chicago.
 
Greenspan Scheduled Today
 Mr. Greenspan is scheduled to give Congress his six-month review of Federal Reserve policy, beginning today. Many bond traders and analysts say the Fed will delay increasing interest rates for at least a month because inflation appears to be in check, even though there was some speculation in the currency market that Mr. Greenspan might hint at raising rates in his testimony.
Indeed, Mr. Greenspan said this week that the nation's money supply was not expanding at an inflationary rate. Last week, he said inflation was slowing.
Mr. Greenspan's "comments suggest that interest rates are on hold," said Troy Bowler, a market strategist at Paine Webber International in London.
The Fed has pushed up short-term interest rates four times this year in an effort to rein in inflation.
Recent reports show inflation is subdued. Producer prices did not rise in June, while consumer prices rose an expected three-tenths of 1 percent.
The bond market was also helped yesterday by a revival of the London-based Eurodollar bond market and a growing appetite for Treasury securities by non-American institutions, traders said.
There's been a rebound "of demand for Eurobonds" denominated in dollars, including a $1 billion sale of five-year bonds by a large Dutch bank, said Charles Quigley, a bond trader for Chemical Securities in London.
"People are attracted by five-year dollar bonds," said a trader at the Generale Bank in Brussels. "It's not very usual for an issue to be sexy for both" institutions and individuals.
London investors bought as much as $1 billion of Treasury securities maturing in as many as 10 years, some traders said. The 10-year Treasury note rose 12/32 of a point to yield 7.13 percent, down five basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, from Monday.
 
Unfazed by Trade Gap
 "The market overreacted to perceived strength and the fear that we'll have inflation," said Brooks Nelson, who handles $230 million at Nelson Capital Management.
Treasury prices advanced yesterday, even though the Government said the nation's trade deficit rose 7.6 percent in May, a figure that had little impact because it's almost two months old. Bonds initially fell amid concern that a wider trade gap would cause a drop in the dollar, traders and analysts said. A weaker dollar often causes declines in dollar-denominated investments, like Treasury bonds.
But the dollar rose after the report, which also noted that the nation's merchandise trade deficit with Japan had narrowed. That in turn helped bond prices, traders said.
Since July 11, the 30-year Treasury bond's yield has dropped 26 basis points, as prices rose in their biggest seven-day rally since April.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
American Expansion For Honda

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 19

 BODY:
The Honda Motor Company, the first Japanese auto maker to build vehicles in the United States, announced a series of steps today that are intended to increase its North American car production. The expansion should help to mitigate the high costs, caused by the soaring value of the Japanese yen, of building cars in Japan and exporting them to the United States.
The expansion, consistent with Honda's decade-old strategy of seeking growth mainly outside Japan, is expected to tap emerging Latin American markets, especially Mexico, and raise Honda's market share in the United States and Canada. 
 "We will undertake new sales, manufacturing and R.&D. activities to increase the efficiency and reach of our operations throughout the Americas," said Koichi Amemiya, who heads Honda's activities in the Americas.
 
Making a Political Point
 By producing more cars in North America, Honda may also strengthen its political case that it is a global manufacturer that has provided numerous jobs and benefits to the American economy, and therefore should not be subject to protectionist pressure. Honda and other Japanese auto makers are annoyed by a law, written with the help of the Big Three auto makers, that takes effect this fall and requires new cars to carry a sticker disclosing the percentage of their foreign and domestic content.
"Honda already has the highest local content of the Japanese auto makers building in this country," said David Healy, an auto industry analyst for S. G. Warburg & Company. "Honda has been criticized that their operations are only screwdriver factories that assemble parts imported from Japan. If it ever was true, it certainly is not true now."
All of the Japanese auto makers, attempting to use their global production systems as a way to serve world markets, have been shifting more car production to the United States in recent years and exporting a higher percentage of their North American production. Part of the strategy is to blunt the costly effects of the yen's rise in value against the dollar by building cars in America and pricing them in dollars, instead of building them in Japan and converting the price to dollars from yen.
Jay W. Chai, chairman and chief executive of Itochu International, a Japanese-owned trading company based in New York, said: "All the Japanese auto makers have to find ways to get their costs out of yen and into dollars. Honda is a creative company, but it has to be a company that makes money."
But Scott Whitlock, executive vice president for North American manufacturing, said: "This strategy isn't a reaction to the recent rise of the yen. We've been saying that we want to localize our operations for years."
 
 
 
$310 Million Project
 Today company executives set forth details of a $310 million expansion of production capacity in the United States, Canada and Mexico during the next three years.
In addition to expanding capacity at factories in Marysville, Anna, and East Liberty, Ohio, as well as in Alliston, Ontario, Honda will build a small plant in Guadalajara, Mexico, to make automobiles from kits. Over all, Honda said it would add about 1,100 workers to its North American work force of roughly 15,900. Honda said it would also increase its North American research and development, marketing activities and opportunities for American suppliers.
Although Honda is small compared with competitors like the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Toyota Motor Corporation, its steady expansion has shown that it can make big waves in the market with relatively little financial investment. The amount Honda is planning to spend is tiny by automotive standards, and includes no new floor space or assembly lines for its existing factories. Yesterday, for example, Ford said it was investing $500 million over the next few years to expand a single steering-gear plant in Indiana.
During the next few years Honda said it would also introduce two new Acura luxury models, both designed and assembled in North America. One model will be sold in the United States and Canada, and the other only in Canada. Honda announced in January that it would be the first Japanese auto maker to assemble a luxury vehicle in North America. About 60 to 65 percent of its sales in the United States are of cars made in the United States and Canada, a proportion that will rise to 75 to 85 percent in the next few years, a spokesman said.
 
 
 
18% Rise in Car Capacity
 Honda's annual production capacity will increase 18 percent, to 720,000 vehicles by 1997 from 610,000 now, and its engine capacity will rise 50 percent, to 750,000 from 500,000. The increase in engine production will include a new V6 in 1996, the first Honda car engine larger than a four-cylinder to be built in the United States. Honda's single largest investment, $200 million, will go to expand its engine plant in Anna.
By 1999 Honda expects to export about 150,000 vehicles annually from the United States and Canada, double the 75,000 vehicles it expects to export this year.
The Mexico plant, the spokesman said, will initially supply the budding Mexican market. Most of the parts will be exported to the plant from Honda factories and those of suppliers in the United States. But Honda said it hoped eventually to export from the Guadalajara plant as well.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Deficit Swelled Again in May

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit soared again in May, as the American economy pulled in more and more manufactured products from abroad while the weak dollar did only a little to spur foreign buying of American goods and services by the still sluggish economies of Europe and Japan.
The Commerce Department reported today that the shortfall between exports and imports climbed to $9.17 billion, from $8.53 billion in April. American imports rose 1.2 percent, to a record $65.45 billion, while exports grew only two-tenths of a percent from April, to $56.27 billion. 
 The trade deficit with Japan actually fell in May by almost 20 percent, to $4.39 billion, but economists say that is largely a seasonal phenomenon, not a harbinger of change. The figure has declined in May each of the last four years, only to come roaring back in subsequent months.
On Monday, in fact, Japanese officials in Tokyo, who get their trade data out sooner than Washington does, released their statistics for June, which showed the imbalance in trade with the United States sharply widening again.
Today, Clinton Administration officials met at the White House to rethink trade strategy with Japan. Officials are saying that unless there is some movement out of Tokyo in the next 10 days, they will set in motion trade sanctions on Japan for its failure to meet a July 31 deadline to open its public contracts market for medical equipment and telecommunications.
The United States deficit with Japan for the first five months of this year is still 10 percent ahead of last year's pace, at a total $24.9 billion -- although Japanese products are more expensive with the weak dollar and the strong yen. The deficit with Japan remained by far the nation's largest and accounted for just under half the total American trade deficit.
If there is good news for the American economy in these trade numbers it is that American exports to Japan for the first five months of this year are up 8 percent, with healthy increases across the board in consumer goods, machinery and autos. The reason these exports have not improved the overall trade balance with Japan is because American imports from Japan are up 9.3 percent over the same period, despite the steadily weakening dollar and strengthening yen.
This raises some interesting theoretical questions. Standard economic theory says that if a country's currency devalues, the immediate impact is a worsening of its trade deficit, because buying patterns take time to shift, so initially it is paying more for the same volume of imports. Over a two-year period, the theory says, volumes of imports will decline in the country whose currency is devalued and its exports will rise, because its cheaper currency makes all of its products easier to sell abroad.
 
Theory Hasn't Worked
 But the dollar has steadily declined against the yen -- sharply in the last two months, but steadily for the last few decades -- and the theory has not worked out as expected. That may be in part because Japanese markets are not as open as they should be, so even cheaper American exports cannot penetrate in high enough volumes to affect the deficit.
In addition, the United States imports certain products from Japan that are not easily replaced, even when the price goes up because of currency fluctuations. These include ceramic packages for microcomputers, flat panel displays, certain machine tools, chemicals used in growing silicon crystals for semiconductors and luxury cars with zero defects.
So for the moment, the American economy seems to be experiencing the worst of all worlds with Japan: The United States appetite for Japanese imports remains high, despite their higher costs, which means that the trade deficit may continue to worsen or hold steady, even with the dollar having lost about 10 percent of its value against the yen in the last six months.
"The trade deficit reflects both the growth differentials between the U.S. and its trading partners and the need for further market openings around the world," said Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown.
 
China Trade Gap Grows
 The trade gap with China also ballooned in May by $400 million, jumping to $2.22 billion from $1.79 billion in April. While much attention has been focused on Japan, the United States had a record $22.8 billion trade deficit with China last year and the deficit with Beijing is up 22 percent on that level already this year.
The trade gap with the newly industrialized Asian countries also widened by $525 million, to $1.1 billion, and the deficit with Western Europe surged from $83 million in April to $1.43 billion in May. The sluggish European economies simply are not buying as they used to from the United States, while American imports from them remain very healthy. The trade deficit with Germany is now the largest it has been since December 1988.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Profit Is Down Sharply At Merrill and Lehman

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Merrill Lynch & Company, the nation's largest securities firm, and Lehman Brothers Holdings, a large stock and bond underwriter, reported sharp declines in second-quarter earnings yesterday.
Two major regional firms -- Raymond James of St. Petersburg, Fla. and the Inter-Regional Financial Group of Minneapolis -- also reported big drops in their profit. 
 The declines reflect the substantial advance in interest rates that have disrupted stock, bond and commodity markets this year and made the second quarter the worst for the securities industry since 1990.
"It highlights how cyclical these businesses are," said Douglas Eby, vice president of Robert E. Torray & Company, a money manager in Bethesda, Md. "When you can't move the product and the price is going down, it has a dramatic effect on earnings."
Merrill Lynch's stock fell 87.5 cents yesterday to close at $36.25 and Lehman Brothers dropped 62.5 cents to close at $15.125.
 
Six-Month Period Better
 Profit at Merrill Lynch declined 27 percent, to $252 million, or $1.18 a share, from $345 million, or $1.52 a share, in the similar period of 1993. For the first half of the year, net earnings slipped 4 percent, to $624 million, or $2.87 a share, from $652 million, or $2.88 a share, after adjustment for an accounting change in the corresponding period of 1993.
Daniel P. Tully, the firm's chairman and chief executive, called the second quarter "the most difficult operating environment for our industry in over three years." He cited "rising interest rates, unsettled currency markets, investor caution and a sharp decline in global underwriting volume, industrywide" as contributing factors.
Principal-transaction revenue decreased 25 percent, to $561 million, and investment-banking revenue dropped 22 percent, to $322 million. Still, Merrill Lynch remained the leading underwriter of both debt and equity securities.
Earnings at Lehman Brothers declined 79 percent in the second quarter, to $20 million, or 11 cents a share, from $95 million a year earlier, when the trading firm was owned by American Express. It would have earned 90 cents a share in the second quarter of 1993, had it been publicly owned and separately listed. The 1994 quarterly results include a $12 million charge related to the spinoff on May 31.
 
Financial Effect of Spinoff
 For the first half, profit was down 52 percent, to $62 million, from $129 million in the April-June quarter of 1993. On a per-share basis, earnings were 40 cents, compared with 63 cents before charges for the spinoff and accounting changes.
Trading revenue fell 17 percent, to $361 million, in the second quarter, while investment-banking revenue dropped 27 percent, to $151 million. These declines were attributed to "adverse market conditions in both the United States and Europe."
In an effort to provide greater incentive, Lehman Brothers said it would begin paying part of some employees' compensation in stock. Under the arrangement, for instance, Richard Fuld Jr., the chairman and chief executive, and T. Christopher Pettit, the president and chief operating officer, would receive 62.5 percent of their total compensation in restricted stock. Other senior executives will get 50 percent of their total compensation in this kind of stock, which is convertible to common stock on a one-to-one basis in five years.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Corn and Soybeans Tumble On Report of Thriving Crops

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Corn and soybean futures prices slumped to their lowest levels in more than a year yesterday after the Government said the crops were thriving in the warm, humid Midwest.
The Agriculture Department rated 86 percent of the corn crop and 79 percent of the soybeans in good-to-excellent condition as of Sunday. The marks were among the highest for those crops since the department began the rating system in 1985, said Dale Gustafson, grain analyst with Smith Barney Shearson. 
 Corn for September delivery sank 3 1/2 cents on the Chicago Board of Trade, to $2.21 3/4 a bushel, and August soybeans dropped 13 1/4 cents, to $5.99 1/4 a bushel. Both contracts notched intraday lows that were the lowest for an active contract since June 1993.
September wheat rose 2 1/4 cents, to $3.30 1/4 a bushel, amid concerns about scab disease, a fungus, in the spring wheat crop. September oats slipped 3/4 cent, to $1.16 1/2 a bushel.
Green coffee beans for September delivery plunged 7.55 cents, to $2.335 a pound on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange.
Stephen Platt of Dean Witter said the drop was part of a continuing correction in coffee prices, which more than doubled to $2.74 a pound from June 24 to July 13 after two severe frosts in Brazil, the largest coffee producer.
 
Cold Forecast in Brazil
 Losses were limited by forecasts for more cold weather in Brazil this weekend, Mr. Platt said.
Silver and copper futures rose strongly on New York's Commodity Exchange, reflecting simmering inflation fears and prospects for stronger European and Chinese demand for copper as those economies pick up steam. Gold followed silver higher.
August gold rose 90 cents, to $387.10 a troy ounce; September silver rose 7.3 cents, to $5.345 a troy ounce, and September copper rose 3.75 cents, to $1.162 a pound.
In energy trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, August light sweet crude oil slipped 5 cents, to $19.46 a barrel, while September deliveries rose 14 cents, to $19.23 a barrel; August heating oil rose 0.64 cent, to 49.48 cents a gallon; August unleaded gasoline rose 0.28 cent to 54.25 cents a gallon, and August natural gas rose 1.4 cents, to $1.959 for 1,000 cubic feet.
In livestock trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, August live cattle fell 0.52 cent, to 68.80 cents a pound; August feeder cattle dropped 0.25 cent, to 78.80 cents a pound; August live hogs rose 0.27 cent, to 44.77 cents a pound, and August frozen pork bellies rose 0.43 cent, to 32.75 cents a pound.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Kellogg enlists real people to stress the value of its breakfast.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE Kellogg Company is extending ambitious efforts to change consumer perceptions that the prices of its cereals are as high as the corn in Kansas in August.
Humorous television commercials and print advertisements by Leo Burnett U.S.A. promote the notion that the prices of three best-selling Kellogg brands -- Frosted Flakes, Raisin Bran and Rice Krispies -- are "just part of the value in a Kellogg's breakfast." 
 They began appearing in June, five months after a similar campaign for another popular Kellogg cereal, Corn Flakes, which asserted that its average price of less than a quarter a bowl was "another reason to taste them again for the first time."
Kellogg's strategy is to pour money -- just how much, the company won't say -- into campaigns aimed at altering shoppers' beliefs that after years of Kellogg's raising prices by an average of 5 to 6 percent annually, private-label and store-brand cereals have become more economical buys.
By one count, Kellogg raised prices five times between January 1991 and March 1994, compared with three times for General Mills, No. 2 behind Kellogg in the nation's estimated $8 billion ready-to-eat cereal market.
"We believe the ads reinforce for consumers that they are getting a great value when they eat a Kellogg cereal," Karen MacLeod, a spokeswoman for Kellogg in Battle Creek, Mich., said.
"We feel we've always been the value leader," she added, "and continue to be."
A leader, yes, but Kellogg's lead has been shriveling faster than flakes under milk. From 1988 to 1993, Kellogg's market share fell from 42.2 percent to 35 percent, according to data compiled by John C. Maxwell Jr., an analyst with the Wheat First Butcher Singer brokerage firm in Richmond. Rising sales of lower-priced alternative brands, though still tiny over all, have cut into Kellogg's results, as have a paucity of successful new products and gains by rivals like Post, Quaker and Ralston Purina.
The commercials for the three brands, like their Corn Flakes precursor, feature unscripted vignettes of consumers rather than actors. They were directed by Gary Weiss of 1/33 Productions in New York, who formerly made short films for "Saturday Night Live."
Each spot centers on a brand's familiar characters or slogans. The commercial for Frosted Flakes asks, "Would you spend 30 cents to have breakfast with Tony?" referring to the brand's tiger mascot; it is set, appropriately, in a zoo.
The commercial for Raisin Bran plays off that brand's longtime "Two scoops of raisins" theme to ask, "Hey, have you heard the latest scoop?" The answer comes as a man holds aloft a stack of newspapers -- presumably The Battle Creek Enquirer -- bearing the banner headline "Kellogg's Raisin Bran for 45 cents."
And the commercial for Rice Krispies, shot at a college, offers a "Snap, Crackle, Pop quiz," invoking the brand's trio of elf-like pixies. After people fail to guess that a serving of Rice Krispies costs 35 cents, one man mangles their names as "Snackle, Crack, Apop."
Walter Maes, an executive vice president and group creative director with Burnett in Chicago, said, "You could never write anything like that."
"There's a level of communication there I can't explain," he added. "When a real person's talking about something, I believe it much more than an announcer."
The belief levels among cereal industry analysts vary.
Nomi Ghez of Goldman, Sachs & Company in New York called Kellogg's campaign "a good idea."
"From a public relations and consumer relations point of view, it's better to maintain lower prices," she said, "but that's clearly not Kellogg's decision."
Data "show consumers with split personalities," she added, because while private-label brands "are growing at a faster rate than branded cereals, at the same time consumers continue to buy more cereal and the total market is growing."
"If consumers really thought cereal was way overpriced and there were less expensive alternatives," Ms. Ghez said, "they'd buy them."
Mr. Maxwell of Wheat First said that General Mills "has gone one-up on Kellogg" by trying to raise its market share, at 29 percent last year, by reducing suggested retail prices of 10 best-selling brands like Cheerios, Trix and Wheaties. General Mills is promoting those reductions, which average 11 percent, in a campaign carrying the theme "Good cereal, good value."
"When your major competitor puts banners on 40 percent of its boxes saying 'Now! Lower price!,' it puts some pressure on you to either lower your prices or tell consumers your prices are low enough," said John M. McMillin of Prudential Securities in New York.
"I guess Kellogg took the lesser of two evils," he added.
The Kellogg campaign also serves to "tell consumers it's O.K. to buy cereal without a coupon," Mr. McMillin said -- a crucial goal because Kellogg, as well as General Mills, is trying to wean shoppers from short-term promotions by reducing the flood of cents-off coupons they issue.

HEADLINE: AT LUNCH WITH: Richard Hughes;
An Actor Prepares; Vietnam Interrupts

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
RICHARD HUGHES, fabled as the last American to leave Saigon in the 1970's, is finding that Vietnam still refuses to let go of him. And vice versa.
In fact, he believes Vietnam has a way of following him around. So Mr. Hughes was hardly surprised when, rehearsing for an Off Off Broadway production of "The Seagull" in 1992, he stepped off the A train at Canal Street and came face to face with the big green sign of the Kinh Do Vietnamese Restaurant. 
 As an omen, not to mention an eating place, it was hard to pass up. So Mr. Hughes, a 51-year-old Pittsburgh-born actor who looks like Clint Eastwood in his less craggy days, surrendered to the lure of a bowl of pho in the same way he had given himself to Vietnam and the cause of the homeless urchins he sheltered in his Shoeshine Boys hostels in wartime Saigon a quarter century ago.
That's where I first met him, and as a correspondent for The Times in Saigon, I wrote the first piece about the Shoeshine Boys.
Since he first discovered Kinh Do ("Big City"), Mr. Hughes has come back to the restaurant at 19 Avenue of the Americas for pho, a hearty rice-noodle soup with beef, and for the crispy pork and shrimp rolls called cha gio. In fact, he chose Kinh Do as the place to have lunch recently and talk about how Vietnam derailed the budding acting career that he is now trying to get back on track.
He also recounted his campaign to gain freedom for two former Vietnamese colleagues jailed in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) in 1990 for what the Government called "anti-socialist activities," a costly cause that has drained him financially, leaving him more than $35,000 in debt.
"I made a couple of copies," he began, turning up at the table in a blue work shirt and sliding his rangy six-foot form into a seat.
A couple of copies? His briefcase bulged with dogeared correspondence with Tom Cruise, Paul Newman, Robert De Niro and others who have helped his cause; newspaper clippings and fund-raising appeals; briefing papers, and manifestoes focused on the cases of Doan Than Liem, a lawyer who is reported close to release, cutting short his 12-year term, and Do Ngoc Long, an economist who was freed last year and is awaiting asylum in the United States.
Exuberantly boyish, with blue eyes and salt and pepper hair, Mr. Hughes seems to know he can be a pain but leavens his passion with good humor. "I'm committed," he said. "Not obsessive."
He remembered enough Vietnamese to banter with the restaurateur, Tu Van Nguyen, a former South Vietnamese Army major who spent 10 years in Communist re-education camps and jails.
Mr. Hughes would have been satisfied with a bowl of pho, but Mr. Tu would not hear of it. Nothing but the house special would do. Mr. Tu scurried off to see to it.
He soon emerged with a compromise. A double order of cha gio to start, along with a plate of lettuce leaves and mint sprigs to wrap around them and a dipping bowl of nuoc mam, the fermented fish sauce.
Over the crunchy rolls and iced glasses of sweet lemonade the menu charmingly calls so da, Mr. Hughes recalled his early acting career, all but hijacked by the Vietnam War.
After graduating in 1965 from Carnegie Tech and two years later from the Boston University Graduate School of Drama, where his classmate was Paul Michael Glaser, who later starred in the hit television series "Starsky and Hutch," he started off at the Theater Company of Boston. There, he acted in "The Local Stigmatic" by Heathcote Williams and was Jon Voight's understudy in "The Dwarfs" by Harold Pinter.
In 1968, as a conscientious objector, he refused the Vietnam draft, only to borrow $1,500 and travel on his own to Saigon, where he helped found the Dispatch News Service -- later it distributed Seymour Hersh's exclusive on the My Lai massacre -- and opened a shelter for street children called the Shoeshine Boys Project.
The low-key charity, so named because the children commonly subsisted by shining shoes, was lionized in news articles. Richard Avedon took pictures, and Mr. Hughes was even flown back to the States in 1974 for a surprise family reunion with his parents and six siblings on "This Is Your Life," which included a tribute by the United States representative at the United Nations, George Bush.
By the mid-70's, Mr. Long and Mr. Liem were taking more responsibility for the charity, which expanded to eight group homes -- six in Saigon and two in Danang -- before they were phased out and Mr. Hughes was told to pick up his exit visa. That was in 1976, three years after the last G.I.'s left Vietnam and more than a year after the Communist victory reunified North and South Vietnam. The charity aided some 1,500 youngsters, mainly boys but also some girls.
After waiters cleared the table, Mr. Tu re-emerged proudly with platters of crispy fried flounder, peppered salt jumbo shrimp nesting in tomatoes and onions, soft-shell crabs fried in butter, and sweet and sour sauteed lobster.
Mr. Hughes snapped off pieces of flounder, placed them in his cup of white rice and used his chopsticks Vietnamese-style to shovel the dish into his mouth. Mr. Tu shelled him chunks of lobster tail.
In 1976, when he got back from Vietnam, Mr. Hughes continued, he tried to restart his acting career, landing some parts in regional theaters and then a prime supporting role as Bernardo in Kevin Kline's "Hamlet" at the Public Theater in 1986. The same year, he appeared as a Pentagon bomb sleuth in Marshall Brickman's film "The Manhattan Project," and in 1987 he portrayed Ross in a Shakespeare in the Park production of "Richard II."
In 1992, he played Shamrayev, the estate owner in Chekhov's "Seagull," at the Muse Theater, and last year he appeared as the train engineer in the Disney film "Iron Will," about a dog-sled race.
But Vietnam was claiming his life again. In 1990, Mr. Long and Mr. Liem were arrested, along with a former American colleague, Michael Morrow, a development consultant, over their meetings with a freelance writer who had angered the authorities by visiting a group of former Vietcong guerrillas critical of the Government.
Bang! Gesturing, Mr. Hughes knocked over his lemonade. Calmly, he swept the ice shards into his palm and onto a napkin.
Mr. Morrow was released after three weeks, Mr. Hughes said, but the two Vietnamese were more harshly treated, in large part, Mr. Hughes is convinced, because of their alliance with him two decades earlier. They were a very close threesome, he said. "You can't get any closer than taking care of a kid who dies."
A week ago, Mr. Hughes learned in a call from Mr. Liem's family in California that he, too, was about to be released.
The worst part of the story, Mr. Hughes continued, was having to be defensive for taking his loyalty to his friends to such lengths.
"I had to explain who these people are and why I'm doing what I'm doing," he said. "I felt there was almost something wrong here because I cared. It's been an uphill battle. People are usually not that loyal for so long."
But now, he said, "I got to the point I'm no longer apologizing for the natural thing to do."
Meanwhile, he said, he passed up other acting roles to devote time to the campaign. To earn money, he worked all night long at law firms, proofreading legal briefs.
His finances have taken a beating, he said. Faxes alone have cost at least $3,500 so far, not to mention the time he has spent running around the corner to send them.
His companion, Sherry Hall, a public-school teacher, is the financial mainstay, supporting the family in an apartment in Inwood, in upper Manhattan. Their daughter, Tara, almost 10, attends the Manhattan Country School with some financial aid.
Having reached the point that he addresses Mr. De Niro and Mr. Newman as "Dear Bob" and "Dear Paul" in his letters, Mr. Hughes is seeking their help to wipe away the $35,000 debt.
He has made so many contacts with celebrities and former Vietnam hands, he said, that when he ran into Arthur Miller on the street one day, he thought he was talking to David Halberstam.
Mr. Tu brought infusions of strong French coffee with sweetened condensed milk that he poured into smoking glasses of ice.
Mr. Hughes said he longed to revisit Vietnam. One of his brothers recently traveled there and found the old Shoeshine Boys home on Pham Ngu Lau Street was crowded by hippie bikers and stalls selling novelties.
When lunch was over, Mr. Hughes headed uptown to pick up his daughter from school. He had just had lunch, he told her, with someone he knew from Vietnam.
"Oh, no," Tara said with a groan, "not another long story."

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
Once More, Jackson Is the Giants' Receiver

BYLINE: By FRANK LITSKY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: FLORHAM PARK, N.J., July 19

 BODY:
In the National Football League's wacky and not-always-wonderful world of free agency, winners sometimes become losers and then, if they are lucky, they more or less become winners again. Just ask Mark Jackson, a starting wide receiver for the Giants last year, an unemployed player 10 weeks ago and now a Giants starter again.
A year ago, when unrestricted free agency came to the N.F.L., Jackson left the Denver Broncos after seven seasons and signed with the Giants. One attraction was the Giants' new coach, Dan Reeves, his coach with the Broncos. Another was the money: $4.5 million over three years. 
 Jackson led the Giants in receptions (58) and receiving yardage (708). But he was 29 years old and small (5 feet 9 inches). He also led the Giants in dropped passes with 9 (no one else had more than 3), and he tailed off late in the season.
On May 6, struggling with the new salary cap, the Giants waived Jackson and his 1994 salary of $1.35 million. But on Monday, when training camp began, they re-signed him for $450,000. Now, in the two-a-day practices, he is back in business, back in the starting lineup.
 
Philosophical Optimist
 Jackson is a philosophical optimist, and that approach, he said today, has helped him through what could have been a devastating period.
"Last year, I was sort of uncomfortable: new environment, new people," he said. "And when Mike Sherrard went down and was gone for the season, it was a different scenario. I began to fatigue. I was sleeping less."
The off season was troubling, too.
"I didn't know what was happening," he said. "The cap was new, like free agency the year before. You didn't know what to expect. And when the Giants drafted a receiver as No. 1, I didn't know if they wanted me back. But they did want me back at a lesser price."
So for two and a half months, Jackson was jobless. He said his lawyer received inquiries from 10 or 11 teams, but, as Jackson said, "What does that mean in a league with all this juggling with a salary cap?"
It meant nothing until the Giants called again. And this time, it meant a job for much less money. The Giants tried to re-sign Ed McCaffrey, another wide receiver, for $450,000. McCaffrey balked, so the Giants rescinded their offer to him and re-signed Jackson for the same amount.
 
A Starter Once Again
 "Sure, it's less money than last year," Jackson said. "But I'm working. And if you average the money over two years, it isn't bad."
In the Giants' training camp at Fairleigh Dickinson University's campus here, the key wide receivers are Sherrard (recovering from a dislocated hip), Jackson, Chris Calloway, Arthur Marshall, Keith Crawford and the first-round draft choice, Thomas Lewis. For now, the starters are Sherrard and Jackson, which means Jackson has gone from the penthouse to the doghouse to the penthouse again.
"Mark is starting because he started last year," Reeves said. "You don't lose your starting job because you were released."
 
Work to Do
 Jackson still has work to do. Last year, his quarterback was Phil Simms. This year, with Simms gone, it will be Kent Graham or Dave Brown.
"You can't have a feeling for a quarterback in one year," Jackson said. "Now we will have another quarterback. It's tough on everyone, but that's part of the game, You work around it."
Jackson has resolved another problem.
"Last year," he said, "I just started getting comfortable with the Jersey roads. If you don't know them, you see where you want to go and you can't get there, so you have to go 30 miles before a U turn."

The Monkey Wrench

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
So I went up to Macombs Dam Park in the Bronx to see the so-called monkeys and the colored boys doing their thing, but it had been raining for a couple of days and the park was deserted.
Monkeys and colored boys are terms (not quite of endearment) that refer to the black and brown youngsters who play in the park, which is next door to the gleaming blue and white baseball palace called Yankee Stadium. 
 Yechhhhhhh! Colored kids! You could almost feel the disgust emanating from the hefty form of Richard Kraft, the dim-witted white Yankee executive who, according to New York magazine, let loose a nasty simian simile while discussing the kids who play near his ball park.
"It's like monkeys," he was quoted as saying. "Those guys can all go up and hang on the rim and crack the rim and bend the hoops."
Like monkeys. How dare they be allowed anywhere near the pristine wonderfulness of Mr. Kraft's Yankees and their true fans, the well-scrubbed, well-behaved, well-heeled whites from the idyllic suburbs of northern New Jersey, Westchester and Connecticut.
I stood outside the deserted park and let my gaze drift from right to left, left to right, seeking movement, evidence of wildlife in the dark and savage environs of the South Bronx. I saw a boy about 12. He was walking by himself, minding his own business. But I approached him cautiously. They were like monkeys, Mr. Kraft had said. I half expected this kid to leap high in the air and start swinging from the streetlights or something. But the boy stayed on the ground.
He said his name was Kevin. When I asked if he was a Yankee fan, he smiled and said: "Yeah! Sometimes my uncle takes me to the games."
So much for the wildlife. I didn't bother to mention Richard Kraft, a monkey's uncle if there ever was one. If you want a clue as to what's wrong with the Yankees, just consider that Mr. Kraft is the team's vice president for community relations. His grand qualification for this important post apparently is that he was a college roommate of the team's principal monkey's uncle, George Steinbrenner.
Almost as soon as Mr. Kraft's comments were on the newsstands, the ball club, through a spokesman, said: "The New York Yankees offer an unequivocal apology for the statements attributed to Mr. Kraft. His comments in no way reflect the opinion of the Yankees."
Later, Richard Kraft denied that he had ever made the statements. You can take the denial with a grain of salt. Faced with the hideous prospect of unemployment, a middle-aged, marginally talented baseball executive might say anything. Richard Kraft will do what he has to do. By next week you can expect him to be lecturing on multiculturalism.
The problem with the Yankees is not Richard Kraft, it's George Steinbrenner. For years he's been stuffing his vaults with millions and millions of dollars from the taxpayers of New York, and from the proceeds of a team whose glorious history is totally and irrevocably entwined with the very idea of New York.
Nevertheless, Mr. Steinbrenner takes every opportunity to bad-mouth the city in general and the Bronx in particular, characterizing them as vile places populated by lowlifes intent on bringing him ruin. He should no longer be allowed to get away with this. The politicians who have spent long years crawling after Mr. Steinbrenner and kissing his shirttails should get off their knees and give him an ultimatum: Either stay in the Bronx and become part of an effort to revitalize the area surrounding Yankee Stadium, or get lost.
The Borough President of the Bronx, Fernando Ferrer, is one of the few politicians who hasn't been cowed by Mr. Steinbrenner. Mr. Ferrer has in hand an ambitious revitalization plan that would include substantial improvements in parking and other facilities for the Yankees, and an extensive renewal of the triangle of land where the stadium and the Bronx Terminal Market are located.
It is time for George Steinbrenner to stop leeching off the city. If he wants to be part of a South Bronx revitalization, fine. If not, good riddance. No other offers should be made. New Yorkers are not beholden to Mr. Steinbrenner. Let him pack up his team, his millions and his flock of co-dependents and get out of here.

HEADLINE: Hussein, King of Realpolitik

BYLINE: By Abba Eban; Abba Eban, former Foreign Minister of Israel, is writing a book on diplomacy after the cold war.

DATELINE: HERZLIYA, Israel

 BODY:
The pioneer of realism in the Arab perception of Israel was not President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt, who made peace with Israel in 1979. It was King Hussein of Jordan, who was talking amicably, but secretly, with Israeli leaders when Egyptian and Israeli forces were still exchanging bombardments and casualties.
As an ardent Arab nationalist, King Hussein would probably have preferred a Middle East without Israel, but he was quicker than any other Arab leader to understand that Israel had passed the threshold of destructibility. 
 As the years went by, he must have become painfully aware that nothing protected Jordan's survival more effectively than Israel's interest in preserving it. Israel made it known throughout the Middle East that an Iraqi or Syrian invasion of Jordan would probably incur Israeli intervention -- a rare case of a deterrent strategy that really worked.
Now King Hussein's realism seems about to pay off. A new Middle East is in the making.
The decision of King Hussein, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and President Clinton to confer in the White House on Monday is an immense boost for the peace process. Coming after the establishment of the Palestinian self-governing authority in Gaza and Jericho, it has left Israelis more sanguine about ultimate diplomatic success.
But this does not mean that the negotiations will come to a brisk conclusion. Even the Egyptian-Israeli treaty required 17 months of negotiations after President Sadat's visit to Jerusalem in 1977.
Nor will the Jordanian-Israeli dialogue be free of surrounding contention. King Hussein will feel pressure from many Jordanians with strong Palestinian affiliations on the West Bank and in Gaza who wish he would take more militant positions in support of Palestinian statehood.
But most Israelis believe that the strong leadership of King Hussein and Prime Minister Rabin, reinforced by President Clinton, will carry the day and ultimately sweep Syria into their momentum.
King Hussein's biography is studded with disasters that seem to indicate a habit for personal miscalculation. This is only partly true. Jordan's gravest tragedies have flowed from intimidation by other Arab states.
In 1967, President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt tricked King Hussein into entering the Six-Day War, in which he suffered a debacle. Nasser claimed to have already brought Israel to its knees. In the Persian Gulf war, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq lured King Hussein into the appearance of being on his side. King Hussein's position was untenable. Accused in the West of acting with cynical calculation, he alienated his natural allies in America, Europe and Saudi Arabia.
Until recently, it seemed probable that Syria would force its own rejectionist policies on Jordan. But for King Hussein to have lagged behind other Arab participants in the peace process would have been reckless. Jordan never gained any advantage by sacrificing its own national interests for the mystique of Arab unity.
How could a disgruntled Syria now do serious harm to a Kingdom of Jordan protected by American support, European sympathy and an agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, without which the Jordanian-Israeli accord would not have been signed?
King Hussein's slogan today is "Jordanian interests" -- which are not inferior to other interests. This is the hour for a show of Jordanian self-confidence, and King Hussein has so far exploited it impressively.
Jordan does not regard itself as the leader of the Arab world, but it may have more to contribute to a system of regional cooperation than any other state. The proximity of rival ports at Eilat and Aqaba, the need for sharing the Dead Sea and the Jordan-Yarmuk water systems, the large-scale potentiality for tourism once the barriers fall, the rapidity of land communication, the ties of the Jordan population with the self-governing Palestinian areas -- all point to a particular intimacy of relations among Israelis, Jordanians and Palestinians.
As King Hussein looks out across the Jordan, either from the eastern bank or from Aqaba, he may well be impressed by the spectacle of a dynamic Israeli society. His own kingdom has prospered, too. Israelis who have crossed over to Jordan speak respectfully of well-tended landscapes, a developed university and hospital network and a tradition of civility in the working of institutions.
The causes that brought the lengthy Israel-Jordanian talks to a deadlock since 1967 are not obscure. Israeli governments, haunted by Arab threats, felt it necessary to claim boundary changes beyond anything that Jordan could accept. But King Hussein's difficulties were not only territorial. His central concern was whether as the head of a small country he could audaciously take responsibility for leading the vast Arab world to peace with Israel. Was it not the duty of Cairo, Damascus, Baghdad and the holy cities of Islam to carry that burden?
This situation no longer prevails. All of Israel's neighbors are now negotiating in detail with Israel beyond the vague formalities of the largely ceremonial Madrid conference. In addition, King Hussein has skillfully passed the Palestinian issues to Palestinian leaders. He must feel satisfied with that decision, since it relieved him of potential responsibility for the chaos in Gaza that has tormented Yasir Arafat, especially the rioting on Sunday that led Israel to seal off Gaza.
Unlike its predecessors, the current Israeli Government is not killing the idea of peace by trying to rule permanently over nearly two million Palestinians without offering them equal citizenship or the chance to establish a separate jurisdiction.
Israel is also making cordial contacts with Arab states in North Africa and the Persian Gulf area. Jordan would not be a lonely adventurer in establishing relations with Israel.
When the time comes for the determination of permanent boundaries, which ought to be much less than three years away, the three peoples -- Israelis, Jordanians and Palestinians -- will probably move toward a community relationship, combining independence for each with close economic cooperation. (The European Union is a relevant example.)
The ultimate guarantee for peace lies in the creation of common regional interests with such entanglement of reciprocal advantage and such mutual human accessibility as to make future wars inconceivable.

HEADLINE: Italy's Economy Posts Gains, Not Losses

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your July 6 news article on Italy paints a grotesquerie of "very real fiscal problems" that differs sharply from reality. During the entire month of June, my wife and I toured the country, speaking with people at every stratum of society, getting the feel of post-election Italy. 
 The "trade deficit" you claim is "galloping" is a horse of a different color: a surplus of $18.7 billion for the last 12 months. That is the second highest in Europe. Your "creeping inflation" has crept downward by .4 percent in the last reporting period.
The Italian economy is strong compared with the rest of Europe and the United States. Gross domestic product rose at the rate of 3.2 percent in the last three months, the highest for the larger European economies. It compares well with our growth of 3 percent in the last trimester.
Italy's current account (budget) surplus for the last year of $8.3 billion is second only to France among major countries of Europe.
As an indicator of the optimism of small and large investors, the Italian stock market in the year to date is up about 21 percent in dollar terms.
Although Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's leadership has been questioned by you and by several leaders of European countries, Italians had their first opportunity since the national elections in March to pass judgment on their new leader during elections for the European Parliament in June. With 81 percent of eligible voters voting, in a country where voting is not compulsory, Mr. Berlusconi's Government saw about a 17 percent increase in support. This is significant inasmuch as the governing party or parties of most other countries in Europe lost support.
Your reference to the menace of "the brown shirts" seems to apply to a fear of a recrudescence of Fascism, a highly unlikely prospect, given the political attitudes of a preponderance of Italians in and out of public office. But it was brown shirts for Hitler's Nazis and black shirts for Mussolini's Fascists.

Cellular Necessity

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your July 6 news article made reference to merchants busily speaking on cellular phones in an unnamed city between San Sepolcro and Monterchi in Umbria. Your tone indicated they were so rich (or indolent) they could afford to use a cellular phone. 
 Having lived in Citta di Castello, near both villages, I can tell you that the absence of public telephones, lack of sufficient private lines and higher quality of cellular communications often make the use of cellular phones advisable if not indispensable. When traveling by car, a cellular was a must, as roadside phones were either broken or vandalized except at superstrada gas stations. On standard roads they were almost nonexistent.
In Italy you pay air time only when originating a cellular communication. In my job working for a ballet company with extensive ties to Poland, we often had to use the cellular phone to reach Poland, as the land lines were impossible from about 8 A.M. to 10 P.M. With our cellular phone the redial was automatic, and connection was usually within five minutes.

HEADLINE: Out-of-Wedlock Births Up Since '83, Report Indicates

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19

 BODY:
With the debate over reducing the country's welfare rolls focusing renewed attention on the rising birthrate among unwed women, the Census Bureau reported today that the number of children living with a parent who had never married -- a reflection of out-of-wedlock births -- soared by more than 70 percent from 1983 to 1993.
According to the bureau, 6.3 million children, or 27 percent of children under the age of 18, lived in 1993 with a single parent who had never married, up from 3.7 million in 1983. 
 While indicating that the annual increase in the number of children born out of wedlock slowed somewhat in the 1980's, the report also documented the sharp rise in these kinds of births over the last three decades. While there were 243,000 children living with one parent who had never married in 1960, by last year that number had climbed to 6.3 million.
"It's astonishing," said Kristin Moore, director of Child Trends, a Washington-based research organization that studies adolescent pregnancy. "It's really a substantial social change, and it's happened really fast."
The figures are compiled in an annual report by the Census Bureau titled "Marital Status and Living Arrangements." The findings mirror the results of other studies in recent years -- including those done by the Census Bureau -- that show out-of-wedlock births still on the rise.
The report demonstrated the extent to which blacks are affected by the changes that are roiling the traditional family structure. According to the report, 57 percent of black children are living with one parent who has never married, compared with 21 percent of white children and 32 percent of Hispanic children.
The latest figures are likely to fuel the debate over competing Democratic and Republican proposals on how to cut the country's welfare rolls.
In its bill, the Clinton Administration emphasizes the need to identify the fathers of children born out of wedlock and hold them responsible for financial support of their children, requires single mothers under the age of 20 to remain in school to continue to receive welfare benefits and allows states to limit additional cash benefits to women whose babies are conceived while they are on welfare.
But a group of Republicans in the House, contending that welfare provides a financial incentive for poor, unmarried women to bear children, goes Mr. Clinton one step further, freezing welfare payments at current levels and denying cash benefits to single mothers under the age of 18.
"I think these figures dramatize, once again, that our welfare policies are going in absolutely the wrong direction," said Representative Jan Meyers of Kansas, who is the architect of the Republican bill.
But some researchers say that freezing or denying welfare benefits would not have much, if any, effect on the soaring out-of-wedlock birthrates. They note that the out-of-wedlock birthrate rose in the 1960's when the value of welfare benefits went up. Yet the rate continued to rise in the 1970's and 80's, even though the value of the benefits declined because they did not keep pace with inflation.
"Research suggests that welfare accounts for some, but not all of this phenomenon," said Martha Farnsworth Riche, director of policy studies for the Population Reference Bureau, a private research group.
 
Family Trends
 The statistics included in the annual report also document other trends associated with the breakdown of the traditional American family:
*The number of unmarried adults nearly doubled, to 72.6 million from 37.5 million, from 1970 through 1993, with 58 percent of this group made up of adults who have never married.
*The number of people who are divorced tripled to 16.7 million in 1993 from 4.3 million in 1970.
*Men and women alike continue to delay marriage, with the median age at first marriages rising last year to 26.5 years for men and 24.5 years for women. The figures represent the highest median age at marriage for both men and women since 1890.
*The delay in marriage is greatest among blacks, with 22 percent of black women age 40 to 44 never having been married, compared with 7 percent of white women and 9 percent of Hispanic women.
 
Role in Social Problems
 But it is the drastic rise in the birthrate among unwed women and girls that is most likely to draw attention in the coming months as Congress debates several issues. The phenomenon of out-of-wedlock births has been cited as a factor in a host of social problems, including increased crime, drug abuse, welfare dependency and poor educational attainment.
Indeed, the bureau's report presented stark evidence of the socio-economic disadvantages confronted by children living in one-parent households, as against those in two-parent families. And the report indicated that those disadvantages were much more acute for a parent who never married.
According to the Census Bureau, the median family income in households where two parents were present was $43,578. In contrast, in one-parent families where the mother was divorced, the median income was $17,014, and where she had never been married, the median income was $9,272.
Similarly, 10.6 percent of children living in two-parent families were living below the poverty line. But 38.4 percent of children living with divorced mothers and 66.3 percent of those living with mothers who had never married were living below the poverty line.

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article and headline yesterday about a Census Bureau report on unwed mothers characterized the statistics incorrectly in some copies. The figures reported were for children living in single-parent households with a parent who had never married; the figures were not birthrates -- the number of births to unwed mothers.

HEADLINE: Investment In Tobacco Is Questioned

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
The trustees of New York City's largest public employee pension fund have taken what could be the first step toward eliminating the stocks of tobacco companies from the fund's portfolio of investments.
The trustees, who oversee $23 billion in pensions for city employees and retirees, have sent letters to eight tobacco manufacturers or suppliers whose stocks the fund holds, asking them to show how they will protect the fund's investments despite growing efforts across the country to restrict smoking. 
 The move, announced yesterday at a news conference by Public Advocate Mark J. Green and aides to Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, underscored the varied political pressures on the tobacco industry at a time when Congress is scrutinizing industry practices and when governments are considering wider restrictions on smoking in public places.
But Mr. Green and Deputy Comptroller Jon Lukomnik said they were acting more out of an economic concern rather than moral or social considerations. They said the pressures on the industry raised questions about the future risks of investing in tobacco companies.
 
Concern About Liabilities
 The officials also emphasized that they had not yet decided whether to sell the pension fund's tobacco company stocks, now valued at $295 million, or about 1 percent of the total. But they said their requests for information, in letters dated July 13, could lead to that.
"None of us, as trustees, officials or citizens, can be unaware of the dangers posed by this product and therefore the potential long-term liabilities and costs of this product," Mr. Green said.
The initial step by the trustees of the fund, the New York City Employee Retirement System, came as a growing number of municipalities, universities and hospitals have given up tobacco stocks, much as, in a protest against apartheid in the 1980's, they gave up stock in companies that had holdings in South Africa.
In 1990, Harvard University and the City University of New York voted to eliminate stocks of tobacco companies from their investments. Since then several local governments, like including Pittsburgh, Cambridge, Mass., and Fulton County in Georgia, have also decided to divest, according to the Tobacco Control Resource Center at Northeastern University in Boston.
 
Action Could Take Years
 Brad S. Krevor, the executive director of the center, a nonprofit group that has pushed local governments and institutions to drop their tobacco stocks, said that local governments that invested in tobacco companies also were paying education and health-care costs related to smoking.
"We shouldn't be profiting from addiction," he said.
The city's public employee pension fund holds about 7.5 million shares in six tobacco manufacturers: Philip Morris U.S.A., RJR Nabisco Holdings, United States Tobacco Company Inc., American Maize-Products, the Loews Corporation and the Culbro Corporation. It also holds 1.5 million shares in the Eastman Kodak Company, which produces cigarette filters, and the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, which supplies paper to cigarette makers.
The pension fund's trustees -- the Mayor's office, the Comptroller, Public Advocate, the five borough presidents and three union leaders -- asked the companies to provide details of how they plan to cope with potential liability from lawsuits, restrictions on smoking and other matters that could hurt the companies financially.
 
'We're a Good Investment'
 "Many investors are seriously concerned about both the social and economic implications of their investments in companies that manufacture cigarettes and other tobacco products," the letters to the companies said. The letters added, "We too are concerned."
The pension fund sold off its stocks in companies doing business in South Africa in 1990 -- the only time it has divested a type of stock -- after a five-year process of review that began under Mayor Edward I. Koch. It lifted the ban last October after that country moved toward democratic elections.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 23, 1994, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about the New York City pension system's investments in tobacco stocks referred incorrectly to Eastman Kodak's involvement in the tobacco industry. Although a former subsidiary, Eastman Chemical, produces material for cigarette filters, the company is no longer affiliated with Eastman Kodak. In some editions the article also misidentified one company in which the pension system has invested. It is RJR Nabisco, not RJR Reynolds.

HEADLINE: Bacterial Evidence Forces Cruise Liner To Stop All Service

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HAMILTON, Bermuda, July 20

 BODY:
The cruise ship Horizon was taken out of service today, and the vacation plans of more than 1,000 passengers were upended, after test results came back showing the possible presence of the Legionnaires' disease bacteria in the ship's water system.
Spokesmen for Celebrity Cruises, which operates the luxury liner, said it would arrange flights back to New York on Thursday for the passengers. They had been evacuated from the ship Tuesday and put up in hotels here while the Horizon's water systems were being disinfected to eliminate any bacteria that might have caused four confirmed cases of Legionnaires' disease and 18 possible cases among passengers who had traveled on recent cruises. 
 Today's news caused anger among the passengers, who had showed up to board the ship in New York on Saturday only to be greeted by leaflets announcing that they faced a small risk of getting Legionnaires' disease.
They talked of being whipsawed emotionally by sudden announcements of troubling new developments, including midnight notifications slipped under their stateroom doors, and they accused Celebrity of knowingly sending them off on vacations that were likely to be disrupted if not dangerous.
Celebrity officials said that they had acted in good faith and that Federal health officials had not recommended last weekend that the cruise be canceled. They are promising full refunds to passengers on this cruise as well as for travelers who have already booked other trips on the Horizon. The company has canceled the Horizon cruise scheduled to leave this weekend.
"Everyone is entitled to a worry-free vacation, and this has been anything but that," said John Largan of Floral Park, L.I., as he angrily prepared to retrieve his luggage from the ship for the flight back to New York on Thursday. "And on top of all of this they are cutting our vacations short by three days."
When the passengers do get home, they can only wait out the incubation period of the disease to see if they fall ill, and even then it will take a blood test to determine whether they have Legionnaires' disease rather than another form of pneumonia.
 
Disease Is Readily Treatable
 The disease can set in from 2 to 10 days after infection and produces headache, fever, coughs, chest pains, diarrhea and some delirium. It is readily treatable with the antibiotic erythromycin, but death rates in cases where patients are sick enough to be hospitalized have reached 15 percent.
The news of the possible presence of Legionnaires' bacteria on the Horizon grew out of an investigation begun on the ship Saturday by officials of the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after three recent passengers turned up at a New Jersey hospital with symptoms of the disease.
Bob Howard, a spokesman for the C.D.C. in Atlanta, said today that the agency took some 32 specimens from a variety of locations on the 12-deck ship, including samplings from shower heads, basins, water faucets and Jacuzzi's. The specimens were sent to Atlanta, where they were grown in cultures, and it was the results of those efforts that were reported today.
Mr. Howard said the tests had actually found the presence of the "DNA of legionella bacteria" and not the live bacteria themselves, in "several locations among those from which specimens were taken." The DNA material suggests the presence of the live or dead bacteria that could actually cause the disease, but it does not completely and conclusively confirm that presence, he said. Additional cultures would be required to determine that.
Mr. Howard would not specify where on the ship the material was found. And he noted that the cruise line, in its diligence to remove all potential dangers, might have washed the ship clean and disinfected it of any remnants of the bacteria. During the stay here in Bermuda the ship's systems for handling and desalinating ocean water were flushed, bathed in a concentrated solution of chlorine and rinsed clean.
"It could very well be that they killed and washed away all active bacteria with this process," Mr. Howard said. "We still can't say that those people were made ill on that ship, and we may never be able to say that for sure. But at this point our investigation is by no means over."
Windell Bradford, deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, praised the cruise line for its cooperation and noted that Celebrity had acted to cut the risk of infection to passengers throughout the trip and always without prodding from the agency.
 
Insufficient Information
 He said the C.D.C. did not recommend that the Horizon stay in New York on Saturday because the agency did not have sufficient information to warrant such a decision. The only recommendation that the agency made when the ship left New York was that it flush and decontaminate its systems as soon as possible.
At a news conference in Manhattan hours after Celebrity Cruises learned of the C.D.C.'s findings, Al Wallach, senior vice president for passenger services for the cruise lines, said that although "C.D.C. and we believe the vessel is completely safe now and ready to sail," the company is arranging a place in the United States to dock the ship so more tests can be done if necessary.
He also said he did not know where on the ship the Federal officials found the suspect specimens. Mr. Wallach said the ship is routinely inspected by the New York State Department of Health as well as routinely chlorinated. The ship was last inspected in February.
Horizon, which made its debut in 1990, is one of three ships owned by Celebrity Cruise Lines. It has a capacity of 1,500 passengers and spends half of its season in Bermuda and the other in the Caribbean. The other two ships are the Zenith and Meridian. The Meridian also travels to Bermuda.
 
Refund Applications
 Mr. Wallach, who said passengers should contact their travel agents about obtaining refunds, declined to comment on how much the episode is costing the company, saying, "It's not an economic issue."
And he expressed sympathy for the passengers angered with how the cruise company has handled the situation.
"Passengers are frustrated because information has not come in even flow," he said. "It's perfectly natural to be frustrated and display some disbelief when you make people wait for something.
"We hope they would understand this is a dynamic, moving situation," Mr. Wallach said.
But here in Hamilton today, the passengers were not in an understanding mood.
It was pandemonium at tea time in the lobby of the luxurious Hamilton Princess Hotel as angry passengers who had checked out earlier today in expectation of returning to the ship were clamoring to get new rooms in which to stay until they left Thursday. A day earlier, many had joked about the stay in the Bermuda hotels, luxurious by most standards, and viewed it as an unexpected but pleasant interlude. Some even called it an adventure.
Today, that all changed.
Referring to the refund from the cruise line, a livid Ann Marie Prisco, from Wantagh, L.I., said through tears: "Forget the money. And forget the lost three days. They have jeopardized our lives."
Steve Savona, of Clifton, N.J., was trying to take it all in stride, noting that all that had happened was unforeseeable and not anybody's fault. What was disastrous, he said, was the "bumbling way" in which officials of the cruise line had handled things.
"It's been a comedy of errors from the beginning," he said. "Every time we started feeling comfortable and relaxed, some new thing happened, and now this."

HEADLINE: Federal Reserve's Chief Suggests A New Rate Rise May Be Needed

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
The hairman of the Federal Reserve said today that the four increases in interest rates this year might not have been enough to keep inflation under control. His remarks caused a drop in American stock and bond markets as investors concluded that a further increase was more likely than many had thought.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman, stopped short of actually declaring that he would raise interest rates, saying that Government economic indicators were not currently providing a clear signal of future inflation. 
 But he gave some indications of his plans by telling the Senate Banking Committee that it remained an "open question" whether the rate increases so far were sufficient to prevent future inflation. And he added for the first time that it would be better for the nation's economy if rates were too high than not high enough.
If the central bank raised rates again and the economy slowed sharply, Mr. Greenspan said, it could easily lower rates and the economy would bounce back quickly. But if the Federal Reserve failed to raise rates high enough, he said, inflation could return and could be beaten back only at the cost of a prolonged economic slowdown.
His comments today prompted traders and investors to sell securities now because another interest rate increase might force prices lower. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 21.04 points, to 3,727.27, while the interest rate on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 7.54 percent, from 7.46 percent on Tuesday. [Pages D7 and D8.]
Mr. Greenspan, often called the second-most-powerful man in the country after the President and the most powerful in economic terms, had carefully avoided saying in recent weeks that he would not raise short-term interest rates again, so his comments today did not signal a new policy. He has said repeatedly since the Federal Reserve began raising its short-term interest rate target in February that the central bank would take whatever action necessary to prevent inflation from returning to the American economy.
But after the fourth interest rate increase in May, when the rate for overnight loans between banks was increased to 4.25 percent, Mr. Greenspan did say that the Federal Reserve had "substantially" completed its program of monetary-policy tightening. Today, he avoided such language.
The threat of another increase in short-term interest rates is not a new one for the financial markets. Many traders, analysts and economists have been predicting that the Federal Reserve would have to move rates up again one or more times this year. In fact, many analysts were expecting a fifth rate increase to come just after the Federal Reserve's policymaking committee met earlier this month. So Mr. Greenspan's hint of another increase should not have been a total surprise.
But when the Federal Reserve refrained earlier this month from raising rates -- and when new economic data indicated that inflation remained in check and that the pace of economic growth might be slowing -- there was talk in the financial markets that the Fed might be able to wait a while before a next move. But today, Mr. Greenspan's comments seemed to indicate and were interpreted as a signal that the Fed's next move would be sooner rather than later.
 
Debate Over Inventories
 He also emphasized today that the dollar's recent fall could fuel inflation. And he criticized the popular view among some economists that a recent increase in businesses' inventories meant that prices would not be rising soon.
Some of the increase in inventories consists of imported goods, and some may reflect a desire by companies to have more products on hand for consumers to buy, Mr. Greenspan said. Either case suggests that American factories may continue working at full speed, he said.
Future inflation is a risk because continued economic growth means that the nation's businesses are operating ever closer to full capacity, which means that inflationary bottlenecks could appear, Mr. Greenspan added.
Robert DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said that while Mr. Greenspan did not send a clear signal of more interest rate increases, "all the language was tilted to one side, in the direction of tightening."
Another interest rate increase in the coming weeks could produce considerable rancor in the Fed's relationship with the Clinton Administration -- a relationship that has already frayed over the last few months.
Administration officials largely abstained from publicly jawboning the Fed during the spring. But that reticence has faded this summer.
Asked on July 8 whether the Fed should raise interest rates to help support the dollar in international currency markets, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen responded, "Not at this point."
Mr. Bentsen was more circumspect today. "I do not try to predict what the Federal Reserve is going to do," he said at a White House news conference on health care. "I think that the Federal Reserve and Alan Greenspan shares with us the objective of long-term growth with low inflation."
 
Differing Assumptions
 The White House's economic forecast for the second half of this year, which was released last Thursday, assumed no further increases in short-term interest rates until the end of this year or early next year.
The White House also forecast that consumer prices would rise 3 percent this year, 3.2 percent next year and 3.4 percent a year in the late 1990's. Mr. Greenspan criticized this as undesirable.
"I should note, however, that most Federal Reserve policy makers would not regard the inflation projections of these other forecasters, which generally do not foresee further progress toward price stability over the medium term, as a desirable outcome," he said.
Mr. Greenspan predicted today that the American economy would grow 3 to 3.25 percent this year and 2.5 to 2.75 percent next year. The estimates are similar to a White House forecast last Thursday that economic growth would be 3 percent this year and 2.7 percent next year.
He predicted that consumer prices would rise 2.75 percent to 3 percent this year and the same or slightly higher next year, and provided no estimates beyond that.
 
Action vs. Inference
 "It is an open question whether our actions to date have been sufficient to head off inflationary pressures and thus maintain favorable trends in the economy," Mr. Greenspan said in his opening remarks.
In the closing minutes of the three-and-a-half hour hearing, Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., the Michigan Democrat who heads the Banking Committee, told Mr. Greenspan that his initial remarks had been widely interpreted in the financial markets as signaling another interest rate increase. Mr. Greenspan then responded with his comment that it would be better to raise rates too much than too little.
"If we fail to recognize emerging inflationary forces, remedying that will be far more difficult and far more of a problem for the long-term stability of the economy in 1995 and beyond," he said.
Marc W. Wanshel, an economist at J. P. Morgan in New York, said that the comment made an additional tightening of monetary policy and higher interest rates likely.
"He's setting up a very severe test that you have to pass not to have a further tightening," Mr. Wanshel said. "What he's saying is that any further up-creep in inflation could provide the basis for further tightening."
But Wayne D. Angell, who left the Fed in February and is now an economist at Bear, Stearns, said that Mr. Greenspan had kept enough balance in his remarks to keep the central bank's options open as further evidence emerged this summer of the economy's health. "He didn't close any doors, which is really very appropriate," Mr. Angell said.
With some exceptions, Senate Democrats were less critical of the Fed's interest rate increases than earlier this spring.
 
Insensitivity on Unemployment
 The main disagreement came over unemployment, with several Democratic Senators accusing the Fed chief of insensitivity. "This is about real people, flesh and blood, and not numbers on an economist's work sheet," said Senator Carol Moseley Braun, Democrat of Illinois.
Mr. Greenspan said that unemployment, at 6 percent, was already so low that faster growth from low interest rates would not put the remaining unemployed Americans back to work. People still without jobs now are unemployed because they lack skills that employers need, he said. "Monetary policy, which works mainly by influencing aggregate demand, is not suited to addressing such problems," Mr. Greenspan added.
Mr. Greenspan repeated today his recent contention that low inflation helped to increase productivity in the economy. But when pressed by Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, about whether he was making too much of a recent Fed study that reached this conclusion, Mr. Greenspan said that the evidence for his position was "fragmentary," and not conclusive.

HEADLINE: A Cheap New York? For Foreign Visitors, Yes.

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
Last week, Alain Tobier waited in line two hours to climb the Statue of Liberty. He marveled at the view from the World Trade Center and had his picture taken with a dinosaur at the American Museum of Natural History. But now he was concentrating on what really drew him to New York: shopping.
Standing at the counter at 47th Street Photo, Mr. Tobier, an aerospace engineer from Toulouse, France, looked through the viewfinder of the Pentax autofocus 35-millimeter camera recommended by a salesman. He had already bought an Epson portable computer upstairs. One of his companions was carrying a new Wilson tennis racquet in his bag. The other had a box of Timberland shoes. 
 "Everything is so much more expensive at home," Mr. Tobier said. "We have a list of all the things we're supposed to buy for our friends. This is so much fun."
Join the club. Tourists from abroad, spurred on by the fall in the dollar that makes many foreign currencies especially valuable here these days, are spending their francs, marks and yen more freely than ever this summer. Together with a revival in visitors from elsewhere in the United States, New York City appears to be experiencing its best tourist season in years.
"New York is the shopping mecca of the world," said Mitchell Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University. "The decline of the dollar is doing more to boost tourism here than all the promotional campaigns put together."
To Brett Spencer, a journalist from London, New York is everything he expected -- and more. "It's too hot, too crowded and too noisy, and we can't get enough of it," said Mr. Spencer, 25, who was visiting the Empire State Building with his father. "People told us we'd either love it or hate it. So far, we love it."
Visitors accounted for more than $14 billion in economic activity in 1992, the most recent year for which figures are available, the United States Travel and Tourism Administration reports. Travel and tourism support 154,000 jobs, according to the City Economic Policy and Marketing Group. Cultural activities, heavily attended by visitors, add another 58,000 jobs. To put that in perspective, the entire banking and credit industry accounts for fewer than 150,000 New York City jobs.
Foreign tourism, which is up all over the country, is particularly important. While visitors from abroad made up only about 20 percent of the 25 million people who stayed overnight in New York City in 1992, the city's Convention and Visitors Bureau estimates that they spent more than 40 percent of the dollars that tourists left behind.
Europeans account for the bulk of the visitors from abroad, but tourism officials also note that visitors from Latin America are on the rise. There has been a slight decline, they say, in the number of visitors from Japan.
This year, signs abound of increased visits by Americans and foreigners alike. Moreover, it is not just the World Cup, the Gay Games and other highly publicized events that account for the improvement. Hotel business is up sharply since the beginning of the year. After slumping from 1987 through last summer, hotel occupancy rates began to creep higher late in 1993. Now they are climbing steadily.
Despite a harsh winter, hotel occupancy rose nearly four percentage points, to 64 percent, during the first quarter this year, compared with the same time last year. In May, 77 percent of the roughly 65,000 hotel rooms in the city were full, according to the Pannell Kerr Foster consulting firm. That is up from 71 percent in May 1993, and just 68 percent the year before.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art, noting an unusual number of European visitors, reported attendance up by 8.2 percent in the first quarter. Visits to the Statue of Liberty, which was closed frequently this winter because of harsh weather, nonetheless are running even with last year and were up by 4 percent in June, to 307,000, compared with last year.
 
High-Rising Attendance
 Meanwhile, attendance at the Empire State Building, which reopened from repair work on May 20, has risen by 17 percent over the same period last year.
"This is turning into one of our best years ever," said Laura Fries, director of visitor marketing for the skyscraper. "The whole world knows about the Empire State Building. This is a true Tower of Babel."
It is not just international visitors who flock to the observation decks on the 86th and 110th floors. Chris and Cyndi Mooney, heading to upstate New York from Wilmington, Del., were not planning to visit the city this summer. But their daughter, Jenny, 5, persuaded them to spend a couple of days seeing the sights, specifically the Empire State Building.
"She wanted to see where Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan met in 'Sleepless in Seattle,' " Mr. Mooney said. "How could we say no?"
To most Americans, New York stands out as perhaps the most expensive city in the country. The average hotel room rate today is $144. The cost of restaurant meals, from McDonald's to the Rainbow Room, is higher than elsewhere.
David Jackson, a director of a private school who lives in Corona, Calif., is still in shock. Hoping to save money, he stayed in Fort Lee, N.J., as his travel agent suggested. But the savings quickly disappeared, swallowed up by renting two cars and paying tolls and gasoline. He spent $455 for his family, which includes his wife and five children, to see "The Phantom of the Opera" on Broadway "and the seats weren't even that good," he complained.
Still, Mr. Jackson said: "Everybody needs to see New York at least once. There's nothing else like it."
To visitors from Europe and Japan, however, New York is a bargain. "Most things here seem pretty inexpensive," said Henning Groenbaek, a Danish visitor.
Most products like cameras and electronics equipment are heavily taxed in Europe and Asia, making them substantially more expensive there than in the United States. In addition, the exchange rate of most European currencies against the dollar is up about 10 percent since the beginning of the year, making goods bought in the United States even more of a bargain.
Yuko Kitani, from Osaka, Japan, has visited SoHo, Greenwich Village, Central Park, the Brooklyn Bridge and the World Trade Center in her two-week visit. "You can find something to do 24 hours a day," she said. When not sightseeing, though, she particularly enjoys shopping. "There are a lot of speciality shops," she said. "There is a shop for everything."
Indeed, foreign tourists appear to be on a spree. The amount of foreign currency exchanged last month at American Express offices in New York City rose by 25 percent over June 1993, said Nancy Muller, a spokeswoman for American Express. Part of the increase was a reflection of the World Cup games, she said, but not all of it.
Glenn Weilgus, a spokesman for the South Street Seaport, said the number of visitors at the enclosed marketplace, a prime tourist attraction, was up at least 5 percent from last year. "Foreign tourists just love American name brands," Mr. Weilgus said. "They go nuts in places like J. Crew and Gap Kids."
Adrienne Cleere, vice president of international marketing at Bloomingdale's, agreed. "We're even starting to advertise on CNN International in Asia, Latin America and Europe," she said.
Still, not everybody comes to New York just to spend money. Mirco Schumann is a schoolteacher who lives in the eastern section of Berlin, behind the wall before it was torn down in 1989. He said the high point of his trip with his parents, Dietman and Monica, was their visit to the Statue of Liberty.
"It was important to see the Statue of Freedom," he said. "For us from the East, freedom is more valuable than anything else."

HEADLINE: Stocks Tumble Over Fears of a Rate Rise

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan managed to spook the financial markets yesterday by merely telling them generally what he has said before and refusing to rule out further increases in interest rates. But there were some nuances in his testimony before Congress that put traders' teeth on edge.
The stock, bond, and currency markets all nose-dived on the Federal Reserve Board chairman's statement to the Senate Banking Committee that Fed policies "need to remain disciplined and focused." 
 That statement, combined with Mr. Greenspan's comments that inflation might still accelerate and a declining dollar is inflationary, made some traders conclude that a rate increase could come sooner rather than later.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 21.04 points, to 3,727.27, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 fell 2.26 points, to 451.60. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index fell 6.55 points, to 712.77.
 
Below-Average Volume
 Moderating the price decline somewhat was below-average volume on the New York Stock Exchange, the nation's largest exchange, with its most valuable stocks. A total of 268 million shares changed hands.
Some analysts said that the markets were right to decline but not as much as they did. "The magnitude was out of proportion," said Neal M. Soss, chief economist at CS First Boston. "I saw nothing in Greenspan's testimony that was a declaration of war on business expansion."
On the other hand, he said, "the financial markets may have lulled themselves into a false complacency" that the Fed would not raise rates soon. The Fed's policy-making committee earlier this month declined to raise rates, as some traders had expected.
What was striking about Mr. Greenspan's testimony yesterday was its pointed declaration that the dollar's fall against the Japanese yen and European currencies hurt the American economy. That could mean there is another reason for the Fed to raise interest rates soon -- to defend the dollar.
What made the declaration noteworthy was that on a so-called trade- weighted basis, taking into account major trading partners like Canada and Mexico, against whose currencies the dollar has not declined that much, the dollar has been stable or rising slightly for much of the year, calling into question the inflationary effect of the dollar's volatility.
But even if a declining dollar does not contribute that much to inflation, Mr. Soss said, it does make borrowing from Asia and Europe more expensive. "We don't finance the economy across the Rio Grande or the St. Lawrence Seaway," he said. "We finance it across the Atlantic and Pacific."
The financial markets were not the only ones to decline yesterday. Also falling was the commodities market, but falling prices there for agricultural goods and other raw materials are taken as a good sign for the economy.
 
Fall in Commodities Market
 Coffee prices declined on weak demand, lumber dropped on weak housing construction, and crude oil prices slipped on unexpectedly ample supplies. The Commodity Research Bureau futures price index dropped 2.42 points, to 231.78, a steep drop that on another day would have prompted rallies in the stock and bond markets.
The reaction to Mr. Greenspan's testimony was sharp among bond traders. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose about 10 basis points in only two hours, finally closing at 7.54 percent, up from 7.46 percent .
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.19 points, to 249.70, with advancing stocks lagging behind declining stocks by 756 to 1,401. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 0.90 point, to 433.00.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 15 fell, led by Caterpillar, which dropped 1 1/2, to 107 5/8, on no immediate news. Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 304 fell, led by Microsoft, which dropped 1 3/4, to 48 3/8, in advance of announced fourth-quarter earnings of 59 cents a share versus 43 cents.
The most active stock, at 11.2 million shares, was Sybase , which fell 8 3/4, to 39 3/4, following news that in the second quarter sales of its key software product, a way of searching through large data bases, was slowing.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Fall in Price

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell sharply yesterday after the chairman of the Federal Reserve indicated that another increase in interest rates might be needed
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 28/32 , to 8424/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, jumped to 7.54 percent, from 7.46 percent on Tuesday. 
 "The bond markets are going to run scared for a while," said Ed Labenski, chief investment officer for $4 billion at IDS Fixed-Income Advisors in Minneapolis.
The fall in the market was touched off in the morning when Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, told a Senate panel the Fed might raise interest rates again to contain inflation. The comments surprised investors who had been buying bonds in the last week on the assumption the Fed would not soon increase rates.
Mr. Greenspan's comments shook the bond market, even though some economists had expected the central bank to raise rates 50 basis points this quarter.
 
'Robust and Rapid' Economy
 "It's the first time in a while that the Fed described the economy as robust and rapid," said Michael Strauss, chief economist at Yamaichi International. "If you read through the text, everything is one-sided. The market was betting on great news out of the testimony."
Some investors now expect the Fed to raise rates as early as the middle of August, when the Fed's policy-making committee meets again, to pre-empt inflation. The Fed chairman said yesterday that there was evidence that inflation was building.
"In recent months, we have seen some of these signs" of possible accelerating inflation, like labor shortages, slower deliveries of goods and rising commodity prices, Mr. Greenspan said.
The Fed has raised short-term interest rates four times this year to rein in inflation, which erodes the value of bonds. Thirty-year bond yields were 6.3 percent before the Fed began raising rates in February.
Municipal bond pricess fell as concern about higher interest rates dampened investor demand for large California and New York City offerings yesterday.
California sold a record $4 billion in revenue-anticipation warrants to raise cash needed to cover its mounting bills. Seven underwriting syndicates submitted winning bids on California's sale, with the series C warrants priced to yield between 4.75 percent and 4.80 percent at maturity in April 1996.
 
General Obligation Bonds
 New York City sold $791 million in general obligation bonds in an offering managed by Prudential Securities Inc. The bonds were tentatively priced to yield up to 6.45 percent in 2010.
In the corporate bond market, five companies sold $1.25 billion of debt even as rates rose.
The Columbia HCA Healthcare Corporation sold $200 million of three-year floating-rate debt, MCM Corporate Watch said. Avco Financial Services Inc., a unit of Textron Inc., sold $200 million of five-year notes and the Chemical Banking Corporation sold $150 million of 12-year subordinated notes, according to Corporate Watch.
Elsewhere, Daimler-Benz A.G., the German auto maker and industrial giant, sold $606 million of certificates backed by truck loans through its North American unit, MCM Corporate Watch said. The Green Tree Financial Corporation sold $92.4 million of asset-backed securities.

HEADLINE: Haiti Holding Up Relief Supplies as a Bargaining Chip to Gain Recognition

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, July 20

 BODY:
In an effort to win some form of diplomatic recognition, Haiti's military-appointed Government is holding up shipments of food and other relief supplies until foreign embassies apply to the two-month-old Government for a special tax exemption on imports.
In some instances, food shipments from donor countries, which include the United States, Canada, France and the European Union, have been kept on the docks here since April and have rotted or been pilfered. 
 The usual practice here is for the donor countries to transport food and medicine to Haiti by ship and then turn over the supplies to international volunteer organizations, which then distribute the supplies throughout the country.
Diplomats said the Government of Emile Jonassaint, installed in May to lend legitimacy to the rule of Gen. Raoul Cedras, is demanding that embassies of donor countries formally apply to Government ministries for an exemption from a tax levied on imported goods. In the past, relief supplies have been granted the exemption as a matter of course, but with foreign governments continuing to recognize the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide as Haiti's constitutional President, those in power have decided to force the issue.
 
Blackmail, Pure and Simple'
 "It's blackmail, pure and simple," one diplomat here said. "The Government claims it is the embargo that is starving people, but then won't let food shipments in."
The delays have not yet begun to significantly hamper the extensive feeding programs sponsored by relief organizations because most of them have large amounts of food stockpiled around Haiti. But the director of one such group said he was perturbed by the game of political brinksmanship going on and said his group would be crippled if the Haitian Government makes good its threat to force payment of the tax.
Similar problems have developed with a shipment of fuel, intended for use by aid groups, that is due to arrive this week. Diplomats said a letter sent to the Haitian Army asking for permission to unload the cargo and hand it over to relief organizations, the procedure that has been followed in the past, was returned with instructions that the request be made to the Jonassaint Government.
At a news conference this week, Foreign Minister Charles David denied that the Haitian Government was using food supplies as leverage to seek concessions from the approximately 15 foreign countries that still recognize Father Aristide and maintain embassies here. "There is no new policy" concerning the distribution of relief shipments, he said.
But diplomats here said they were informed as early as April that if the economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations were increased, General Cedras might suspend all food aid programs.
Elaborating on the issue of food supplies and diplomatic status, Mr. David accused foreign embassies here of abusing their privileges. He said he found it "extraordinary" that foreign diplomats could fly in food and other items "that make their daily lives more bearable" while Haitians suffer from the embargo. He warned that reprisals might be taken.
Diplomats described Mr. David's accusation as fanciful, pointing out that luxury items such as French wine are readily available in grocery stores in upper-class neighborhoods where Cabinet ministers and other officials live.
 
Order to Journalists
 The broader question of the Government's lack of international status is extremely sensitive here. Last week, the Ministry of Information issued a communique ordering journalists to stop referring to Mr. Jonassaint and his Cabinet as a "de facto" Government, insisting that it was a "provisional and constitutional" Government. The order has mostly been ignored.
Haitian officials have also told the United States to register Radio Democracy, the new radio station set up by Washington to broadcast Father Aristide's message to the Haitian people, with the authorities.
The United States provides the Haitian Government with flight information on Coast Guard planes monitoring the flow of refugees trying to flee Haiti by boat, but has turned down requests for other information on the refugees.
Mr. David also said that the Haitian Government was abiding by all the terms of the Vienna Convention, the international agreement that establishes the rules for the treatment of diplomats and embassies. But diplomats here challenged that assertion, saying the Government has recently threatened on several occasions to open diplomatic pouches at the Port-au-Prince airport.
"Their attitude is 'if you won't recognize us, we won't recognize you,' " a diplomat said. "And since we will not deal with their Government, that is where the matter stands."

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
A Panama Enemy Becomes an Ally

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
Panama's President-elect, a stalwart in the political party that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega controlled until American troops ousted him in 1989, is suddenly the darling of official Washington.
The President-elect, Ernesto Perez Balladares, says he would allow up to 10,000 Haitians to stay in temporary havens in Panama after he takes office on Sept. 1. The Clinton Administration thought it had a deal with Panama's incumbent President, Guillermo Endara, to take in the boat people. But Mr. Endara, who was installed by American troops after General Noriega's downfall, abruptly withdrew his offer this month, leaving the White House strategy in shambles. 
 Mr. Perez Balladares has set strict conditions on his offer: the Haitians must stay at American military bases in Panama under American supervision, and for no more than six months.
 
'Do Whatever We Can'
 "We have to do whatever we can without hurting our own national interests to bring about a reasonable solution to the Haitian crisis," said Mr. Perez Balladares, a wealthy 48-year-old businessman whose stocky build has earned him the nickname Toro, or bull.
The flow of boat people has ebbed in recent days so the question of safe havens may be moot. But Mr. Perez Balladares has also pledged to help the United States in anti-drug efforts and to press for new laws to prevent money-laundering in Panama and increase penalties for violators.
That President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore met with Mr. Perez Balladares at the White House today to discuss Haiti, among other issues, offers an instructive tale of how mutual economic, diplomatic and security interests of the present can outweigh the differences of the past.
"We'll judge the guy more on his performance and less on his record as a member of Noriega's former party," said one Administration official.
 
Questioned for Several Hours
 Five years ago, Mr. Perez Balladares managed the campaign of General Noriega's handpicked presidential candidate, Carlos Duque, who lost to Mr. Endara. In the 1989 invasion that ousted General Noriega, American troops seized and questioned Mr. Perez Balladares for several hours before eventually releasing him.
Since then, he has resurrected his discredited Revolutionary Democratic Party by distancing it from General Noriega and embracing the legacy of another former dictator, Gen. Omar Torrijos. General Torrijos remains a national hero for building public housing for the poor and negotiating the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties with President Carter.
"Noriega kidnapped our party more than we got together with him," said Mr. Perez Balladares, who won a narrow victory in May over six other candidates in Panama's first democratic elections in more than a quarter of a century. "We've been able to separate that. People understand that Noriega had no political following in Panama. He was a strongman whose leadership was based on force."
 
Who's Who of the Opposition
 Although a disciple of General Torrijos, Mr. Perez Balladares says he will not repeat that regime's curbs on the press and political dissenters. Indeed, the President-elect has packed his Cabinet with a who's who of Panama's free-market economists and former opposition leaders. His foreign minister-designate, for example, is Gabriel Lewis Galindo, a respected former ambassador to Washington who led the political fight against General Noriega from exile in Washington.
The makeover of his party and his own image, and the accompanying layers of irony, are no't lost on Mr. Perez Balladares, a former Citibank executive who was schooled at the University of Notre Dame and at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. So far he is saying what the Administration wants to hear, but will he deliver?
"I want to make sure we make a difference," Mr. Perez Balladares said in an interview. "We want to make sure that the American public understands we're representative of the Panamanian people. We want to maintain a good working relationship."

HEADLINE: Bentsen on Derivatives

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told an important House committee today that a panel of top regulators was working to tighten oversight of the derivatives markets, but that the panel did not see an immediate need for legislation.
Mr. Bentsen, who is also chairman of the panel, the Working Group on Financial Markets, said that instead of pushing for legislation, financial regulators were amending and updating regulations to cope with the derivatives market. 
 Derivatives are complex contracts whose values are tied to -- or derived from -- the performance of an underlying asset, like a currency, or the performance of a financial market, like the one in interest-rate securities.
Mr. Bentsen issued a report to Representative John D. Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has oversight over financial markets, on Monday. Mr. Dingell's office released the report today.
Mr. Bentsen's panel includes the heads of the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The panel was originally formed to examine the causes of the October 1987 stock market crash.
Mr. Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan, asked the group in May to comment on issues raised by a General Accounting Office report that called for regulations in the face of the explosive growth of the derivatives markets.
Responding to Secretary Bentsen's report, the Congressman said he was "encouraged" by actions taken so far by regulators to address concerns raised by the G.A.O., which is the auditing and investigative agency of Congress.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE CAMPAIGN;
Clinton Insists He Won't Retreat on Coverage for All

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
After a torrent of criticism from supporters who feared that he was retreating on health care, President Clinton and his Administration went all out today to insist that he would never compromise on his goal of legislation providing health insurance for all Americans.
The President told reporters before a meeting with Congressional leaders that while he was "flexible" on how to reach the goal, he would not abandon it. "If we tinker around with the system and don't try to do something comprehensive," he said, "we could actually make it worse for ordinary Americans. We could increase the cost to middle-class Americans and decrease coverage." 
 At a meeting of the nation's governors on Tuesday in Boston, Mr. Clinton said he might settle for legislation that would produce 95 percent or 98 percent coverage. Today, two House Democrats, Representatives David E. Bonior of Michigan and Butler Derrick of South Carolina, told him that his remarks had not helped those pushing in Congress for universal health coverage and had rattled many of the President's supporters.
"We're past the time for intellectual rationalization," Mr. Derrick, a deputy chief whip, said with some exasperation.
Senior White House officials conceded that Mr. Clinton might have miscalculated the impact of his comments before the governors. "I think he got into a technical discussion about finance with a group who could understand it," one White House official said, "and maybe he wasn't thinking about how it would be interpreted by people who were poised to see the first sign of a cave-in."
But Mr. Bonior, who is the Democratic whip, or No. 3 in the leadership, said he had also told Mr. Clinton that his clarifying remarks today were reassuring.
 
Angry Calls to White House
 White House telephone lines had been hammered on Tuesday night by calls from angry supporters of universal coverage. Their arguments were reflected today in a statement issued by another high-ranking House Democrat, Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, chairman of the Appropriations Committee.
Mr. Obey said that he was not sure what the President's meant to say in Boston but that if Mr. Clinton was "backing away from universal health care reform that covers every citizen in this country, then I will walk away from the Clinton health plan." He added, "This is not the time for the Administration to create confusion about its commitment."
To counter those criticisms, the Administration made an unstinting effort to dismiss Mr. Clinton's remarks on Tuesday as inconsequential. Vice President Al Gore started shortly after 7 A.M. on network news shows. Three hours later, Hillary Rodham Clinton, holding a child with multiple birth defects at a televised new conference, proclaimed, "Health reform without universal coverage will not work."
Mr. Clinton said that all he had meant by citing percentages below 100 was: "We have Social Security, but about 2 percent somehow don't get covered. We have universal school attendance laws in every state in the country, but there are always a couple of percent who fall through the cracks. But you have to write it into law to get there."
 
Bentsen Emphasizes Stand
 Lloyd Bentsen, Secretary of the Treasury, told reporters at a luncheon gathering that Mr. Clinton "still feels very strongly about universal coverage." Mr. Bentsen, who once sponsored legislation that would only change insurance laws, said he now believed such a partial approach would not work. And while he said the Administration was not absolutely insistent on requiring employers to help pay for insurance as the route to universal coverage, that was "sure the easiest way to do it."
Echoing the 1992 Clinton Presidential campaign, when supporters were given a single theme to emphasize each day, the White House health care "war room" sent its allies "talking points" to be used in comments today, including these:
*"The President's bottom line is what it has always been: guaranteed health care coverage."
*"Obviously, we are not going to achieve universal coverage overnight. That's why we phase it in. There will be a road toward universal coverage, but the road must achieve universal coverage."
*"There is no change in strategy. The President remains absolutely committed to universal coverage."
The Administration also made a strenuous effort today to argue that there was not only a social value to universal health insurance, but a strong economic case to be made, too.
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, contended that relying only on changing insurance laws would "not improve the system." Instead she said, "You may make it worse."
She argued at the Bentsen lunch that without universal coverage, there would continue to be people without insurance who would get inadequate preventive care and then use expensive health facilities like emergency rooms for conditions that did not require them.
She also said that two changes for which there is widespread support -- requiring insurance companies to insure anyone who asks, regardless of pre-existing medical problems, and community ratings, which charge everyone the same premium regardless of age or health -- could backfire without universal coverage.
If people did not have to be insured but could get insurance whenever they wanted, she said, some people would not buy it until they were ill. That would drive up charges for everyone else. She also argued that young, healthy people would drop out of the system, leaving the pool of insured relatively less healthy and more expensive to cover, again raising rates.
 
Budget Control Emphasized
 Alice M. Rivlin, acting director of thy Office of Management and Budget, argued that universal coverage was the only way to get control of costs and hold the Federal deficit in line.
The officials did not identify any particular percent of the population that had to be covered for these economic gains to be achieved, but clearly implied that it had to be close to 100. Whether 95 percent or 98 percent of the population is covered makes a big human difference, especially when compared with the 84 percent now covered. At 98 percent, several million more people would have the security of health insurance than at 95 percent. But achieving that extra coverage would require larger Government subsidies or larger employer payments.
 
Doubts on Capitol Hill
 Despite the White House insistence that nothing had changed, doubts persisted on Capitol Hill about why Mr. Clinton had spoken as he did to the governors. Some lawmakers speculated that he had been tempted to retreat because he had gotten a gloomy account of Senate prospects for universal coverage from the majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, with whom he met on Monday night. Many in Congress are worried about the high cost of covering everyone, which may require large public subsidies or an unpopular mandate that all employers contribute.
Mr. Mitchell said he would not discuss his conversations with the President. White House officials said they did not know what Mr. Mitchell had told Mr. Clinton.
Others said they believed Mr. Clinton was only trying to sound accommodating without substantively changing his position but stumbled into difficult territory in the process of trying to impress the governors with his good intentions.
Another White House official supported this view, saying that by mentioning any percentage below 100, Mr. Clinton had trod dangerously onto his opponents' turf, the political territory that argues for partial measures.
"We've been very disciplined as an Administration about not saying it for two months now, because we're afraid of it," the official said. "And we were certainly right. You can't use their language, because you get trapped in it."
It also remained to be seen what effect Mr. Clinton's remarks would have on the process of assembling health insurance bills for the House and the Senate to vote on. The majority leaders, Mr. Mitchell in the Senate and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri in the House, are trying to firm up their ideas by the end of the week. Mr. Gephardt is also trying to overcome disputes over jurisdiction of the legislation among three committee chairmen.
 
Dole Is Encouraged
 The suggestion of retreat plainly encouraged Mr. Clinton's opponents, from Senator Bob Dole of Kansas to Senate moderates led by Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island.
But it also fired up his most liberal backers, who held news conferences and rallies all over the Capitol today and worked hard at encouraging Mr. Mitchell to go for a strong bill and take a chance on losing, rather than abandon universal coverage and required employer payments at the beginning.

Chart: "DIARY: Health Care Developments"
 
YESTERDAY
 In a coordinated effort, the White House insisted that President Clinton had not retreated from his goal of universal health insurance when he told the nation's governors on Tuesday that he might accept legislation that resulted in coverage for 95 percent or 98 percent of Americans.
 
THE ADMINISTRATION
 The White House made an unstinting effort to dismiss Mr. Clinton's remarks to the governors as inconsequential. Vice President Al Gore made the case on morning television news programs and Hillary Rodham Clinton, holding a child with multiple birth defects at a televised new conference, proclaimed, "Health reform without universal coverage will not work." Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen released a study offering a breakdown by state and Congressional district on the 37 million Americans without health insurance. "They're middle-income Americans that are your neighbors," Mr. Bentsen said at a White House briefing. "Eighty-four percent are in working families."
 
CONGRESS
 The President told reporters before a meeting with Congressional leaders that he was flexible on how to reach his goal of coverage for all Americans but that he would not abandon it. Two House Democrats, David E. Bonior of Michigan and Butler Derrick of South Carolina, told him that his remarks had not helped his supporters' efforts to draft health care legislation and had rattled many Democrats in the House. Some members of Congress saw the President's comments as tantamount to a surrender. "Many people rejoiced yesterday," said Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas. Others saw a door open to compromise. "I think the President is just waking up to the fact that if he wants a health care bill, it has to be reasonable," said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a conservative Utah Republican who surprised some observers by sitting down for closed-door meetings today with health care moderates in his party.
 
LOBBYISTS
 The American Association of Retired Persons, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the American Medical Association issued an unusual joint appeal to Congress to overcome its differences and enact a comprehensive health bill this year. They said any bill must achieve universal coverage, give Americans free choice of doctors and health plans, and slow the rate of increase in public and private spending.

HEADLINE: Rabin Sees Walls of Suspicion Crumbling

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 20

 BODY:
Even without trumpets and shouts, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin says, walls will come tumbling down when he and King Hussein of Jordan appear publicly for the first time at the White House next week.
The barriers are in the national minds, the Israeli leader explained, built brick by brick through "an accumulation of hatred, suspicion, animosity, bloodshed, antagonistic perception of one another." 
 "I try to focus on one issue: how to bring down the psychological walls," he said today, his voice characteristically rumbling along like a freight train, slow but insistent. It can be done, he added.
When President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt journeyed dramatically to Jerusalem in 1977, he said, Israelis quickly concluded that he was serious about peace. Within a few years the Egyptians got back Sinai, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
 
Handshake With Arafat
 When Mr. Rabin and Yasir Arafat shook hands on the White House lawn last September -- an act many Israelis found distasteful -- it raised hopes that maybe Israelis and Palestinians could live together, after all.
Now the spotlight is on Israel's newly invigorated peace talks with Jordan, focused on the coming White House encounter between the Prime Minister and the King.
Speaking before a parliamentary committee on Tuesday, Mr. Rabin cautioned that it does not mean that all of a sudden the two countries will clear up their land and water disputes and end five decades of a technical state of war.
No, he said today, warming to a lecturer's role from a soft chair in his office, the point of the meeting is not what it produces. The point is simply that it takes place.
"By itself, it will signal in a meaningful way the kind of atmosphere that no doubt will facilitate solving the practical issues," he said.
 
Not a Matter of Numbers
 "The questions cannot only be solved by computers. It's not just practical issues. The issue is much more about emotion, sometimes irrational. Changing attitudes one toward another is much more important than one kilometer of area this way or that way."
It is tempting to contrast this White House gathering with the celebrated one in which Mr. Rabin shook Mr. Arafat's hand. Yitzhak Rabin was having none of it. "I don't try to compare," he said.
Still, it seems clear that for him and his country the meeting with King Hussein carries much less emotional baggage. After all, the Prime Minister acknowledged today, Mr. Arafat "symbolized barbaric terror against innocent people."
Just before that White House session, he was emotionally jumbled, confessing to an interviewer that his very viscera were in rebellion. There is no such turmoil in regard to King Hussein, a man the Prime Minister is known to have already met several times secretly and whom Israelis regard as a relatively benign figure.
 
'A Great Leader'
 "I will not talk about any meeting that took place or didn't," Mr. Rabin said when asked about the King. But he added, "He's a great leader of his country and his people, and I see him as a partner for the effort to achieve peace between Jordan and Israel."
As for Mr. Arafat, the Prime Minister declined to discuss his feelings about him now that they have met several times. But the new self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho cannot succeed, he warned, unless the Palestinian leader reassures would-be foreign donors who are skittish about where their money is going.
Can Mr. Arafat learn?
"If he will not learn it will bring an economic disaster, and we see the beginning of it in the Gaza Strip," Mr. Rabin said. Israel will not agree to expand the Palestinians' self-rule, he added, until they show they know how to "run a business in a way that it has to be run."
Whatever happens next week in Washington, the 72-year-old Prime Minister says he intends to take Israel further along on perhaps its most challenging voyage since its founding in 1948. For the first time in those 46 years, the outlines of peace with the Arabs are distinct and ready to be fleshed out.
 
Accusations From the Right
 His opponents on the political right accuse him of leading the country, lemming-like, to disaster; the Arabs, they say, will renew their war on Israel once it is lulled by false peace. His detractors on the left accuse him of failing to move more swiftly to disentangle Israel from territories that it captured in 1967.
Mid-term in office, Mr. Rabin also faces disarray on domestic fronts.
His Government has lacked an assured parliamentary majority for many months. His Labor Party recently lost control of two important power bases, the Histadrut union federation and Jerusalem City Hall.
One by one, senior advisers have walked out on Mr. Rabin, and he has yet to find replacements.
Routinely, he is criticized for trying to do too much himself, especially by serving as both Prime Minister and Defense Minister. His tendency to secretiveness and to make important decisions on his own makes some Israelis wonder if the two ministers talk to one another.
Yet even people who are not admirers of Mr. Rabin have marveled at his flexibility in changing Israel's course with the Arabs.
 
'Believes in Tomorrow'
 "For the first time in many years, Israel has a Prime Minister who believes in tomorrow instead of yesterday," wrote Zeev Chafets, a columnist for The Jerusalem Report.
Daniel Ben-Simon, a writer for the newspaper Davar, said: "His value system has changed. The No. 1 soldier here, Mr. Security, has turned into something else, talking about what occupation does to society."
Two months ago, Mr. Rabin startled some Israelis by declaring that "ruling over another people has corrupted us." That from a man who, as Defense Minister in the late 1980's, had advocated beatings as a way to end the anti-Israel uprising in Gaza and the West Bank.
The 27-year military occupation, he added, has "perverted" Israel's economy and its soul, leading it, for example, to depend on cheap Palestinian labor instead of rolling up its own sleeves. The only alternatives, he said, are to annex the territories, an idea he rejects, or to deport the Arabs, a rightist demand that he calls "a racist proposal."
There is one other alternative, Mr. Rabin said: End the occupation.
"The Palestinians are different than us, religiously, politically, you might say nationally," he said. "Jews are not accustomed to become occupiers of another people."
To Israelis who argue that holding onto the land is a supreme Zionist value, Mr. Rabin noted that "we did not keep Mount Sinai." It went back to Egypt a dozen years ago.

HEADLINE: Blacks Press the Case for Reparations for Slavery

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
The phrase "40 acres and a mule," recalling a post-Civil War proposal to compensate former slaves for their servitude, has become the rallying cry among a small but outspoken group of African-Americans.
Some invoke the phrase as they seek financial redress from the Government on behalf of their ancestors. Others, who admit that seeking payment is impractical and the chances of receiving anything improbable, still maintain that gaining attention for the plight of their forebears is well worth their energies. 
 Beginning tomorrow, about 1,000 people who favor reparations are expected to attend the fifth annual Conference on Reparations at Cobo Hall in Detroit. The three-day conference is part of a grass-roots movement that includes petition drives and support from some prominent black politicians, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan.
 
Framing the Debate
 For years, blacks have joked bitterly about exacting reparations. "This is my 40 acres," some looters were heard to say during the urban riots of the 1960's. "I'll be back for the mule." But until recently, any organized movement had been largely ignored or dismissed by most blacks as a foolhardy and unwinnable effort by people whose time could be better spent addressing issues like crime, unemployment and teen-age pregnancy.
Robert Woodson, the president of the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise in Washington, disagrees with the idea of seeking reparations, saying that blacks' efforts should be directed toward dealing with the problems of the present. "The issue isn't whether reparations are justified," Mr. Woodson said. "The question is, Is this an effective way to address problems facing black Americans?"
The success in recent years of other groups, including Japanese-Americans and American Indians, in winning reparations for internment and illegal seizure of land, has fueled the determination of some blacks to ask the Government to make good on what they view as a 133-year-old unfulfilled promise by members of Congress and the Lincoln Administration. But even the most impassioned proponents of reparations do not expect Government action anytime soon.
"Our primary function is raising consciousness and activism," said Efia Nwangaza, a lawyer in Greenville, S.C., who became involved in seeking reparations six years ago. "Not only are we finding more awareness of the concept, but a sense that we indeed are entitled to reparation."
But many people, including historians and politicians, say the issue of reparations for the descendants of slaves raises these questions:
*Who is to pay reparations -- the Government or the descendants of slave owners?
*What form would reparations take? Money? Land?
*Who would be entitled to compensation: all people of black ancestry currently living in the United States or only those who can directly trace their ancestry to slaves? Would they include people of mixed ancestry?
"The Government might make the argument that Japanese-Americans who received reparations were those who were directly injured or harmed as opposed to those who are descendants of" them, said Stanley Mark, a lawyer who is the program director for the Asian-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, which was involved in the class-action that won reparations for Japanese-Americans.
Others say that any effort to identify direct descendants of slaves would be a complicated and probably futile exercise, one compounded by a lack of historical records and vague definitions of who is -- and is not -- black.
 
The Historical Proposals
 The issue of whether to grant land or provisions to former slaves or their descendants was debated during the Lincoln Administration. In 1861, two white abolitionists, Representative Thaddeus Stevens, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Senator Charles Sumner, Republican of Massachusetts, introduced the first of several such bills.
One proposal would have allowed land confiscated from slave owners to be turned over in 40-acre plots to former slaves. After the Civil War, nearly a half-million acres divided into 40-acre parcels -- from Charleston, S.C., to the St. Johns River near Jacksonville, Fla. -- were turned over to former slaves under a field order by Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman. Sherman guaranteed "40 acres of land, plus provisions including mules, horses and foodstuffs" to the former slaves who had fought under him. But in 1869, President Andrew Johnson rescinded the order.
Advocates of reparations cite recent examples of payments to various ethnic groups as precedents for their case. In 1980, the Supreme Court ordered the Federal Government to pay $105 million to eight tribes of Sioux Indians for land seized by Congress in 1877. And in 1988, Congress pledged restitution of $20,000 to each of the 60,000 surviving Japanese-Americans who had been interned in the United States during World War II. That came to a total of $1.2 billion.
Support for the concept has come from sources as diverse as Representative Conyers and rap groups like Public Enemy and KRS-One. Spike Lee, the film director, named his company 40 Acres and a Mule and has said that the name is intended to prick the nation's conscience.
In 1991, Mr. Conyers sponsored a bill to establish a commission to study reparations, but the bill, which has 20 co-sponsors, has never moved out of the House Judiciary Committee. He said that some opponents of reparations argue that blacks have already been compensated through affirmative-action programs, antipoverty programs and race-based scholarships.
 
Forms of Compensation
 Mr. Jackson has sought reparations not just for American blacks but also for African nations for what he has called the illegal importation of Africans to America. "The voices that cry out for reparations have been seen as marginal or radical," he said. "What is America willing to do to repair the damage done?"
But even the advocates of reparations differ on what form the compensation should take.
"Some think $20,000 to every living black American is enough; others want land," said Chokwe Lumumba, a lawyer who heads the New Afrikan People's Organization, a black nationalist group based in Jackson, Miss. "Blacks have a retarded economic infrastructure. We're saying we need reparations to develop that: land, machinery, technology. All of that has to come with billions of dollars."
Kalonji Tor Olusegun of Washington, a leader of the reparations movement, said blacks would never get "the amount due us" and thus must consider other forms of reparations.
"For many blacks, relief from Federal taxes would be sufficient reparation," said Mr. Tor Olusegun, who is a chairman of the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, or N'Cobra, an umbrella organization of more than 20 social, civic and political groups that represents about 5,000 people.
Other proposals include establishing a national museum devoted to the history of slavery and offering unlimited college scholarships to blacks. Many proponents say that whether or not reparations come, they take some satisfaction in the heightened awareness of the issue.
 
'We Mean Business'
 Last October, Robert Brock, head of the Self-Determination Committee, a Los Angeles group that assists black businesses and community groups, filed suit against the Internal Revenue Service seeking tax exemptions on behalf of 49 million descendants of slaves on the grounds of involuntary servitude.
"We mean business," said Ray C. Jenkins, the coordinator of the Conference on Reparations and a Detroit real estate broker who has worked for 27 years on the reparations effort.
"There is no statute of limitations on injustice," Mr. Jenkins said. "We've been waiting patiently. Our patience has run out."

HEADLINE: Why American Steel Is Big Again

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GARY, Ind.

 BODY:
The blast furnaces, rolling mills and slab carriers at U.S. Steel's six-mile-long lakefront plant here are running flat out these days, producing coil after coil of sheet steel for the automotive, appliance and container industries.
The plant, despite having the latest technology, is struggling to keep up with demand -- which is precisely the way U.S. Steel and the nation's other big steelmakers have planned things. After a decade of collapsing markets and bankruptcies by the dozens, mill closings and layoffs by the hundreds of thousands, prosperity has returned to the American steel industry.
 
Not Everything Matters
 But this time, having learned the hard way how easily booms can go bust, the industry is prepared to let some business slip away rather than gear up to meet a peak demand that may be fleeting. 
 Although the social costs have been staggering in the last two decades in terms of lost jobs and economically ravaged mill towns, Big Steel's makeover is now reaping big payoffs. The industry is expected to earn $1 billion this year, compared with losses of about $350 million in 1993.
Inland Steel Industries and AK Steel have just reported strong second-quarter profit, compared with losses a year earlier. And the USX Corporation's U.S. Steel Group is expected to soon report earnings in the range of 47 cents a share, compared with a huge loss in the 1993 quarter.
Moreover, the big steel companies, after years of winning only grudging price increases, now find themselves in a position to demand more.
 
Demand Increases
 Thanks in part to the weak dollar, which makes importing foreign steel more expensive than it used to be, domestic mills are being flooded with orders from revived manufacturers in the American industrial heartland.
Analysts estimate that the nation's integrated steel mills -- those that convert raw material like iron ore, coal and limestone into finished steel -- operated at 96 percent of capacity last year. Forecasts are that demand will stay high, and that the industry will operate at 97 percent of capacity this year and 98 percent in 1995.
"The steel industry is in pretty good shape for at least the next 5 to 10 years," said Harry W. Paxton, a former steel executive and now a professor at Carnegie Mellon University. "They cut back on manpower, put in new equipment and did a whole bunch of things to improve on quality."
Steel has even started to reclaim some of the market share lost to plastics and other materials in automobiles and appliances. And a shortage of suitable timber may provide a long-sought opportunity for steel to replace wood in some residential construction. "Steel demand has gone from 90 million tons in 1991 to 106 million this year," said Peter F. Marcus, an analyst with Paine Webber.
And yet, any assessment for steel must be tempered with caution. Some analysts note that the industry's financial position was weakened by the losses and debt taken on during during the 1980's and that it has huge pension and benefits liabilities that are yet to be financed. And they say that the world's steel companies have the capability of making more steel than is consumed, so that any forecasts are subject to trade issues.
 
Accusations of Dumping
 The "voluntary restraint agreements" that limited imports in the 1980's expired in 1992, but the industry has continued to try to limit imports by filing complaints that many products are being dumped -- sold at less than the cost of production.
Students of the industry say that the American companies are now as good or better than European and Japanese steelmakers in quality and cost. Some steel will continue to be imported, industry officials say, largely because the domestic industry has cut back to the point that it cannot meet all the demands of a vigorous economy.
"The American steel industry is, on average, the most productive in the world in terms of man-hours per finished ton of steel," said Christopher Plummer, a steel analyst with Resource Strategies, a consulting company in Exton, Pa.
For every ton of steel produced, American steelmakers spend 5.3 man-hours, compared with 5.6 for the Japanese and Canadian industries, and 5.7 for the British, French and Germans, Mr. Plummer said.
But all this progress for the industry has come at a vast cost to many individuals. According to the American Iron and Steel Institute, the principal trade group, domestic steel employment peaked at 650,000 workers in 1953. Four decades later, the total is close to 175,000. Some companies, including U.S. Steel, have five retired workers for every active employee.
At the Gary Works, during the plant's peak employment in 1953, as many as 30,000 workers toiled there, earning some of the highest wages and best benefits in blue-collar America. The wages and benefits were still good at $29.57 an hour in 1992, but far fewer people were receiving them.
 
But Where Are the People?
 The cavernous buildings here seem almost devoid of human beings. Employment at the 4,000-acre complex still totals close to 8,000, but few workers are to be found on the plant floors where solid steel is processed. Today's steelworkers typically run plants from computerized, air-conditioned control rooms high above the production floor.
Only in the blast furnace, which looks like a first approximation of hell as streams of liquid iron spew sparks and flame, do a few hundred workers in protective clothing work close to the dangerous metal that flows from the furnace at nearly 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
The industry's geography has also changed. In the traditional steelmaking regions, primarily the Monongahela River valley near Pittsburgh and along the Mahoning River near Youngstown, Ohio, mills were built to be close to the sources of iron ore and metallurgical coal. But such locations often limited their space, making plant layouts difficult and adding to transportation costs. As part of the industry's overhaul, many of those mills have been closed and torn down.
Between 1977 and 1987, 45 million tons of steel-production capacity -- the equivalent of five Gary works -- went out of service as a result of bankruptcies in the industry or scale-backs leading to partial or complete plant shutdowns.
Today, the American steel industry's center of gravity is in northern Indiana. In addition to U.S. Steel's Gary Works, which has operated at this site since 1909, there are big, integrated mills along the southern shore of Lake Michigan operated by Inland Steel Industries, LTV and Bethlehem Steel. A flat lakefront location allows the mills to be laid out more efficiently and lets producers bring in bulk material cheaply, by freighter across the Great Lakes.
Companies that once boasted of making every steel product from "nails to rails" have conceded low-value items like concrete reinforcement bars to foreign steelmakers and the mini-mills operated by smaller American companies like the Nucor Corporation and the Chaparral Steel Corporation, which produce steel from scrap, rather than ore.
One of the key technological changes for American steelmakers has been the installation of continuous casters, machines that turn molten metal into solid slabs that can be handled and processed while still red hot. The previous method, in use since the earliest days of steelmaking, was to pour molten metal into individual molds, wait for it to cool, strip off the mold and reheat the steel so it could be processed.
Continuous casting greatly reduces manpower and energy requirements. Today, 86 percent of American steel is continuously cast, compared with about 20 percent in 1980.
 
Pendulum of Labor Relations
 A decade of adversity has changed some workplace attitudes, as well. The steel industry bitterly resisted unions until changes in the laws began to give workers the upper hand in the 1930's. But even with the recognition of unions, labor relations in the industry were highly adversarial.
In recent years, though, the United Steelworkers union has negotiated contracts with the major steelmakers that have given the companies more flexibility in assigning workers. In return the union has gotten, among other things, the right to name a member of the board of directors.
Together, continuous casting and greater labor flexibility have produced sizable reductions in costs. The Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington-based research organization, said in a recent report that the labor portion of steel costs declined from $262 a ton in 1982 to $161 a ton in 1992.
Over all, the cost of producing a ton of steel in the United States declined from more than $650 a ton in 1982 to about $525 a ton in 1992. "Consequently, U.S. companies went from being among the world's highest-cost producers, to among the world's lowest-cost producers," the study concluded.
Until last year, steel prices had been steady or declining, which has helped other industries that are large steel users. Analysts say one of the factors in the comeback of the American automobile industry is that it has been building 1990's cars out of steel at 1980's prices. But with demand now nearly surpassing supply, American steelmakers are in a position to raise prices. Last year, they rose about 15 percent in spot markets and have gone up 5 to 8 percent more so far this year.
The steel industry says it has other problems, notably "legacy costs" -- obligations to pay pensions and health benefits to the tens of thousands of involuntary retirees and their spouses. Of the 50 most underfinanced pension plans, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation says, five are in steel: National, LTV, Inland, Bethlehem and AK Steel.
LTV, which operated under bankruptcy protection for seven years, largely because of its pension liabilities, still has $3.68 billion in pension obligations -- and more than 40 percent of it remains unfinanced.
"Pensions and health are the biggest millstones" the older companies have to bear, said Mr. Plummer, who estimated that they added $4 to $8 a ton in costs. "That's a lot in a when you are competing in a market with mini-mills, which do not have them at all."

HEADLINE: KING HUSSEIN HINTS JORDAN CONSIDERS A SEPARATE PEACE

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, July 20

 BODY:
Signaling his independence from Syria and his desire for peace, King Hussein of Jordan suggested today that he was prepared to move without President Hafez al-Assad of Syria and sign a separate peace treaty with Israel.
The King's remarks were couched in his characteristically elliptical style, and he added that it could take some time before an agreement could be reached. 
 But the King's remarks to reporters at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Amman, were echoed later by Prime Minister Abdel Salam Majali of Jordan. There were other signs of progress in negotiations and gestures of friendship between Israel and Jordan after the announcement last Friday that King Hussein would meet with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel in Washington on July 25.
Shortly after King Hussein spoke, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres became the first Israeli Cabinet minister to publicly set foot on Jordanian soil.
He arrived by helicopter at a spa on a remote area of the Dead Sea for talks with Mr. Majali and Mr. Christopher that outlined specific economic projects to link the two countries and affirmed the goal of ending a formal state of war that has existed since 1948.
The site was not far from where Golda Meir, as Israeli Foreign Minister, secretly met King Abdullah, the present monarch's grandfather, in the late 1940's. Over the years, King Hussein has met a number of times with Israeli officials, but always in secret.
It was 43 years ago on this day, Mr. Peres noted, that King Abdullah was assassinated outside the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem in front of his grandson.
"Today, Israel and Jordan are stepping out from the old and into the new," Mr. Christopher said in prepared remarks after the three-way meeting near the town of Shuna. "An era of war is coming to a close. This ancient land's cries for peace are finally being heard."
King Hussein was asked when he would sign a peace accord with Israel and whether it could come at the White House next Monday when he meets with Mr. Rabin. "I believe the answer is as soon as possible, but certainly not next week," King Hussein replied. "We've still got a long way to go."
Pressed by one reporter on whether peace could come in a month, he added: "I don't know. Maybe a month might be too soon."
But King Hussein stated that he was willing to go his own way, despite his repeated pledges to Mr. Assad, the man he still calls his "brother," that a comprehensive peace of all the parties is necessary.
"The Syrian track is active as we are," King Hussein said when asked whether he would sign a peace treaty ahead of Syria. But, he added, "We have taken a sovereign decision regarding our right to move to deal with every aspect and every problem that is included in the agenda which we ratified in Washington some while ago and we are beginning."
King Hussein referred to the signing of a framework agreement in Washington by Jordan and Israel last September that provides the basis for resolving differences between them.
Although on paper the Israeli-Jordanian agreement merely set out a formal agenda for negotiations, it represented a major step toward peace and has provided a basis for progress in specific areas.
"It is our fervent hope that at the end of this process, there will be a comprehensive peace in the region," the King said.
The new independent tone was echoed later by Prime Minister Majali, who told reporters at the Dead Sea that it was not important whether Syria or Jordan signed first. "Who is to be signing peace first or second?" he asked. "This is immaterial."
In a joint communique, the United States, Israel and Jordan spelled out some of the areas of cooperation. The three sides pledged to hold regular meetings on the ministerial level and work on a master plan for the development of the Jordanian Rift Valley that is expected to be announced at the White House on Monday.
 
Framework for Trade
 They also said they would formulate a framework for trade and commercial relations between Israel and Jordan, marking a new willingness by Jordan to discuss those subjects without first settling water and territorial disputes. Finally, they agreed on a plan to develop tourism and on the creation of a joint team to explore aviation routes and conduct a preliminary survey of a major road linking Jordan, Israel and Egypt.
Essentially, Jordan and Israel are making peace in practical ways -- what one senior Admninsitration official called "pieces of the peace" -- in preparation for the day when they sign an overall agreement.
In his prepared remarks, Mr. Peres captured the historic sense of the meeting: "It took us 15 minutes to fly over. It took us 46 years to arrive to this time and this place."
Jordanian waiters watched news of today's meeting on Israeli television; Israeli journalists were able to use their cellular phones to make calls to Jerusalem. The Jordanian side handed out glossy brochures titled, "Investing in Jordan, Your Profit Center in the Middle East."
There were small hints here and there that, for all the enthusiasm, peace may not be waiting just around the corner. In a news conference with Mr. Peres and Mr. Christopher, Mr. Majali repeated that Jordan would not be rushed into peace.
"In Arabic, we say, 'He who hastens things before its time, God will prevent him from having it.' Not to try to push things before it is time. When it is time, it is right, it is delicious, it is good. If it is before its time, if you eat the apple before its time, you will get tummy cramps."

HEADLINE: Bosnian Serbs Said to Reject Mediators' Partition Plan

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GENEVA, July 20

 BODY:
In a new blow to efforts to end the Bosnian conflict, Bosnian Serb authorities were reported today to have rejected a territorial division that was the central pillar of a new Bosnia peace plan proposed by international mediators two weeks ago.
Under the plan, which was presented to the warring parties on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, Bosnian Muslims and Croats would be given 51 percent of the new republic, while Bosnian Serbs, who now hold 70 percent of territory, would see their share reduced to 49 percent. 
 Although Bosnian Serbs indicated on Tuesday that they might be ready to work with the plan, Charles Redman, the United States special envoy to the Balkans, said that the Bosnian Serbs told a five-nation group of international mediators that they could not accept the territorial proposal.
 
A Negative Reply
 The Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, who presented his delegation's response today, refused to meet reporters here. But senior European officials who attended today's meetings confirmed that there was no ambivalence about the Bosnian Serbs' negative position, and that the mediators were united in perceiving the Serbs' response as a rejection.
Earlier today, a joint Bosnian Government and Bosnian Croat delegation confirmed their acceptance of the plan in a separate meeting with the international mediators. The Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Croats agreed earlier this year to form a federation.
The Bosnian Serbs' rejection of the proposed map opens them up to a series of reprisals by the international community, including tightening of sanctions against their Serbian backers in Belgrade and a possible lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia, which has impeded Bosnian Government efforts to overcome the Bosnian Serbs' advantage in weapons.
 
Decision on Sanctions
 The decision on what new punitive measures will be adopted against the Bosnian Serbs will be taken by Foreign Ministers of the United States, Russia, France, Britain and Germany at a meeting provisionally scheduled for Geneva on July 30. These same Ministers proposed the peace plan here July 5.
The Bosnian Serbs' response, which was the result of two days of intense and secretive meetings of the Bosnian Serbs' self-styled parliament in Pale, was conveyed today to a so-called "contact group" of senior officials from the same five mediating countries at two closed-door meeting here today.
"At the first meeting, the Bosnian Serb delegation said it had not accepted our territorial proposal," Mr. Redman said. "At the second meeting, our group expressed its disappointment at the lack of a positive reply."
 
Other Issues Raised
 He said the Bosnian Serb delegation had raised other issues, but was reminded that all other discussions depended on acceptance of the territorial proposal. He added that the "contact group" would present a detailed "incentives and disincentives package" next week.
One European envoy said that, while in the past there have been differences within the "contact group" there was "no divergence" among the mediating countries today in their reaction to the Bosnian Serbs' response. "You can talk of unity of the group," he said. "For all of us, the territorial division is the key question."
Bosnia's Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic, and the Bosnian Croat leader, Kresimir Zubak, left Geneva soon after presenting their response this morning. Bosnia's Vice President, Ejup Ganic, stayed on to be briefed on the Bosnian Serb response by the American, Russian, French and British envoys. Mr. Karadzic and his delegation are expected to leave here Thursday and no further meetings with the "contact group" are scheduled.
Western diplomats said that the Bosnian Serbs seemed anxious to reopen discussions about the map even though they had been asked for a yes or no answer. But despite reports from their headquarters in Pale, Bosnia, on Tuesday that the Bosnian Serbs might want to give an equivocal reply, the mediators read it as a rejection.
 
A 'Yes' Is Not Heard
 "This wasn't a 'yes, but' or a 'yes, and'," one Western diplomat said. "There was not a 'yes' involved here. The territorial proposal was not acceptable."
The diplomats said the Bosnian Serb reply presented to the "contact group" in a sealed pink envelope raised such questions as constitutional arrangements within the proposed Bosnian union, the status of the capital city of Sarajevo and Bosnian Serb demands for an access to the Adriatic Sea.
But one well-placed Western diplomat recalled that the international mediators had decided that the territorial division was the "core problem" and should be dealt with first. He added that by trying to deal with other issues first, "the Serbs are talking about a different kind of process -- not what we have been working on for the last three months."
United States and European diplomats refused to speculate about measures that might be adopted when Secretary of State Warren Christopher joins his Russian, French, British and German colleagues here later this month, but they noted that a lifting of the arms embargo is still considered "a last resort."
One Western diplomat noted that the mediators' objective was still to make the Bosnian Serbs accept the peace plan and that there was still some hope that Russia could persuade them to do so.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Microsoft case shows that trustbusters won't be referees.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
MICROSOFT v. the United States and the European Union: What had all the makings of the global antitrust case of the decade ended with a whimper. Microsoft had been rumored to be facing strict monitoring of its relations with competitors and clients, or even a breakup of its operations into two companies. In the end, however, the Justice Department and its European counterpart demanded only modest changes in the way the giant software maker markets its products.
Not surprisingly, the consent decree was greeted with dismay by rivals most vulnerable to Microsoft's juggernaut, notably those that produce software applications like word processing, along with those that produce utilities -- anti-virus programs, for example -- that are often sold as a package with Microsoft's basic operating system. What may surprise is the lack of a passionate response from antitrust economists and lawyers. 
 Many of them simply agree with Assistant Attorney General Anne Bingaman that the deal was about as tough as the antitrust statutes would support. To win, she reminds, "you have to have the law and the facts" on your side.
But times have changed, and so have trustbusters: Many now fear that the Government will do more harm than good when it tries to play market referee, especially in high-technology industries: "You want to make it as easy as possible to compete with Microsoft," said Frank Fisher, an economist and antitrust expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, "but you don't want to confuse Microsoft's success with monopoly."
The deal struck between Microsoft and the Justice Department bars a Microsoft pricing plan that looked fishy on its face.
The department objected to "per processor" contracts in which, to earn volume discounts, computer makers were required to fork over a royalty to the software maker on every machine shipped, regardless of whether Microsoft's "operating system" -- the coded instructions that link the machinery to the user -- was shipped with it. The arrangement effectively forced computer makers to pay a double royalty if they chose to sell an operating system not made by Microsoft.
Michael Sohn, a lawyer at Arnold & Porter who represents the Novell Corporation, one of Microsoft's few competitors in the sale of operating systems, professes satisfaction with the decree. "It levels the playing field," he said, giving Novell and others a fair shot at the market for software that comes out of the box with a new computer.
But that does not mean competitors will come up with products that persuade millions of reasonably satisfied customers to go to the trouble of switching from Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system and the Windows graphics software that converts MS-DOS mumbo-jumbo into user-friendly pictures. Nor will it prevent Microsoft from integrating ever more applications into its operating systems, undermining software producers in niche markets ranging from appointment calendars to cutesy "screensavers." Nor should it have the slightest impact on Microsoft's rapacious appetite for a greater share of the market for word processing, spreadsheet and data organization programs, the meat and potatoes of the software industry.
Competitors care, but should the public? It is possible that Microsoft will parallel I.B.M.'s path in computer hardware, dominating the software market by being good enough, if not always best. In this scenario, Microsoft would one day lose its edge and be overwhelmed by hungrier rivals. Indeed, Microsoft's saga may prove to be another chapter in the chaotic but benign process the economist Joseph Schumpeter called "creative destruction."
It is also possible, though, that the Microsoft juggernaut will be sustained by inertia long after it has ceased to be a leader in technology. It may end up looking less like I.B.M. in 1990 than like General Motors in 1980 -- a failed organization still able to command vast quantities of capital and labor that could be used more productively elsewhere.
What, then, is to be done? Antitrust lawyers have no trouble answering "very little." The antitrust laws are written to punish conduct, not to generate desired outcomes in markets, Ms. Bingaman said. "We don't live in a planned economy," she added.
One might expect economists, who lack the reality check of the law, to be more tempted to intervene. Certainly many would have been tempted in the 1970's, before Washington tossed away billions of dollars on synthetic fuels to compete with Arab oil. And a good number would still have taken the chance before the political debate over who lost high-definition television ended in a rush to take the credit for waiting until the next broadcast technology came along.
But economists are humbler today. The $64 question is no longer "Do markets work well?" but rather "Will markets work better after the Government tries to fix them?" And few are optimistic that Washington is up to the task, especially when it includes predicting the path of innovation.
So what about Microsoft and the awful possibility that it will someday become General Motors? "We'll just have to deal with the problem, when and if it comes," said Alfred Kahn, an economist at Cornell who has regulated businesses ranging from electricity to telephones to airlines.

HEADLINE: Quest for Return of the Timber Wolf;
But Not Everyone Is Eager to See Predator in Adirondacks

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TUPPER LAKE, N.Y.,

 BODY:
Scott Thiele was bouncing down a rutted logging road in the Adirondacks recently, thinking about Jack Nicholson and the feral music of the backwoods, when the thought struck him: what a perfect spot for a howling party.
Amid the secluded bogs, hemlock forests and placid lakes where fishermen dreamily canoe, he envisioned tourists at dusk and a guide who mimics the mournful cry that has sent shivers down spines for centuries. 
 No full moon needed. Just real wolves to howl back.
So goes one of Mr. Thiele's many pitches for an idea he has been single-mindedly selling to the north country: to return the eastern timber wolf to the Adirondacks, the vast and sparsely populated state park that covers most of northern New York State.
 
Wolves for Yellowstone
 In his quest, Mr. Thiele, 33, has joined a loose-knit national movement to repopulate state and national parks in Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Montana and Wyoming with North America's once top predator. In the movement's latest and perhaps largest victory, the Department of Interior agreed recently to reintroduce 30 wolves into Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho over the next year.
Mr. Thiele argued that repopulating the Adirondacks with wolves, which probably disappeared from the region around 1890, would make the natural order healthier because wolves prune away aged and infirm animals, particularly deer and beaver. But wolves will also make the economic order healthier, he said.
"Nobody will come to the Adirondacks just because coyotes are out there," he said. "But the wolf gives a mystique to the wilderness. A lot of people just want to know the call of the wild is still out there."
Plenty of Adirondack residents disagree. Residents worry about wolves killing pets and livestock. Hunters argue wolves will decimate the deer population. A few biologists even question whether wolves ever lived in the region.
Property-rights groups see wolf restoration as a veiled attempt by environmentalists to increase state and Federal control over the region, since the wolf is protected under the Federal Endangered Species Act.
"This isn't a zoo here," said Larry Reandeau, a businessman in Tupper Lake who is active in the Adirondack Solidarity Alliance, a property-rights group. "We come under regulations that no one else has to face, all in the name of environmentalism. But it isn't environmentalism. It's socialism."
 
A Tough Sell
 Even Mr. Thiele's supporters say he faces an uphill battle. A proposal by the state to bring moose from Canada and New England foundered last year when Adirondack residents raised fears about car accidents with the 1,200-pound animals. Wolves, with all their negative baggage, could prove an even tougher sell.
Langdon Marsh, the State Commissioner of Environmental Conservation, said: "I recognize there is a lot of unwarranted fear and superstition about the wolf. But nevertheless, there is the reality of significant public concern."
Though he has a handful of helpers, Mr. Thiele is something of a one-man sales team for the wolf. A six-footer with a soft voice and long beard, he has sold time-share condominiums, computers and office equipment. But he said he became fed up with what he called "the lies of the corporate world" and decided to get involved in environmental causes.
He learned of the Yellowstone wolf-restoration project while traveling in Montana last summer and decided to bring the idea east. So he formed the Adirondack Wolf Project, raised $7,500 in foundation grants and hit the road.
Though he owns a home in Montrose, Pa., he has been living out of his rusty 1986 Hyundai as he crisscrosses the north country, living on oats and yogurt, bathing in mountain streams and sleeping in campgrounds and friends' backyards.
In the small towns where he gives lectures to advance his cause, Mr. Thiele has faced some tough crowds. His notes were stolen at one session, a videotape at another. He has received death threats on his special phone line, (800) 310-WILD. In Silver Bay, someone asked, "If we're going to bring back the wolf, why don't we bring back smallpox, too?"
But elsewhere, support has been substantial. "The wolf is such a wonderful family animal," said Janet Chapman at a session in Tupper Lake. "Man could learn a lot from them."
Peter O'Shea, a retired police officer who lives in the town of Fine, contended that only a vocal minority opposed wolves. "They have set a stage so people are loathe to speak up on any environmental issue," he said outside the meeting in Tupper Lake. "But 80 percent of the people love these woods and they want these animals."
The goal of Mr. Thiele's crusade is to prod state and Federal agencies to study where wolves could thrive in the Adirondacks. He believes that the region can sustain 20 to 30 packs, about 100 to 150 wolves; he envisions starting out with wolves captured in eastern Canada and released in the Adirondacks.
 
'Symbol of Wilderness'
 Though wolf-repopulation efforts are under way in several states, Minnesota is the only place outside of Alaska with a sizable wolf population. There, wolf advocates say, evidence is growing that wolves, hunters and farmers can coexist.
But biologists who are critical of Mr. Thiele's proposal say the Adirondacks are more densely populated than northern Minnesota, so wolves and people would cross paths more often here. They noted that in the recent lynx restoration in the Adirondacks, many of the 83 animals released in the wilds were struck by cars.
The biologists also contended that the wolf's place atop the predatory ladder has been filled by coyotes.
"The wolf is a symbol of wilderness, it is a critter that just by its presence stirs the imagination," said Dr. Rainer Brocke, professor of wildlife ecology at the State University College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse. "But as far as the ecosystem goes, it wouldn't do a whole lot. The coyote has largely taken its niche."
But Mr. Thiele said there was more to his effort then just filling a niche. "It's about nature's health," he said. "It's about the wholeness of the ecosystem."

HEADLINE: Bretton Woods: A Policy Revisited

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
A half century after the about-to-be victorious Allies of World War II put in place bold plans for a global financial system and two decades after that system was formally abandoned, a high-profile group of economists, bankers and diplomats is trying to put it back together again. But the privately sponsored Bretton Woods Commission, which meets today in Washington amid dramatic erosion in the value of the dollar, is sure to meet resistance from a host of sources.
To some, the effort led by Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, to invent a more effective form of economic super-government to coordinate currency exchange rates, is ideologically offensive. "It's against the trend of the times," said Ian Vasquez, the director of the Cato Institute's Project for Global Economic Liberty. 
 But probably the more telling opposition will come from pragmatic economists. They find the call for tighter harmonization of monetary and fiscal policies unrealistic. "Would President Reagan have decided not to cut taxes in order to defend the exchange rate of the dollar?" asked William Branson, an economist at the Woodrow Wilson School of Princeton University.
And they are skeptical that the gain in stabilizing exchange rates would be worth the pain.
"There's just not a compelling case that exchange instability exacts a heavy cost" on the industrial countries, which, typically for domestic political reasons, put domestic economic and social priorities first, said Jeffrey Sachs, an economist at Harvard University.
In July 1944, the original Bretton Woods conference, named for its New Hampshire site, pitted ally against ally. The American delegation, led by Harry Dexter White, wanted to fix exchange rates and abandon controls on trade after the war, because it believed in free trade and because it wanted to consolidate American influence. The British, led by John Maynard Keynes, were eager to slow Britain's loss of authority in the world economy by retaining considerable power to adjust rates and to limit trade.
The deal struck was widely interpreted as a compromise between the American and British views. Changes in exchange rates would be permitted, but only in exceptional, though undefined, circumstances and only under the supervision of a new organization, the International Monetary Fund. To back its authority, the I.M.F. would offer a carrot of loans to countries that needed time to adjust domestic policies to shore up the exchange value of their currencies.
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development -- the World Bank -- would mobilize capital to rebuild the shattered world economy. Most of that capital would be American. And the two countries agreed to disagree about free trade, postponing a resolution until the postwar recovery.
But as Ronald McKinnon, an economist at Stanford University, has noted, the supranational structure created at Bretton Woods served mostly to camouflage the reality of American dominance over postwar economic policy. Most of the money used to rebuild Europe and Japan came directly from Washington under the Marshall and Dodge plans -- not from the I.M.F. or the World Bank.
And as The Economist magazine has pointed out, Washington actively encouraged the creation of a regional payments union which wrestled with Western Europe's currency exchange problems into the late 1950's, without the help or interference of the I.M.F.
 
Shattering of a System
 What the United States created, it did not hesitate to destroy. The fixed exchange-rate system invented at Bretton Woods was shattered when its main supporter, the United States, put the goal of domestic economic growth ahead of the goal of global exchange stability.
Thus President Nixon's 1971 decision to devalue the dollar by cutting it loose from the price of gold rather than risk recession in an election season was merely the formal end to a rule-based currency system that had largely been honored in the breach. Today's informal arrangement, by which the major economic powers seek to stabilize currencies only when it suits their collective interests, represents less of a break with the past than is generally understood.
Why, then, is the Bretton Woods Commission trying to go back to the way we never were?
"There is good evidence that exchange rates fluctuate excessively," in the sense that the movements do not reflect underlying economic changes, Mr. Branson said.
And few economists disagree with the commission's assertion that exchange misalignment both wastes resources and adds a head of steam to the pressure for protectionism. In the mid-1980's, for example, the overvalued dollar accelerated the demise of heavy industry and led Washington to curtail imports of steel and autos; today the Japanese are accusing Washington of driving down the value of the dollar to aid American exporters.
 
A Two-Step Approach
 Hence the commission is seeking a two-stage revival of the spirit of Bretton Woods. In the first, governments would pledge to work toward coordination of fiscal and monetary policies through the I.M.F., reducing the pressures for currency realignments. In the second, they would agree to maintain formal exchange rates within bands -- say a few percent up or down against the yen, mark and dollar.
"The world isn't capable of maintaining a true fixed exchange-rate system," said John Williamson, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics. But he said exchange rates could not be left to currency traders, who treat it all like some giant Nintendo game. "Someone has to take the long view," Mr. Williamson argued.
One voice of dissent comes from the ideological right, which has no use for any plan adding to the power of the international bureaucracies created at Bretton Woods. Indeed, a number of organizations use the slogan "50 years is enough" as they campaign in Congress to withdraw American sustenance from both the I.M.F. and the World Bank.
"These institutions are simply trying to invent reasons to survive" in a world that has passed them by, said Mr. Vasquez of the Cato Institute.
Mr. Sachs shares this suspicion of bureaucracies that keep on running and running and running. And he has no particular affection for the I.M.F. "They give bad advice," he said. "I'd never give them more power."
 
Little Economic Effect
 His broader objection to a move toward globally managed exchange rates, however, is that it would not be practical. European countries, he argued, have a strong incentive to coordinate policies because their economies are exceptionally interdependent. But the current mini-crisis over the dollar, he suggested, illustrates that even sharp speculative shifts in major exchange rates rarely have much effect on jobs, prices or profits. In spite of -- and perhaps because of -- the weak dollar, the American economy is in the best shape in years.
In any event, Mr. Sachs said, policy coordination is often not the key to fixing what is broken. For example, if Japan, the biggest potential loser from a weak dollar, had felt strongly enough about its exporters' competitive position, it could have cut taxes or lowered interest rates. "It really was not necessary," he said, "to raise interest rates in America," which he believes would have done more harm than good to the United States economy.
Robert Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International and a participant at the Bretton Woods forum today and tomorrow, offered what is likely to prove the dominant sentiment at the meeting. "It's useful to have the proposal on the table," he said, because the "essentials -- greater policy coordination -- make sense."
But a return to the Bretton Woods system, Mr. Hormats suggested, "just wouldn't be credible without a major change in attitude" -- on the part of currency traders and governments. "We've moved well beyond a world in which a single set of currency rules is practical," he concluded.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar's Gain Turns to Loss After Greenspan Testimony

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell slightly against leading currencies yesterday, following the bond and stock markets, which weakened after the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, rekindled inflation fears in testimony before Congress.
Though Mr. Greenspan indicated concern about the dollar's weakness and its effect on the economy, the dollar still fell against the Japanese yen and the German mark. Such talk usually drives the dollar higher by putting traders on notice that the central bank may intervene in its defense. 
 Traders said yesterday that sliding securities prices and profit taking from the dollar's recent rally undermined the positive effects of Mr. Greenspan's testimony.
 
Another Rate Increase?
 The dollar started higher in Europe but began to fall with stock and bond prices after the release of Mr. Greenspan's prepared testimony. He told the Senate Banking Committee that this year's four interest rate increases might not be enough to rein in inflation.
"Greenspan may have reopened a can of worms," said Lisa Finstrom, currency analyst at Smith Barney Inc. "It rekindled inflationary expectations. The market had become somewhat more calm and had faith coming into this. The dollar's value reflects overall financial health of the United States and inflation is no good. The expression of concern fed dollar negativity."
The dollar was quoted in late New York trading at 98.80 yen, down from 99.30 late Tuesday. The dollar dropped to 1.5650 marks from 1.5682 marks on Tuesday.
 
An Impact on Policy
 In his testimony, Mr. Greenspan said the currency's slide was bad for the United States economy and was beginning to have an impact on the Fed's monetary policy because of the inflationary consequences.
A protracted slide could ultimately fuel inflation by pushing up the price of imports, and has already set off investor flight from dollar-denominated assets.
Some market participants shrugged off the comments, which they said shed no new light on the Government's currency policy, and attributed yesterday's dip mainly to profit taking.
"The selloff started before Greenspan opened his mouth. I think it was largely technical," said Hubert Pedroli, manager of currency trading for Credit Suisse in New York.

HEADLINE: Building Small . . . Thinking Big

BYLINE: By MITCHELL OWENS 

 BODY:
A COTTAGE as pretty as a picture postcard, nestled behind the sort of tidy wooden fence that Tom Sawyer so famously whitewashed. Cozy and eminently affordable, it was the American dream for much of this century, until the decade of the leveraged buyout caused the average middle-class home to balloon from 1,710 square feet in 1982 to more than 2,100 square feet last year.
But even as houses continue to grow, the small, sensible cottage is coming into vogue again. A band of architects and builders is trying to shake some sense into their industry, spurred on by statistics that show that the American family is shrinking, and by the rise of single-person and single-parent households. Such people say they don't need and can't afford the bodacious four-bedroom house that has strong-armed the suburban landscape for more than a decade -- "the junior embassy look," as Michael Walsh, a syndicated columnist, has called it. 
 "It's the architect's duty to bring people to their senses," said Max Levy, a Dallas architect. "Excess square footage is the architectural equivalent of overeating, with all its overtones of nervous disorder."
A prime example of how this nascent less-can-be-more movement can work stands in a grove of pines at the end of a winding gravel road in Dutchess County, N.Y. Clad in cedar shingles and topped by three vast interlocking peaked roofs, Tobias Picker's house resembles a Russian dacha by way of Stanford White. Packed into its two-floor 1,100-square-foot plan are two bedrooms (15 by 13 feet and 14 by 11 feet), one and a half baths and a semicircular living room (17 by 17 feet) dominated by a baronial fireplace. Out back is a covered porch (21 by 13 1/2 feet), which functions as a dining room for much of the year.
The cost of the house was $110,000 -- $100 a square foot, said its architect, Dennis Wedlick, a young New Yorker with a talent for cottage-size homes with poetic silhouettes. Judicious use of stock windows, a prefabricated fireplace, ready-made columns and asphalt roofing allowed Mr. Wedlick to incorporate luxuries like doors made of fine-grained Douglas fir.
From the owner's perspective, the house is "huge." "And it's cheaper and nicer than anything I've seen already built," said Mr. Picker, a composer, who shares the house with a friend. He added that the different ceiling heights (8 feet in the halls, 10 feet in the bedroom and study, a cavernous 16 feet in the stairwell) remind him of old cartoons. "You know, where a cat chases a mouse into what appears to be a tiny house but they run through dozens of rooms," he said.
Growing interest in small-scale houses is spurred in part by "hometown" developments like Seaside, Fla., and by the reissue of turn-of-the-century house-plan books like "Bungalows, Camps and Mountain Houses" (AIA Press, 1993).
"There's a real need for intimacy," said Melanie Taylor, an architect in New Haven who has developed a thriving sideline selling plans for neo-Victorian, 875-square-foot cottages based on her designs for Seaside.
One of her latest projects is for Kathryn George, an editor in chief of American Homestyle magazine. Measuring 16 feet wide by 36 feet deep and replete with fireplaces, porches and a bunk room for guests, Ms. George's three-bedroom, 1,152-square-foot house in Ashfield, Mass., is expected to cost about $120,000.
Mr. Levy, Ms. Taylor and their fellow revolutionaries have their whittling cut out for them. According to a recent study by the Economics and Housing Development division of the National Association of Home Builders, of the million or so single-family American homes built in 1993, 29 percent measured 2,400 square feet or more. Thirty percent of all homes built last year had four bedrooms or more, while 48 percent were equipped with at least two and a half baths. In six years, it is predicted that the average American home will increase by nearly 10 percent, to about 2,500 square feet.
Ironically, census statistics point out that the size of the American family has decreased, from an average of 3.6 people in 1971 to 2.7 in 1993. The end-of-the-decade family unit is expected to be even smaller, just 2.4 people.
"Everybody wants a media room, a home office, an exercise room, three bathrooms, a family room, a living room and a huge, beautiful, eat-in kitchen that nobody cooks in," said a plainly exasperated Gopal Ahluwalia, the director of research for the home builders' association. "It's incredible. All this increased size has nothing to do with use of space, because the space that we have is wasted. My wife and I are perfect examples. Our dining room is used maybe three times a year."
But for many people, cutting back a floor plan means "invading the category of hope," said Anne Lewis, a partner at McCartney-Lewis, an architectural firm in Washington.
"We all have a long list of people we want to invite over, and 20 years later, we still haven't given that big party," she said. "But, hey, you never know."
One reason big homes are so prevalent is economics, said Marshall Taylor, a senior reporter at Real Estate Finance Today, a publication of the Mortgage Bankers Association.
"Builders want to make the most money they can, and the bigger the home, the bigger the profit," Mr. Taylor explained. "They just don't make nearly as much building a small house. Consequently, we have an affordable-housing crisis. The average family can't afford a home because there aren't enough homes being built for less than $150,000."
According to a guideline cited by officials at the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, a family with a median yearly income of $39,950 can afford a $113,000 home -- if they can find one.
Dr. Jamie Horowitz, an environmental psychologist and associate professor of architecture at Iowa State University of Science and Technology, says home-buying habits are partly to blame for the housing shortage. Ten years ago, "it was addictive," she said, "like high-stakes gambling: buy a big house, sell it for more than you paid, buy a bigger house." She continued: "Builders built big and expensive because that's the only way they could recoup what they paid for the land. Then the bottom of the market fell out."
"Today, we're in need of balance, not bombast," she said. "Showing off doesn't give us the same sort of thrill anymore, which explains part of the renewed interest in the cottage. It's discreet, it's comforting and the lower price tag means that you end up with money in the bank that you can spend on enjoying life instead of paying an outrageous mortgage."
Several other societal factors play a role in the small-house revival, from concern for the environment (smaller houses generally cost less to build, heat, cool, decorate and maintain) to the knowledge that the average American family no longer resembles the Cleavers.
As market research shows that single men and women, single-parent families and gay and lesbian couples are as eager to buy houses as are more traditional families, farsighted builders are testing the waters with alternatives to condominiums.
Town and Country Homes, a leading developer in Oak Brook, Ill., has embraced the small-house ideal for subdivisions in the Chicago and Minneapolis areas. Town and Country's two-story houses of the Saturn series are expected to cost between $120,000 (1,180 square feet) and $145,000 (1,630 square feet), said the company's president, William J. Ryan Jr.
Each has details that recall the golden age of the Craftsman-style bungalow, circa 1915: a wood pergola connects one model to a garage, while another features tapering columns that support a shaded front porch. All have picket fences.
Similarly neo-traditional touches are ornamenting housing developments across the country. Greystone Homes' Windsor subdivision in Pleasanton, Calif., has peaked rooflines and multipaned windows. For a project in St. Albans, Vt., Turner Brooks has designed a neighborhood of 900- and 1,000-square-foot two-story houses in a corn-fed country vernacular, replete with welcoming porches and clapboard siding. The projected cost? Less than $45 a square foot.
Design magazines, once the domain of the grand and glorious, are slowly following suit. The August issue of House Beautiful, for example, is devoted to the joys of small spaces.
"Good living is not related to an excess of square footage," said the magazine's editor in chief, Louis Oliver Gropp, who points out that the challenge is for architects to make small spaces interesting and for potential homebuyers to understand that less space doesn't necessarily mean cramped space.
For Andre Sala, a toy designer and father of three who lives in Albany, Calif., the architect Christopher Alexander designed a three-story, $103,000 tinted concrete house with ingenuities that not only save space but are what Mr. Sala calls "spiritual enrichments."
Making the house vertical rather than horizontal, for example, masked its small size, 1,080 square feet. "If you don't have a lot of actual floor area, then stack it," said Mr. Alexander, whose user-friendly architectural theories are put forth in "A Pattern Language" (Oxford University Press, 1977). "The psychological distance becomes great, adding privacy, intimacy and separation."
Upstairs, the Sala children share a 9-by-14 1/2-foot room, their beds built into the thick walls, thereby freeing floor space for play and study. Downstairs is the family's alcove sitting area, its low ceiling, built-in seats and overhead bookshelves providing the cozy atmosphere of the captain's quarters on a galleon.
When trying to build an affordable house, alternatives count. Richard Mogas, an architect in San Antonio, sheathed an 1,800-square-foot ranch house in board and batten siding, more often found in farm structures than in custom housing. The barn-red porch is just a slab of concrete.
Ted Flato, a founder of Lake/Flato Architects in San Antonio, designed a 30-foot square, four-bedroom house using corrugated sheet metal for the roof and painted plywood for the bedroom floors. The 1,000-square-foot house is built around an 18-by-18-foot octagonal great room that serves, Mr. Flato said, "as entry hall, screened pavilion and living-dining-kitchen space." Its ceiling soars to a skylight 25 feet above the stained concrete floor, and when opened wide, the room's glass-and-pine double doors (each 5 feet wide and 12 feet tall) give the house the personality of a gazebo. This spatial attraction more than makes up for the minuscule bedrooms, all big enough for a double bed and little more.
But for some people, small is more than enough. "All you need is a place to sleep, a place to eat, a place to work and a place to read," said Mr. Picker, who thinks his 1,100 square feet are perfect. "How big can that possibly be?"

HEADLINE: AT HOME WITH Matilda Raffa Cuomo;
Working to Renew the Lease

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 20

 BODY:
Matilda Raffa Cuomo surveyed the parade of anniversary cards atop a mantelpiece in New York's Executive Mansion and feigned disbelief at the durability of her marriage. "Forty years," she said. "One man."
The last 12 of her 40 years with Mario M. Cuomo have been spent on Eagle Street in the 40-room mansion that the state has lent its governors since 1877. It is easy to understand why the Cuomos might want to avoid eviction. 
 The elegant three-story house in the Queen Anne style, with a distinctive wraparound porch, has been lovingly restored during the Cuomo years. It is currently their only residence, although they use Mr. Cuomo's mother's house in Hollis, Queens, as a voting address and are looking for a home of their own in Queens.
Three men who went on to become President lived in the mansion, as did two vice presidents, four unsuccessful Presidential candidates and one Chief Justice. Mr. Cuomo has chosen not to extend that legacy. But he is seeking to make history of a different kind this year by running for a fourth consecutive four-year term. If he is successful and if he completes the term, the Cuomos will become the mansion's most enduring residents.
Mrs. Cuomo has used her time in Albany to become an energetic ambassador for the state, traveling to more than a dozen countries on trade missions and taking advantage of countless appearances to promote programs for children and families. As a spokeswoman, she is warm and effervescent, refreshingly uninhibited, impeccably dressed and seemingly ageless.
Her secret? Regular walks around Lincoln Park in Albany and "Buns of Steel" workout videos, produced by her son-in-law Howard S. Maier. "They're very good, by the way," she said. "The No. 3 is fantastic."
Despite their common history, Mario and Matilda Cuomo often seem remarkably different. If the Governor's mind functions like an appellate brief, manufacturing logic even where there may be none, Mrs. Cuomo's moves like a skimming stone, capable of veering in new directions each time it touches water.
The Governor listens to her, he said, because she is intelligent, but he declined to identify specific policies that she has influenced. She unquestionably has the ear of her own small state-salaried staff, as well as the Governor's commissioners and aides. "I can call them whenever I want, and they're at my disposal," she said.
Some hear from her more than they want and roll their eyes when she calls. But none question her commitment to preserving families. "She eats it, works it, breathes it," one Cuomo aide said. "And she's very impatient that she can't improve things immediately."
Mario and Matilda Cuomo met in the cafeteria at St. John's in Queens, where they both attended college. They shared a first date at Larry's Bar and Grill, where the cash-poor Mr. Cuomo put the bill for their chopped steaks on his tab. She wore his college ring on a chain and waited for him while he played minor-league baseball in Georgia, walking to the post office each day to pick up his letters. When she didn't hear from him for two weeks, she told herself: "That's it. He's dead. I never want to see that guy again."
All was forgiven when she found out he had been beaned, an injury that ended his baseball career and led him to seek another one. After all, her mother, a Sicilian who had prophesied the baseball injury after dreaming about it, had always liked him. "I kept saying, 'Why do you like him so much?' " Mrs. Cuomo recalled. "And she said, 'Well, he's serious, and he won't hurt you.' How would she say it? 'He's sincero.' That's it -- sincere. My God, if she said that once . . ."
She became pregnant with Margaret, the first of their five children, on their honeymoon in Puerto Rico, or close to it ("She's 39, and I'm married for 40 years, so you figure it out," said Mrs. Cuomo, who, like her husband, is now 62.)
When he displayed early symptoms of workaholism as a young lawyer, she raised the family. And when he detoured into politics, she went along for the ride, although she has never been happy about the loss of potential earnings. "I mean, he made senior partner," she said. "He was going to make loads of money."
During her tenure in Albany, Mrs. Cuomo has served as chairwoman of the Governor's Decade of the Child program. She has been responsible for creating computer data bases to coordinate state programs for children, developing a public-school curriculum on nutrition and distributing booklets on parenthood in hospital maternity wards. She often speaks on issues related to breast cancer.
But her signal achievement is the state's Mentoring Program, which has paired 3,200 adult volunteers, Mrs. Cuomo among them, with schoolchildren in need of academic and social support.
The program, said Mrs. Cuomo, a former elementary-school teacher, is not just for the poor. "I know when I was raising my kids, there's such a rebellious point there when they're preadolescent," she continued. "The hormones seem to be running amok. They get the pimples. They don't like the way they look. And that's the reason for all that punk and all that stuff. Look, you go crazy. You look at them and say, 'Is this my kid?' "
Mrs. Cuomo's other obsession has been renovating the Executive Mansion, which she has opened to the public for Thursday afternoon tours and for civic group luncheons. "The way it was was not proper for people to come here from other countries visiting the Executive Mansion of this great state," she said of the house, which dates from 1856. "I said, 'My God, it's going to be not only a bad reflection on us personally but on the state, the people.' " An upstairs bathroom was "so cruddy you cannot believe it," she continued, adding: "It had all the little gray institutional tile. It was so awful, disgusting."
Downstairs, there were "drapes that looked like, at best, you'd put them in your den, you know what I'm saying?" she said. "They were a beige, like a linen look, and straight across and with a salmon and a brown," she continued. "It was not for this type of a home and this period. It was an eyesore. It really was."
After raising $2 million in private gifts and commanding a team of interior designers, Mrs. Cuomo believes the mansion is now as it should be. She is diligent enough about preserving the restoration that she covers the hand-loomed seat cushions with plastic when her four young grandchildren, all girls, sit at the dinner table.
And yet, despite her obvious pride in rehabilitating the mansion, Mrs. Cuomo exhibits a certain sensitivity about the place these days.
Given the electorate's impatience with incumbents, it might be impolitic to seem too much at home, even if the Cuomos have spent a fifth of their lives there. Furthermore, the mansion, with its 11-member staff and its $445,000 budget (down from $772,000 four years ago), does not exactly fit the "son of a ditch digger, born above the grocery store" image that Mr. Cuomo has nurtured throughout his political life. When the Cuomos' elder son, Andrew, really wants to needle his younger brother, Christopher, hecalls him "Mansion Boy," because Christopher spent his formative years in the big house with servants.
"It's never really been our home," Mrs. Cuomo said. "It's a public place. That's the way it is, and that's the way it's meant to be. It's a lodging. It's a place to come to be at night, to eat together."
Mrs. Cuomo was at first reluctant even to be interviewed at the mansion, lest it be thought that she has spent the last 12 years as a homemaker, the occupation she lists on the Cuomos' tax returns. Once she relented, she emphasized that her family rarely uses the ornate formal rooms, with their luxurious wallpaper and Hudson River School landscapes. And she said that she travels so much that she usually spends only two or three nights a week in Albany.
When not in Albany, she frequently stays with one of her daughters: on Long Island with Dr. Margaret Cuomo Maier, 39, a radiologist, or in Westchester with Maria Cuomo Cole, 32, the chairwoman of the nonprofit Help for the Homeless. Mrs. Cuomo's other children are Andrew, 36, an Assistant Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development; Madeline Cuomo O'Donoghue, 29, a lawyer and Cuomo campaign official, and Christopher, 23, a student at Fordham Law School.
The Cuomos have kept their personal lives remarkably private for a family that has lived so long in the spotlight, largely by using the mansion as a cloister.
Governor and Mrs. Cuomo do not dine out in Albany (their last outing was to a Japanese restaurant for their 39th anniversary in June 1993) or use the mansion for state dinners. They rarely go to movies, plays or sporting events. Their time together is spent at the mansion, where the Governor reads, watches television or videos ("Gunga Din" is a personal favorite) and writes at his roll-top desk in a small study equipped with a fax machine and three telephones.
"I'm not going to kid you," Mrs. Cuomo said. "He is constantly on the phone."
When he is at home with his family, Mr. Cuomo is not always the Jesuitical combatant he may seem at the Capitol, Mrs. Cuomo said.
"He is really fun," she said. "I'm not kidding. It means nothing to him to put on, you know, the hat he wears with the brim. And he puts it way over his ears." Then, Mrs. Cuomo said, her husband sticks his tongue out and makes her laugh. "I said, 'Don't do that,' because it used to scare the kids."
As she girds herself for what may be their roughest campaign, Mrs. Cuomo says she is prepared to defend her husband against all manner of Republican brickbats.
Mr. Cuomo, she argued, has not received his due from a negativist press, particularly given the difficulty of leading such a diverse and populous state through a long recession.
"My God, if you didn't have this kind of Governor, if you didn't have this kind of perspective, if you didn't have this kind of focus and commitment long term, what would it have been like?" she said. "We'd have rebellions worse than L.A. We would have people killing each other."
After so many years in power, she finds the notion of leaving right now unthinkable. To trade what she describes as "the productivity" of the Cuomo administration for a new agenda would be "such a waste."
And of course, there is the issue of the Decade of the Child, which Mr. Cuomo announced in 1988. "We have four more years to go," she said. "It's a decade, right? I mean, that's the whole point. You know, give us a break."

HEADLINE: Reinvestment Law Aids Poor Areas

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A July 11 news article offers two explanations for growing interest by banks to lend in New York's poorer areas: banks are stronger, and city and neighborhood development groups have helped rejuvenate many areas over the last decade.
I believe there is a third factor: renewed emphasis on the Community Reinvestment Act and the obligations it places on lending institutions to reinvest in neighborhoods from which they take deposits. The law, passed in 1977, has been criticized by neighborhood development groups because of the soft approach the bank regulatory agencies have taken to enforcement. 
 One of the Clinton Administration's early endeavors was to order the regulatory agencies to review the act and to hold public hearings. New regulations have been drafted and will soon be promulgated. These will make direct lending a top priority.
With stronger regulations and stricter enforcement, poor neighborhoods, like better-off ones, will be assured of the availability of credit essential to keeping neighborhoods alive.

HEADLINE: Numbers Game on Health

 BODY:
President Clinton says he thought his remarks sounded innocent enough. Speaking to the nation's governors on Tuesday, Mr. Clinton said he would be satisfied if health-care reform managed to insure "somewhere in the ball park of 95 percent" of Americans and that he would not insist that Congress impose an employer mandate. Neither remark deviated one iota from Administration policy.
But that did not stop a torrent of speculation that the President was retreating on universal coverage and was backtracking from mandates. Yesterday a rattled White House disclaimed any such signals. And the First Lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, visited Capitol Hill to reassure Democratic leaders that the President was not wavering. By the end of the day, the Hill was supposed to believe Mr. Clinton was singing the same old tunes -- for now. 
 Judging from reactions, it would seem a grave matter of statecraft whether President Clinton sets sail for 95 percent coverage or 93 or 98. But to fixate on the numbers is to miss the important structural questions in the debate.
Universal coverage is, foremost, a statement about public values: the richest country ought not to terrorize parents with the fear of bankruptcy because their child becomes chronically ill. But for those who need a harder-edged reason, universal coverage is also necessary to make health-care markets work. If the rules allow healthy individuals to opt out of insurance, many will do so -- at least until they become sick. Then insurance companies would find they are mostly catering to the chronically ill, whom they will have to charge prohibitively high premiums. The answer is to require healthy individuals to enroll when they are well and pay premiums to help cover the cost of care when they become ill. In a phrase, universal coverage.
Does that mean every living American must be covered to the point of statistical perfection? Not really. Indeed, the President's bill would not achieve 100 percent coverage; nor do the Europeans or Hawaii -- which has a mandate on employers to buy their workers coverage. What is needed is a bill that, as a practical matter, brings coverage to the rich and poor, sick and healthy, young and old, employed and unemployed, in the same way that Social Security, as a practical matter, provides retirement benefits for all Americans and requires contributions from every worker. If the medical insurance rules, like those of Social Security, allow odd exceptions -- whether they add up to 2, 3 or even 5 percent of the population -- this amounts to no moral or medical catastrophe.
Mr. Clinton's loose lips did not help negotiations. His words encourage recalcitrants on Capitol Hill to spend time figuring out how to get the President, and his Democratic supporters, to retreat -- rather than accepting the goal of universal coverage and figuring out what else the bill can have to win bipartisan support.

HEADLINE: Destructive Entitlement Caps

 BODY:
The House votes today on a defective proposal by Representative Charles Stenholm of Texas to place a cap on overall entitlement spending -- programs like Medicare, food stamps and Social Security. Mr. Stenholm's bill would limit annual increases to an amount that would offset inflation and increases in the number of eligible recipients. That may seem reasonable, but it fails to account for many other reasons spending rises -- such as health-care prices that drive up the cost of Medicaid faster than inflation, or import surges that drive up the cost of agriculture subsidies.
A Congressional committee estimates that the Stenholm cap would require cutting entitlements by a whopping $150 billion over five years. Under the bill, Congress could close the gap by cutting entitlement programs or raising the cap. If it did neither, programs would be cut across the board. 
 The cap, contrary to Mr. Stenholm's representations, would victimize health-care reform. To make $150 billion in cuts, Congress would be forced to go after the only two programs that are huge and growing: Medicaid and Medicare. But Congress already plans to cut these programs to pay for health-care reform. The cuts cannot do double duty.
The cap would also victimize the poor. Mr. Stenholm would allow Congress to cut spending, but not raise taxes to meet his cap. That preserves "entitlements" doled out through the tax system -- like unlimited tax deductions for medical insurance provided to high-paid employees. But it leaves welfare and other poor people's programs at risk.
The House will also vote today on a bill by John Kasich of Ohio to control entitlements by having Congress set an overall limit and limits on individual programs each year. If the limits are breached, individual programs would be cut back. Mr. Kasich's bill would also punish the poor. He, too, would not allow Congress to meet entitlement limits by raising taxes; to make matters worse, he would exempt Social Security from cutbacks -- thereby directing cuts to programs targeted on the needy.
The only acceptable bill the House will consider is by John Spratt of South Carolina. Mr. Spratt would require the President to propose a solution to Congress if total entitlement spending were to rise above target; Congress would then have to vote on the President's proposal -- which could be to do nothing. The Spratt bill would force Congress to face up to the problem. But unlike the other plans, it would allow Congress a full menu of responses -- including tax hikes and cuts in discretionary spending. Mr. Spratt does not believe Congress should single out the needy.

HEADLINE: Now Put Africa on Foreign Policy Agenda

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Last month's White House Conference on Africa was a good first step in raising the profile of the continent among policy makers.
The United States has been a leader both in providing humanitarian relief to Africa and in designing effective population programs. Moreover, our diplomacy has been very effective in several countries; in South Africa, for example, steadfast United States support for the transition to nonracial democracy played an important role in that country's astounding success. 
 While we have made progress, Africa needs and deserves more attention from the Clinton Administration. I believe we must take action in three critical areas.
First, we must increase the level of our development aid to Africa, which is stuck at $800 million. Africa contains 18 of the world's 20 poorest countries, and 30 of the poorest 40.
In last year's House foreign aid authorization bill, we authorized $900 million for Africa; unfortunately, this sum was later reduced. The Administration should demonstrate its commitment to Africa by requesting a higher level of assistance in the next foreign aid budget.
Second, the United States should develop a comprehensive approach to conflict prevention and resolution in Africa. As anyone who reads the daily paper knows, wars dominate Africa's political landscape. Not only do these wars cause tremendous suffering, but they also severely retard the growth of sub-Saharan Africa's economy.
Members of the Africa subcommittee recently introduced legislation to help the United States more effectively address the scourge of war in Africa. This bill helps build indigenous African capacity in conflict resolution and provides critical assistance in demobilizing oversized African armies.
Third, Africa should be engaged at a higher level within the United States Government.
To implement an upgrading of Africa in United States foreign policy, the Clinton Administration should schedule a Presidential visit to Africa, encourage officials above the level of assistant secretary to become more actively engaged in Africa policy and undertake higher level and higher profile diplomatic engagement in African conflicts and problems.

HEADLINE: THE RWANDA DISASTER: RELIEF;
AID FOR RWANDANS STARTS TO ARRIVE AT REFUGE IN ZAIRE

BYLINE: By JO THOMAS 

 BODY:
The first significant deliveries of food and medicine to treat cholera arrived yesterday in Goma, Zaire, as foreign governments and relief agencies worked to organize help for up to four million Rwandan refugees as they continued to flee at the rate of 2,000 an hour.
In Goma, where more than a million refugees have gathered, the camps were filled with hundreds of bodies. Doctors Without Borders, a medical relief agency, has set up tents to begin treating thousands stricken with cholera. The group predicted as many as 50,000 cases, half of whom could die. 
 The first convoy of trucks carrying food shipments arrived from Uganda yesterday, and some flights carrying medicine landed at the Goma airstrip.
President Clinton said the United States planned to "try to lead the United Nations in responding to the cholera problem and dealing with the other aspects of this human catastrophe." This would include $35 million in United States aid, added to $41.4 million approved several days ago, and bringing the total to more than $120 million.
Many details of the relief plan are still being worked out by military planners and diplomats in the United States, Europe and Africa. Deputy Defense Secretary John M. Deutch met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff yesterday to discuss how the military would carry out its part of the plan.
"We are literally in a race against time to save lives," warned the American Red Cross President, Elizabeth Dole. "It's a race we simply cannot lose, or it will be a tragedy of unimaginable proportions."
With estimates of Rwandans who have fled their homes now reaching four million, nearly half the population has been killed or displaced because of the civil war.
In a briefing yesterday afternoon, Brian Atwood of the United States Agency for International Development, who had just returned from Zaire, said he expected the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to appeal today for $274 million to help the growing number of refugees.
Mr. Atwood said the United States would send 33,000 tons of grain and an immediate shipment of water supplies and 20 million packets of oral rehydration kits to treat cholera and diarrhea.
The Defense Department is also prepared to set up an air installation in Entebbe, Uganda, to ship food, medicine and equipment to the entire area. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Germany and Britain have also offered planes for the airlift.
Francoise Derron, spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross in New York, said the airstrip in Goma "cannot accommodate more than 20 planes a day." Reporters in Goma said up to 30 planes landed yesterday, although the air traffic was causing damage to the runway.
"The difficulty is that you have planes arriving, and you have to unload the planes and load trucks," she said. "All that takes time."
Marie Okabe, senior liaison officer for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in New York yesterday that 10 flights had arrived in Goma by midday. But she said that the impression in New York was "that very little aid is reaching the refugees in spite of the agencies' best efforts."
The United Nations has said the refugees need nearly 8 million gallons of water a day, and it has asked governments to send 50 water trucks, 300 additional trucks and 100 light vehicles to move supplies.
Water can be pumped from Lake Kivu, but until systems can be set up to do that, adequate supplies of clean water are crucial, relief workers said. Water and oral rehydration are essential to the treatment of cholera.
 
Water Difficult to Reach
 According to CARE, one of the relief agencies on the scene, ground water is difficult to reach because it is covered with volcanic rock, which also makes it difficult to dig latrines. The United Nations has asked for aid to build 60,000 latrines.
In Goma, workers using megaphones have urged refugees to go to four camps -- Katale, Kibumba, Mugunga and Lac Vent -- north of the town. Food distribution began Wednesday in Kibumba and Katale, where a dispensary was also set up. Kibumba, 18 miles north of Goma on the road to Katale, has about 300,000 people.
The first of 20 trucks from the World Food Program arrived in Goma yesterday, each carrying 30 tons of corn, cornmeal and beans from Kampala, Uganda. Thirty more trucks were loading in Nairobi, Kenya. Half will go to Goma and the rest to Bukavu, on the southern end of Lake Kivu. Twenty more trucks are on their way to Nairobi from the organization's fleet in Eritrea and Ethiopia.
"In this situation, you have to use trucks," said Douglas Coutts, deputy director of the North America office of the World Food Program of the United Nations. "The airlift is so expensive and difficult."
 
Problems at Airport
 The runway at the airport in Goma, Mr. Atwood of the Agency for International Development said yesterday, can handle large planes. "The problem is the apron area and the cargo-lift capacity," he said. "We badly need to turn planes around there very quickly."
Kathleen deLaski, the Pentagon spokeswoman, said, "The biggest problem in Goma right now is that there's one airfield which is already saturated, so in order to bring in more equipment or more people, we have to either build another ramp at Goma or identify some other airfields."
It is not clear how many United States troops may be involved in the relief operation, but Mr. Atwood quoted an estimate by Mr. Deutch, the Deputy Defense Secretary, that it could be as many as 1,000.
Mr. Atwood said he expected that 1,500 tons of food would reach the Red Cross in Goma by today, along with 120 tons of blankets, 135 tons of plastic sheeting and 4 temporary warehouses. These would be sent on eight Boeing-707 aircraft.
 
Hutus Still Fearful
 Mr. Atwood said the United States was also trying to work with the newly formed Government in Rwanda. But the Hutu fear of the Tutsi-dominated Rwanda Patriotic Front, which won the country's civil war, has contributed to the continuing flow of refugees.
"We know that this situation will not be handled until conditions are such that refugees will return to their country," he said. "We are going to be prepositioning food distribution centers in Rwanda to encourage people to stay and to encourage people to return."
Mr. Coutts, of the World Food Program, said the turn of events in Rwanda had caught the relief organizations by surprise.
"We thought we could address the needs of the population within the country once there was a settlement," he said. "Who would have predicted that the opposition to the Rwanda Patriotic Front would have continued with these hate broadcasts, telling people, 'They're going to kill you.' This is our worst nightmare."
Mr. Atwood said yesterday that he had discussed "the problem of the clandestine radio that is urging Hutus to leave, and within a matter of hours I hope we will have equipment on the ground to deal with that problem."
"We will in the next few days have our own radio facilities -- meaning the international community, the United Nations -- in order to send more positive messages to the people of Rwanda," he said.
He said he had been assured that the French would be able to detect or jam the clandestine radio.
"We believe the French can handle this," he said. "Nonetheless, we're watching this very closely because this radio station is not only inciting people to leave the country, it's also putting out a lot of anti-U.N. rhetoric in recent days, and after the closing of the Embassy of Rwanda here in Washington, there was even a lot of anti-American rhetoric."
 
Hopes for New Government
 The United States, Mr. Atwood said, was hoping for cooperation from the new Government. "We're going to need them not only to be sending the right signals rhetorically to people on the outside," he said. "We're also going to need to see them taking actions to show their good will."
The Rwandan Government, he said, must set up a legal system that meets internationally recognized judicial standards and must show that it intends to deal with war criminals through that system.
"They have agreed already to do that, but even all that is not enough," he said.
"We will also require an effective Unamir force that makes all of Rwanda a safe zone," he added, referring to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda.
 
U.S. Said to Move Too Slowly
 Lionel Rosenblatt, president of Refugees International, said the Clinton Administration was not moving quickly enough.
"More Rwandans are dying than in any other population in the world," Mr. Rosenblatt said. "The trick is to turn it around in a matter of days and not to have it soar over a matter of weeks.
"We've had eight days now, and we basically wasted those eight days. We need the water and the airlift in the next two weeks, or we'll have tens of thousands dead. This has to be done in the next few days. It's got to be a Berlin airlift kind of response."
Mr. Atwood said: "I think the announcements that I've made today incidate that we're moving aggressively and immediately. The international community has never seen anything quite like this."

HEADLINE: Pirelli's Savior Faces New Headwind

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MILAN, Italy

 BODY:
It took near disaster at Pirelli S.p.A., Italy's giant rubber company, to bring Marco Tronchetti Provera to the helm. Rapid expansion in Europe and the United States in the 1980's had spawned a mountain of debt, and by 1992, when Mr. Tronchetti took over as chief executive in the midst of recession, the company's anchor businesses of automobile tires and electrical cables were floundering.
The success of Mr. Tronchetti, who is 46, in refloating Pirelli made him just about the most-talked-about man in Italian business, raised the company's sagging share price, and last year landed him on the cover of Fortune magazine's international edition as one of Europe's tough new generation of managers. 
 This year, the question is whether the tall, lean and energetic Mr. Tronchetti is tough enough to face down what may be a stiffer challenge -- keeping Pirelli from sinking in the new storms swirling in Italian politics.
The storms threaten to swamp his strategic plan for the future of the company's electric cable division, on which many analysts think the future of the company as a whole rests. And they have come at time when drastic retrenchment and a strike at the company's tire division in the United States, the Pirelli Armstrong Tire Corporation, are highlighting the survival risks confronting all in the tire-making industry except the giants, like the Michelin Tire Corporation, the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and the Bridgestone Corporation.
For all of this, investors remain bullish about Pirelli. By the end of the second week in July, when Pirelli closed at 2,725 lire ($1.77) the stock had shown a 9 percent increase since the start of July. Since, the stock, like all stocks traded in Milan, has been buffeted by the near collapse of the Government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
Pirelli is the world's third-largest maker of optical fiber cables, and Mr. Tronchetti's strategic plan is this: He badly wants to acquire a sizable stake in Telecom Italia, a company still on the Government's drawing board as part of its work to privatize the state-controlled telecommunications industry. The acquisition, he says, would assure the nation a major telecommunications company with the scale to compete when Europe's telecommunications monopolies break up. It would also preserve a base for Pirelli's cable manufacturing.
"I think it important there be movement on both wings of the business," said Luca Comi, a share analyst at Milan's Intereuropa brokerage. "But Telecom is very important, also at a psychological level. Optical fibers is where the company is lagging, and it would provide Pirelli with a privileged access channel."
Italian politicians take a different view. With Telecom being taken public this fall, Mr. Tronchetti is under assault by two key groups.
 
Facing Multiple Roadblocks

 
 One group is the state industries' professional managers, worried about their jobs if an aggressive industrial shareholder of the likes of Pirelli with clear business goals assumes a major share.
The other group is made up of small businesses central to the uneasy coalition that keeps the right-wing government of Mr. Berlusconi, himself a tycoon turned politician, in power; the small businesses have long feared the weight of large industrial concerns.
In Rome, legislators are accusing Mr. Tronchetti of trying to transform what had been a public monopoly into a private one, and have vowed to block any attempt by Pirelli to obtain a controlling share of Telecom.
Mr. Tronchetti rejects all such charges. "Whoever accuses us is speaking in bad faith," he said, stiffening his back during an interview at Pirelli's headquarters here.
"Liberalization will cause two phenomena: first will be a lowering of rates, and second, a reduction of everyone's market share," he continued. "We've got to seize the opportunity, or Italy risks becoming marginalized, forced to cede development to third parties."
 
A Leader Who Seizes the Moment

 
 If history is any guide, Mr. Tronchetti is a master at seizing opportunity. A graduate of the management school of Milan's Bocconi university, Mr. Tronchetti got his start in the Tronchettis' $320-million-a-year family business, Camfin S.p.A., , trading raw materials and petroleum products. After a spell in London as a trainee with a marine transport company, he returned to Italy to set up a shipping agency, and at age 28 married Leopoldo Pirelli's daughter (they have since separated).
He succeeded Mr. Pirelli, grandson of Giovanni Battista Pirelli, who founded the company in 1883, as chief executive of the company at time when its shareholders were badly shaken by debt resulting from a failed attempt to buy Germany's big Continental rubber company in 1991. His first goal was to return the company to its industrial roots. He jettisoned about 40 subsidiaries making everything from sneakers to conveyor belts. Shedding the philosophy of bigness, he dismissed 170 executives, nearly one-quarter of management.
He dramatized his hands-on approach by moving the company headquarters from fashionable Piazzale Cadorna in downtown Milan to austere quarters on Pirelli's original factory grounds north of the city.
And he has been advertising the company's new look with a provocative campaign that recently plastered much of Europe with billboards featuring the American sprinter Carl Lewis bent over in a starting position, sporting bright red women's high heels. The ad's message promotes the sure grip of Pirelli tires: "Power is nothing without control."
This year, the company expects to turn a modest profit, after losses of $27 million in 1993, on global sales of $5.7 billion. (In telecommunications, for example, Pirelli is a major supplier of cables to American telephone and power companies. It also sells sophisticated components like optical amplifiers, which strengthen signals in glass fiber cables, to long-distance carriers like the MCI Communications Corporation.)
Net debt, which stood at $2 billion in 1991, has been almost halved to $1.1 billion. The company is leaner than it has been in a long while, employing 43,000 people, 8,500 fewer than in 1991.
 
U.S. Operations Displeasing

 
 Mr. Tronchetti has not been pleased with operations in the United States, where roughly 16 percent of Pirelli's total sales has been generated through sales of Armstrong replacement tires at big retail outlets like Sears, Roebuck & Company. For the last two years, Pirelli Armstrong has been restructuring, to focus on car and light-truck tires and on productivity gains. In the second week of July, Pirelli Armstrong announced the company intended to phase out health care benefits for 3,000 retirees. And since, the New Haven-based subsidiary announced it had reached an agreement to sell its Des Moines factory, which makes tires for farm vehicles, to Titan Wheel International Inc. of Quincy, Ill.
The Des Moines factory is one of three Pirelli plants -- the others are in Nashville and in Hanford, Calif. -- struck by 1,700 members of the United Rubber Workers July 15. The union says Armstrong's health and pension offers are unacceptable. Paul Calvi, chief executive of Pirelli Armstrong, says "the financial viability of Pirelli Armstrong is being threatened by health costs."
Mr. Tronchetti declined to comment. What is going on with Armstrong, said Giancarlo Rocco di Torrepadula, a Pirelli spokesman, is a local problem being dealt with by local management.
According to Stephen Reitman, an auto industry analyst at UBS-Philips & Drew in London, Pirelli Armstrong's problems provide one more piece of evidence for the strains in the the world tire market, where recovery awaits a revival of Europe's sluggish automobile market.
"Maybe the shakeout is just taking longer than expected," he says. "Maybe it's the smaller manufacturers, the Continentals, the Pirellis, the Dunlops, that are going to go."
 
One Possible Key to Survival

 
 Such an analysis highlights the importance of Pirelli's telecommunications division -- and of a stake in Telecom -- to the company's future. To foil any single investor taking control, Rome has been insisting on limiting share purchases to about 3 percent of equity. One way to skirt such restrictions is to get a group of allied companies to snap up 3 percent packages, and then act in concert as a shareholder group.
In any event, Mr. Tronchetti is not saying what strategy Pirelli will use until he sees which way the present government plans to go. In the meantime, he takes every opportunity to hammer away at what he sees as Italy's need to shed a mentality based on government ownership.
"Our problem remains learning to understand the state as a regulator, not as owner and operator," he said.
Mr. Tronchetti is a passionate yachtsman and owns a Finnish-built boat named Kauris, Finnish for Capricorn, his zodiac sign. His abiding interest in the sea is reflected in the antique maps of Italy and its surrounding waters that adorn his office walls.
And does he see a connection between boating and business? "I enjoy being at the helm," he replied.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: SPECIAL INTERESTS;
Health Care Bills Bring Benefits For Some Specific Constituents

SERIES: The Fine Print: A periodic look behind the law.

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
A hospital in Representative Dan Rostenkowski's neighborhood in Chicago is getting Federal aid for a $580 million construction project. Representative Charles B. Rangel has secured similar assistance for a hospital on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. And Representative Barbara B. Kennelly of Connecticut has obtained special dispensation for the Hartford Life Insurance Companies.
Those are a few of the little-noticed provisions tucked into health care legislation for the benefit of specific hospitals, drug companies and insurance companies. 
 The highly contentious health care bills moving through Congress are chock-full of such narrowly focused provisions, and they illustrate how shrewd lobbyists or sympathetic members of Congress on strategically important committees try to write law for clients and constituents.
Michael D. Bromberg, executive director of the Federation of American Health Systems, a trade group for 1,400 hospitals, said the manipulation of Federal largess would become more common if the Government gained control over a larger share of the nation's health spending.
"Once you give Congress the power to play with a trillion dollars a year, it will be tempted to shift money around in pork-barrel fashion," he said.
And there may be unforeseen consequences. "If you do a special deal for Hospital A," said Mr. Bromberg, "Hospital B across the street will be hurt."
The health care bill is far from the first piece of legislation to include such benefits. Similar provisions for specific recipients are found in many tax bills and appropriations bills.
Such provisions are customarily written to help specific groups without mentioning them by name. The health bill approved by the House Ways and Means Committee, for instance, provides Federal interest subsidies to reduce the cost of financing major construction projects planned by teaching hospitals.
This provision, sought by Mr. Rostenkowski, would make Federal aid available only for construction projects that cost $500 million or more, were approved before June 1, 1994, and will be finished by Dec. 31, 2002. In practice, it benefits only a small number of hospitals.
Although Mr. Rostenkowski was forced to step down as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee after he was indicted on Federal corruption charges in May, he can still do favors for constituents.
One institution that would qualify for the interest rate subsidies is Northwestern Memorial Hospital in downtown Chicago, which has a $580 million project to replace most of its existing beds. Joseph K. Dowley, a Washington lobbyist who was chief counsel of the Ways and Means Committee from 1985 to 1987, helped Northwestern land this prize.
Another beneficiary of the same provision is New York Hospital, on the Upper East Side, which has an $820 million project. New York Hospital got assistance from Mr. Rangel, a Manhattan Democrat who serves on the Ways and Means Committee, and from William A. Signer, a lobbyist who used to work for Mr. Rangel.
Aides to Mr. Rangel said the assistance to a few major teaching hospitals was justified as a way to help them through the financial uncertainties of a transition to a new health care system. The hospitals serve large number of poor people and need to replace buildings constructed more than 50 years ago, they said.
Here are other provisions that address the concerns of specific constituents:
HARTFORD INSURANCE All the major health care bills would establish Federal standards for private health insurance. Insurers could not cancel or deny coverage for a person who became sick or had an illness or disability, and they would have to offer a standard package of health benefits to all applicants.
In general, the bill says, "a carrier may not refuse to enroll, refuse to renew the enrollment of, or terminate the enrollment of, an individual or employer in an insured health benefit plan." But there is an exception for companies leaving the health insurance business "pursuant to a joint marketing agreement entered into prior to Jan. 1, 1994."
That obscurely worded provision applies to only one case: Hartford Life Insurance Companies, subsidiaries of the ITT Corporation, is leaving the health insurance market and transferring most of its group-medical business to the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company of Springfield, Mass., which uses the trademark MassMutual.
John E. Shelk, Federal affairs counsel for the ITT Hartford Insurance Group, a unit of the ITT Corporation, said he had secured this provision after laying out his concerns to Mrs. Kennelly, a Democrat from Hartford who is a member of the Ways and Means Committee.
"We are fortunate that our Congresswoman is on the committee," said Mr. Shelk. "She did a good job and helped us get a technical clarifying amendment.
"The purpose of the bill is to prevent companies from jumping out of the health insurance market on the date of enactment," he continued. "But we made a business decision in the late summer of 1993 not to continue in the traditional group health insurance market. We negotiated a joint marketing agreement with MassMutual. The new rules should not apply retroactively to a transaction that was already negotiated."
INSULIN The Ways and Means Committee bill, like President Clinton's health plan, would expand Medicare to cover prescription drugs given to elderly patients outside hospitals. The Government seeks to use its buying power to obtain a discount on drug prices. It insists that drug manufacturers pay a rebate to the Government for every prescription dispensed to a Medicare beneficiary.
These rebates are modeled on those already required under Medicaid, the program for low-income people. In Medicaid, the rebates are larger for prescription drugs and insulin than for over-the-counter medications and generic drugs, which are low-cost copies of brand-name products whose patents have expired.
In general, the new Medicare benefit would cover prescription drugs, not over-the-counter products. But it would also cover insulin, a hormone for treating diabetes, which is sold without a prescription. Under the bill, the rebate would be 15 percent for brand-name prescription drugs and 10 percent for generic drugs.
Eli Lilly and Company does not want to pay the higher rebates for its insulin products. Accordingly, the company, whose headquarters are in Indianapolis, went to Representative Andrew Jacobs Jr., an Indiana Democrat, and asked for help. Mr. Jacobs, a member of the Ways and Means Committee, offered an amendment to specify that the rebate for insulin should be only 11 percent. The committee later decided to set it at 10 percent.
Lilly contends that it should not be penalized with the higher rebate because insulin costs no more today than it did 70 years ago.
GROUP HEALTH INC. With a network of doctors and hospitals across New York State, Group Health provides coverage to more than two million people. It competes aggressively with Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield. But Group Health is concerned that it may not have all the tax breaks available to Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans.
So it enlisted the help of Geraldine A. Ferraro, the former New York Congresswoman. They persuaded the Ways and Means Committee to stipulate, as part of the health care bill, that Group Health shall be treated the same as a Blue Cross and Blue Shield organization in the future and for tax years back to 1987. The Senate Finance Committee approved a similar provision.
Group Health and the Blue Cross plans in New York all describe themselves as nonprofit corporations. Congress ended the tax exemption for such companies in 1986, after concluding that many were indistinguishable from commercial insurers. But the 1986 law authorized special tax breaks for Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans that meet certain criteria. Group Health contends that it should have received the same tax breaks.
In an interview, Frank J. Branchini, the president of Group Health, said: "We are organized in exactly the same manner as Blue Cross plans, so we should receive the same tax treatment under Federal law. This is not a special provision for a specific company. All we seek is fair, equitable treatment."

YESTERDAY
President Clinton had the Democratic leaders over to the White House to plan their push for the health care plan, and 50 of the nation's largest corporations gave a boost to the proposal by supporting coverage paid by employers.
 
WHITE HOUSE
The Democratic leaders of the Senate and House met with President Clinton and declared that they were ready to push forward with legislation to guarantee health insurance to every American. Earlier, the Clinton Administration got the kind of support it had been seeking for some time when a coalition of major corporations argued in favor of employer-paid health insurance. The companies urged Congress to pass "comprehensive health care reform that provides for universal coverage through shared employer responsibility." The 50 corporations included Ford, Chrysler, General Motors, H. J. Heinz, Bethlehem Steel, I.B.M., Manpower Inc., Giant Food, Champion International, Time Warner and Westinghouse.
 
CONGRESS
Members of Congress have tucked into health care legislation various provisions that are intended to benefit specific hospitals, drug makers and insurance companies. In New York, for example, Representative Charles B. Rangel, the Manhattan Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, has secured millions of dollars in assistance for New York Hospital on the Upper East Side.
 
LOBBYISTS
The health care legislation probably involves the largest amount of money ever spent on lobbying and the greatest number of former Congressmen and former executive branch officials working on behalf of various organizations, according to a study by a research group. "We believe that health care reform has become the most heavily lobbied legislative initiative in United States history," said Charles Lewis, the executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, which conducted the study.

HEADLINE: Upsala College Decides to Stay Open

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: EAST ORANGE, N.J., July 21

 BODY:
Debt-burdened, its enrollment shrinking, its accreditation slated to be revoked, its faculty unpaid for a month, Upsala College will nevertheless remain open for at least another semester while the 100-year-old college looks for a way to solve its financial crisis.
The decision to stay open was one of three choices before the Board of Trustees today; the others were to close outright or to reopen in the fall without a freshman class. In a unanimous decision, the trustees chose a very difficult path. It depends on reducing enrollment further, from last year's 1,000 to 600 this fall, cutting course offerings, reducing salaries of the faculty and reassigning teachers to administrative positions, and hoping that the state will come up with money to save the school. 
 In any case, today's decision will take Upsala (pronounced UP-suh-luh) only through the end of the year -- unless the college finds a new source of money or a way to refinance its crushing debt.
 
Cheering May Be Premature
 A large group of summer students and faculty members cheered today when the Dean of the Faculty, Warren Funk, announced the decision to remain open.
"I must be very clear," he said, "that the plan that has been adopted will require a very austere budget and considerable sacrifices from all, sacrifices that we may not all want to cheer as this plan works its way out."
Already, Dr. Funk said, the college's administrative staff has been cut from 70 to 40, and 14 custodial positions have been eliminated. The annual payroll of the college is about $5 million.
Today's decision comes at the end of several years of mixed fortunes for the college, which is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America. The college survived a drastic plunge in enrollment in the 1980's, and reached a low of 475 full-time undergraduates in 1990, less than a quarter of its peak enrollment in 1950, when Upsala was crowded with returned World War II veterans studying on the G.I. Bill.
Fearful that many students would avoid a college with an enrollment less than 1,000, Upsala undertook a vigorous campaign to increase student numbers and brought enrollment up to just over 1,000 today, a figure reached in part by increasing the minority enrollment from surrounding urban communities in northern New Jersey.
Although Upsala, founded here in 1893, was built on the style of a small rural campus, the urban sprawl of northeastern New Jersey has grown up around the college since World War II. Today, the streets off Prospect Street, which cuts through the campus, are decayed and stained with graffiti; here and there, a once-grand house stands boarded up.
As the area around Upsala crumbled, so did the attachment of the oldest, and most prosperous alumni.
 
Borrowing at High Interest
 "Our alumni are disaffected with the campus," said Frederick H. Jarvis, a retired insurance executive who is chairman of the trustees. "They remember East Orange from the days when it was the all-American city, and they don't find that here anymore."
Partly to make the college more attractive to visitors and prospective students, Upsala also borrowed about $12 million in the 1980's for long-deferred maintenance in classrooms and dormitories.
It was the debt, at high interest rates, that eventually brought the college low. Creditors were unwilling to refinance the debt, and several other campuses that were approached as possible partners for Upsala -- Dr. Funk would not say which ones, or how many -- refused to make cooperative agreements with the college until its debt problem was solved.
"We tried to get our debt restructured," Dr. Funk said, "but it seems every time we got close to success something would happen to stop us from consummating the restructuring, until our string finally ran out."
Last winter, the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools warned Upsala that its precarious finances put its accreditation in jeopardy. On June 13, the college told its faculty that it could not afford to meet its payroll after June 30, and last week, the accreditation agency formally notified Upsala that its accreditation would be revoked Dec. 31. If that happened, any credits granted by the college would not be honored by any other accredited undergraduate or graduate program.
Upsala College has been appropriated $1.1 million in annual aid from the state for the 1994-95 fiscal year under a program of support for private colleges in New Jersey. $400,000 of that amount has already been paid, with the balance due in December. The college hopes that the state will pay out the additional aid money by next week.
 
No Pay Since June 30
 "If they do not," Dean Funk said, "our contingency plan has the faculty and staff essentially going without pay for the six or seven weeks until students arrive for the fall."
In any case, the college will appeal any loss of accreditation, and would retain accreditation during the appeal, said Debbie Kotch, the director of information for the college, who like everyone else on the campus has not been paid since June 30.
"I consider myself basically a volunteer," Ms. Kotch said. "You've got to keep the faith."
While the trustees deliberated in the Agnes Wahlstrom College Center, members of the faculty liaison committee were poring over staffing lists and payrolls in an effort to produce a plan of survival.
 
One Semester at a Time
 Upsala faculty salaries, at less than $35,000 a year for a tenured full professor, are already low by regional college standards. Members of the committee said they were prepared to work for less, or work longer and harder for the same amount. Both the teachers and the administration agree that there will have to be reductions in the faculty.
"We have some options," said Lincoln Brown, a mathematics and computer sciences professor and a member of the Liason Committee. "Staying open for another semester gives us another semester to try to make something happen."
For the students, however, the prospect of losing the college is daunting. John Mack is a 32-year-old junior in theology; his undergraduate fees are being by the Lutheran Seminary of Philadelphia on a program that would send him to the seminary and eventual ordination as a Lutheran minister.
"Sure, I could always go to another Lutheran college," he said. "But I'm married, my wife works, so having to move would really put a damper on things for me."

HEADLINE: Affordable Home Survey

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
Despite slightly higher mortgage rates during the first quarter, housing remained affordable in many areas of the country, particularly in the Midwest and South, a builders group said today.
"Although there are many places where affording a home is out of reach for many families, the low mortgage interest rates that we have been enjoying for nearly a year make housing more affordable everywhere," said Tommy Thompson, president of the National Association of Home Builders, which conducted the check. 
 Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.56 percent during the January-March period, up from 7.27 percent the previous three months, the association said. Mortgage rates were in the double digits during most of the 1980's.
The Housing Opportunity Index measures the ability of a typical family to purchase a home in its own market by comparing median family income with median home price. The median income nationally was $39,900 in the first quarter and the median home price was $112,000.
"Regional trends remained steady, with the most affordable markets found primarily in the Midwest and in the South, and the least affordable markets mostly in the West, particularly California, and the Northeast," the group found.
The Vineland-Millville-Bridgeton, N.J., area topped the index with a 95.6 score. The area, about 40 miles southeast of Philadelphia, replaced Jackson, Mich., as the most affordable.
San Francisco remained the least affordable market, a position it has held since the Home Builders began the studies in the first quarter of 1991.

Treasury Prices Mixed Amid Rate Uncertainty

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday as investors awaited a move by the Federal Reserve on interest rates. Remarks on Wednesday by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, led investors to conclude that another rate increase was imminent.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged yesterday at 8424/32 to yield 7.54 percent. Prices of short-term and intermediate securities fell. Bond yields are not expected to make any pronounced changes in direction "until we get rid of the uncertainty of the Fed move," said Jerry Harris, who manages $600 million at First Alabama Bank. 
 Notes and bills may seesaw as "short-term traders buy the dips and sell the rallies," he said, based on conflicting notions of slower growth and rising inflation, which diminishes bonds' value. "It's going to be choppy," he added.
 
Big Offerings Are Coming
 Notes also fell yesterday because most investors expect "rates will have to go higher to underwrite the supply that's coming," said Marcello Frustaci, a bond trader at Daiwa Securities America.
In the next three weeks, the Treasury is expected to sell as much as $85.75 billion of securities with maturities of up to 30 years, according to Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J. In yesterday's auction, the Treasury sold $16.89 billion of one-year bills at an average rate of 5.20 percent, the highest since 5.26 percent in September 1991.
In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday, Mr. Greenspan said it was an "open question" whether the agency's tightening to date had been sufficient to head off inflation.
Mr. Greenspan's comments killed the bond market's biggest rally in three months. Many analysts interpreted his remarks to mean that the Fed would raise rates, perhaps by as much as 50 basis points and as early as mid-August. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making committee, meets on Aug. 16.
Mr. Greenspan testifies before a House subcommittee today in the second leg of the Fed's semiannual testimony on monetary policy.
 The central bank may raise rates by a quarter-point next month, said Marilyn Schaja, money market economist at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation, "depending on the next employment report and consumer price index." The Government will release reports on July employment on Aug. 5 and on July consumer prices on Aug. 12.
If the Fed raises rates again, long-bond prices could still rise, she said.
Higher rates would help choke off any incipient inflation, which recent reports show is subdued.
Even so, she said, "a lot of deterioration in bonds has been because of the dollar," which has fallen 10 percent against the German mark and 12 percent against the Japanese yen this year.
The bond's yield could fall to 6.75 percent to 7 percent because higher rates support the dollar, she said.
 
Philadelphia Fed Report
 In economic reports yesterday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said prices for raw materials and finished goods rose this month as economic growth slowed in the Philadelphia area. The Philadelphia survey's price index for raw materials rose to 36.4 from 28.7 in June, while the index for prices received for manufactured goods increased to 15.8 from 11.0.
The report of higher prices echoed Mr. Greenspan's comments yesterday that inflation might accelerate, economists said.
"The prices-paid figures suggest that there are some price pressures built in at the producer level," said Ward McCarthy, economist at Stone & McCarthy.
Even so, the bond market "is too concerned about Greenspan's testimony" to pay attention to any single indicator, said Elias Bikhazi, money market economist at Deutsche Bank Government Securities.
 Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of one-year bills:

HEADLINE: Soros in Call To Cooperate

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
George Soros, the billionaire financier, urged leading nations today to agree on a system of economic coordination to help stabilize currency rates.
"We are in a very serious situation not only in the monetary field, but politically also," Mr. Soros told reporters at an international conference here. 
 He said the collapse of the Soviet Union had robbed the United States and its allies of a reason to stay together, raising the chances of nationalism and beggar-thy-neighbor policies.
"The collapse of the Soviet system could easily lead to the collapse of the free world," Mr. Soros said.
"The important thing is you have to recognize that there is a need for cooperation," he said. "It can be very subtle and not announced.
"All exchange rate systems are flawed. They work for a while and then they break down. So you have to be constantly flexible and adjust the system." But, he said, "we need to have a system."

HEADLINE: Donald Turner, Lawyer for U.S. And Writer, 73

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Dr. Donald Frank Turner, a legal scholar and economist who was the Government's chief antitrust lawyer in the Johnson Administration, died on Tuesday in a nursing home in suburban Washington. A Washington resident, he was 73.
The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, his family said. 
 Dr. Turner was appointed Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965. During his three years in the post, he became known as a strong enforcer of the antitrust laws. He also established a set of guidelines for mergers in the private sector.
He argued that antitrust laws should not block natural economic growth, although they should be used to keep business concentrations within bounds. As he once put it, "Substantial competitors can't merge."
Dr. Turner took the office as a scholar well versed in both the law and economics. In his view, a corporation's being large was not necessarily an evil in itself, and he advocated always giving first consideration to the economic consequences of an antitrust move by the Government.
Born in Chippewa Falls, Wis., the son of a Presbyterian minister, he worked his way through Northwestern University. He served in the South Pacific as a lieutenant in the Navy during World War II before receiving a doctorate in economics from Harvard University and a law degree from Yale University.
He was a law clerk to Justice Tom Clark of the Supreme Court and joined the faculty of Harvard University Law School in 1954 as an assistant professor. He was appointed a full professor in 1957.
He was the author, with Carl Kaysen, of "Antitrust Policy: An Economic and Legal Analysis," published in 1959. The book won esteem as a legal and economic examination of the country's antitrust laws. He returned to Harvard after his stint in Washington and was the co-author of a five-volume treatise on antitrust law and policy, "Antitrust Law," published in 1980.
He retired in 1979 as Harvard's Bussey Professor of Law. After that, he was counsel to the Washington firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering, a visiting professor at Georgetown University Law Center and a fellow at the Brookings Institution.
Dr. Turner is survived by his wife of 38 years, Joan Pearson Turner; a son, Paul A., of Washington; a daughter, Katherine T. Alen of Lynnfield, Mass.; two brothers, John P., of Hudson, Wis., and W. Bard, of Lexington, Mass., and a sister, Elizabeth T. Hall of New Haven.

HEADLINE: Buyouts in the Heart of Texas

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DALLAS, July 21

 BODY:
The Texas banks might all be owned by people in New York, Charlotte, N.C., and Columbus, Ohio. The department stores, long ago swallowed by national chains, have few remaining regional distinctions. But Thomas O. Hicks will gladly testify that one thing in business here has not changed. Texans still like to do deals with Texans.
As controlling partner in the Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst leveraged buyout firm here, Mr. Hicks makes a decent living (estimated net worth, $150 million) by not being from New York. 
 Donald J. Carter, the multimillionaire owner of Home Interiors and Furnishings, a giant household-items company, first thought that selling control to a leveraged buyout firm meant dealing with one of the Gordon Gekko types from back East. Around here, Mr. Carter is best known for showing up in a white cowboy hat to cheer on his own professional basketball team, the Dallas Mavericks.
 
A Gift, Then a Deal

 
 So it made good sense for Mr. Carter's investment banker to introduce him to Tom Hicks. Mr. Hicks, whose firm owns the company that makes more than 80 percent of the nation's cowboy hats, began by presenting Mr. Carter with a top-of-the-line Stetson.
"You are Dallas's most visible western hat wearer," Mr. Hicks told him. "We want you to wear one of our products."
A couple of months later, Mr. Carter wore his new white hat to the meeting that put the final touches on a $1 billion deal, announced last week, that is Hicks, Muse's largest yet. No other firm that does leveraged buyouts -- financing the acquisition of corporations largely through debt -- was even given a shot.
Hicks, Muse partners, all of whom are Texans, say that the majority of their deals still come through their Texas connections. With sellers like Mr. Carter, for whom leveraged buyouts still reek of ruinous machinations on faraway Wall Street, the firm's four partners have had to do more disarming than the United Nations' peacekeeping forces.
Including the Home Interiors deal, Hicks, Muse has made $4.3 billion in acquisitions since the firm's founding in 1989, among them the G. Heileman Brewing Company, which happens to make Lone Star beer. That doesn't count another few billion in deals by a predecessor firm, Hicks & Haas, where Mr. Hicks was co-chairman.
A first investment fund of $255 million is likely to far surpass a goal of 40 percent gross annual returns, giving outside investors 28 percent at the very least. A second fund has already passed its goal of raising $500 million by the end of the year.
"It seems like Hicks, Muse is doing a better job of screening, getting to, executing and closing deals than anyone in the country," Richard Rainwater, a Fort Worth investor, said.
Hicks, Muse partners say that being based away from New York is essential to the company's success, not to mention their sanity.
"For people in the heartland -- the Midwest and the South -- they click better with us than with some guy with a yellow tie and slicked-back hair from New York City," said John R. Muse, the firm's co-founder. Sitting in the Dallas Country Club's 19th Hole lounge last weekend, in golf shirt and shorts, he pantomimed an antsy New Yorker straightening his tie and smoothing back his hair. "We're just regular guys," he said.
Not that the guys at Hicks, Muse revive the tired old caricature of the Texas wheeler-dealer -- the one who bought and sold on gumption, instinct and Jack Daniels. The Hicks, Muse partners come equipped with computer spreadsheets, M.B.A.'s and resumes that include the New York offices of Morgan Guaranty, CS First Boston and Morgan Stanley.
If the Texas economy might have once seemed independent, now the fortunes of Tom Hicks, John Muse and almost everyone else here rely heavily on outside investors.
Mr. Hicks travels the nation to find investors like General Electric, Bankers Trust and the state pension funds of California, Oregon, Michigan and Wisconsin. He recruited his old friend from the University of Texas, Charles W. Tate, a former Morgan Stanley managing director, to open what amounts to a Hicks, Muse consulate in New York. The firm's fourth partner, Jack D. Furst, came with Mr. Hicks from the previous firm.
 
Rebuttal From New Yorkthe East

 
 Some New York rivals see only a twang's difference between what they do and what Hicks, Muse does. They, too, work their networks to generate and capture their own deals.
Thomas C. Franco, a spokesman for the Clayton, Dubilier & Rice buyout firm in New York, said that of three major acquisitions the firm has made since December, two remained exclusive and the third initially had been. "The Hicks, Muse model is a successful model -- and one that Clayton, Dubilier & Rice has employed since 1978," Mr. Franco said.
The decor at Hicks, Muse's Dallas headquarters suggests a style having more to do with imperial 19th-century France than regular-guy Texas. Swag curtains, inlaid furniture with gilt serpents slithering along the edges -- it's as if the Hicks, Muse partners had backed up some pickup trucks to Napoleon and Josephine's yard sale.
But in some quarters here, a distinctive approach to business survived the collapse of the region's real estate, energy and banking industries in the 1980's. Even in New York, Mr. Hicks, who is 48, sometimes shows up in boots (great for middle-age fallen arches, he says) and a cowboy hat, with an Armani suit. When he needed someone to run a new $250 million real estate partnership with the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette investment bank of New York, Mr. Hicks turned back to Dallas to hire David B. Deniger, who worked here as chief executive of the GE Capital Corporation's real estate arm.
In Texas, he is becoming one of the state's most powerful business people. Gov. Ann Richards, seeking advice on what to do with the $7 billion investment pool that supports the University of Texas system, named him to the system's board of regents earlier this year -- even though he had given $25,000 to the campaign of her Republican foe.
Now Mr. Hicks, although a Republican, is finance chairman for Richard Fisher's Democratic campaign to unseat Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson. Mr. Fisher is to his liking as a fiscal conservative, Mr. Hicks explained. Besides, Mr. Fisher lives next door in Highland Park, a executive enclave near downtown Dallas.
If New York's business leaders usually disperse at day's end, to city co-ops or distant suburbs, most of those in Dallas live within a 15-minute drive of each other. They are more likely to take part in political, civic and social groups, developing ties that reach across industries. Ability with a balance sheet matters, but so does ability with a hunting rifle or golf club.
Mr. Hicks (handicap 16, and impatient to get lower) and the managers of his corporate investments sometimes meet in the morning, then tee off in the afternoon. This Sunday, it's the Castle Pines course, near Denver.
At breakfast recently in Dallas, Mr. Hicks, who is 6 feet 3 inches tall, shambled up in jeans and hiking boots. Later that day, he said, he planned to explore the hiking trials at the gathering of business leaders and other big shots at the Bohemian Grove near Guerneville, Calif., where he was invited for the first time.
 
Three Simple Guidelines

 
 The payoffs of the Hicks, Muse approach -- no hostile deals, thank you -- come not only in clinching the purchases. They also avoid what the partners privately call "drunken sailor" prices. Mr. Muse has three messages for investment bankers trying to shop companies around: "We don't do auctions. We don't do auctions. We don't do auctions."
If Mr. Carter had opened up the bidding to other buyout firms, Mr. Muse said, "He probably could have gotten more." Although Mr. Carter set and won a take-it-or-leave-it price well above what Hicks, Muse had offered, he agrees.
"We did not put ourselves up for auction," Mr. Carter said. His mother had founded the company in 1957, and he and his children, who will own 49 percent of the company, wanted to remain involved. "This was much like a marriage with us," he said. "I don't think a bride likes to be auctioned off."
Mr. Carter certainly wanted his company to have a wealthy groom. But he also wanted one about whom he could sleep soundly after his evening prayers. "If I pray on it and I don't sleep well that night, forget it," Mr. Carter said.
Though Mr. Carter hadn't known Mr. Hicks well, he had no trouble talking with several mutual friends who did before he even let Mr. Hicks in the door. He respected Mr. Hicks for reviving, through his previous firm, the company that makes Dr Pepper, a hometown favorite.
At the first meeting, Mr. Carter asked mostly about family, friends and background. Receiving the Stetson -- "He knew how to get my attention" -- and hearing Mr. Hicks talk about his own six children from two marriages, strengthened Mr. Carter's inclination to sell locally.
"In the N.B.A., I've dealt with people from all over the country,' said Mr. Carter, the Mavericks owner. "But if you give me a choice, I'm going to take care of my own backyard first. Because Dallas took care of me before New York or L.A."

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Profit Far in Excess Of Estimates

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
I.B.M. surprised Wall Street yesterday with second-quarter earnings far in excess of analysts' estimates, attributing the gain primarily to cost reductions. It was was the third consecutive profitable quarter for I.B.M. after a long series of losses.
I.B.M. shares were buoyed by the news, surging $6.50 to close at $62.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Analysts said the results indicated that the International Business Machines Corporation was making progress on its path to recovery, and that the outlook for the second half of the year was bright. But while lower costs and repeated profits have lifted earnings for now, analysts said it remained unclear whether I.B.M. could generate the significantly higher revenue that would sustain long-term growth.
 
What Is Still Uncertain
 "The revenues have to pick up, the strategy has to pay off, and that's the part you don't have visibility on yet," said Steven Milunovich, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company.
For the quarter, I.B.M. had earnings of $689 million, or $1.14 a share, compared with a loss of $8 billion in the second quarter of 1993, when the company took charges to cover job cuts and a corporate reorganization.
Revenue for the most recent quarter was $15.35 billion, an increase of 2.7 percent over $14.95 billion in the comparable period last year. The comparison with 1993 was adjusted so as not to include revenue from I.B.M.'s Federal Systems Company, which it sold at the beginning of 1994.
"I'm pleased with our continued progress," Louis V. Gerstner Jr., I.B.M.'s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. "We are still far from where we need to be, but we are showing steady improvement."
I.B.M. said expenses fell 18 percent in the quarter compared with the period a year earlier as a result of continued focus on expense cutting, work force reduction and plant consolidation.
Last July, I.B.M. announced plans to reduce its expenses $7 billion by 1996, compared with 1992. Yesterday the company raised the target, saying it now planned to cut costs $8 billion. By the beginning of this month, I.B.M. said, it was more than halfway toward this goal, having reduced expenses by $4.8 billion.
Jerome York, the chief financial officer, indicated in a telephone interview how the company had been able to move ahead of plans on expense cuts. "We had budgeted to take out $3 billion this year so we would expect we would have done $1.5 billion by now, and we did $2 billion," he said.
 
Sales Strongest in Asia
 While I.B.M.'s hardware sales were flat in the United States, Europe and Latin America, the Asia-Pacific area showed a gain of 14 percent, despite the recession in Japan.
In its mainframe line, I.B.M. said demand exceeded supply in the second quarter, although mainframe revenue declined from last year's period as a result of price reductions.
Daniel Mandresh, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, estimated that I.B.M.'s mainframe sales, excluding software and support, would decline to $5.4 billion for all of 1994, down from $6.8 billion in 1993. That compares with about $10 billion in 1992 and $11 billion in 1991, he said.
Mr. Mandresh expects total revenue this year to be flat, at $63 billion. "The legacy is in the mainframe but the leverage is not," he said. More and more, he said, I.B.M. should not be looked at so much as a maker of mainframes or personal computers but as a provider of a full line of information technology products.
 
PC Sales Decline in U.S.
 Although the company did not provide figures, it said personal computer sales, its single-largest product category, were up from last year's second period. But the numbers were below the company's expectations, and the growth came entirely from international sales. In the United States, I.B.M.'s sales of PC's declined.
Mr. York said the company misjudged demand for its personal computers and produced too many of some models and too few of others. I.B.M., which now has more than half a dozen lines of personal computers, said it would simplify this lineup. "We ended up with so much product complexity that it almost became impossible for our customers to understand the lineup," Mr. York added.
While analysts expressed some concern that the company's work-force reductions had not proceeded as rapidly as planned, Mr. York said this was not a serious issue. In the second quarter, staffing was reduced 8,000, after a cut of 3,000 in the first quarter, part of its plan to reduce employees by more than 35,000 in 1994. Mr. York said the company still had about 20,000 to go to reach a goal of 215,000 employees.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
U.S. Intensifies Effort to Talk the Dollar Up

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration intensified its public campaign today to talk up the value of the dollar, declaring that a higher dollar had crucial benefits for the American economy and that another slide in the American currency would slow global growth.
The President's top economic adviser, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, also said that the White House would not object to another quarter-point increase in short-term interest rates before the end of this year, a move that could bolster the declining currency. 
 The remarks by Ms. Tyson and Lawrence H. Summers, the Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs, came a day after Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman hinted strongly that another interest rate increase was likely and gave a strong boost to the dollar, which rose sharply today against the German mark and inched higher against the Japanese yen.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5927 marks, up 1.8 percent from 1.5650 marks on Wednesday, and at 99.20 yen, up from 98.80 yen.
Currency traders said that the Administration's repeated message -- that it does not want to see a weaker dollar in order to club Japan over the head on trade, and that the fundamentals of the American economy do not justify further dollar selling -- may finally be getting through to the markets.
"We believe a renewed decline of the dollar would be counterproductive to global recovery," Mr. Summers told the Senate Banking Committee. In contrast, he added, "a strengthening of the dollar against the yen and mark would have important economic benefits for the United States." He said, "It would restore the confidence in financial markets that is important to sustaining recovery."
Mr. Greenspan told the committee on Wednesday that a weak dollar could fuel inflation in the United States. He signaled that another quarter- to half-point increase in interest rates was likely in order to dampen inflationary pressures and indirectly support the American currency, by making it more attractive to investors to keep dollars in American banks.
Ms. Tyson, the head of the Council of Economic Advisers, echoed that view today, telling reporters that there was room for a quarter-point increase in long- and short-term interest rates by the end of the year, without much risk of sapping economic growth.
 
'Room for Some Increase'
 "Our forecast is consistent with a 25-basis-point increase in short- and long-term rates," she said. Ms. Tyson said an examination of the Administration's economic forecast released last week showed "there actually is room for some increase before year's end."
Only two weeks ago, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen declared that he did not think any increase in interest rates was justified at this time. Although Ms. Tyson was circumspect about the appropriate timing of the next rate increase, the fact that she affirmed that another rate rise was legitimate within the next five months would certainly make Mr. Greenspan's decision easier.
The comments by Mr. Summers and Ms. Tyson the day after Mr. Greenspan's testimony were the most pronounced effort by the Administration to persuade the financial markets that the White House and the Federal Reserve are in harmony and that the Administration does not secretly covet a weaker dollar. Some investors interpreted the Administration's willingness to let the dollar drop earlier this year as an intentional move, aimed at putting pressure on Japan to open some of its closed markets.
But while the Administration is trying to talk up the dollar, it has also indicated that it is not willing to take other steps now, like heavy central bank intervention, to support the American currency.
 
Message 'Getting Through'
 The Administration "is defending the dollar and that is important as compared to where they were earlier," said Scott Pardee, chairman of Yamaichi International (America) Inc. a leading currency trader. "Their message is gradually getting through. Traders are still leery, though, that someone in the Administration, either consciously or unconsciously, will link the exchange rate with trade negotiations with Japan."
Mr. Pardee said his company had seen "a little bit of buying" of American securities by Japanese investors in the last few days, which suggests that "they think the dollar is oversold." At least, he added, there is now more of a difference of opinion in the markets about the future direction of the American currency -- with fewer people thinking it could only go down -- and "this may be enabling the dollar to stand on its own two feet." There is certainly a logic to the Administration's argument for a strong dollar: If the American currency continues to erode in value, foreigners will be less willing to invest in dollar-denominated assets in the United States and they will be less willing to buy American Treasury notes needed to finance the deficit at reasonable interest rates.
At the same time, a weaker dollar fuels inflation to some degree, because it takes more dollars for Americans to buy imported cars from Japan or chemicals from Germany. When import prices go up, American producers of similar products feel less competitive pressure to hold down their prices.
A stronger dollar "would boost the attractiveness of U.S. assets and the incentive for longer-term investment in the economy, and help to keep inflation low," Mr. Summers said.
Since early January, the dollar has fallen 13 percent against the yen to a 50-year low and 8 percent against the mark.
 
Speculators' View
 In recent weeks, the financial markets have not really paid much attention to Administration declarations, because speculators have looked at the huge trade surpluses run up by Japan, as well as the weak Government in Tokyo that seems unable or unwilling to do anything about those surpluses. They have concluded that even if American officials are telling the truth -- that they don't want a weaker dollar -- the only way to deal with Japan's huge surplus is by devaluing the American currency against the yen.
In addition, the Germans have made clear that they have no interest in joining further interventions to prop up the American currency, and the German central bank signaled today that it was not going to be lowering interest rates any time soon -- a move that would likely strengthen the dollar against the mark.
The Bundesbank president, Hans Tietmeyer, said that until the central bank gained further evidence that German inflation and the money supply were under control it was going to put a four-week hold on interest rate reductions.

HEADLINE: Banks Are Warned on Derivatives

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
Citing some banks' heavy losses from risky investments, a senior bank regulator issued a legal warning to the industry today that many banks should avoid the potentially volatile securities known as structured notes.
Structured notes are debt securities that make payments based on various indexes of interest rate, options or contracts that lock in future interest rates. These notes are derivatives, which are financial securities that are based on prices in other markets and may be subject to big fluctuations in value. 
 Today's warning was the latest sign of regulatory concern about the extent to which community banks and other small financial institutions may be speculating in derivatives with little understanding of the risks.
 
Aimed at Small Banks
 The regulator who issued today's warning, Douglas E. Harris, a senior deputy comptroller of the currency, said that while the warning went out to all of the nation's 3,300 federally chartered banks, it was mainly aimed at smaller banks.
One bank with $80 million in assets lost a quarter of its $8 million in equity from a bad investment in structured notes, Mr. Harris said. He refused to identify the institution, adding that it still met Federal standards for capital adequacy.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which is part of the Treasury Department, is still trying to calculate industrywide losses from derivatives, Mr. Harris added.
"We have some significant losses, but not substantial losses -- nothing large enough to imperil the capital of a bank," he said.
Mr. Harris sent an official advisory letter to the chief executive of each of the 3,300 federally chartered banks. These letters, which carry close to the force of regulation, are rare -- today's is only the second that the comptroller has issued this year.
"Because of the risks involved and the difficulty in assessing those risks, some types of structured securities are inappropriate investments for most national banks," Mr. Harris wrote in his letter.
Federal bank regulators have consistently told Congress this year that they do not see a need for additional legislation to control speculation in derivatives with federally insured deposits, saying that they have more flexibility if they deal with institutions individually, using their powers to declare some banking practices to be sound and others to be unsound.
The comptroller's office oversees these institutions, which hold 60 percent of the assets in United States commercial banks.
State regulators oversee state-chartered banks, and have varying rules on the extent to which the institutions they regulate can invest in volatile securities.
Diane M. Casey, the executive director of the Independent Bankers Association of America, a trade group here that represents small banks, said that the comptroller's warning was needed. Despite public attention on derivatives since the sharp drop in bond markets last spring, securities firms continue to try to sell complex derivatives to community bankers who may not understand the risks, she said.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Rise

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for state jobless benefits shot up last week, the Government said today, but analysts shrugged off the sharp gain as attributable to temporary layoffs in the auto industry.
The Labor Department said new claims for state unemployment benefits in the week ended July 16 climbed to 392,000 from a revised 365,000 the prior week, putting them at the highest level since 408,000 in late January. 
 The number far exceeded Wall Street economists' forecasts of 358,000 new claims in the week.
The average climbed to 363,500 in the week ended July 16 from a revised 353,500 the prior week.

HEADLINE: The New, Wide-Open Restaurant District

BYLINE: By RUTH REICHL 

 BODY:
IT has taken 35 years, but Borough President Hulan E. Jack's idea has finally paid off.
On May 18, 1959, he persuaded the New York City Council to rename Fourth Avenue in his borough from 17th to 32d Street. Upgrading the street's name to Park Avenue South, he argued, would give the area a "psychological lift." Besides, he added, it wouldn't cost anything. 
 Mr. Jack would undoubtedly be pleased to know that Park Avenue South, whose only former claim to fame was Tammany Hall, has suddenly become the heart of the city's newest restaurant district. Eleven restaurants have opened in the blocks flanking Park Avenue South below 23d Street in the last 10 months, and at least three more are in the works.
It was bound to happen. Over the last decade the neighborhood has come to life as a center for publishing and advertising. New businesses have sprung up on all the side streets, and the Greenmarket at Union Square has attracted shoppers from all over Manhattan. The neighborhood has turned into a place where the hip and the harried come comfortably together. Nowhere is this more evident than at the casual, upscale Union Square Cafe, whose enormous success lured other restaurateurs into the area.
They liked what they found. The convergence of two major Manhattan arteries provides easy access. And the growth of night life in SoHo and TriBeCa has made the formerly forgotten Flatiron district suddenly seem central to people who live farther north. Mark Strausman, who has just opened Campagna on 21st Street, puts it this way: "At this location east meets west, north meets south and downtown meets uptown."
Economics also plays a part: rents are reasonable. "We get a lot more bang for the buck per square foot here," Mr. Strausman admits. Indeed, space is a neighborhood asset. Look in any window and you find expansive rooms with soaring ceilings.
The sheer sweep of the interiors has been inspirational. These big, bold spaces are now home to some of the city's most audacious culinary creations. If you are looking for the latest in American cooking, this is the right place.
 
Gramercy Tavern
42 East 20th Street, (212) 477-0777.
 A new room often has a wonderful buzz; at just under two weeks old, this one's got it. The air prickles with expectation. The people sitting at the tables and milling around the bar look proud of themselves just for being here. And why not? Reservations are already impossible to get and sitting in this dim, expensively casual room is fun. (Gramercy Tavern is booked through Aug. 22 and will not take reservations more than a month ahead.)
Millions have reportedly been poured into this collaboration of Danny Meyer of Union Square Cafe and Tom Colicchio of the former Mondrian, but to its credit it does not show. Already the room feels lived in. It would be easy to believe that Gramercy Tavern had been here for years, quietly accumulating the paintings on the walls. Each table has ample breathing room and the chairs seem built more for comfort than effect. If the waiters, in their understated Armani-designed clothes, don't quite know what they are doing, for the most part they hide it. Is the room noisy? A bit, but the sound never reaches shouting level.
The menu is exciting and while much of the food offers evidence that the kitchen staff is new, everything I ate was good. The meal began with a little slice of tomato on a Parmesan cracker drizzled with bright green basil oil; the flavors were intense and so delicious one bite filled the mouth with flavor. After that, my favorite dish was a large ricotta raviolo layered with the flavors of summer vegetables. Tuna tartar had a fabulous sea urchin vinaigrette that sent the taste of the fish shooting off in a new direction. Sauteed cod was served with a brandade and tomato confit so deliciously sweet that it transformed the dish. Perhaps the beans on the tuna were undercooked and the squab was served in a bowl that made it difficult to eat, but those things will undoubtedly improve as the restaurant matures.
Desserts were wonderful. I loved the peach tarte Tatin with sweet basil syrup and cracked-pepper ice cream. And the cherry salad with sour cherry sorbet was unusual, refreshing and just the thing for a summer night.
 
C. T.
11 East 22d Street, (212) 995-8500.
 What happens when the son of one famous French chef and the nephew of another, a man who worked at the Paul Bocuse and Taillevent restaurants in France, goes off to Brazil and falls in love?
This.
Claude Troisgros has opened one of the most impressive new restaurants of the year. If Trader Vic had been trained in classic French cuisine, he might have come up with something as sophisticated as this sleek, cool room where tropical ingredients collide with a French esthetic. The results are stunning: breast of duck on a passion fruit and apple puree, foie gras with caramelized daikon, ravioli filled with taro root and truffle oil.
In the hands of a minor chef, these combinations might be silly, but Mr. Troisgros works with extraordinary assurance. These foods join together in harmony. If the menu is sometimes flip, the restaurant is smoothly run; it is clear that Mr. Troisgros has big plans.
 
Patria
50 Park Avenue South, at 20th Street, (212) 777-6211.
 "I wish I had a little more finesse," Douglas Rodriguez once said. "Everything I do is big and exaggerated." True, but that's what we love about this chef.
Mr. Rodriguez is trying to change the way New Yorkers think about plantains and yuca and guava, taking them out of the realm of the ethnic and giving them star status. The former Positano has become a three-level Latin fantasy with a mosaic over the door and suave service. There are fabulous rum drinks, beer from seven countries, a wine list that wanders the world. And the menu is unlike any other in the city.
Oysters come with spinach, plantains, Manchego cheese and horseradish salsa. Oh, go ahead, try it. Lentils are served with bananas, a delicious notion. Empanadas come in six flavors; one is filled with lamb, raisins, peppers and onions and served on a spinach salad with mint. Not for the timid. Ditto the salmon, which is served on a bed of mashed blue potatoes. And when the chef touts "oxtail in a chilified red wine sauce," he is not talking about temperature.
The food is uneven but always interesting. Most of it is absolutely extraordinary, and unlike anything anyone has tasted before. You may be amazed or amused, but you will not be bored.
 
Cafe Beulah
9 East 19th Street, (212) 777-9700.
 Cafe Beulah takes you right to the country. It is so cozy and comfortable you find yourself listening for the chirping of crickets and imagining that if you stepped outside, a friendly dog would wander up and sniff your fingers.
A basket of Beulah's breads is the best way to prolong the illusion: this is the finest collection of corn bread and biscuits in the city. It goes well with a bottle of Voodoo beer.
Beulah's specialty is Low Country cooking; big food with big flavors. Baked ham is drenched with praline bourbon sauce, the smoky ham edging up against a painfully sweet sauce until your mouth is vibrating. The flavors are echoed in the lemon candied yams on the side.
There is a mean fried baby chicken with barbecued red beans. Hominy grits with smothered shrimp is so soft and soothing it is like savory cereal. And who else serves an appetizer of okra and barbecued shrimp, or a salad combining cabbage and apricots?
Best of all, this food is reasonable. If you stay away from the expensive house specials, you can eat a big meal for a price that makes you especially happy that Cafe Beulah has arrived on 19th Street.
 
Zen Palate
4 Union Square East, at 16th Street, (212) 614-9291.
 Zen Palate confirms a carnivore's worst fears about vegetarian restaurants: after spending a great deal of time and money in this extremely beautiful restaurant, I invariably leave hungry. It is the ultimate triumph of style over flavor.
The restaurant looks like a Zen temple, all calm, peaceful beauty. From the dining room on the second floor, patrons can look out over the trees of Union Square Park before reading the menu, a self-conscious construction of nubby brown paper tied up with a chopstick and red ribbon. But the dishes, which have names like jewel of happiness (mini-mushroom steaks with endive and sweet peas) and mushroom forest (minced shiitake mushrooms, soy bean protein, wheat gluten and pine nuts all wrapped in lettuce) are ultimately unsatisfying.
Those hoping to fill up on dessert are out of luck. A gelatinous mango pudding was one of the worst things I have ever tasted (although I did like the seaweed cracker chips that came with it), and just the thought of tofu cheesecake covered with a sticky, gooey blueberry sauce makes me shudder.
 
Metronome
15 Broadway, near 21st Street, (212) 505-7400.
 "Don't get mad at me," the waitress said when we asked, for the third time, for a bottle of mineral water.
And that was the high point of the evening.
Well, there was the moment when the waiter started doing magic tricks; he was really good, managing to turn a deck of blue cards into red ones and making watches appear and disappear at a dizzying rate.
If only he could have magically improved the food! But the meals I have eaten in the huge, expensively decorated room have not been impressive. Doughy rigatoni with broccoli rape and chunks of sausage, slimy baby chicken with a soy-and-peanut sauce, a "California spinach salad" sprinkled with mangoes and pecans.
"Isn't the food wonderful?" breathed our waiter as he finished his tricks. He really seemed to mean it.
 
Bolo
3 East 22d Street, (212) 228-2200.
 For sheer happy energy, few restaurants can beat Bolo. The restaurant is visually exciting, with edgy graphic collages on the wall and dizzy tiles around the oven. The food fits right in.
Flushed with the success of his Mesa Grill, Bobby Flay decided that he wanted to try cooking Spanish food. But he is not a chef who follows rules, so the food, like the decor, takes its cues from Spain without ever leaving Manhattan. The paella contains roasted duck and lobster; rice is cooked with curry, and the Bolo salad has so much cabrales cheese and chorizo that no Spaniard would recognize it as his own.
Does it matter? Not a bit. Bolo is a lively restaurant with exciting food that is always delicious. What should you try?
Fried squid with anchovy vinaigrette is terrific, and the steamed baby clams in green-onion broth are a joy. Grilled scallops are served on an intense pasta cooked in squid ink. At lunchtime there are terrific sandwiches, and caramel sorbet is a great dessert.
And deep in summer, that Sangria really hits the spot.
 
Campagna
4 East 21st Street, (212) 460-0900.
 It said a lot for the neighborhood when the pretentious Luxe was replaced by the eater-friendly Campagna. The room was stripped of its silly gold accents and repainted in rustic tones. On the tables, where flowers once were, vases filled with rosemary have appeared. And the menu, once so complicated the waiters had to explain it, now speaks for itself.
The best way to begin an urban rustic meal at Campagna is with a selection from the antipasto table, an appealing array of marinated and grilled vegetables, cheeses, sliced cured meats and salads. A plate would make a wonderful meal. But that would mean missing the terrific frito misto and all those appealing pastas.
At the moment, the restaurant is full and frantic. The chef and owner is Mark Strausman, whose many admirers have followed him from Coco Pazzo, thrilled that his food is now more affordable. When the hoopla dies down, this will probably mature into a wonderful restaurant.
 
Chutney Mary
0 East 20th Street, (212) 473-8181.
 It bills itself as "New York's first organic-Indian restaurant," but there are other attributes Chutney Mary might brag about. New York's first Indian restaurant with an indoor fountain, for instance, or New York's first Indian restaurant with a jungle. The latter is a remarkable creation made of murals, dripping water and plants; there are even a couple of fake mangoes hanging way up near the ceiling, inspiring a person to wonder if a couple of monkeys or parrots might not be appropriate additions.
After all that, the food is something of a letdown. The usual range of Indian fare includes pleasantly spicy samosas; a range of tandoori breads, meats and fish; a few quite spicy vindaloos. As befits an organic restaurant, the most interesting dishes turn out to be vegetarian: I was especially taken with one called silk and jewels, a fragrant mixture of spinach, homemade cheese and fresh spices.
 
City Crab and Seafood Company
35 Park Avenue South, at 19th Street, (212) 529-3800.
 Here comes the tray, piled high with festive red-clawed creatures. The waiter lifts it, angles it over the table and slides the crabs right onto the paper-covered surface. For the next half-hour, conversation stops.
Nothing is more fun than an old-fashioned Maryland crab boil; it takes the teeth and every one of the fingers to pry the sweet, recalcitrant meat from the shells. When you have finished, your hands are pleasantly prickly, your lips atingle with spices. What a good thing that there are so many fine beers on draft at the City Crab and Seafood Company!
The menu offers many other appealing options. Great clams and oysters, on the half shell, at reasonable prices. Good fresh fish (the tuna has been particularly impressive). Crisply roasted chicken. Fabulous fries served in big heaps.
Afterward? Key lime pie, of course. You may even find yourself leaning toward the next table and belting out a couple of bars of "Happy Birthday" when the staff gathers to toast one of the many revelers in the room. It's a perfect place for a party.
 
Park Avalon
25 Park Avenue South, near 19th Street, (212) 533-2500.
 Every neighborhood needs a place to hang out. In this part of town, Park Avalon provides it. The restaurant has something for almost every appetite at extremely reasonable prices. Nothing on the menu is more than $17.95, and most entrees are less than $15.
The huge high-ceilinged room is usually filled with a cross section of neighborhood people. Celebrities and hip young things mingle happily with the Gramercy Park crowd in the pleasingly casual space.
The menu offers hits of the 90's: Caesar salad, pizza, pasta, grilled chicken, roast chicken and so forth. In my experience it is best to stick with the basics; the more experimental dishes can be pretty silly. But nobody could quarrel with a chicken paillard served on a bed of garlicky mashed potatoes, or a generous bowl of penne with roasted tomato sauce.
The wine list is good and fairly priced. Desserts are impressive. There is even a daily diet dessert so delicious it is hard to believe its low-calorie claims.

HEADLINE: Restaurants

BYLINE: By Ruth Reichl 

 BODY:
Do you remember the scene in the movie "Gigi" in which the aging courtesan teaches her niece to eat ortolans? The bones of the tiny birds crackle horribly in the old lady's mouth but she remains the picture of elegant ease. Gigi, attempting to imitate her aunt, merely looks uncomfortable.
Every meal I have eaten at Les Celebrites has reminded me of that scene. Unfortunately, I am always Gigi.
The setting is undoubtedly what brings this to mind. No restaurant in New York so perfectly recreates another time and place. Les Celebrites is a precious Art Deco parlor, all lacquer and Lalique. To those who appreciate the opulence of that ebony and gold period, the intimate room with just 18 tables will seem the last word in luxury. Those who do not may find the atmosphere slightly suffocating. Personally, I always have the fear that when I sit back in those well-padded sofas my feet will not quite touch the floor. 
 Well-meaning waiters hover anxiously; they do not enliven the atmosphere. The dismay of our captain, who went hopping around the table one night trying to provide the correct cutlery as we passed our plates to taste one another's food, would have been comical had it not been so oppressive. At one point I actually found myself crossing knives with him as he snatched a fish knife away to replace it with the proper one for meat. He looked triumphant; I was embarrassed.
Yet another captain, on another visit, steadfastly refused to allow us to order a fish course between the appetizer and the entree. "Our portions are very large," he said firmly. "It will be too much for you." We persisted, he insisted. We finally gave up.
Another time our captain murmured approval of my choice of Ferrari-Carano, a rich California chardonnay. "I'm glad you like it," I replied, attempting irony. He drew back a bit. "Oh no," he said severely. "It is not a wine for me."
In this restaurant you must play by the rules. Stick to the proper cutlery, don't try to order too much and be grateful for wine advice, even if uninvited. You will be rewarded with some of the city's finest food. After a few forkfuls of foie gras, even the most anxious waiter fades into the background where he belongs.
Foie gras is one of the signatures of the chef, Christian Delouvrier, who piles it onto his plates with joyous abandon. He might plunk morsels onto a bed of baby pea sprouts and top them with a deep, dusky prune sauce as a tidbit to offer diners before they order. Or stuff fat slices of foie gras between rings of green apple and turn it into the world's most decadent burger. He hollows out an onion and fills it with a seductive mixture of foie gras, prosciutto and sweetbreads. Sometimes he just sautes the rich liver with fresh figs: when a dish is as simple as this one, the sheer generosity of the serving is heady.
Mr. Delouvrier can be equally cavalier with caviar. Once last winter he used caviar like mustard in a sauce for scallops and shrimp. The graininess of the roe was a treat and a surprise in a playfully delicious dish.
He is no more respectful of truffles, handling them as if they went for the price of potatoes. Rock shrimp ravioli arrive in a wild mushroom broth scented with truffle oil. The perfume of the dish is dizzying. And in truffle season, a small mountain of crushed potatoes arrived hidden beneath shaved black truffles; it was the most wildly indulgent dish I've had all year.
Even a simple salad of green beans becomes a luxury in Mr. Delouvrier's hands. In springtime the beans shared the plate with morels so large and so black they were shocking. Long after the morels had disappeared, their musky flavor was still echoing on the tongue.
The appetizers are a continuous kaleidoscope of surprises. Tomato consomme with scallops sounds unimpressive. But the soup is topped first with a scoop of icy tomato sorbet, then with a single leaf of fried basil. In this company, the sliced white scallops are mere threads in a tapestry of textures.
The wine list is equally impressive. It is tempting, faced with so many good choices, to succumb to the excesses of the room and decide that this is not the time to economize. But those who keep their heads will discover that a surprising percentage of the wines are affordable, especially to people willing to venture beyond Burgundy and Bordeaux. They will also find that if they ask for advice, it is reliable.
If only the entrees were as dependable. Many are. Honey-and-orange-lacquered duck, perfumed with coriander and cumin and served with a fig puree, is a reminder that Mr. Delouvrier once worked with the three-star French chef Alain Senderens. With its spicy medieval flavors, the duck is irresistible. Squab with garlic confit and wonderfully truffled polenta is rare, gamy, satisfying. Tiny chops and saddle of extraordinary lamb are served with sweet little tomatoes. And a special one night, the loin, saddle and rack of baby goat, was fine enough to revolutionize the image of that unlovable animal: surrounded with thyme, it was gently flavorful and absolutely tender.
But much of the fish is disappointing. Turbot is more notable for its vegetable mosaic of green asparagus, bright carrots, red and yellow beets and fava beans than for the flavor of the fish. Crispy-skinned salmon steak, ordered rare, is overcooked and the skin is nothing but a small oval on the side. Worse, the compote of leeks on which it sits is so salty that the masterly sauce, shot through with the flavor of grapes, is almost ruined. Strips of sole are large, rubbery, dull and salty. A special tuna is dry. The waiters standing by with worried looks make it all worse.
But when dessert appears, everyone relaxes. The sweets are a loving reminder of a time when calories were not counted. Sorbets arrive in an ornate chocolate basket, luxury within luxury. Ice cream is served in a tall chocolate "crocus" piled high with creamy chocolate, praline and caramel confections. An apple tart is still warm, its thin slices of fruit riding a gossamer crust; the Calvados ice cream obligingly takes its time melting across the top. And a perfect raspberry souffle collapses upon itself with a fragrant sigh of hot air.
Petits fours arrive with the coffee. They are arrayed around an arrangement of pulled sugar flowers. Each time, I find myself tempted to reach out and see what the flowers feel like. But then I see that the captain has his eye on me and I fold my hands meekly and place them in my lap.

HEADLINE: How Aid Makes Argentina's Poor Poorer

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"In Argentina, the Poor Seem to Get Poorer" (news article, July 7) observes that while President Carlos Saul Menem "has focused on macro-economic issues, he has neglected new social programs." You do not mention, however, that lending practices of such international institutions as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are as much to blame for the widening gap between rich and poor as the skewed economic policies of the Argentine President. 
 For years, these agencies promoted structural adjustment programs, which have contributed to the spectacular growth from which President Menem, their loyal servitor, has benefited. But while export sectors expanded and trade deficits shrank in the mid-1980's, poorer Argentines were getting squeezed when the international lending agencies imposed a fiscal austerity program as a precondition for rescheduling the country's burdensome debt payments.
To compensate for the reduction of social public spending in Argentina, the best the World Bank could do was to disburse $328 million to the Argentine health care, housing and other social sectors from 1985 to 1990, just 15 percent of total outlays to the country for that period. The International Monetary Fund doesn't even extend such loans to the "social sectors," preferring instead to remain institutionally blind to the poverty it helps create and sustain.
It is these giant lending institutions therefore, as much as Mr. Menem, that are primarily responsible for an earnings growth rate of -0.8 percent and public health expenditures that totaled only 4.2 percent of gross domestic product in 1990, the last year for which figures are available.
Even when the World Bank finances a project to ameliorate the living standards of Argentines, corruption and mismanagement transform it into a behemoth. After 15 years of loans, the vast Yacyreta Dam, constructed to supply water to Buenos Aires, is $7 billion over budget and still not completed. This figure does not include the enormous social cost of relocating 50,000 people and destroying four local ecosystems.
Washington, as the main sponsor of many of these lending projects, must be held at least indirectly accountable for the worsening condition of millions of Argentines. It is time for the United States, as the architect of the Bretton Woods system, to re-examine its blueprint for loan programs that merely pay lip service to perilous living conditions not only of millions of Argentines, but also of populations throughout most of the third world.

HEADLINE: As It Moves to Privatize Schools, Hartford Is Keeping Some Control

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 21

 BODY:
The Board of Education is preparing to hire a profit-making company to manage Hartford's 32 schools, although fierce opposition from teachers and questions about the financial arrangements have caused city officials to reject the company's bid to take nearly full control of the system.
The school board's vote, perhaps as soon as Friday, would make Hartford the nation's first city to hire a private manager for its entire school system. But instead of having wide latitude to squeeze millions in savings from the budget to pay for improvements to the city's troubled schools, the company, Education Alternatives Inc., will be given control over only a small part of the system's $171 million budget and will be asked to reorganize the schools from within, working with the bureaucracy that is acknowledging its own failure by hiring the company. 
 Board members who support hiring the company said the board was likely to insist on keeping control of hiring and firing and to require that its expensive contracts with teachers and other employees be respected. Education Alternatives, the Minneapolis-based company that runs 12 schools in Baltimore and one in the Miami area, will be allowed to revise the Hartford district's curriculum, retrain teachers, bring computers into classrooms and search for economies. But, under the board's latest proposal, the company will have to do so with approval by Hartford's school superintendent or the school board itself.
As cities across the country consider privatizing their schools to make better use of scarce resources, Hartford's experience shows how reluctant even the most desperate districts are to hand over control to companies that answer to stockholders instead of taxpayers.
In exchanging proposals, city and company officials have agreed that the company, over five years, would aim to raise standardized test scores and attendance rates by specific percentages. The board would be able to cancel the contract at any time.
The company has proposed that Hartford pay its expenses out of the savings the company hopes to find within the school budget. If after those expenses are paid, money is left over, those savings would be divided equally among the company, as its fee, the school board and the city. While neither side has estimated the potential savings, the company has projected its operating costs in the first year at $6 million. If it could not find that much in savings, it would have to bear those costs itself.
In a city that spends more per pupil than most of its suburbs yet achieves the worst academic results in the state, critics say they cannot see how the company will be able to accomplish more than the Board of Education with the same budget, while taking a profit.
"There's no question that Hartford's no different from any other large city," said the school board's chairman, William Meagher, one of only three people on the nine-member board who oppose private management. "Problems exist and we want do something about it. But I don't think sending millions to Minnesota is the way to go."
The company is a young publicly owned corporation whose stock soared after it won management and consulting contracts for 12 public schools in Baltimore in 1992. Its efforts to go citywide here have made Education Alternatives, as much as education itself, the focus of controversy. Education Alternatives has bet much of its corporate future on winning a districtwide contract.
Opponents have attacked not only its claims for improving the Baltimore and Miami schools but also its motives.
 
Helping the Balance Sheet?
 If the school board agreed to pay over its budget to Education Alternatives, for example, the result would not only be more control for the company, but an immense lift to the balance sheet it shows stockholders, since it could count that $171 million as its own revenue.
"We are aware that would build up their balance sheet, but we don't see how that would result in any improvement in the education of our kids," said Ted Carroll, a school board member who is one of the company's strongest defenders but who has been convinced that the company should not control the board's budget.
At its national convention this week, the American Federation of Teachers, which represents Hartford's teachers, called on districts not to sign contracts with the company.
"E.A.I. has lied about test results, shifted money from classroom instruction to overhead and profit, and denied services to special education and disadvantaged youngsters," said the federation's president, Albert Shanker.
 
Answering Some Challenges
 Education Alternatives said the company's record was being misrepresented. The test results in question did not involve standardized tests, the company said, but only its own monitoring of Baltimore students' progress on a computer curriculum that is central to the company's educational plan. The number of students reported to be progressing was overstated by mistake, the company said.
A spokeswoman for the company, Lory Sutton, said the company did spend extra money on repairing the Baltimore schools in the first year of its contract, but the repairs were needed and more money was now being shifted to instruction.
The charges involving the classroom assignment of special-education children, she said, were made by the Baltimore federation, and a state investigation found problems at only one school. The American Federation of Teachers opposes placing special-education students in regular classrooms, a practice known as mainstreaming that Education Alternatives favors.
The mounting attacks, combined with a softening of the company's Hartford prospects this month, drove down its stock price to a low of $9igh of $48.75, raising new concerns even for its supporters. The stock closed today at $13.625, up 12.5 cents.
 
'Need for Change'
 "I have no doubt that it's make or break for that corporation," said the Hartford City Council's majority leader, John B. O'Connell, who favors private management. "That's part of the concern. We're talking about a municipal operation, a no-risk kind of mental attitude over here, and we're concerned that we're going to turn over half our city budget to an entity that we're not sure of yet."
This week, however, a study by the accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand reassured city officials of Education Alternatives' financial health, and plans were proceeding for the school board to vote.
"The need for change hasn't changed," Mr. Carroll said. "A solid majority still feels there is a solid role for a private management company in helping us bring about those changes."
Ms. Sutton, the company's spokeswoman, said no one could say what Education Alternatives' role in Hartford would be until a contract was finally negotiated. But in its proposal to the city, the company said it was not interested in being a mere consultant.
"In our opinion," the company stated in its proposal, "you do not need yet another consultant advising you what to do. You need someone to do it!"
The school system's test scores have been falling while its dropout rate has been rising even as Connecticut has sent tens of millions in school aid to the capital city each year. Two thirds of the system's students come from poor families.
In a desegregation lawsuit that was heard last year, lawyers for Hartford schoolchildren argued that spending even more money on the city's schools would not insure equal educational opportunity because of the disadvantages posed by the district's intense poverty and racial segregation.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 26, 1994, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about a private company's efforts to win a contract to manage the public schools in Hartford misstated the position of the American Federation of Teachers on "mainstreaming," the placement of special-education students in regular classrooms. The union opposes a practice known as full inclusion, in which all such students are placed in regular classrooms regardless of the severity of their disabilities; it does not oppose all mainstreaming.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Paine Webber to Bail Out a Fund Battered by Complex Investments

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
The Paine Webber Group disclosed yesterday that it would spend $180 million to bail out a mutual fund battered by its holdings of the highly technical and often risky Wall Street securities called derivatives.
The rescue effort comes on top of $88 million the big brokerage firm spent last month to stabilize its mutual fund and to reimburse customers burned by what was advertised as a safe and secure investment. 
 The bailout, at $268 million, may be the largest ever in the rapidly growing mutual fund industry.
And it is the latest and sharpest example of the way Wall Street wizardry can go wrong -- and how derivatives can hurt ordinary Americans.
Derivatives are complex securities whose returns are based on -- or derived from -- other investments. In this case, these derivatives started life as everyday home mortgages that are lumped together and sold in pools to investors. But in Wall Street's derivative laboratories, they are diced and sliced and reassembled into what can turn out to be a Frankenstein's monster.
The Paine Webber story also raises fears among some analysts about what would happen if such a fiasco occurred at a firm that could not afford to cover investors' losses.
The money from the bailout announced yesterday will not go directly to investors. It is intended to shore up the value of the fund in an effort to stem its losses.
The Securities and Exchange Commission, which will rule on Paine Webber's rescue plan, is studying whether derivatives pose a pervasive problem in the $2.2 trillion fund industry. This is at least the fifth time this year a fund company has had to spend its own money to stabilize a fixed-income fund that had experienced enormous losses from derivatives. BankAmerica Corporation put money into its funds twice and Piper Jaffray Companies once.
Just last month, Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the S.E.C., wrote to the country's largest mutual funds to express his "continuing concern that mutual funds utilize derivative instruments wisely."
Barry Barbash, director of the commission's investment management division, echoed that concern yesterday. And he added: "This raises the broader question about what investors know about the funds in which they invest. It's a question of disclosure, which needs to be very tight."
The bailout will cost Paine Webber $34 million after taxes, which the company took as a charge in the second quarter, said Regina A. Dolan, the company's chief financial officer. That charge more than wiped out the company's earnings last quarter, leaving it with a loss of $25.1 million, or 35 cents a share.
The battered fund, the Paine Webber Short-Term U.S. Government Securities Fund, had been extremely popular with brokers and their clients because they were eager to earn more than the low interest rates available from safe certificates of deposit and money market funds. The fund, which opened for business in May 1993, quickly collected almost $2 billion from investors hunting for slightly higher returns.
But to get those returns, the fund's managers invested in derivatives called structured notes, because Wall Street created them -- structured them -- to meet specific investors' needs. Like a custom-tailored suit, however, such notes are hard to sell "off the rack."
New, highly technical and extremely complicated, most of these derivatives were created when interest rates were falling. After the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in February, however, these derivatives backfired and fell sharply in value. Even worse, no other investors wanted to buy them, despite the fire-sale prices.
 
Price Fell Sharply
 So far this year the Paine Webber fund is off more than 7 percent, far more than most other, similar funds. Shocked investors fled, pulling out hundreds of millions of dollars, and some filed a class action lawsuit contending that they had not been told of the fund's risky nature.
In June, Paine Webber agreed to settle that lawsuit and to spend $33 million, or 6 cents a share, to compensate fund investors for some of their losses from investments that firm officials agreed had been inappropriate. The company also spent $55 million to buy some other derivatives from the fund, thereby shoring up its value.
In yesterday's action, Paine Webber said it would buy another, larger holding of derivatives at the price at which the fund now values them. That price is far less than the fund paid for them, but more than the firm would be able to get for them on the open market.
The firm decided to take this action after it told regulators it could not get other securities firms to bid on these derivatives.
Paine Webber was pressed to act by Federal securities law, which bars mutual funds from investing more than 15 percent of their assets in securities that cannot be sold easily. By yesterday, these two derivatives accounted for almost 25 percent of the rapidly shrinking fund.
The company also replaced the fund's managers, who resigned earlier this week, with Pacific Investment Management Company, one of the top fixed-income money managers in the country. Paine Webber also named its president, Paul Guenther, to oversee directly its entire $26 billion mutual fund business.
Paine Webber said it was not legally obligated to buy the derivatives. "It sounds corny, but that mutual fund had the Paine Webber name on it, and our reputation is important to us," said Thomas F. Eggers, director of the fund group.
Lawyers for fund investors had been pressing Paine Webber to get rid of these troubled derivatives, and were pleased by yesterday's decision, said Sam Schwartz, a lawyer with Bizar & Martin. "They were a destabilizing factor," he said, adding, "This is good for investors."
However, regulators and executives of other fund companies expressed concern that the giant bailout might set a bad precedent by making investors think they will always be rescued from unwise investments, or by leaving the impression, already prevalent among some, that funds are insured in the same way that bank deposits are.
Indeed, some industry consultants have suggested that investors should stick with large fund companies because they are better able to afford to reimburse investors.
But Jon S. Fossel, chairman of the Oppenheimer Funds, disagreed. "What they should do is look at the track record of a fund and only buy ones where the fund has already been though a bad market," he said. "The best offense is a good defense."
Even excluding the one-time charge, Paine Webber's second-quarter earnings were below Wall Street's expectations. With the exclusion, they fell 85 percent, to $9.1 million, or 12 cents a share, from $59.3 million, or 69 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected Paine Webber to earn about 24 cents a share.
Still, Paine Webber's stock was unchanged yesterday at $16.375, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Paine Webber said its net revenues fell 15.7 percent, to $579 million in the second quarter, from $686.5 million.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE CAMPAIGN;
Clinton Plan's Backers Set Out on Bus Cavalcade

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore. July 22

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration took its high-stakes health care gamble on the road today, using a bus trip, a Hollywood actress and a rock group to try to rekindle the cozier moments of last year's Presidential campaign. It hopes to ignite popular support as the complex issue heads for a floor debate on Capitol Hill.
Ignoring scattered boos and hand-painted signs opposing abortion rights and "rationed health care," a crowd of 10,000 cheered as more than 100 supporters of universal health coverage set off in four buses on a 3,384-mile cross-country trek carefully staged and financed by supporters of the President's plan. Their goal is to court Americans who have been watching the debate at a distance. 
 The caravan will be joined by hundreds more doctors, nurses and "reform riders" in the next two weeks. When the 16 buses in the "Health Care Express," along with caravans starting elsewhere in the country, reach Washington, participants hope to make their case to Congress with three days of rallies and lobbying in the first week of August.
 
A Rowdy Send-Ooff
 Starting here in a state known for its liberalism and its statewide endorsement of broad health care coverage, the journey began with a boisterous rally and shouts of encouragement from Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Mrs. Clinton jogged to the stand and then waited, nodding, as several of the bus riders told brief stories of their troubles with the present system. She then addressed the crowd filling Pioneer Square, almost shouting in the 100-degree heat, "This is economically, socially and morally the right thing to do!"
Mrs. Clinton, who is not riding on the buses, and other speakers criticized insurance companies for waging a high-cost advertising campaign against the health care overhaul and urged politicians to listen to their consciences and constituents. "The bottom line has to be guaranteed insurance," she said to cheers.
But the drama and the difficulties of the debate hit home long before the rock group Lovemongers, formerly Heart, struck its first note, or Meredith Baxter, the star of the television program "Family Ties," began her opening remarks. People waiting for the rally to begin fell into impassioned debates over abortion rights, high costs, excess bureaucracies and universal coverage.
Joseph Forsythe, a 49-year-old claims adjuster from Portland, said, "People really don't understand the issue if they are not on the inside." Just hours earlier, he said, he received an insurance claim with a $395 charge for a $62.50 procedure and a $265 fee for a $79 procedure.
"I think that's where a lot of this problem is coming from -- gouging," he said. "The only way we can possibly fix this is to do something now."
Others just as passionately disagreed.
"This whole Clinton health care scandal will be the greatest bureaucratic mess ever in the history of the earth," said Walter Taylor, a gray-haired man wearing a radio headset and who traveled from Salem, Ore., to register his complaint and hear the details of the plan. "They have no idea what it will cost."
 
Message for Congress
 The organizers of the trip -- Families USA, a Washington-based health care lobbying group; the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, and Health Right, a health advocacy group -- have worked with health care organizations and several unions to send Congress the message that Americans want guaranteed health care.
Carefully designed to appear as an almost spontaneous outpouring of outrage, the campaign comes with T-shirts, a slogan, "Pass it Now!" and the high spirits of hundreds of people who have found their lives darkened by inequities and unexpected pitfalls in the existing system.
Many of the riders have long been known to health-care specialists because they have lost jobs, insurance and in some cases any safety net at all, while faced with health problems like cancer and near-fatal accidents.
Most of those riders view the health-care issue literally as a matter of life and death and will remain on the bus until they reach their destination in Washington. But some of the more prominent participants in today's rally had committed themselves to rides of less than a hundred miles. Mrs. Clinton herself did not ride the bus but continued to Seattle, where she was scheduled to attend another health-care rally.
The $2 million national caravan is being financed by a loose consortium of groups supporting health care reform, including health care unions and other labor groups.
Arnold Bennett, a balding lifelong liberal who is the media director of Families USA, said the campaign was "for the folks who can't afford to buy $20 million worth of advertising but still want to get their voices heard."
Some of the populism has been carefully crafted. Bus riders were screened by the trip's organizers, who turned down those who did not completely agree the primary message: full coverage for everyone.
The message also has to seem urgent. So as the buses started their engines, Mrs. Clinton stopped to shake dozens of riders' hands. As the Rev. Rodney I. Page, executive director of the Ecumenical Ministries of Oregon, boarded a bus she stopped him in front of the cameras for a particularly warm send-off. But moments after the First Lady and the cameras left, Mr. Page got off the bus and boarded the one on which he had a seat, this time with no ceremony.

HEADLINE: Auto Makers' New Idea: Focus on Used-Car Sales

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 22

 BODY:
The nation's auto makers, historically obsessed with offering the freshest shapes and the most advanced gadgets, are increasingly shifting their attention to something older: the booming used-car market, estimated at twice the size of the new-car market in the United States.
For shoppers, the change will mean more well-maintained, low-mileage, recent-vintage cars that are laden with accessories. 
 Anticipating a rapidly growing supply of high-quality used cars starting later this year, as a large number of two- and three-year leases come to an end, auto makers are beginning to stand behind the second-hand cars their dealers sell in ways they never backed them before. The companies are issuing standards for how customers should be treated, in an effort to rein in fast-talkers who promise coddled Cadillacs but deliver clunkers. They are also setting standards for reconditioning used vehicles.
Further, they are lowering finance rates on used cars, providing lease deals for them, extending warranties and offering 24-hour roadside assistance to buyers. They are setting up computerized satellite auction systems to sell used cars more efficiently to dealers. And some are developing new cars with an eye to how they will appeal to second buyers.
Behind the strategy is the astonishing growth in new-car leasing. Auto makers are expecting a flood of used vehicles to begin rolling back to dealer lots, effectively turning the companies into the country's largest owners of used cars. When a company finances a lease it owns the car. The companies know they must sell those used cars at a good price when the leases end, or take big losses on them.
"You're seeing manufacturers being led not by their instincts, but by their investments, into used-vehicle wholesaling," said John J. Ferron, a senior partner at J. D. Power Associates, the automotive consulting firm in Agoura Hills, Calif.
After ignoring it for generations, the auto makers are zeroing in on a market of at least 30 million vehicles a year. It is generally a big moneymaker, with new-car dealers averaging more than three times the profit per sale on used cars than on highly competitive new-car transactions.
"We're in the transportation business, and what we tend to always talk about is the new-car market," said Michael D. Jordan, executive director of sales operations for the Ford Motor Company. "But there's a very big market here for used cars. There's no reason we can't compete successfully in it."
 
Of Growing Importance
 Auto dealers recognized the potential years ago. Since 1989, and for the first time since World War II, new-vehicle dealers have been selling more used automobiles than new ones -- and the gap has grown wider each year.
"As far as keeping a dealership these days, used cars are more important by far," said Kraig M. Quisenberry, general manager of Bay Ford in Port Orchard, Wash. "That's really the bread and butter for most dealerships."
To make the lowly used vehicle more appealing, auto makers are trying to elevate its status. While Ford of Britain set up a "factory" to recondition 100,000 used cars a year, Ford in the United States is reconditioning cars through its auction network, which handles used vehicles that the company buys back from fleet customers. Workers steam-clean the engines, repaint the cars if necessary and make any needed repairs. For its used-vehicle lease program, Ford then slaps on an extension of the new- car warranty covering 115 systems, from the engine to the brakes, for the period of the lease. People with the leases can also receive assistance if their cars break down.
General Motors' Cadillac Division runs a similar program. In addition, G.M. offers a companywide used-vehicle leasing program.
To handle the flow of off-lease vehicles, Lexus, the luxury division of the Toyota Motor Corporation, has set up a satellite system to sell reconditioned cars to its dealers. The company transmits a photo of the car and relevant data to dealers' television screens, and dealers bid by tapping the keys of their telephones, watching the price climb on the screen.
Like Cadillac and some of its other luxury competitors, Lexus is searching for a more dignified nomenclature as it focuses on used vehicles.
" 'Used' doesn't do justice to what we're trying to sell," said Gary Marcotte, manager of special markets for Lexus. " 'Used' is something you don't want." But, he said, " 'pre-owned' is something someone's taken care of."
Lexus began reconditioning and then marketing previously owned cars late last year; it expects to sell or lease 22,000 used Lexuses this year through its dealers. Ford has leased about 20,000 used vehicles so far this year, and expects to lease up to 100,000 in 1995.
 
The Leasing Gamble
 Through such programs, the auto makers hope to cultivate customers who cannot afford new vehicles now, but may be able to later. More important, they are trying to insure that the enormous gamble they have made on new-car leasing pays off.
Through leasing, auto makers have at least three opportunities for profit. First, when they sell a car to a dealer. Then, if the dealer leases a car the auto maker's finance arm can profit from the lease payments. The dealer and the auto maker can both profit when the car is later sold as a used car. But the companies are quite guarded about how much they make on all these transactions.
Now, every time an auto maker leases a new car it must guess how much the car will be worth when the lease is up -- its so-called residual value. If the company predicts that the residual value will be high, the person leasing the car will have smaller monthly payments, because those payments are based on the value that is used up during the lease.
For car makers, the risk is that they may have guessed residual values that are too high. If that happens, they can wind up trying to sell used cars at a loss. And the more such previously leased cars they try to unload, the further prices will fall.
So far, the companies seem to have guessed right. The used-car prices are higher than expected two or three years ago, meaning that Ford, the leader in leasing, is doing fine. At the moment, residual values of Mercury Cougars are coming in at 103 percent of projections made by Ford two or three years ago.
The great wave of recently leased vehicles has not hit yet, and some of Ford's competitors have suggested that the company is overexposed. "Quite frankly, we think that some of our competitors perhaps went a little too far in terms of their incentivization of leasing," said J. Michael Losh, chief financial officer for General Motors. Leases by G.M.'s financing arm account for about 12 percent of the company's retail transactions. By contrast, Ford finances leases for about 20 percent of its transactions.
 The volume of vehicles reaching the market after a two- or three-year lease will more than double this year to 1,073,000, according to Art Spinella, vice president and general manager of CNW Marketing/Research, a Bandon, Ore., company that tracks leasing. By 1997, he said, volume will grow to 2,750,000, with leases on most vehicles ending in the summer. By then, most auto analysts predict that new car demand will have slackened.
"You watch: July and August 1997, it'll be mayhem," Mr. Spinella said. "That's the reason some people are worrying about it now. But most aren't."
Ford says it is not concerned that prices will fall with the surge of used cars. "Two-year-old vehicles have always been in short supply in the industry," Mr. Jordan, the Ford sales director, said.
Another way to keep used-vehicle prices high in the United States is to keep the supply down. Mr. Jordan said Ford was considering exporting used vehicles for sale abroad.
Ford has also become more sophisticated about designing its vehicles, to keep residual values high. The developers of Ford's new Windstar mini-van decided against offering a "stripper" version, which would have been shorter and cheaper, with fewer standard features.
A cheaper version today would make the vans less valuable later as used cars. "In the short term you probably do sacrifice some sales," said David M. Ford, program manager for multipurpose vehicles at Ford. But, he added, "I'm not sure, longer term, it does you a lot of good having a stripper version that denigrates the image of the vehicle."
 
A Potential Threat
 Of course, one risk is that buyers may decide that two-year-old cars -- with detailed ownership histories and full warranties -- are better bargains than new ones.
Executives with several auto makers insisted that a two-year-old vehicle, even with a warranty, is clearly a used car, and would cause no such confusion. "That's one theory," Mr. Ferron of J. D. Power said. "The other theory is, that's hogwash." Mr. Ferron said that value-conscious buyers were increasingly willing to consider used vehicles.
That is what Catherine Williams did. A Milwaukee police officer, Ms. Williams recently bought a 1991 Subaru Legacy station wagon, after making a deal on a new Subaru subcompact. "I didn't have to get a trimmed-down version of the car," she said. "I got power everything, air-conditioning, a good stereo."
Detroit executives are sensitive about this issue because they made a horrendous mistake in the late 1980's. They pumped up sales by encouraging rental car companies to replace cars as often as every four months. Those so-called "program cars" turned up on used-car lots as low-mileage "nearly new" cars and began to attract new-car customers.
"We don't want to create the kind of problem with leasing returns that we created with daily rental car returns a couple years ago," Mr. Losh of General Motors said.
 So far, dealers say the only problem with the used-car market is too few vehicles. This market tends to parallel the market for new vehicles, rising for the same reasons: high consumer confidence combined with aging vehicles on the road, prompting buyers to trade up and trade in.
But used-car prices appear sensitive to changes in volume. This spring, for example, prices of used vehicles actually fell slightly, said Patrick C. Jackman, a senior economist at the Labor Department. That dip coincided with a boom in new-car sales, and hence in trade-ins, at the beginning of the year.
An important reason that used-car prices are high now, dealers say, is that new-car sales were slack for several years, meaning people were not trading in their cars and pumping up the used-car supply. Another reason is that the auto makers insist that rental companies keep their fleet cars longer. As the recovery continues and new-car buyers trade in their vehicles, Mr. Jackman said, used-car prices are likely to soften.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Prepares a Takeover Of Newark's Desperate Schools

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 22

 BODY:
The New Jersey Education Department said today that it was prepared to take control of Newark's troubled schools. It issued a damning report that portrays the district as badly mismanaged by officials who sit aloof in comfortable offices while students struggle through badly taught classes in filthy buildings and ultimately fail in great numbers.
Officials of the Newark district, the state's largest, have 20 days to respond to an order from Education Commissioner Leo F. Klagholz that requires them to demonstrate in court why there should be no takeover. Newark officials vowed again today to resist state control, meaning the long, complicated process of takeover could drag on for another year. 
 If that fight is unsuccessful, Newark would become the third district to be controlled by the state. Jersey City's school system, the state's second largest, was taken over in 1989 after a long battle. Paterson, the state's third-largest system, was taken over in 1991.
New Jersey's action is in line with a national trend toward fighting educational collapse not by focusing on money -- Newark spends as much per pupil on its public schools as Princeton -- but by directly attacking school administrations viewed as derelict. [News analysis, page 24.]
In its report today, the state spared almost no one and nothing in the school system from criticism.
"The Newark School District has been at best flagrantly delinquent and at worst deceptive in discharging its obligations to the children enrolled in public schools," the report said. "Already at risk of school failure because of economic disadvantage, children in the Newark public schools are placed at greater risk by school district personnel who fail to provide them with the opportunity to achieve academically in a safe, healthful environment."
Eugene C. Campbell, the Newark executive superintendent, could not be reached for comment about the report; school officials said he would be unable to comment anyway because he had not read the report until this morning. Evelyn Williams, president of the Newark school board, said she could not comment on the report until she had read it. But she said she was "absolutely, categorically opposed to state takeover."
Toni Randolph, a spokeswoman for the 48,000-student district, said state control was not the solution to the system's problems.
"We're willing to fight all the way," she said.
At a news conference this afternoon, Mayor Sharpe James of Newark said that the state takeovers of Jersey City and Paterson had yet to raise test scores in those districts and charged that political motives were behind the state's move.
"We should be very clear in our message that the children are the losers in this power play," he said. "A state takeover is a power play that helps certain assemblymen get re-elected."
The evidence against the system was laid out today in a report called a comprehensive compliance investigation that is the fourth stage leading to state takeover. Newark schools failed the first three levels of monitoring, and have failed to receive state certification since 1984, when the state began its current system of monitoring public schools.
Although the move toward state takeover in heavily-Democratic Newark comes under a Republican Governor, it has dragged on for a decade under both Republican and Democratic leadership. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has called takeover a last resort, but said that she will support the decision of the Education Commissioner and the state board. The Governor has no direct power in the takeover.
 
Struggle for Achievement
 The action also comes as New Jersey is struggling to raise its troubled urban districts to the level of educational achievement in its richer, suburban systems. Earlier this month, in declaring the state's method of financing public schools unconstitutional, the New Jersey Supreme Court said that the state must not only spend the same amount of money on students in poor urban districts as on those in wealthier systems, but must also guarantee urban students the same educational opportunity as their suburban counterparts.
Per pupil spending in Newark, $10,700 in 1992-93, is well above the state average of $8,571. Yet Newark's students fare poorly on every indicator of educational achievement used by the state.
The district's graduation rate is 54 percent, near the bottom of even the 30 so-called special needs urban districts that are the focus of school finance reform in the state. Its students routinely score at or near the bottom on state standardized tests: only 25 percent of eleventh grade students were able to pass all sections of a state high school proficiency test in 1993.
Average daily attendance in 1992 was 90 percent, one of the lowest rates in the state. But the report said that even that number might be inflated. Investigators found numerous instances of careless or nonexistent attendance records, the report said. At Weequahic High School in Newark, for example, all students were reported present for 16 consecutive days in June 1993. And one principal asked state investigators why they thought he would bother to keep attendance records at all.
The 1,100-page report portrays a system wounded by mismanagement, loose fiscal policies and blatant conflicts of interest. In one example, a senior business office official signed documents awarding contracts to a vendor for which he is a consultant. The vendor does more than $1 million in business with the district.
In another example, the district pays $18,300 a year to lease a hangar at Newark Airport for an aerospace class that has not existed for several years.
The report paints the school board as indifferent to parents and the community, disinterested and unfamiliar with issues of curriculum and instruction.
"Faced with a recent cutback in external funding for the Chapter One remedial program, for example, the board concerned itself primarily with staff assignments and job security rather than with the impact on the children's learning," the report said.
Educational programs are unchallenging and badly taught, the report said. Students lack sufficient textbooks, supplies and equipment. Instruction in most classes is textbook-driven and focused on rote memorization. There is little writing and little encouragement of independent reading, the report said. A number of teachers are uncertified; some were observed giving incorrect information to students to study.
 
Special Students Isolated
 Particularly disturbing, the report said, is the segregation of special education students in separate school buildings, rather than integrating them into neighborhood schools as required by Federal and state law.
The report found that many of the district's buildings had been remodeled or renovated without county and state approval, but still suffered from poor maintenance and neglect. Many schools are more than 100 years old.

Chart: "What Was Found: The Newark Schools -- Failing Grades
 Problems identified by the New Jersey State Education Department.
 
STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT
 From the third grade to the sixth grade, the percentage of children meeting state minimum requirements in basic skills tests drops off more sharply than anywhere in the state. And students identified as low achievers in eighth-grade "early warning tests" show little improvement in later tests. Consequently, the majority of students who remain in Newark schools through the 12th grade "are in danger of leaving high school without diplomas."
 The average daily attendance for 1992-93 was only about 90 percent, one of the lowest of any district in New Jersey. And the report says the actual rate may be lower because of poor bookkeeping; at one school a principal responded to a state request for attendance figures by asking "What would I do with that information.
 
INSTRUCTION
 Instruction is "unchallenging and often misdirected or inappropriate. Few instances were found ... of children being encouraged to generate their own ideas, to collaborate in problem-solving activities, to write in class, to read widely and independently or to use skills and facts in context."
 
STAFF
 Some teachers and other professional staff "were observed to lack an understanding of the subjects they were teaching and to give misinformation for children to copy into their notebooks."
 
SERVICES
 At one school the principal directs the custodians to lock all bathrooms and allows students to use bathrooms only when the whole class is scheduled to go.
 Public transportation is "hazardous." Children ride in school buses that are operated by improperly licensed drivers, lack proper safety equipment and have not been properly inspected.
Food services program is not properly monitored; cafeterias "often do not provide the size of portions or nutritional components described in their published menus."
 
ADMINISTRATION
 While the schools are "badly neglected," administrators work in "comfortable offices." The report says central administrators "accomplish little of value and drain needed resources from students."
 A significant backlog of authorized (many before 1986) but uncompleted captial projects totaling $122 million existed on June 30.
 An unsafe, vermin-infested building was leased for a school at an annual rent of more than $175,000. The report says two Newark Board of Education employees benefit financially from the arrangment.
 Prospective vendors were "strongly pressured" to contribute $1,000 to an "Executive Superintendent's Scholarship Fund;" this fund is not registered with the attorney general as required by a state law govering charities. (pg. 24)

HEADLINE: CUTTING THE LOSSES: A SPECIAL REPORT;
Lessons in the Rubble of the Coliseum Deal

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER with SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
For a decade, it survived design flaws, political miscalculations and years of litigation. But in the end the collapse last week of a plan to build a huge office and retail center at the site of the New York Coliseum was brought about by two overriding forces: the dramatic changes in New York City's economy and the weight of years of bitter negotiations that left the parties mired in mistrust and inflexibility.
The demise of the project, which Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the developer and publisher, had intended to call Columbus Center, has left a trail of recrimination, with Mr. Zuckerman and the owner of the site, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, blaming each other for the debacle. 
 Although both the M.T.A. and Mr. Zuckerman insist they were trying to make the final deal work, each side suspects that the other never really wanted it to go forward. Clearly neither was willing to take on added economic risks to make it happen.
In fact, both managed to benefit somewhat in the way the deal finally ended: Mr. Zuckerman reduced his potential losses from $34 million to $17 million, and the M.T.A. was able to end its relationship with Mr. Zuckerman and start from scratch, something the agency had wanted to do for most of the last two years.
Meanwhile, the complex's 10-story office building remains occupied, and the Coliseum is used from time to time for exhibitions and shows.
Many experts now see the Coliseum saga as a case study in what not to do with important urban parcels. The plan was revised (and reduced) three times. It was approved twice by the Board of Estimate. It was struck down once in court and upheld once. It was intended by its government sponsors to yield the largest possible sale price with urban design a secondary concern and then rammed unaltered through the city's approval process -- decisions that helped provoke vehement opposition from planners, architects and civic groups.
But the decisive blow probably came on Oct. 19, 1987, the day the stock market crashed, eventually taking with it the economic boom in which Mr. Zuckerman's project was conceived.
"In a sense this was the quintessential 80's project; it only made sense in terms of the strong economy of the 80's," said Abraham Biderman, a former city Finance and Housing Commissioner who for most of the decade was Mayor Edward I. Koch's point man on Columbus Circle.
"It didn't happen because there was just a small moment in history, an ideal time, when it could have happened, and that was between 1985 and 1987," Mr. Biderman said. "After 1987, it just became much more difficult, but not impossible."
It finally became impossible in the last six weeks. Talks over the latest plan were abandoned when the developer and M.T.A. officials could not agree on what seemed, on the surface at least, like a small detail. How would the developer insure liability during demolition? What guarantees would he offer if an attached office building were to be damaged while the Coliseum's exhibition hall was being razed?
 
Distrust on Both Sides
 By the time that question came up, the years of revisions and renegotiations had clearly taken their toll, many of the participants said this week. Some M.T.A. officials suspected that Mr. Zuckerman was no longer serious about trying to build on the site at 59th and Broadway, and was concerned mainly with cutting his losses.
On the other side, the Zuckerman team suspected that the M.T.A., and its chairman, Peter E. Stangl, had no desire to complete a deal with Mr. Zuckerman and was raising new conditions in the hopes of scuttling the deal and starting anew.
Both sides dug in their heels, and by last Friday, four hours before yet another deadline, everyone agreed that there was no more point in talking. The endgame had been concluded; the project was dead.
For the parties, the outcome was mixed. Although the M.T.A. gets its chance to start over, it still faces the possibility of a lawsuit by Mr. Zuckerman seeking to recover his deposit.
Mr. Zuckerman was able to cut his potential losses by $17 million, but beyond that his balance sheet is unclear. He has said often that he also spent more than $100 million during the decade-long effort, much of it in fees for lawyers and architects, along with steel and marble ordered in the mid-1980's.
 
$95 Million From Salomon Brothers
 But Mr. Zuckerman received $95 million from Salomon Brothers, the investment banking company, when it withdrew as the project's prime tenant and co-investor in 1987. Although Mr. Zuckerman's partner, Edward H. Linde, said that the payment did not cover all the expenses, other experts said they could not see how their costs could have been that high.
"Zuckerman isn't coming out badly," said Peter D. Salins, director of the graduate program in urban planning at Hunter College and a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. "He is making a healthy profit."
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani did not get the compromise he had been seeking since taking office. His aides had pushed hard to mediate between the M.T.A. and Mr. Zuckerman, whose newspaper, The Daily News, endorsed Mr. Giuliani in last year's election.
Critics suggested that the Mayor was doing it to help Mr. Zuckerman get a better deal, but the Mayor said he wanted the project to go forward because it would mean construction jobs and a psychic boost for the economy. In the end Mr. Giuliani got no jobs.
 
Original Proposal
Perfect Marriage Quickly in Trouble
 When the city and the M.T.A. first dreamed up the project, in 1983 and 1984, the economy was booming, and continued expansion was an almost universal assumption.
The Jacob Javits Convention Center was about to open on Manhattan's West Side, eliminating the need for the Coliseum, built 30 years earlier by Robert Moses and the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority. A team assembled by the Koch administration and the Triborough's parent agency, the M.T.A., decided to seek proposals from developers interested in razing the Coliseum and an office building next door and redeveloping the property.
The prime consideration in the competition, it was decided, would be financial -- how much money the developers would offer. The money would be used to help rebuild the subway system and for other important city projects. Design and urban planning were secondary.
Fifteen developers offered proposals, and on July 11, 1985, Mr. Zuckerman's firm, Boston Properties, emerged victorious. He proposed to pay $455 million for the site, on which he planned to build a huge complex containing a hotel, office space, condominiums, stores and movie theaters. Salomon Brothers would be the prime tenant and Mr. Zuckerman's partner in the development.
The complex would contain 2.7 million square feet. Two towers, one 68 stories and the other 58 stories, would rise from a base that would curve in symmetry with the western edge of Columbus Circle.
It seemed to city and state officials like a perfect marriage. The development would raise huge sums of cash for subway renovations, provide as much as $100 million in annual tax revenues, and keep a major securities firm anchored in New York City.
"It was a worthwhile project, and the city would have benefited if it had gone through," Mr. Koch said this week. "I'm really saddened about it."
The project ran into trouble almost immediately. Architects, planners, citywide civic groups and West Side community groups objected both to its size and design.
Much of the criticism was aimed not at Mr. Zuckerman but at the city and the M.T.A., whose desire to maximize the sale price would have forced any developer to build an extremely large complex. Opponents took their fight to the Board of Estimate, the courts and the streets. Bill Moyers and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis were among the opponents' celebrated allies.
Typically, major development proposals are modified as they wind their way through the city's arcane approval process. Proposed buildings are often scaled down, and other changes are made to appease opponents and forge a consensus.
The M.T.A., the developers and the Koch administration took a different tack with Columbus Circle. They knew they had enough votes on the Board of Estimate, so they insisted that the plan could not be altered. Thomas W. Strauss, then the president of Salomon Brothers, threatened to withdraw if changes were made.
In February 1987 the proposal passed overwhelmingly. "We didn't perceive the need to compromise," Mr. Biderman said.
"In retrospect," he added, "it's clear that if we had been a little more accommodating at that point -- and we were acting in what we thought was in the city's best interest -- the outcome might have been different."
 
Renegotiations
City Reluctant To Force Closing
 In December 1987, the project's forward movement ground to a halt. Salomon Brothers withdrew from the project, saying it was forced to revise its "space requirements" after the stock market collapse.
Then, just four days later, a State Supreme Court justice ruled against the city on a suit brought by the Municipal Art Society. Acting Justice Edward H. Lehner invalidated the sale, saying that the city had acted illegally when it made the full purchase price contingent on the developer's obtaining a zoning variance.
Trying to keep his proposal alive, Mr. Zuckerman said he would scale back the plan, setting off a succession of revisions and renegotiations that cut the purchase price from $455 million to $357 million to $338 million. The third version of the plan, approved in May 1989, included a $33.8 million letter of credit that Mr. Zuckerman would forfeit if the deal fell through.
 
Political Considerations
 Lawsuits filed by other opponents, including community groups and local elected officials, kept the plan on hold for years. But even after the final lawsuit was thrown out in June 1992, the Dinkins administration did not press Mr. Zuckerman to close the sale of the land or lose his $33.8 million. The city was reluctant to start all over again and preferred to save the project by renegotiating its price and size one more time.
Two former aides to Mayor David N. Dinkins said he was also reluctant to force Mr. Zuckerman to complete the sale on the 1989 terms for fear that Mr. Zuckerman, who had acquired The Daily News, might retaliate by endorsing his opponent in the 1993 mayoral campaign.
The administration was also unwilling to push Mr. Zuckerman because he was deciding last year whether to build a new printing plant for The Daily News in New York or New Jersey, the Dinkins aides said. (He eventually choose New Jersey.)
M.T.A. officials, however, pushed the city to force Mr. Zuckerman to close the sale.
 
The Collapse
Neither Side Is Satisfied
 By November the dynamics had clearly changed. The Daily News did endorse Mr. Dinkins's opponent, Mr. Giuliani, who went on to win the election. A month later the Dinkins administration finally sided with the M.T.A. and issued a 90-day deadline to Mr. Zuckerman.
Senior Dinkins advisers insisted at the time that the decision did not represent political revenge as Mr. Zuckerman contended, but came only after they got a crucial assurance from the M.T.A. that the city would remain involved in planning for the site. Still, the two former Dinkins aides said this week that politics had also played a role.
With Mr. Giuliani in office, the alliances shifted again. Now the developer had a firm advocate in City Hall, and the M.T.A. essentially stood alone. Arguing that the slumping real-estate market had reduced the value of the Coliseum parcel, Giuliani aides began to pressure the M.T.A. to work out a new deal that would sharply cut the price Mr. Zuckerman would have to pay.
And as the pressure grew, so did the tensions and backbiting.
"In negotiations where there is so much at stake," one participant said, "you expect a certain level of tension. But clearly there was no love lost among this group."
The involvement of John S. Dyson, the outspoken Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, and his insistence that the two sides complete a deal, complicated matters, the participant said.
The day after the deal collapsed, Mr. Dyson said, "I have never dealt with as difficult and as unpleasant a bunch of people to do business with as the people at the M.T.A."
In June, the M.T.A. and the developers agreed to a compromise under which Mr. Zuckerman would get the north half of the four-acre site for less than a quarter of the original price -- $100 million. Of that, the city agreed to pay $20 million.
Some independent people thought Mr. Zuckerman should have been pushed to complete the purchase on the 1989 terms or withdraw from the project and lose his deposit.
"I like Mort Zuckerman," Mr. Koch said, "but I thought it was an error to let him out of the original deal."
"You're going to tell me that the market's changed and now the property is worth less that it was before?" he said. Then, answering his own question with an expletive, Mr. Koch said, in essence, too bad.
 
Both Sides Displeased
 Neither side was truly satisfied with the new deal. M.T.A. officials felt they were pushed into a corner, and the developer expressed displeasure at being forced to agree to a host of new obligations, including the $6 million cost of restoring the Coliseum garage.
The parties then turned to the task of writing a new contract that would formalize the agreement. But it soon became apparent just how difficult a deal the M.T.A. and the developers had devised for themselves when they agreed to cut the property in half.
One issue in particular illustrated the gulf between the parties. It concerned the M.T.A.'s request from the developers for some sort of financial guarantee to cover the potential damage during the delicate process of separating the office building from the exhibition hall.
Mr. Linde, Mr. Zuckerman's partner, agreed to three means of security, including construction and completion bonds to be posted before demolition began.
For the M.T.A. that was not enough. It sought security in the form of letter of credit or some other asset.
Deadline day, July 15, dawned with several key parts of the contract still unsettled. In addition to the issue of financial security over the separation work, the parties remained apart on the basic agreement as well as matters as mundane as the number of parking spaces in the garage the developers and M.T.A. would share.
 
Unable to Coax a Compromise
 After meeting less than two hours at the offices of the transit agency's lawyers, Bachner Tally Polevoy & Misher, little was settled, and the parties agreed to a timeout.
Mr. Linde left to consult with Mr. Zuckerman, who did not attend the sessions. The M.T.A.'s representatives met with Mr. Stangl, who also was not present.
Starting in the late afternoon, Mr. Dyson shuttled between the parties, now in separate conference rooms, in an effort to coax a compromise on the liability issue. But with four hours left before the M.T.A.'s deadline, the talks broke down. Each side accused the other of walking away first.
Many of the people who have been involved with the Coliseum proposal over the years say it offers some long-term civic lessons.
In a public-private partnership for a large development, they say, the government has to operate more like a business, not allowing projects to be continually renegotiated.
"I think we've created an overall environment that's bad for these partnerships in general," said Richard A. Kahan, a former developer who also once headed the Battery Park City Authority. "How does the private sector know when you can renegotiate with the government and when you can't?"
In addition, he said, the government sponsors and the private developers have to pay more attention to designing projects that have broad appeal to an array of critical constituencies.
"You can get the votes and you can win the litigation," Mr. Kahan said, "but you need a real partnership for it to work."

HEADLINE: Judge in Simpson Case Goes by the Rules

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 22

 BODY:
Judge Lance A. Ito, soon to become the most closely watched judge in the country as he presides over the O. J. Simpson trial, has two main standards for handling high-profile cases.
"Rule 1: Be cautious, careful and when in doubt, keep your mouth shut," he says. "Rule 2: When tempted to say something, take a deep breath and refer to Rule 1." 
 Those cautions, part of a course he teaches for judges called "Media and the Courts -- Handling the High-Profile Case," were quoted in a recent interview in which he told The Daily Journal, a local legal journal, that a judge "would have to be crazy" to want to try the Simpson case.
Judge Ito, the assistant presiding judge of the Los Angeles Superior Court, was named today by his superior, Judge Cecil J. Mills, to handle what has already become the most intensely covered and thoroughly second-guessed televised legal proceeding in history.
 
Appointment Wins Praise
 "I think you would have to be crazy to want that case," the 43-year-old judge said in the interview earlier this week. "Being the trial judge is the worst position in a major high-profile case. You can't call a press conference to explain your side of things."
The selection of Judge Ito, a former prosecutor, drew widespread praise today from defense lawyers, who called him intelligent, hard-working and balanced, with a dry sense of humor that he uses to defuse courtroom tensions.
"He is very sensitive to the needs of trial lawyers and allows them to do their work," said Blair Bernholz, a defense lawyer here. "But there's never any question who is in control of the courtroom. He keeps a firm hand."
Janet Kerr, a law professor at Pepperdine University who has advised Judge Ito as a technical expert, said: "I believe him to be a brilliant judge who's willing to listen intently to many different sides of an issue and who makes very well-reasoned decisions. He does have a very dry sense of humor. I think he adds a lot of personality in the courtroom."
After Judge Ito's appointment was announced, Mr. Simpson's chief lawyer, Robert L. Shapiro, called him "an excellent choice because he is one of the finest judges in the state of California."
 
Trial Judge of the Year
 Judge Ito, the son of schoolteachers, graduated from the University of California at Los Angeles with honors in political science in 1972, and from the University of California at Berkeley law school in 1975.
After working for a decade as a prosecutor, he became a Municipal Court judge in 1987 and was named to the Superior Court in 1989. The Los Angeles County Bar Association named him trial judge of the year for 1992.
Judge Ito's most high-profile case was the securities fraud prosecution in 1991 of Charles H. Keating Jr., the former owner of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. In a controversial ruling in the case, Judge Ito dismissed about half the charges. Then, when Mr. Keating was convicted, Judge Ito sentenced him to the maximum term of 10 years in prison.
In court this morning, Judge Mills informed the prosecutors and defense lawyers -- as judges routinely do at the start of cases -- of a potential conflict of interest: Judge Ito's wife, Margaret Ann York, is a former homicide detective and is a captain in the Los Angeles Police Department. As such, she is the highest ranking woman on the force. Lawyers for both sides in the case agreed to accept Judge Ito.
 
Victims Become Reluctant
 Judge Ito has handled domestic violence cases and has complained of the difficulty of prosecuting crimes in which the victims sometimes refuse to testify.
After one recent case was dropped when the victim changed her testimony to claim she had been mugged, Judge Ito told The Los Angeles Times: "Often there are serious injuries and implausible explanations as to how it happened. The problem is, 75 to 90 days later, when the case comes to trial, emotions have cooled down, economic realities have set in and victims often become reluctant."
In the Simpson case, Judge Ito has already presided over the pretrial hearing at which a grand jury investigation was halted and is one of the few people who know what is contained in a mysterious envelope that was presented in court earlier this month.
Mr. Shapiro had approached Judge Ito about an item of evidence he had uncovered, and after a closed hearing, the judge named a retired judge, Delbert Wong, to receive and seal the item. The nature of the evidence in the envelope remains one of the tantalizing unknowns of the case.

So naturally the black women who toil over knitting machines for 50 cents an hour in Taiwanese-owned sweater factories here expected the election of Nelson Mandela to bring payback time -- a union shop, better wages and a little respect. 
 "It's our turn to be treated as human beings," said Clara Monethi, a shop steward for the Southern African Clothing and Textile Workers Union.
Instead, at the first sign of post-election unrest in the mills of Kimberley, a mining and textiles center 300 miles southwest of Johannesburg, the Taiwanese owners abruptly closed their seven factories, and the union is now fighting to save 1,000 jobs.
Here, as in much of the reborn South Africa, the soaring hopes of workers have collided with the new economic reality, creating a fallout of strikes and disenchantment.
Unionists who regard themselves as heroes of the liberation struggle often find themselves pilloried as an impediment to foreign investment, a menace to economic discipline and potentially a threat to the Government they helped elect, the Government that is South Africa's biggest employer.
Businessmen who thought the election of a black President would mean a period of labor peace have also been sorely disappointed.
In the six months surrounding the April elections, South Africa has lost 1.2 million days of workers' time to strikes, up from the 700,000 in the same period last year, according to Andrew Levy and Associates, an industrial relations consulting firm.
Increasingly, the strikes are not organized walkouts but wildcat protests. Strong union leaders who had the experience and authority to channel worker grievances have been drafted into Parliament and Government ministries.
Johannesburg was unsettled last week by anarchic scenes of conflict reminiscent of past political resistance, when striking grocery clerks rampaged through Pick 'n' Pay grocery stores, and police officers routed them with snarling dogs and rubber bullets.
"A lot of management expected that after the election of a new Government, everything would be hunky dory -- 'Now we've given them power and they can shut up,' " said Renee Grawitsky of Andrew Levy and Associates. "That was naive."
During three decades when the African National Congress was banned, unions became a bastion of political resistance, promoting majority rule and foreign disinvestment as ferociously as better wages.
"What we got was a highly politicized trade union movement, and a militant trade union movement," said Duncan Innes, editor of a newsletter on labor issues.
In addition, South African labor, while relatively expensive, is mainly poorly educated and militant. It has dampened the enthusiasm of many Americans and Europeans scouting investment opportunities here.
Thanks to union successes, labor in South Africa costs twice as much as in Brazil or Mexico, and several times as much as in Thailand or China. Black workers are products of an apartheid education system that deliberately schooled blacks for menial work. Productivity is low.
"The Taiwanese don't understand the South African work ethic," said Pierre Hugo, the lawyer for the factory owners here. "In Taiwan, everybody is productive. In Taiwan, they work seven days a week and take off one Sunday a month to do shopping."
The Taiwanese are regarded by South African unions as hard cases -- secretive, low-paying and ill at ease with black workers -- but in their quest for cheap and cooperative workers they are not alone.
While some union leaders have endorsed more business-friendly arrangements like contracts pegged to worker productivity or profit-sharing plans, ordinary workers feel little sense of a shared stake in the economy. After decades of mutual hostility, they tend to see employers as rich, white beneficiaries of apartheid.
"They still see business as a kind of endless pot from which they can draw ever-increasing wages and there is no end to the process," Mr. Innes said.
He said one major American company recently came to ask him if they could avoid the union altogether by offering premium pay and benefits. No, he replied. Because of their role in fighting apartheid, unions are ingrained in South African culture.
"Workers see the unions as being important," he said. "It's politically correct. We can't bypass the unions. The challenge is to bring them on board."
The new Government is now in the uneasy role of intermediary between the workers who elected it and the business it courts.
Adding to the Government's sense of foreboding, the fastest growing and most militant unions are those representing mainly black hospital workers, teachers and other public employees. They are demanding large raises to match the pay of more privileged white civil servants.
Mr. Mandela's Government is sympathetic, but it also faces a quandary. The more money spent raising the pay of two million public employees, the less there will be for the five million blacks who have no jobs at all.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE EMPLOYER;
Pizza Hut Defends Its Insurance Plans

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
Throughout the debate over national health insurance, the hottest issue has been how to pay for it. Today, that question boiled down to the cost of pizza.
At a Senate hearing today, Allan S. Huston, president of Pizza Hut, a division of Pepsico Inc., said that requiring employers to pay for their workers' insurance would mean lost jobs, lower wages and closed businesses. 
 These are the arguments that small businesses and operations like Pizza Hut, with its many low-wage workers, have pressed since President Clinton proposed a system of universal health care coverage financed largely by employers. Although Pizza Hut, with 10,000 stores in 47 countries, is neither small nor struggling, it says it has to keep its costs down to compete with less-expensive restaurants and home cooking.
 
'Double Standard'
 As they have in the past, advocates of universal insurance coverage retorted that some businesses were exaggerating their fears to duck responsibility to their workers. And they repeated their argument, made at a news conference last week, that if large chains like Pizza Hut or McDonald's could afford to insure workers in countries where they were required to do so, then they could afford it here. "An unacceptable double standard," the chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, called it at his committee's hearing today.
The question of employer payments is a central sticking point as Democratic leaders in Congress work to turn proposals passed by four committees into legislation for consideration on the House and Senate floors this summer.
Mr. Huston told the Labor committee today that if Pizza Hut had to provide health benefits for thousands of hourly workers its restaurants would have to "either raise prices, which will lead to a falloff in sales and eventually lost jobs, or eliminate jobs at the start."
Pizza Hut could not easily raise its prices, Mr. Huston said, because "customers have a choice: they can eat at home." Mr. Houston said an employer mandate could push the average price of an $11 pizza up by $1.10 because health insurance costs would start a snowball effect of higher prices begetting a drop in sales volume, begetting higher costs, begetting higher prices, and so on.
 
Adjusting to Shock
 But advocates of national health insurance said the increased costs would be more modest. Under the Senate Labor committee bill, for example, the increase would be limited to 12 percent of payroll. Pizza Hut says its payroll is 30 percent of its costs, so the presumed increase for an $11 pizza would be 40 cents.
If fast-food chains had to provide insurance, "some fewer hamburgers would be eaten, but my hunch is it wouldn't be a lot fewer," Uwe Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton University, said in an interview. "This product is so favorably priced, people would adjust to the shock."
Mr. Clinton, speaking to governors this week, said, "If all your competitors are in the same boat you are in, you don't go broke doing this."
The Health Care Reform Project, a coalition of groups seeking to require employers to pay for insurance, also raised the issue in newspaper advertisements last week. The group noted that Pizza Hut provides health insurance to workers in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Japan, where employers are required to do so.
 
Unwanted Spiral
 Mr. Huston said the requirement in Europe, and elsewhere where employee social benefits were costly, contributed to a "descending spiral of higher prices and unemployment." Without the cost burden, he said, his chain expanded much faster at home than abroad. He said the company had lost money for 10 of the last 11 years in its 65 German stores at a time when it was opening hundreds of new restaurants in the United States.
Bob Dole, the Senate minority leader and an opponent of employer mandates, took the Senate floor today to defend Pizza Hut, whose headquarters are in his home state of Kansas. "I don't know what company or industry will next be attacked by the White House, the Democratic National Comittee or their allies," he said, "but from the arguments they use, I know that they like their pizzas with a lot of baloney."
Pizza Hut store managers receive company-paid benefits, which they can use for medical, dental or other needs. Mr. Huston said most other employees are young, part-time workers who receive the $4.25 hourly minimum wage, or $170 for a 40-hour week. During their first six months of employment, they may buy basic coverage for $11 a week, though the company says 70 percent rely on family coverage provided by other employers. After six months on the job, hourly workers who bought the $11 basic plan receive a small additional contribution from Pizza Hut that increases the workers' benefits.
 
Big Mac, Fries and a Cola
 An executive of McDonald's was invited to the hearing today, Senator Kennedy said, but declined to appear. At the witness table, to underscore the absence of the executive, the committee's staff placed a Big Mac hamburger, french fries and a soft drink.
David Adelman, a restaurant securities analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, said the costs for a well-run, profitable, company-operated McDonald's store would typically be: labor, 25 percent; food, 30 percent; store overhead (rent, utilities, supplies, breakage and pilfering from the cash register), 23 percent; corporate overhead, 10 percent, and pretax profit, 12 percent.
The National Federation of Independent Business, a small-business group that lobbies vigorously against employer mandates, asked members last fall how they would deal with a 3.5 percent increase in their health care costs. Thirty-five percent said they would raise prices; 40 percent would reduce jobs, wages or benefits; 17 percent would cut profits, and 2 percent would shut down.
 
Shared Responsibility
 Opponents of the employer mandates also said they feared that employer contributions would eventually be raised if Government financing failed to cover health costs.
But 50 large businesses and business associations endorsed "shared employer responsibility" in a letter to Congressional leaders last week. Walter Maher, an official of the Chrysler Corporation, said the debate was "between those businesses that are providing benefits and those who aren't." He said the ability of American manufacturers to compete overseas was being weakened because they must absorb health care costs other American companies are not absorbing.
"The retail sector, fast foods, and much of the service sector don't provide health coverage," Mr. Maher said. "And they are not in global competition. We end up adding to the cost of production" for manufacturers who not only provide coverage but compete abroad.

GRAPHIC: Graph: "DOLLARS AND CENTS - Fast Food: How Costs Break Down" Requiring all employers to help pay for workers' health care under proposals being considered by Congress could add about 40 to 70 cents to the cost of an $11 pizza, according to advocates of empolyer mandates. A Pepsico official testified that labor costs at the company's Pizza Hut chain were 30 percent of each sales dollar. Under the health care bill passed by the Senate Labor Committee, employers would pay no more than 12 percent of their payrolls on health care; 12 percent of 30 percent of the cost of an $11 pizza is 40 cents. Here are the typical costs as a percentqge of revenues for chain-owned fast food stores: 25 pct. labor
30 pct food,
5 pct rent leasing or buying
3 pct depreciation.
3 pct. advtg;
2 pct paper
10 pct other (insurance, utilities, breakage and pilferage).
12 percent pre-tax profits
10 pct corporate expenses

HEADLINE: Robert Rodriguez, 43, Politician And Affirmative-Action Official

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Robert Rodriguez, a leader of New York's Hispanic community and former New York City Councilman from East Harlem-South Bronx, died on Sunday at the apartment of a friend in Albany. Mr. Rodriguez was 43.
The cause was a heart attack, the Albany County Coroner's office said. Mr. Rodriguez, who had been working for the State Department of Civil Service in Albany, was using the apartment of the friend, State Assemblyman Angelo Del Toro, a Democrat of Manhattan, while Mr. Del Toro was in New York City during the legislative recess. 
 At his death, Mr. Rodriguez was overseeing affirmative-action and diversity programs in state agencies for the Department of Civil Service. He joined the department 14 months ago to direct its Division of Diversity, Planning and Management.
Mr. Rodriguez had been active in community affairs in Manhattan, serving on the boards of Community School District No. 4, Metropolitan Hospital Center, the Harlem Urban Development Corporation, the East Harlem district of the Boy Scouts of America and the Edwin Gould Services for Children Foundation. He was a past chairman of the Community Mental Health Center, a Democratic district leader and a member of Community Planning Board No. 11 in East Harlem.
In 1979 he was a coordinator in New York's Hispanic community for Jimmy Carter's Presidential campaign.
Mr. Rodriguez was a member of the City Council from 1978 to 1982. He lost the Democratic primary that year to Carolyn B. Maloney, now a member of Congress.
He graduated from Alfred E. Smith High School in the Bronx and studied history at Nyack College. Before his election to the City Council, he was a senior employment consultant for the State Department of Labor's Equal Employment Opportunity Office in Manhattan.
More recently, he was director of labor relations in the city's Fire Department and chief of staff for Assemblyman Jose Serrano, after which he held executive positions at the SCS Business and Technical Institute in Manhattan and with the state's Hispanic Housing and Economic Development Task Force.
Mr. Rodriguez's survivors include his wife, Edith Delerme Rodriguez; his parents, Carmen and Juan Rodriguez; two sons, Robert J. and Jonathan R., and a daughter, Tina Rasheen, all of New York City.

HEADLINE: Will New York Accept Its Personal Credit Card?

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
It sounds like a David Letterman routine: New York, New York, the city that was tottering on the brink of bankruptcy 20 years ago, is considering creating its own credit card.
But Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that he had instructed city officials to look into the possibility of entering a partnership with a bank or credit-card company to offer a New York City card -- with some of the proceeds from sales going to the city treasury. 
 The arrangement the city is considering -- called an "affinity card" in the industry -- has been used in recent years by universities, sports franchises, environmental groups and radio stations to raise money and promote themselves.
New York would not actually be involved in lending money or dunning deadbeats. Rather, Visa, American Express or some other major credit-card company would issue a card featuring the city's name and some appropriate logo. Customers could say "I Love New York" with plastic, and the city would get a cut of the credit-card company's profit. The company benefits because the city promotes the card and creates new customers.
The Mayor said such a card could be sponsored by the city as a whole or by some agency like the Housing Authority or the Human Resources Administration.
John S. Dyson, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, said the idea of an affinity card was first broached by several credit-card companies.
"They're now doing cities and they asked us if we'd consider it," he said, envisioning cards emblazoned with the Statue of Liberty, the New York skyline, or, perhaps, a picture of the Mayor.
Mr. Dyson said that university affiliation cards could provide a model of how such a card would work.
"The college or university gets a very tiny fee for that association with Mastercard, Visa card -- I guess we wouldn't do Mastercard anymore," said Mr. Dyson, still smarting over Mastercard International's announcement last week that it was relocating its headquarters and 550 jobs from Manhattan to Westchester. The city, he said, would pick "someone who's not leaving home without us."
Mr. Dyson said he thought such a credit card could bring $1 million a year into city coffers or more depending on how many people choose to use the card and the volume of sales that were generated.
Plano, Texas already offers a city Visa card. And closer to home, South Orange, N. J. is preparing to issue the South Orange Mastercard in September.
"You can't keep asking taxpayers for money," said William R. Calabrese, a pharmacist who is the South Orange Village President. "So we decided how to find extra sources of revenue. I own a pharmacy and see affinity cards all year long, so we went to see if a municipality could do it."
Mr. Giuliani said that he had asked Corporation Counsel Paul A. Crotty to examine the legal aspects of starting a city credit card and Budget Director Abraham M. Lackman and Business Services Commissioner Rudy Washington to examine the fiscal aspects.
Mr. Dyson said that the city had already discovered one potential stumbling block to a credit-card plan -- that a firm, which he did not identify, was already offering New York credit cards "without any authorization." City lawyers, he said, would have to press the company to "cease and desist" so New York can license its name.
Mr. Giuliani did not say how long it would take him to make a decision. In the meantime, can Mr. Letterman resist? What are the top 10 reasons for getting a New York City credit card?

HEADLINE: THE RWANDA DISASTER: THE OVERVIEW;
PRESIDENT ORDERS PENTAGON ACTION TO AID RWANDANS

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
President Clinton ordered the Pentagon today to mount an enormous, urgent airlift to funnel relief supplies from around the world into Africa in an attempt to control the catastrophe facing more than a million Rwandan refugees now in Zaire.
 The American relief mission, which White House officials said was designed to mobilize a worldwide effort, was described by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, as "a race against time." But with every minute tolling another death at the cholera-stricken camps in Zaire, officials said it would take several days to mobilize the airlift fully. 
Setting up the airlift, involving installing the panoply of equipment that comes with modern airfields, is a task beyond the abilities of international relief organizations, and was the most significant new contribution on a day when Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali appealed for international aid to help alleviate the suffering of the Rwandan refugees. [Page 4.]
 Also today, the European Union pledged an additional $183 million in aid.
 "We're going to be doing everything we can, but there is going to be a time lag here," said J. Brian Atwood, head of the United States Agency for International Development.
 It will take time to supply the refugees with clean water, the one thing they need above all. Cholera, which kills by severe dehydration, is spread through contaminated water.
 In addition to organizing the airlift, the Pentagon was told today to take the leading role in providing water purification and distribution systems to supply 1.2 million refugees.
 But the tasks being undertaken by the Americans cover only about half of the needs described in recent days by relief organizations.
 Mr. Clinton also called on the United Nations to move as quickly as possible to deploy an international peacekeeping force to stabilize Rwanda and persuade refugees to return home. The Pentagon said that it expects to commit about 1,500 troops to the airlift, most of them in Africa, but that beyond security at the airfields, they would not be part of the peacekeeping force, which is being drawn largely from Africa.
 A new urgency seemed to grip the global relief effort today, with the world suddenly recognizing that every moment counts now that disease and hunger have replaced genocide as the main killers in the region. Cholera, in particular, can expand exponentially in the kind of conditions the refugees have created.
 Three months after the resumption of a civil war between Rwanda's two main ethnic groups, hundreds of thousands are dead and four or five million of the country's eight million people have been displaced. About two million of them have fled into neighboring countries, mainly Zaire.
 Mr. Clinton, calling the situation possibly "the world's worst humanitarian crisis in a generation," defended American relief efforts so far. "From the beginning of this tragedy, the United States has been in the forefront of the international community's response," he said.
 The United States has so far provided about 40 percent of all the relief aid in Rwanda, officials said, including about 100 planeloads of supplies, but they acknowledged that much more was needed.
 
'International Effort' Stressed
 "It's to be expected that we would do more than anyone else, but I do want to emphasize that this is an international effort, undertaken through the United Nations," Mr. Atwood of the Agency for International Development said.
 In all, the expanded American relief effort is expected to cost the Pentagon about $100 million, in addition to the $150 million or so already committed by the United States since the Rwandan crisis began in April. About $76 million of the American contributions so far were offered within the last week, too recently for their effect to have been felt yet.
 Mr. Clinton also urged the public to increase charitable donations to the many relief organizations struggling to assist the Rwandans.
 The expansion of the aid effort came after several days of intense criticism of the Administration, which was accused of not doing enough.This morning those criticisms continued in Congress.
 "We have the largest, best-trained army in the world that is catatonic," said Representative Harry A. Johnston, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, scolding Michael Myers, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Humanitarian and Refugee Affairs, who was briefing the subcommittee on the expansion of aid.
 "It refuses to move," said Mr. Johnston, a Florida Democrat. "It is frozen in place."
 But military officials said they were now moving as rapidly as possible to get supplies, especially water purification equipment, to the scene.
 "It is, in fact, a race against time, and there's no luxury to be sitting on our hands, and we don't intend to do that," General Shalikashvili said.
 Officials said 20 million packages of oral rehydration salts, the first-aid treatment for cholera victims, would be delivered within two days, with other food and medical equipment following right behind.
 Two military transport planes were already bound for Zaire, and were expected to arrive there on Saturday, one carrying medical supplies and the other hauling six 10-ton forklifts, needed to unload an increasing flow of supplies into the camps.
 Beginning on Saturday, officials said, 42 flights would depart carrying 1,480 tons of food and other supplies requested by international relief agencies. The Pentagon is also considering dropping daily food rations by parachute beginning on Sunday.
 But the biggest problem is to provide an adequate supply of clean water, along with other sanitation equipment, and that is likely to take many days. To move water, purification equipment, trucks and other heavy supplies into the remote areas where the refugees have concentrated requires creating a logistical chain with its central base at Entebbe, Uganda, its rearward collection points in Germany and its front lines at the desperately under-equipped airfields in Zaire.About 1,500 military personnel are expected to be involved within a week or so.
 Deputy Defense Secretary John M. Deutch said the Pentagon would take on these logistical tasks:
 *Providing air traffic control for the airfields at Goma and Bukavu in Zaire, and perhaps at other smaller airfields near the refugee centers, letting them operate 24 hours a day.
 *Providing military security at the airfields.
 *Deploying equipment for unloading aircraft from all over the world, trucks for distributing supplies, survey teams to assess where the supplies are most needed, and computer systems to track the supplies.
 *Controlling all flights into and out of Entebbe, fueling the planes, keeping supplies in warehouses and forwarding them to the refugee centers.
 The array of equipment to be moved in a few days is staggering: runway lights, radios, mess halls, pumps, piping, forklifts and the water purification devices themselves, hauled in from the island depot at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, Mr. Deutch said.

HEADLINE: Fed Nominee Gives Views on Rates

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
Janet L. Yellen, President Clinton's nominee to the Federal Reserve Board, dispelled some of the mystery surrounding her views on interest-rate policy today but did not take a clear position on whether she would support further increases in interest rates this year.
The views that Ms. Yellen sketched out at her confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee today suggested that she might be slightly less willing than her future colleagues to raise rates to curb inflation, but would still fall within the mainstream at the central bank. 
 If confirmed by the full Senate, as seems likely soon, Ms. Yellen would become President Clinton's second appointee on the seven-member Federal Reserve Board. Alan S. Blinder, a former member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, joined the board last month.
 
 
Campaign Consequences
 Some Wall Street economists have speculated that the new nominees may be slightly more reluctant to raise interest rates and slightly more willing to tolerate inflation than the five Republican appointees. The Fed's decisions in the coming months will have a tremendous influence on the health of the American economy in 1996, when President Clinton is expected to seek re-election.
Mr. Blinder at his confirmation hearing in May and Ms. Yellen at her hearing today both sought to present themselves as middle-of-the-road economists who would prevent inflation from rising, while also trying to avoid pushing interest rates to levels that might induce a recession.
But a hint of skepticism about interest-rate increases arose in Ms. Yellen's remarks when she discussed the central bank's four decisions this spring to raise short-term rates.
"I agree with the Fed's decision to reduce monetary stimulus -- before the emergence of obvious inflationary pressure -- in order to avoid overshooting the natural rate" of economic growth, she said. "On the other hand, the appropriate amount of tightening involves some guesswork and it is difficult to know whether the actions that have been taken thus far will prove sufficient to prevent overheating, insufficient to the task at hand or possibly excessive."
By contrast, when Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, testified today before the House Banking Committee, he never mentioned any possibility that the central bank might have gone too far. He repeated warnings from his testimony to the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday that he saw some warning signs of possible inflation ahead. As he also did on Wednesday, Mr. Greenspan indicated that a fifth increase in the central bank's short-term interest rate target this year was possible in the near future.
Mr. Greenspan warned in particular that the fall in the dollar might signal that investors expected inflation. In previous appearances before Congress this year, he has warned that such expectations can be self-fulfilling and that breaking them with higher interest rates is one of the Fed's top priorities.
 
 
 
Possible Inflation Threats
 In a list of possible sources of future inflation, Mr. Greenspan mentioned rising prices for manufacturing materials, backlogs for some goods and recent shortages of some types of workers, notably in the construction and trucking industries.
The overall tone of Ms. Yellen's comments was not that different from Mr. Greenspan's. She contended that the Fed's target should be to keep the economy growing no faster than growth in the economy's underlying capacity to produce goods and services. And she warned against tolerating inflation so as to achieve short-term reductions in unemployment, saying that inflation would inflict long-run harm to the economy.
But Ms. Yellen, 47, startled some in the audience when she emphasized the needs of working people. "What the Fed should be pursuing is the economic welfare of working people, of all Americans," she said.
The central bank has more commonly been known for its links and sympathies with Wall Street and big commercial banks.
Ms. Yellen is a professor of international business and trade at the University of California at Berkeley and is best known among economists for her writings on wages.
She said she would pursue all of the targets laid out by Congress in a 1978 Democratic amendment to the Fed's charter -- "maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Nigerian Strike Pushing Up Oil Prices to Near $20 Level

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Crude oil prices rose yesterday with nervousness over Nigeria's three-week-long oil workers' strike expected to push a test of the key $20-a-barrel level next week, traders said.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, September crude oil futures rose 22 cents, to $19.61 a barrel. Nymex prices hit $20.43 on July 12 as a result of the Nigerian strike, the first time in a year prices had been above $20. 
 "This market is still a function of Nigeria," said William Brown at W. H. Brown & Company in New York. "The situation hasn't improved that much, so prices may firm a bit more."
Crude rose after the 150,000-member oil union in Nigeria walked out of a meeting with Government officials, abruptly stalling an effort to end a pro-democracy strike that has crippled most business activity.
"What we've seen in the last month is a reluctance to be short over the weekend because there is more risk to the upside near term," said Gerald Samuels, managing director of ARB Oil in Los Angeles.
Traders said oil prices were also affected by tight United States crude supplies, growing oil demand and maintenance work in the North Sea during August that will cut world supplies.
 
Market Awaits Fed Moves
 Gold ended firmer on the Commodities Exchange, but analysts said the market received little direction from Congressional testimony by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. August gold ended 70 cents higher at $385 an ounce.
The market was awaiting moves by the Fed to raise interest rates following comments by Mr. Greenspan earlier in the week interpreted as signaling a rate rise soon, analysts said.
New York cotton futures closed their 2-cent limit up, buoyed by heavy buying by speculative funds. December cotton closed at 72.25 cents a pound on worries about tight supplies.
"This is the breakout we have been looking for the last two weeks," said Sharon Johnson, cotton analyst with Frank Schneider & Company. "Fundamentally, the current cash tightness appears to be the bullish factor behind the move."
Cotton hit a three-year high above 78 cents in May on estimates for heavy exports and smaller crops overseas before retreating on profit-taking.

2d-Quarter Profit Down 28% at Bankers Trust

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Tough trading conditions and a drop in customer demand for derivative securities and risk-management services contributed to a 28 percent drop in second-quarter profits at the Bankers Trust New York Corporation.
Bankers Trust, the nation's seventh-largest banking company, said yesterday that it earned $181 million, or $2.09 a share, in the quarter, down from $251 million, or $2.90 a share, a year earlier. 
 Despite the drop in net income, Timothy Yates, the company's chief financial officer, said that in a number of respects the second-quarter results represented a "strong turnaround" from the first three months of 1994.
 
 
Higher Trading Revenues
 In a conference call with analysts, Mr. Yates said that income from the bank's proprietary trading operations totaled $52 million in the second quarter, compared with a $49 million loss in the first quarter.
Trading revenues were also sharply higher, at $124 million, up from $14 million in the first three months of the year. But the second-quarter number loses much of its luster when compared with the $405 million in trading revenues recorded in the comparable three months of 1993, a period when the bull market for securities of all stripes was surging.
The performance of the bank's derivatives business, once seen as a fairly stable and important moneymaker, shrank sharply.
Profits from derivatives, which are contracts derived from underlying financial assets like stocks, bonds and interest rates, were $50 million in the second quarter, less than half of the record $114 million the bank made on derivatives in the first three months of the year.
"Markets continued to be difficult," Mr. Yates said. To adapt, the bank assumed a risk profile that was "conservative, close to home and opportunistic," he said.
Mr. Yates said the derivatives business was affected by a decline in the use of sophisticated products by both corporations and institutional investors like pension funds and mutual funds.
Although Bankers Trust's earnings were below Wall Street's expectations of $2.43 a share, the company's shares gained 62.5 cents yesterday to close at $65.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Still, many analysts were disappointed by the earnings. "Frankly, we thought the numbers were horrible," said Lawrence W. Cohn, an analyst at Paine Webber Group. "The trading results were quite disappointing, and earnings included a substantial amount of what looks like nonrecurring income."
Among those one-time gains were income stemming from the refinancing of Brazil's commercial bank debt, insurance payments related to a January 1993 fire at the bank's headquarters at 280 Park Avenue in Manhattan, and securities and venture capital gains.
Unlike other big banks, Bankers Trust declined to specify how much Brazil added to its bottom line in the second quarter and refused to say how much all of the one-time earnings added to net income.
"They wouldn't say how much it was," Mr. Cohn said. "It was aggravating."
Outside of trading, Bankers Trust said revenues from funds management rose 6 percent from a year earlier, to $180 million, reflecting growth in services for wealthy clients and new securities-processing business.
Reflecting more difficult conditions, Bankers Trust said expenses were pared in the second quarter by just under 8 percent from the second quarter of last year, to $688 million. Much of that cut was a result of a 35 percent drop in bonus expense, reflecting reduced earnings.
Mr. Cohn said that if financial market conditions remained volatile, the drop in bonus expense would likely be followed by layoffs.
If current trends in financial markets continue for another three to six months, Mr. Cohn added, "bankers and everybody else on Wall Street will be cutting expenses, and people."

Dollar Rallies Against Mark But Doesn't Gain vs. the Yen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The dollar rallied against the German mark yesterday as more traders appeared to believe that United States officials want the dollar to rise.
But the dollar failed to advance against the yen because traders fear that there will not be progress in trade negotiations between the United States and Japan. 
 The dollar's rally against most leading currencies yesterday came after the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, told the House Banking Committee, "It is in our interest to have a stronger dollar."
Mr. Greenspan's comments echoed those made on Thursday by Lawrence H. Summers, the Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs, who said that a stronger dollar would restore faith in American financial markets and contain inflation.
For many traders, the two officials' remarks showed that the Fed and the Clinton Administration were no longer at odds over the currency.
"This is the first time since Clinton took office that the Fed, the Treasury and the White House are all on the same side about the dollar," said Angelo Evangelista, vice president in charge of currency trading at the Bank of America.
The dollar tumbled to a post-World War II low against the yen and a 20-month low against the mark earlier this month, in part because traders believed that the Administration wanted the dollar to remain weak.
 
'Edge of the Abyss'
 "Last week, the dollar was teetering at the edge of the abyss," said Marc Cohen, managing director at C-Wave Capital Management, a currency-trading fund in Fort Lee, N.J. "Now it's at a very important crossroads. It will rally across the board if there is a trade deal between the U.S. and Japan."
In New York trading yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.6020 marks, its highest level since July 4, before settling at 1.5985 marks, up from 1.5927 marks. The dollar fell to 98.95 yen yesterday, from 99.20 yen on Thursday.
Mr. Evangelista of the Bank of America said the Clinton Administration had reversed its dollar policy because the currency's weakness contributed to a slump in the bond market. That slump drove up the low interest rates that were central to Mr. Clinton's plan for stimulating the economy and reducing the Federal deficit.
"The U.S. was behaving recklessly with the dollar," Mr. Evangelista said. "They've learned from their mistakes."
In other currency trading in New York, the dollar was quoted at 5.4650 French francs, up from 5.4510 francs late yesterday. The dollar strengthened to 1.3567 Swiss francs from 1.3465 francs and rose to 1,587 Italian lire from 1,582 lire. The British pound rose to $1.5275 from $1.5250. The Canadian dollar was steady at 72.61 United States cents.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Thrilling, Dangerous: Betting on Currencies

BYLINE: By Francis Flaherty

 BODY:
YOU finish the newspapers, heave a sigh and call your broker. "The yen's done rising," you say. "It's the dollar's day now. Let's take a shot." You lean back, confident you've parsed the currency news as deftly as the billionaire financier George Soros . . .
It's a nice daydream -- but keep it that way, warned Maria Scott of the American Association of Individual Investors. Despite the yen's enticing recent rise, currency plays are too risky and complex for nearly everyone, "even for economists." 
 But Michael Schwartz, senior vice president at Oppenheimer, says investors less flush than Mr. Soros can use currency both to profit and to hedge. Two good vehicles are currency options and their low-priced cousins, currency warrants.
The profits from these bets on currency certainly can be fast and big. Imagine an investor, bullish on the yen's prospects against the dollar, who had spent $1,250 on June 24 for one three-month option to buy yen at 100 yen to the dollar. As the yen rose he could have sold the option on July 12 for $2,638 -- a 111 percent profit in 18 days. (Individuals rarely invoke, or "exercise," options; they are usually just bought and sold, or held as insurance until expiration.)
But there are caveats. Options are for relatively well-off investors, Mr. Schwartz said, and even they "should not go blindly into" this complex market, where fast turns can unseat even the most deft. The yen option worth $2,638 on July 12, for instance, fell to $1,519 on July 19.
And while option investors cannot lose more than the price, or premium -- which ranges from $5 for one warrant to several thousand dollars for an option -- they can lose much or all of that. If the investor was mistakenly bearish on the yen, he might have bought an option to sell yen, a "put," rather than buy them, a "call." But if he did, his premium of $1,556 would have dwindled to $587 by July 12 -- a 62 percent loss in 18 days.
Ms. Scott agrees with these cautions, and then some. Currency plays are exciting, but "they are more betting than investing," she said. Not only do currency movements confound the best, but to make money on them you must get two things right -- where the currency will go and when.
But some may want to play George Soros for a day with a prudently small sum. For them, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange is the place to be. It is the nation's largest marketplace for listed currency options, said Paul Adair, an exchange director.
It is a growing marketplace, too. Through mid-July, 51,225 currency options traded daily on average, up from 42,865 in 1991. Dollar-based options come in eight currencies and the option periods now include 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and more months. The two nondollar options are the mark-yen and the mark-pound.
After choosing a currency and deciding between a put and a call, an investor must select the option period and the strike price, or the exchange rate that will trigger the option. If yen now trade at 98.5 to the dollar, for instance, an investor might buy a yen put with a strike price of 99.
All these factors affect the premium. Longer option periods cost more, for example, as do strike prices close to the currency's market price.
Similar to currency options in most respects, currency warrants are traded mainly on the American Stock Exchange. Like options, they can be used not just to speculate but also to shield foreign holdings from currency risk, said Nathan Most, a senior vice president at the exchange.
"Suppose I own some stocks in Japan," he said. "The market's been good there, and the rising yen has been an added benefit. But I'm concerned about the yen outlook." With warrants, such an investor can seal in gains against an iffy yen.
True, not many Americans directly own stocks abroad, Mr. Most said. But many do own the foreign stock certificates traded here known as American depository receipts, and the same hedging technique works for them, he said. A.D.R.'s trade for more than 300 large foreign companies, including Cadbury Schweppes of Britain, Elf Aquitaine of France and Sony and Toyota of Japan.
While many mutual funds that invest abroad hedge for themselves, investors can use options "for funds that do not hedge, or do not hedge all the time," Mr. Schwartz said. Such funds are common. Among funds that can hedge, "most do so 'occasionally,' " said Eileen Sanders, of Morningstar. A large handful never hedge, she said, including T. Rowe Price International Bond, Smith Barney International Equity A and some Templeton funds.
Ms. Sanders sees some limited circumstances in which fund investors might hedge with options or warrants, but "there is enough variety among funds to find one that hedges in your category." So why not let professionals do it?
Moreover, long-term investors will find it very expensive to hedge over the whole investment period. The $1,250 premium paid by Mr. Schwartz's yen investor covered about $62,000 in yen -- a 2 percent hit for three months, excluding $70 to $100 in commissions for the option.
Even an investor planning to unload some foreign stocks does not need option hedges, Ms. Scott said. It is wiser, she contends, to sell off the equities gradually, as the time approaches when the money is needed.

HEADLINE: TAXES;
Steering Clear of a Trap In Generational Giving

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
UNLIKE most Americans, who suffer an acute attack of manana syndrome when confronted with the need for estate planning, you have prepared a will, perhaps even trust documents.
Congratulations. Now you can rest assured that your assets will go to your heirs, including grandchildren, not the Government. And if there is a family business, it will not have to be sold to pay taxes. 
 But there is a villain that could upset these well-laid plans. It is the little-known generation-skipping tax, which is levied at a flat 55 percent on gifts and bequests in excess of $1 million that go to grandchildren or others in a second generation, and is intended to make up for estate tax that the Internal Revenue Service does not get to collect when one generation is bypassed.
Because the real estate and other assets of a family business often exceed $1 million, business owners need to be particularly careful to avoid springing this tax trap.
"As a general rule, most people don't have to worry about it," said Ross W. Nager of Houston, managing director of Family Wealth Planning Services for Arthur Andersen & Company. "The big exception is trusts. With insurance trusts, it is particularly surreptitious. Put in small dollar amounts, and one day it will sneak up and bite you."
In some ways the generation-skipping rules are parallel to those for gift and estate taxes, in which there is a $600,000 unified credit. Up to $600,000 may be left to heirs tax-free unless the credit has been reduced by individual gifts of more than $10,000 during one's lifetime.
Similarly, direct gifts to a grandchild of up to $10,000 are free from the generation-skipping tax.
Here's the rub: assets placed in a trust for grandchildren or left to them in a will may appreciate substantially, resulting in an unexpected tax burden.
Furthermore, gifts to a trust, like the annual premium on a life insurance policy, are not automatically covered by the $10,000 exclusion. Mr. Nager explained that donors could file a generation-skipping tax exemption election each year, so that, say, the $4,000 annual premium is exempt. Without this annual gift-tax filing, the tax could ultimately be levied on the entire proceeds of the policy. This filing is often overlooked, Mr. Nager said, because it is one line of the fourth page of a gift-tax return.
Similarly, someone who wishes to give a stake in a family business to a grandchild can do so by having the business appraised, giving stock to the grandchild over a period of years and filing the annual exemption election if the gift is more than $10,000 (or if any amount is put in trust for the grandchild). If the stock is left to the grandchild in a will, it might eventually be subject to tax at an appreciated value.
Charles Cangro, senior tax manager with Ernst & Young in New York, said, "The trick is to allocate the exemption early before the assets grow too substantially."
Tim Kochis, president of Kochis & Fitz, personal financial consultants in San Francisco, cautioned people to be realistic about their financial situation. "The important issue is whether one can afford to take an aggressive approach to making gifts," he said.
For example, many couples in their 60's with assets of $1 million to $2 million feel affluent and want to do something for their grandchildren. "But they may live another 20 or 30 years," he said, and a setback in terms of the market, health or inflation could deplete their savings.
"There is an appropriate balance between tax planning and cash flow and investment planning," Mr. Kochis said. "Also, there may be personal, psychological and family reasons for not doing so."
But psychology cuts both ways. Mr. Kochis described one client who was like a racer who kept running, unaware he had passed the finish line. He had amassed a net worth of about $15 million through a lifetime of hard work, "but still had a working-class mentality," feeling he had to struggle and could not help his grandchildren as he would have liked.
Mr. Kochis ran a number of "what-if scenarios" on retirement planning software, showing him that even if he lived to a very old age and his investment returns were exceedingly low, he could easily afford the gifts.

SADE: A Biography
By Maurice Lever. Translated by Arthur Goldhammer. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $15.95.
This life of the infamous marquis shows that he came from a family of libertines, and attempts to link all his fictional debaucheries to actual events in his past. Although these connections cannot be verified, Lynn Hunt said here last year, Sade's lurid career unfolds "with verve and vivid detail."
IF IT BE NOT I: Collected Poems, 1959-1982
By Mona Van Duyn. Knopf, $15.
A former poet laureate of the United States, the author has created a rich body of work that comprises whimsical, sometimes rhyming poems and somber meditations. This collection, which incorporates her previous seven books, includes poems inspired by everything from the tribulations of Cinderella to a bout of conjunctivitis. Knopf has reissued it simultaneously with Ms. Van Duyn's most recent book, FIREFALL ($11), in which she explores a form she refers to as the "minimalist sonnet." Last year our reviewer, Rachel Hadas, said of both books, "However rich, Ms. Van Duyn's voice is never bland; particularity inflects her love of the world." 

UNDER FIRE: The NRA and the Battle for Gun Control
By Osha Gray Davidson. Owl/Holt, $13.95.
The author traces the history of the National Rifle Association, which began as an organization devoted to military preparedness and evolved into an uncompromising Second Amendment lobby only in the late 1970's. "There is a lesson in this book about the dangers of absolutism," Wendy Kaminer said here last year.
PARTICLES AND LUCK
By Louis B. Jones. Vintage Contemporaries, $12.
Here are 24 hours in the life of Mark Perdue, a gifted young California physicist who is suddenly confronted with the potential loss of his home -- and other metaphysical possibilities. Last year our reviewer, Carolyn See, said, "What a smart novel 'Particles and Luck' is."
EXPLODING THE GENE MYTH: How Genetic Information
Is Produced and Manipulated by Scientists, Physicians,
Employers, Insurance Companies, Educators,
and Law Enforcers
By Ruth Hubbard and Elijah Wald. Beacon, $12.
News reports that genes may be responsible for everything from cancer to homosexuality imply that heredity is somehow destiny, argue the authors. They caution against this reductionism while examining the profit motive in genetic research. "What is of particular value is the book's sharp eye for newspaper headlines," Daniel Callahan said here last year. In the same review he also praised THE HUMAN BODY SHOP: The Engineering and Marketing of Life, by Andrew Kimbrell (Harper SanFrancisco, $12), which discusses the implications not only of genetic engineering, but also of fetal tissue transplants and surrogate motherhood. "Mr. Kimbrell tells this story effectively and fully," Mr. Callahan said.
GREEN GRASS, RUNNING WATER
By Thomas King. Bantam, $9.95.
Lionel Red Dog, a Blackfoot Indian who makes his living selling televisions and stereos, is having a midlife crisis that revolves, in part, around the fear that he may have "gone white." His fate and that of several other Indian characters are intertwined in what our reviewer, James McManus, described last year as an "impressively ambitious and funny" novel. A more sorrowful look at Indian life is offered in MESSENGER BIRD, by Dan McCall (Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $9.95), the story of the two years a young surgeon spends on an Apache reservation in New Mexico in the early 1970's and the Sioux nurse he meets there. "The early medical anecdotes . . . are perfectly calculated to set up McCall's understated, elegiac plot," one critic said last year.
SLIM'S TABLE: Race, Respectability, and Masculinity
By Mitchell Duneier. University of Chicago, $9.95.
A sociologist chronicles the lives of a group of working-class black men he met at a Chicago cafeteria, finding in their experiences a bedrock of pride, honor and devotion to duty that is rarely noted in commentary on the nonwhite urban poor. In 1992 our reviewer, Roger Wilkins, said Mr. Duneier "sees the scale of their lives as fully human, rather than as diminished versions of grander lives lived elsewhere by people of another color." Values in the black community are also the subject of CLIMBING JACOB'S LADDER: The Enduring Legacy of African-American Families, by Andrew Billingsley (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $14). High unemployment, the author argues, is the biggest factor contributing to the downturn in black marriage. "He combines an unflinching look at current troubles in the black family with an appreciation of its abiding strengths," Arlie Russell Hochschild said here last year. One black woman's struggles are detailed in VOLUNTEER SLAVERY: My Authentic Negro Experience, by Jill Nelson (Penguin, $9.95). The author describes the four years she worked at The Washington Post, where she maintains black staff members were often belittled and underpaid. Last year our reviewer, Patsy Sims, called it "an angry yet often funny memoir."
FISHBOY: A Ghost's Story
By Mark Richard. Anchor/Doubleday, $9.95.
A deformed boy stows away on an ocean trawler, where he becomes witness to the numerous depravities practiced by its murderous crew. The author "has folded a host of exquisitely rendered tales into a stunning novel," Margot Mifflin said here last year.
KIPPER'S GAME
By Barbara Ehrenreich. Harper Perennial, $12.
This journalist's first novel concerns a woman's search for her missing son, a brilliant computer hacker who is the recent inventor of a mysterious new game. Last year our reviewer, Michael Upchurch, said, "The notion of a link between intellectual curiosity and a physiologically based aphrodisia is an arresting one."

An Earful of Noisy Sludge From Three New York Bands

BYLINE: By NEIL STRAUSS 

 BODY:
IT MAY SEEM GLAMOROUS when New York is described in tourist brochures as the city that never sleeps, but it's also the city that never washes. The walls of the subway stations are blackened from years of neglect. The streets of the East Village smell worse than the open fish markets of Chinatown and even the Upper East Side has become a labyrinth of overflowing garbage bags.
For bands based in the Lower East Side like Helmet, Unsane and Surgery, making music that reflects the environment means turning rock-and-roll into dirty, noisy sludge that assaults instead of soothes. 
 Helmet, the best known of New York's new crop of post-heavy-metal groups, plays songs that sound as if they've been cut in half. The high end of music -- bright guitar notes, chirpy cymbal crashes, sunny melodies, a sense of humor -- is entirely absent, replaced by a monochrome, bass-heavy din. Page Hamilton and Rob Echeverria don't jam on their guitars, they grind, and they do it in unison with the driving bass playing of Henry Bogdan and the stolid drumbeat of John Stanier. The result is a tight rhythmic package that refuses to be separated into separate components.
On its third album, "Betty" (Interscope 92404, CD and cassette; Amphetamine Reptile 097, LP), Helmet tries to expand its scope by singing instead of screaming ("Biscuits for Smut") and playing jazz-metal fusion ("Beautiful Lover") and blues from the Lower East Side ("Sam Hell"). Though "Betty" is easier to approach than Helmet's relentlessly noisy 1990 debut, "Strap It On," it is still a one-dimensional album, characterized by Helmet's heavy metal sans metal.
Where the sprawling solos and head-banging rhythms of heavy metal promise escape and release, Helmet's static songs and hypnotic grooves offer confinement and solace. Music making for the band has become less an act of emotion and passion than an art of precision. Mr. Hamilton, who has served time in the guitar orchestras of the minimalist composer Glenn Branca, creates mathematical metal that is spare and economical. Everything in his symphony of the city fits neatly into place, and no noise is extraneous.
The album's only weak link is the lyrics, which are obtuse non sequiturs that seem meant as advice to the weak and wicked. "Spread your mind the fish feed," Mr. Hamilton babbles on "Clean." "Don't ignore my speech, my heart bleeds." His lyrics constantly return to visions of blood, dirt, drugs and disease, but these images are more sharply invoked in his hard and heavy guitar playing.
Where Helmet accepts the noise of the city without glorifying or denigrating it, Unsane wallows in it like bears at a garbage dump. The covers on all three of the trio's albums feature photographs of grisly murder scenes. The distorted vocals on its most recent album, "Total Destruction" (Matador/Atlantic Ole-070; all three formats), are incomprehensible, but song titles like "Body Bomb" and "Go Away" adequately depict Unsane's antipathy.
Unsane, whose original drummer died of a heroin overdose two years ago, is well acquainted with the urban tragedies that fuel its brutal sound. Beyond Chris Shore's heavy guitar attacks and Vinnie Signorelli's adrenaline-fueled drumming lies the foundation of the band's music: Peter Shore's hard-edged bass playing. He rips and roars as much as any lead guitarist. Mr. Shore keeps the music lowdown and dirty, bringing it closer to the industrial-infused grind of their fellow New York noisemakers the Swans and Cop Shoot Cop. Like "Betty," "Total Destruction" offers few hooks to hold onto. The trio is too concerned with creating an overall bad impression to allow any song to stand out.
Surgery puts a little more emphasis on songwriting on its second full-length album, "Shimmer" (Atlantic 82579, CD and cassette; Amphetamine Reptile 579, LP). In any other city, Surgery would be a rowdy Rolling Stones cover band. As residents of the Lower East Side, they've fused their British blues-rock complex with an unhealthy dose of New York cynicism and angst.
"I hate this music, and I hate this night," Sean McDonnell snarls on "Bootywhack." "I want to smash every stereo in sight." Like Helmet, Surgery operates in the low end of rock's frequency spectrum, bringing the bass to the center of their sound, rarely hitting the high strings on the guitar, and churning out music that values density over melody.
Other New York City bands -- like Girls Against Boys, Boss Hog and Wider -- are pursuing similar post-metal obsessions, making music that evokes the seedy side of city living and indulging in lyrics about hate and drugs. Does this mean a New York sludge rock scene similar to Seattle's grunge rock scene is on the horizon? If it is, it will probably follow the cardinal rule set out in the Helmet song "The Silver Hawaiian": "Find 'em and grind 'em and never remind 'em."

HEADLINE: Shannon River

 BODY:
To the Editor: Having returned in June from my fourth boating adventure on the Shannon River, I can attest that it is every bit idyllic as Robert Emmett Ginna Jr. states in his article "Down the Storied Shannon" (June 12). The Shannon's passage from use for commercial shipping, coupled with the excellent navigational marking system, create ideal conditions.
It amazes me that I've never met any other Americans on the river, while the Dutch, Germans and other Continental Europeans dominate the rental boat market, owing perhaps to the overcrowded nature of many navigable European rivers. 
 Although many come for the superb fishing, this year I noticed signs posted on navigational markers and under bridge arches saying "Do not kill pike" in four languages. Several residents in Shannonbridge told me the pike was in danger of being fished out, and serious inroads had been made into the trout and coarse fish such as bream, rudd, perch and tench. Pollution is also having an impact the fish, avian and other wildlife populations.
This comes at a time when Ireland is attempting to promote increased tourism on the Shannon. While this is all very well for increasing prosperity, it bodes less well for the environmental health of the river, including the unparalleled recreational fishing.
Although it is difficult to balance recreational needs and economic growth with environmentally sound practices, this must be accomplished before an outstanding resource is irreparably harmed.

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/409 Edgecombe Avenue;
An Address That Drew the City's Black Elite

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
THE 1917 apartment house at 409 Edgecombe Avenue, just south of 155th Street, is 13 stories tall, unusual in a sea of more modest buildings half its height. It was designated as a city landmark a year ago because from the 30's to the 50's it was the address of choice for some of New York City's black elite.
After a generation of decline, it is now near a city-sponsored co-op conversion. 
 While the hillside site in Manhattan looks over Jackie Robinson Park and has a commanding view of the Harlem River Valley, Schwartz & Gross, the architects, were artistically unmoved by this panorama and recycledd the same tepid neo-Georgian formula they used on scores of other apartment houses of this period.
Upon completion in 1917, 409 Edgecombe Avenue was like any other new apartment house in the city. Its occupants were middle-class, with small families -- and all white. The latest available source for racial composition for specific addresses is the 1925 New York State census and it records 83 white families.
Of these, only seven had live-in servants, two of whom were black, the only people of their race in the building.
A real estate recession in 1905 began to open new buildings in central Harlem to black tenants and by the 1920's Harlem was the nation's largest black settlement, gradually expanding to buildings farther north and south.
One of these was 409 Edgecombe Avenue, which had its first black tenants in the late 20's. By the 40's, it was filled with the city's black elite, who selected it in part because of its luxury relative to the less expensive, lower buildings around it.
The earliest identified black tenant was Julius Bledsoe, a classical concert singer and composer in the late 20's. He also took popular parts -- for example, as Joe he sang "Ole Man River" in the Ziegfeld premiere of "Show Boat" in 1927. In 1929, Walter Francis White moved in, just as he began his tenure as acting secretary, and later executive secretary, of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which lasted until his death in 1955. His apartment was called the "White House of Harlem," says the Landmarks Preservation Commission's designation report.
Tenants who arrived in the 30's included Aaron Douglas, a Paris-trained painter known as the "father of black American art," who moved in in 1934, and Roy Wilkins, who later succeeded Mr. White as head of the N.A.A.C.P., who arrived in 1936.
The 40's brought the scholar-critic W.E.B. DuBois, who had split from the N.A.A.C.P. in 1935 as part of his increasing radicalization; William Stanley Braithwaite, poet, editor and anthropologist; Clarence Cameron White, violinist and composer, and Thurgood Marshall, then an N.A.A.C.P. lawyer.
Mr. Marshall won a string of civil rights cases culminating in 1954 when the United States Supreme Court decided, in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kan., found the "separate but equal" system of education unconstitutional. He served on the Court from 1967 to 1991.
Brown v. Board of Education is considered one of the turning points in racial justice in the United States. But at a time when white New Yorkers often considered civil rights a Southern problem, what was life like for those who lived in 409 Edgecombe Avenue?
Marvel Cooke, who was an assistant to Mr. DuBois, has lived at 409 Edgecombe Avenue since 1932. She says that at the time of the Brown v. Board of Education, no building in the white areas of Manhattan would rent to a black New Yorker.
Harry G. Bragg Jr. says his family -- his father was an assistant New York State attorney general -- moved into 409 Edgecombe Avenue in 1933 when he was an infant. In 1966, he says, he was looking for an apartment on West End Avenue. His first wife, light skinned enough to be mistaken for a Southern European, signed the lease and left a check. Mr. Bragg, who is much darker, came in two days later to co-sign.
UPON meeting the husband, the agent "just sort of looked -- he sure hadn't figured on me," said Mr. Bragg. He then asked for a statement of the couple's worth and, later, made a succession of further requests.
Frustrated, Mr. Bragg finally went to the city's Human Rights Commission, which secured the apartment for the couple. "I'm still the only black person in this building -- and they're probably happy about that," he added.
From its high point in the 40's and 50's, 409 Edgecombe Avenue went into a decline, and it was taken back for taxes by the city in 1979. Now New York City is preparing to sell it back to its tenants for $250 an apartment.
Some tenants have objected, temporarily blocking the sale, but the building manager, Norman Skinner, expects a closing sometime this summer.
He says that the maintenance for a typical two-bedroom apartment will be the same as the present rent, $515 a month, and so the building will be on a sound financial basis.

HEADLINE: New Life Is Near For Old State House

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN 

 BODY:
THE Old State House in Hartford was once described by a state historian, Arthur Van Deusen, as Connecticut's "single most important building."
Single most important or not, the graceful brick and brownstone structure designed by the Revolutionary War era architect Charles Bulfinch, has suffered many perilous moments in its nearly two centuries of history. On several occasions, its very existence was in jeopardy, the latest in 1975 when Hartford was riding the crest of redevelopment. 
 The city's Common Council, which owned the building, cut off funds for it, in essence dooming it. The council had decided that if the building could not be self-sustaining -- a restaurant had been suggested -- then the site, smack in the center of the city, might find a better use.
"There was talk about a parking lot," Wilson H. Faude said. Actually, he more spit it out than said it. "A parking lot! And you know, a lot of people were in favor of that."
 
Bow Ties and Ideas
 Mr. Faude, known equally for his colorful bow ties and colorful ideas and opinions, is executive director of the Old State House Association, an organization formed to save the building after its brush with death two decades ago.
Today, he is jubilant about the future of the venerable structure that served from 1796 until 1878 as Connecticut's capitol, then became Hartford's City Hall until the World War I era and served other purposes, including headquarters for the Chamber of Commerce.
A $10 million restoration project, financed by sources ranging from school children's nickels and dimes to major state and foundation grants, is on track, Mr. Faude said. Work started in October 1992 and will be finished this November, he said. The building is scheduled to reopen in the spring.
 
Hustle and Bustle
 Meanwhile, painters, carpenters and electricians scurry around the old structure, an unusual scene today on Main Street in Hartford. The city has gone from unbridled redevelopment to almost total stagnation in one generation. The paradox of the situation, with all the hustle and bustle over an old building that was once threatened by a parking lot, is not lost on Mr. Faude. "We're the only redevelopment project now," he said.
When the redevelopment project is completed, he said, visitors will see a very historic building that is now structurally sound, with a foundation resting on bedrock for the first time, accessible to handicapped people, gleaming with new paint and again displaying the majesty it once enjoyed. The Senate chamber will be restored, complete to its white oak flooring, as it was when President James Monroe and President Andrew Jackson visited in the first half of the last century. This too was the scene of the Hartford Convention in 1814, when representatives of the New England states met secretly to protest the unpopular war with Britain. The House of Representatives chamber, later used as the meeting place for Hartford's Common Council will reflect that period, complete to its new red oak floor.
 
Exciting and Inviting
 With all the emphasis on historical accuracy, the graceful old lady of Main Street will not be a curio where visitors come to stand behind ropes or to peer at historical documents under glass, Mr. Faude said. You can only succeed in the museum business today by making them exciting and inviting, he said. "If you keep doing things the same old way, you're finished," he said. "Museums have gotten too antiseptic. You've got to give people a reason to come in today."
He has plans to do that. They include workers in period costumes, vendors in costume on the Main Street side, a park as a quiet sanctuary on the other side, special events of many sorts, a section in the basement where the Connecticut Historical Society will maintain what it describes as a "hands-on history exhibit with changing video and audio sections."
And, oh yes, the return of Joseph Steward's Hartford Museum. When the Old State House was opened in 1796, Mr. Faude said, it contained Mr. Steward's museum, a private enterprise on the third floor. The museum contained portraits, natural and artificial curiosities and all sorts of other good stuff. And Mr. Faude wants the museum back.
 
Bengal Tiger and Whale's Tooth
 Early this year, he sent a letter to members of the Old State House Association, asking them to search their attics for some of the items that had been in Steward's museum. They included such things as a stuffed Bengal tiger, wax figures representing an execution on the guillotine, a post made of a whale's tooth and a two-headed stuffed calf.
The items have been coming in nicely. He has the tiger, a stuffed alligator, a stuffed mongoose and boa constrictor in mortal combat and, if not a whale's tooth, an elephant's molar. "But I've got to get a two-headed calf," he said. He checked his friend Robert Pelton, curator of the Barnum Museum in Bridgeport, but to no avail. Mr. Pelton did come up with an an elephant foot, however. The Barnum Museum had a spare.
Mr. Faude plans to put some of the attractions in the 12-foot-high windows facing Main street. "I want people coming by to say,'Hey, I've got to check this out.' "
Wilson Faude, in his present job with the Old State House and when he was curator of the Mark Twain Memorial in the 1970's, has never been mistaken for a traditional conservationist. He has been both criticized and praised for his unorthodox ways. But he does bring a flair to the job. His window tax is an excellent example.
It annoyed Mr. Faude that people in office towers could look down at the magnificent sight of his beloved Old State House without paying anything for the privilege. So he assigned a tax on the windows of the towers. It started almost as a lark but caught on with the people behind the windows, and their bosses, who were willing to volunteer a little money for a good cause.
The take from Mr. Faude's gimmick, eventually netted $25,000 a year toward the cost of maintaining the Old State House. Today, it is down to about $20,000. Some of the windows with the great views no longer have people working behind them.
That is just one evidence of the economic decline of downtown Hartford. When Mr. Faude stands on the Main Street side of the Old State House and looks south he sees the Travelers Tower, symbol of the insurance company that has laid off thousands of workers and that has now been absorbed by Primerica. When he looks north, he sees the buildings of G. Fox, Brown Thompson and Sage-Allen, once the city's great department stores, all now almost eerily vacant. Temporary offices for the Old State House staff, while the restoration work is going on, are on the ground level of a nearby building, once a showplace of redevelopment. Specifically, the temporary headquarters are in a restaurant that went out of business. Mr. Faude's desk is near the bar and a piano.
 
Tourist Attraction Again
 Despite the depressing business landscape, the exuberant Mr. Faude said he is convinced that the new Old State House will quickly re-establish itself as the city's greatest tourist attraction and greatly outdo its previous attendance. When he first became associated with the Old State House in the late 1970's, he said, some 6,000 people were visiting the building annually. In 1991, the last year before the major renovations were started, the attendance was 322,000 visitors, in an area where parking is scarce.
He also believes that the reincarnation of the Old State House could trigger another round of redevelopment in Hartford but only if its people get angry and decide to do something about about the low status of a city that was once considered a jewel of New England.
And he has a suggestion. People would flock back to shop in Hartford, or any city struggling to survive, he said, if the state Legislature would authorize making the impoverished cities zones free of the state's sales tax. The man is never short of ideas.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/The Tishman Empire;
The Rise, Fall and Rise of a Construction Business

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
IN many ways, 68-year-old John L. Tishman and his 39-year-old son, Daniel R., have led similar lives.
Each first relegated his love of building things to home woodworking shops. Each looked at the real estate business that Julius Tishman, John Tishman's grandfather, started in 1898 as something that the "other" Tishmans did, and chose instead to teach school. 
 Each joined the family business at the behest of executives other than their fathers.
And now, it looks like each will have ended up running the show.
Last month, Daniel Tishman, who lives on a 256-acre llama farm in Maine and had been running Tishman's New England projects out of Boston, was named executive vice president of Tishman Realty & Construction and head of all its Northeast operations. He will now spend much more time in New York, since the appointment puts him on a clear path to succeed his father as chief executive.
Already, the elder Tishman is talking about concentrating more on "preconstruction," the phase of projects when designs are evaluated and personal creativity reigns paramount. That is fine with his son, who thrives on computers and is comfortable with the red tape, consensus decisions and compromises that dealing in the modern real estate world often entails.
"My father is a leader and leaders don't like to be led," said Daniel Tishman.
His father puts it slightly differently. "I created a company, and I ruled by fiat," he said. "Dan comes in as the leader of a team."
Actually, Daniel Tishman has done his share of company-building. Since he joined Tishman in 1990, his New England region has grown from 4 to 40 employees. And he's developed his own cadre of loyal clients -- for example, Tishman has done more than a dozen construction projects for the Jackson Laboratory, the genetic research institution in Bar Harbor, Me.
"We wouldn't move on any construction project without asking Dan's advice," said Kenneth Paigen, the laboratory's director.
Still, Daniel Tishman faces formidable challenges. In the last four years, Tishman has accepted projects it would have eschewed in boom times. It has built prisons. It has done for-fee consulting and tenant's representation. It has built joint venture hotels.
In the 80's, no more than 25 percent of Tishman's projects were for the public sector. Today, 60 percent of its 85 projects in hand are for state or local agencies. That means dealing with layers of people and controls, skills more evident in Daniel Tishman's arsenal than in his father's.
"Dan understands the politics of bureaucracy," said John A. Vickers, who has worked for Tishman for 10 years. "John can spend an awful lot of time trying to convince clients his way is better."
Clients spot the distinction, too. "Dan is a lot more tolerant of the bureaucracy in public projects," said Richard Piotrowski, deputy commissioner of the Department of Public Works in Connecticut, where Tishman is managing two prison projects.
Tishman's potpourri of assignments has also opened it to squabbles with unhappy clients. In John Tishman's day, disputes were always resolved privately. For example, when Tishman built the Walt Disney Company's Swan Hotel in Orlando, Fla., John Tishman and Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman, fought mightily over the hotel's site and Disney's choice of architects. They compromised, and Mr. Eisner has hired Tishman several times since.
"John's a true professional, who compromises when need be," Mr. Eisner said.
Recent disputes have not been as happily resolved. The managing partners of A & S Plaza and the Rihga Royal Hotel, two projects on which Tishman was the construction manager, have tried to force Tishman to absorb cost overruns. An arbitrator decided the A & S Plaza situation in Tishman's favor, but a Rihga Royal suit is still pending.
It's all a bit overwhelming to John Tishman, whose main corporate squabbles were intrafamilial. His father, Louis, died when John was 4. Unlike his five cousins, he was under no nepotistic pressure to join the family business. Instead, he studied electrical engineering and taught high school math.
When his uncles did finally solicit him to join Tishman in 1948, they relegated him to the construction end, the one part of the business that none of his cousins had a particular affinity for. Almost by default, John Tishman quickly became the highest ranking construction person in the company.
It was John Tishman who persuaded his uncles to sell the company's services as a builder and manager to other developers.
"I FELT that the more good projects we had, the better the people we could hire," John Tishman recalled. "My uncles countered that the more work we did for outsiders, the less attention we would pay to our own."
It was a stalemate until 1965, when Tishman got a shot at managing the construction of Madison Square Garden. Even John Tishman's uncles could not turn that down.
Such high-profile projects begat even higher-profile projects. In 1965 Tishman began building the first 100-story building ever, the John Hancock Tower in Chicago. So when the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey decided to put up the even-taller World Trade Center a year later, it called Tishman in to consult. When, as consultants, Tishman figured out ways to cut the project's cost, the Port Authority hired Tishman as the builder. Since then, several airlines have hired Tishman to expand their terminals at Kennedy International Airport, which the Port Authority leases from New York City.
"They bring jobs in on time and below cost," said Richard Rowe, who last month retired as the airport's general manager.
Up until the mid-70's, Tishman continued to develop its own properties even as it was expanding its outside work. It put up 460 Park Avenue, at 57th Street, and 99 Park Avenue, at 39th Street, both with aluminum facades it had developed with Alcoa. The then-weird look, and speed with which the buildings went up, garnered Tishman a photo spread in the July 5, 1954 issue of Life Magazine. ("If Khruschchev hadn't chosen that week to bang his shoe, we would have had the centerfold!" John Tishman grouses today.)
Tishman has continued to emphasize research. It invented body-heat detectors that turn lights on and off when people enter or leave rooms. It developed a new roofing installation with Owens Corning Fiberglas. With U.S. Gypsum it developed an inexpensive fireproofing process.
But it never developed immunity to economic vicissitudes. By the mid-70's Tishman was project-poor and cash strapped. The company was liquidated in 1976 and its construction and research arm, along with the Tishman name, was sold to the Rockefeller Center Corporation.
John Tishman soon discovered that, while he had been the biggest proponent of hiring out to work for others, he deeply missed having equity. In 1980 he and some non-family colleagues -- the same men who eventually asked Daniel Tishman to join the company -- bought the company back, and Tishman began building again.
BUT John Tishman learned his recession-administered lessons well. When the current downturn hit, he quickly diversified the company into services. It began managing hotels, including the St. Moritz on Central Park South. It took on financial consulting jobs. And about a year ago it moved into tenant-side brokerage. Tishman brokers recently negotiated a 6-year, 262,000 square foot lease for Olympus America, which makes cameras, in Melville, L.I.
The move into brokerage may be problematic. Tishman gets much of its interiors construction work on referral from brokers, some of whom might be loath to recommend a new competitor. And building owners may not like negotiating with brokers who work for a rival developer.
"Owners may not like to show their bottom lines to competitors," said Jerry L. Cohen, vice chairman of Cushman & Wakefield.
Still, Tishman's overall strategy seems to be working. It has about $1.75 billion in work under contract. And it has some plum projects: It is overseeing the restoration of the New Amsterdam Theater on 42d Street, for Disney Development Corporation. And, in a joint venture with PFP Golf Associates, it is building a convention hotel in Puerto Rico.
John Tishman's long relationship with Disney, and Tishman's ownership position in the hotel, kept him intimately involved in negotiating both those deals. But increasingly, he is turning sales pitches and early negotiations over to younger executives.
"The decisionmakers are Dan's age today, and they don't want to hire someone who is friends with their boss," John Tishman said.
As Tishman's boss-elect, Dan Tishman must form a viable management triumvirate with Mr. Vickers and with John T. Livingston, who left Linpro, another development company, to join Tishman this year. Both men are about Daniel Tishman's age, and both expect to be his equal, if not in title, in authority.
"This business is too complex for one person," Mr. Livingston said. "Dan's name may be on the door, but there will be three men running the place."

 BODY:

THE ECONOMY
 
Health Coverage for All Americans? Yes. No. Maybe. Someday.
There's a world of difference between "all" and "most." From the start, President Clinton's mantra has been health coverage for "every American." But those, he discovered, were fighting words; the perfect world he envisioned simply hit too many political potholes. So last week, ever more isolated in his dreams, he gingerly opened the door to compromise, saying 95 percent coverage may be O.K. at first. But no sooner had he uttered those words than he was hit with a flood of criticism, and he quickly insisted that he wasn't backing off from universal coverage. And Hillary Rodham Clinton, holding a child with birth defects, said, "Health reform without universal coverage will not work." Then Democratic leaders grabbed the ball and, after meeting with the Clintons, said they were ready to push for legislation guaranteeing coverage for all. But not, of course, just yet; full coverage will be "phased in." 

At the I.R.S., Just Looking
Thanks to the wonders of the computer age, 56,000 I.R.S. employees -- roughly half of the agency's workers -- have the ability to peek at individuals' tax returns. Small wonder that some of them, apparently, have not resisted the temptation to snoop on the financial secrets of friends and foes, ex-spouses and future in-laws. But the I.R.S. has been hunting down these Peeping Toms (and Thomasinas), and last week it disclosed that more than 1,300 of the agency's employees had been investigated since 1989. About a third of those 1,300 have faced some consequences, and some will never darken a taxpayer's deductions again.
 
Inflation on His Mind
July may be in full drip, but Alan Greenspan is not about to let the markets relax about interest rates. He doesn't want anyone to think he's scrapped the idea of more increases just because the Federal Reserve didn't raise rates at its policy-making meeting earlier this month. So last week, he told the Senate Banking Committee that the Fed's actions so far this year -- four straight rate increases -- just may not be enough to keep inflation in its cage. He also insisted that rates too high would be preferable to rates too low. The markets got the message loud and clear -- that inflation is so much on Mr. Greenspan's mind that an increase is sure to come soon -- and stock and bond prices fell sharply that day.
 
Beep Me Out to the Ball Game
Oh, the things that are done in the name of that great god Information. O.K., perhaps beepers and their cousins mark a small step for civilization when they carry news, say, that a husband or lapdog has breathed its last. But baseball plays? Yes, indeed. This nation truly wants to know, NOW, of each batter's swing, each pitcher's grunt, so Motorola has sped to the rescue. Last week it unveiled the first American version of its Sports Trax, a device the size of a pocket calculator that -- when you're far from the game -- tells you instantly who's on first, who just hit what. All the facts that provide life support for the true baseball fan.
 
Mutual Fund on Wheels
Kansas City Southern will have to get a new name soon. In 1962, its eye firmly on the future, it started looking beyond its railroad business and making forays into the mutual fund game. And last week it severed the last ties with its past, selling its railroad to Illinois Central for about $1.6 billion, a deal that will create the nation's eighth-largest railroad. But now, Kansas City Southern somehow doesn't seem the right name for a company devoted to mutual funds.
 
Aviation History, Frozen
It all started with Penn Station. When it was torn down in the early 60's, the public snapped to attention and said, Hold it! We can't let architecture's past glories slip away so easily. And the Landmarks Preservation Commission was born. Grand Central has since joined the protected-species list, and last week another travel landmark was added: T.W.A.'s soaring, birdlike terminal at Kennedy Airport. The trouble is, the terminal was built in 1962, back in aviation's Pliocene age; air travel is a far different bird today. The terminal is "functionally obsolete," said a T.W.A. lawyer, asserting that the landmark designation keeps the airline from modernizing it. Then again, Penn Station was "modernized"; now look at it.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Great Swoosh Forward
China has to think big. It's got 1.2 billion people to worry about -- probably 1.6 billion within a generation. So now the land of the Great Wall may also be home to the Great Aqueduct. To keep Beijing from drying up, China has proposed an 860-mile aqueduct -- the distance from Washington to the Mississippi -- to deliver water to the capital. It would be one of the largest public-works projects ever and would carry seven times the water used by New York City. At a cost of billions of dollars, though, it may be a hard sell in a nation trying mightily to get its economic balance.
 
Honda, World Citizen
Honda does not want to be a Japanese car maker -- not in our eyes, anyway. When Americans think "Japanese car maker," they quickly think of trade deficits, of long-suffering Detroit, and their protectionist blood boils. No, Honda wants to be a global car maker. It was the first Japanese company to build cars here, and last week it plunged further along that road, announcing a $310 million expansion of its production capacity in North America over the next three years. Of course, the yen's rise cannot be ignored in the equation; if Honda can build cars for dollars it'll be a lot easier to sell them for dollars.
 
COMPANIES
 
A Failed Biotech Dream
Biotechnology. So, so recently, that word could turn a sober investor into a gambler with whirling dollar signs for eyes. Just look at Synergen. Two years ago, this small company's anti-sepsis drug, Antril, stirred such hopes of riches that its stock hit $67, giving it a serious market value, $1.7 billion. In February, though, Synergen said early test data showed serious limitations, and its stock plunged. Then last week came perhaps the final blow, as the company halted human trials of Antril, and the stock lost half its remaining value. The trouble is, Synergen doesn't have much else going for it.
 
CBS for Sale? Nonsense!
What a difference a failed merger makes. When CBS and QVC were about to waltz off together into the new-media future, Laurence Tisch seemed very much the elder statesman -- glad to be moving on, thank you; let this fellow Diller, with his fancy ideas, have a go at it. But after the QVC deal collapsed and talk bubbled up of CBS being for sale, Mr. Tisch recoiled from this begging-bowl image. Last week, saying he'd found "renewed energy," Mr. Tisch said CBS was not for sale, and his words were sharp: "Unequivocal." "Absolutely no intention." "Tired of the rumors." Was this posturing, or are outsiders just uninformed? Mr. Tisch was clear: "What does an analyst know about what I'm thinking?"
 
The QVC Plot Thickens
Meanwhile, back at QVC, things are getting more interesting -- and more complicated. John Malone, head of Tele-Communications Inc., must have gotten out his calculator and realized there'd be a big capital-gains bite if Comcast managed to buy QVC. Liberty Media, a T.C.I. spinoff, owns 19 percent of QVC and would be forced to cash in, at a huge (taxable) profit. So last week Liberty got into the act, joining Comcast in its $2.2 billion bid. So, tallying it up: Liberty would retain its investment, avoiding gains taxes; QVC would get all cash, not cash and stock; cable folks would get a bit more control of programming; and Barry Diller, head of QVC, would walk away with $100 million. And everyone else would be left struggling to sort it all out.
 
I.B.M., Lean and Hungry
I.B.M. has proved, again, that it can tighten its belt. When it posted yet another surprisingly good earnings report last week, cost cuts took the curtsies. And when it's I.B.M., even a humbler I.B.M., the numbers are still big: it said it had reduced its expenses by $4.8 billion and now had a goal of $8 billion in cuts, not $7 billion. This pushed it to a $689 million quarterly profit, which sent its stock soaring $6.50 in a day. For its next trick, though, if it ever again expects to qualify as a mighty growth company, it will have to get its revenues jumping -- "that's the part you don't have visibility on yet," said one analyst.

HEADLINE: At Work;
Beach Book? Working Class Tales

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble 

 BODY:
AS Freud did not believe in jokes, people who write about work and related subjects seem not to believe in beach books. So the following books are not "sliders," in the Steele-ian tradition, but they are all eminently readable, and reading will relieve your guilt about being out in the sun in No. 2 tanning oil.
When Barbara Garson, playwright, journalist and friend to workers, wrote the first edition of "All the Livelong Day: The Meaning and Demeaning of Routine Work" (Penguin Books), most of the workers she wrote about were blue-collar and bored. Asked how he put up with a brain-numbingly repetitive job, one millworker answered: "It's easy. You just blank your mind." 
 Twenty-two years later, the assembly line and tuna processing still feature in the book, but Ms. Garson shows that some white-collar office work rivals heavy manufacturing in tedium and in its ability to attract petty tyrants to its supervisory classes.
The technology that streamlines tasks like data processing also allows supervisors to monitor the output of individual workers. These employees of the "electronic sweatshop," in Ms. Garson's colorful phrase, feel more stressed and anxious and have more health problems than their nonmonitored counterparts. One data processor, Ms. Garson reports, was asked by a supervisor if she had a problem at home. "Your keystroke count fell to under 9,000 an hour after lunch two days in a row. Are you sure you haven't got any problems?" he said.
The authors of "Newcomers in the Workplace: Immigrants and the Restructuring of the U.S. Economy" (Temple University Press) note Ms. Garson's contribution to the literature of the shop floor by citing "All the Livelong Day" in their bibliography. Louise Lamphere, Alex Stepick and Guillermo Grenier are, however, three social scientists with larger themes in mind. Two recent trends -- the rise in immigration from the Pacific Rim and Latin America and the restructuring of the American economy -- are converging and transforming the work force and the workplace in many parts of the country.
Are immigrants, the authors ask, as "pliable as much of managerial literature leads us to believe, easily threatened and intimidated, or do they resent and resist managerial controls?" Are male-female roles changing or are women being mired in a downward economic spiral? And most critically, "Are immigrants trapped in low-wage positions in dying industries, or has their presence revitalized large segments of the American economy?" Reports of projects in Miami, Garden City, Kan., and Philadelphia flesh out the experience of people who are often either invisible to the native-born or are objects of stereotyping. This is a book the immigrant-phobic Governors of California and Florida might take to their beaches.
Two recent books suggest that welfare, the topic most likely to rehydrate 19th-century beliefs in women and sexuality among the video lizards of Beltway television, is an economic, not a moral, issue. "Lives on the Edge: Single Mothers and Their Children in the Other America" by Valerie Polakow (University of Chicago Press) argues compellingly the out-of-favor position that structural barriers make leaving poverty so difficult.
MS. POLAKOW weaves together comparative historical and literary portrayals of children in poverty, an analysis of the reigning beliefs about motherhood and stories from women juggling children, child-care arrangements, low-paying jobs and snooty social workers. The result is intriguing, though "Lives on the Edge" is one of many recent feminist books that would profit by the immediate repatriation of psychoanalytic-deconstructionist jargon to the French. Jerry Lewis, oui. Lacan, no.
Quick, who said this? "You're responsible for your behavior and what you do and what you get out of life." Your high school counselor? Bill Clinton's therapist? Antonin Scalia? Not! This is the philosophy of an unnamed welfare recipient in "Living on the Edge: The Realities of Welfare in America," by Mark Robert Rank (Columbia University Press), a dispassionate companion volume to "Lives on the Edge.
Mr. Rank analyzes the several ways of interpreting poverty and the need for welfare, and provides an account of his research on what poor people actually do to make ends meet and how they think about it. How they think turns out to be amazingly close to how most middle-class people think about their work, opportunities, families and futures. Perhaps most poignant is that many of the people Mr. Rank spoke with work hard only to lose ground, yet maintain a strong belief in upward mobility and the American dream.
Two books on working class life, "The End of the Line," by Kathryn Marie Dudley (University of Chicago Press) and "Families on the Fault Line," by Lillian B. Rubin (Harper Collins), chronicle the situations of people struggling to find their place as the American economy shape-shifts its way through historic changes. "The End of the Line" is a study of a plant closing in Kenosha, Wis., in the late 80's and its impact on the local community; Ms. Rubin's book looks at how families respond to change imposed on them. Both make clear what a tenuous concept economic security is, especially when the rules for achieving security are in flux. Without working-class work, the working class itself is dissolving.
 
 
 
NINE LABORS, BUT NO LOVE LOST
 LYNN SNOWDEN'S "Nine Lives" (Norton) is a real beach book, in the best possible sense, meaning engaging and droll. Ms. Snowden, a magazine writer, spent a year traveling the country and working, at nine jobs chosen to represent some of the vast array of occupational options Americans exercise every day. Among them are: stripper, roadie, housewife, copy writer, factory worker and rape counselor.
She reports the fantasy-undermining news that roadies watch "Murder She Wrote" for recreation, but housewives do not. Housewifery, she says, involves "unpaid labor. Lots and lots of unpaid labor. . . . There's no quitting time." The hardest job to get was in a chocolate factory, where they were worried about liability and proprietary information. Why didn't they worry about workers stealing recipes and designs? "They're too stupid to know what to do with the information," she was told, which suggests that the employee empowerment movement in the chocolate industry isn't all that it could be.

HEADLINE: How to Get the Dollar Off This Roller Coaster

 BODY:
To the Editor:
After the Federal Reserve and other central banks bought billions of American dollars with Japanese yen, German marks and other currencies to shore up the value of the dollar in late June, the dollar kept sliding (news article, July 12.) Central banks have thus absorbed huge losses, at taxpayer expense. 
 Two years ago, the British Treasury lost about $20 billion in a few days in a vain effort to maintain a rigid exchange rate for the period. Fortunately, the Federal Reserve decided not to intervene further and incur even greater losses.
Greater stability of exchange rates would be desirable, to facilitate international trade and economic cooperation. But for central banks to buy huge amounts of a declining currency, when everybody else is trying to sell it, is not the best approach. It puts an unfair burden on the taxpayers.
More than 20 years ago, the economist James Tobin proposed a better way to dampen excessive volatility of exchange rates: a small tax on each currency exchange, say 1 percent, collected by national governments within their territories.
Such a tax would cool some of today's speculative fever by making it less attractive for multinational corporations to shift billions of dollars back and forth between currencies each hour to cash in on minor shifts in exchange rates or to take advantage of small interest-rate differentials. More money now crosses borders every day -- mostly as electronic blips -- than during the entire century from 1750 to 1850.
Fluctuations in exchange rates are caused by two mechanisms, one of which is desirable. If a country accumulates a trade deficit, the value of its currency tends to drop; this can restore balanced trade over time because exports become cheaper and imports more expensive. This mechanism is stabilizing and desirable.
The other mechanism causes excessive short-term fluctuations and is undesirable. If currencies are gaining in value, as the yen and mark are, speculators profit by buying them low and selling them high. As long as they keep rising, many wish to buy them for the ride upward. Greater demand makes them appreciate even faster.
When the tide shifts and a currency starts to decline, nervous speculators will want to unload their holdings rapidly before its value drops further. This selling pressure pushes its exchange rate down even faster, in a vicious cycle, as has happened to the dollar. These speculative flows of currency lead to wild short-term fluctuations in exchange rates that have no basis in economic reality.
An exchange tax would dampen these short-term fluctuations, but would not prevent realignments in currency values made necessary by trade imbalances. Someone convinced that a currency was undervalued by more than 1 percent would not be discouraged from buying it.
Critics of such a tax argue that it would lead to black markets, which have sprung up when the official value of a currency exceeded its market value by a factor of 2 or 3, sometimes even 10. But major corporations would hardly risk fines and public disgrace to save a mere 1 percent.
Mr. Tobin's exchange tax has another attractive feature. It could gradually replace national contributions to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the United Nations and other international organizations. Richer countries would automatically pay a higher share, without long and divisive negotiations over who should pay how much.
Mr. Tobin's proposal has never been tried. Any group of countries, even one country, could begin to stabilize exchange rates this way. If the experiment proves successful others will join.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
In the Arithmetic of Health Care, It Pays to Aim for 100%

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

 BODY:
FROM a distance, or on television, the argument about whether the nation's re-engineered health care system should include universal coverage may sound like just another Washington squabble about numbers: Does it mean that absolutely everybody would have medical insurance? Or 98 percent of Americans? Or 95? Or 91?
No, the dispute goes to both the mind and spirit of the health care issue. The spirit was tapped when President Clinton suggested to the nation's governors last week that he might settle for 95 percent or so. That enraged the people who think the nation has a moral obligation to see that everyone has health insurance. 
 But the mind is involved, too, because the major motivation for the Administration's effort to reshape the health care system is a sense of economic imperative: taming rampaging costs. And without universal coverage, its logic collapses.
The fresh arguments for universal coverage go beyond traditional Democrats' concern for the downtrodden to the New Democrats' concerns for the deficit and the efficiency of the economy. As Hillary Rodham Clinton put it last month, "At bottom, it is a question of economics."
The economic argument, spelled out last week by a sober cast of Administration economists led by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, whom no one in Washington regards as flighty or emotional, goes this way:
Unless everybody (or as close as the country can get) is insured, it won't be possible to get the soaring costs of health care under control. Sure, there has been some moderation in health care inflation in the last year or so, but that has been out of fear of controls. Such restraint in the face of legislation has happened before; when the legislation died, so did the restraint.
Without cost control the United States will continue spending much more on health care than other countries with whom it competes. This nation now spends 14 percent of its Gross Domestic Product on health care, with 20 percent in sight by the end of the century, and no other nation spends more than 10 percent. The economy is also handicapped when people are locked into their jobs by fear of losing insurance if they switch.
Costs cannot be controlled without universal coverage because the uninsured use the health care system uneconomically, forgoing relatively inexpensive preventive care and then going to expensive emergency rooms when they get sick. If the hospital cannot collect from the uninsured patient, as it usually cannot, it raises the charges on everyone else. People who have health insurance are paying 10 to 30 percent of their premiums to cover the costs of people who don't.
 
Spreading the Burden
 This is called cost-shifting, and everyone says it is a bad thing, even though the Federal Government itself contributes to the problem by reimbursing providers well below what they consider their true costs when they treat patients covered by Medicaid (the poor) and Medicare (the elderly). But as the health care system tries to become less costly, one company after another is refusing to pay rates that have been raised to cover the uninsured. That makes the reimbursements even more lopsided, threatening the future of the hospitals and doctors who treat the uninsured.
There is another cost argument for universal coverage: If insurance companies have to insure all comers, they won't have to spend (and pass on) billions in trying to figure out who is a good risk and who is not. This underwriting is expensive, especially for small groups and for individual policies. There does not seem to be any agreement on how much underwriting adds to premium costs, with industry experts guessing it is 1 or 2 percent and Administration officials putting it much higher. But even 1 percent of the annual national health insurance bill is a lot.
Some Republicans say these arguments exaggerate the problems. Bill Kristol, the vogue Republican theoretician, contends that insurance companies can impose waiting periods that would discourage people from getting insurance only when they get sick. He says he foresees only "a small increase in the cost of insurance for everyone. That's a reasonable price for all of us to pay." With insurance already unaffordable for millions of Americans, it isn't clear just who Mr. Kristol's "us" is. Senator Christopher N. Bond, a Missouri Republican, said it is easy enough to avoid shifting the costs of medical care for the uninsured; just don't provide them with anything but real emergency care if they cannot pay for it.
The traditional Congressional road out of a difficult dispute, trying to pass a minimum bill and claiming great credit for it, retains considerable appeal. On health that approach would involve insurance law changes and some subsidies for the working poor, or at least the working very poor. But in recent days Administration backers believe they have been making political headway with the argument that partial reform could hurt the middle class, help the poor, and leave the rich alone.
Some of the advocates of incremental change never believed in pushing for required universal coverage, often because they found the most obvious way to get there, requiring employers to pay for their workers' insurance, politically unacceptable.
Others did favor universal coverage, but have given up. Senator John C. Danforth, another Missouri Republican, said: "I don't think it's worth the fight. I think we can get close enough" with a bill the Senate Finance Committee approved that relies on insurance reforms, on taxes on expensive health policies to discourage excess use, and on subsidies if the money can be found.
Of course, no one knows whether that bill would get to "close enough," or even what "close enough" is -- at what point short of 100 percent coverage, the problems with partial reform would dissipate.
And even if the Administration's motivation is economic, the social policy arguments matter, too, and stir the emotions of supporters. To critics like Mr. Kristol or Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the No. 3 House Republican, required universal coverage involves too much government. To Mr. Armey, it is a "laudable" idea that every American have health insurance. But once you make it compulsory, he said, he's "troubled by the coercion and pre-emption of individual rights" inherent in a central government decision about what level of insurance Americans need and how they must get it.
The emotional argument for universal coverage is rarely expressed with more fervor than by Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. This month he told supporters, "We have to take action, and take it now, to insure that we are going to have a universal health care program that is going to reach out to every American." He added, "It is morally right."

At the Top of the Ivory Tower The Watchword Is Silence

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
A GENERATION ago, James B. Conant of Harvard, Clark Kerr of the University of California, Robert M. Hutchins of the University of Chicago and a great many other college and university presidents cut striking figures on the public stage. They called for the reform of American education, proposed safeguards for democracy, sought to defuse the cold war, urged moral standards for scientific research and addressed other important issues of the time.
Today, almost no college or university president has spoken out significantly about Bosnia, Haiti, North Korea, health care, welfare reform, the attack on the National Endowment for the Arts or dozens of other issues high on the national agenda. 
 Many academic leaders are frank about their reticence. Jack Peltason, president of the University of California, said: "When I speak out in behalf of the university, I'm always trying to be careful." Then, he added with a professorial chuckle: "I don't have academic freedom."
Among the most recently appointed college and university chiefs, George E. Rupp, who became president of Columbia University last October, has become known among some faculty members on the Morningside Heights campus as The Invisible Man.
When interviewed, President Rupp reveals a penchant for euphemism. Asked about his plans to consolidate the Business School with the Economics Department, he replied: "Collaboration is the metaphor, not consolidation. Or, I would call it enhancement -- putting a positive spin on it. The metaphors need not be negative, like downsizing and consolidating."
Hugo F. Sonnenschein, who became president of the University of Chicago last October, is more famous on the south side of Chicago for having written a thank-you note to a 6-year-old girl who gave him a slightly squished M & M than for any important policy statement.
An instructive example of the new breed is Gerhard Casper, the suave, German-born legal scholar who succeeded Donald Kennedy in 1992 as president of Stanford University. President Casper came into office after Dr. Kennedy -- often provocative and outspoken -- resigned in the wake of allegations that the university had misspent millions of dollars in Federal research grants.
The trustees made no secret of their wish that Dr. Kennedy's successor not only restore integrity to the university but keep himself out of the headlines. In his inaugural address, Dr. Casper broadly hinted that he had caught their drift. He declared that a university "must not have a dominant way of thinking," and quoted a First Amendment scholar who had suggested that a high university official could not take a position on a social issue without inhibiting the freedom of dissent.
It was not long, however, before Dr. Casper ignored his own advice. When asked by a reporter to confirm that he had written a letter supporting President Clinton's nomination of Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the Supreme Court, he thought it a fair question to be asked of a former professor of law, and so allowed that he indeed supported the choice.
"What came out in The New York Times the next day," he recalled with chagrin, "is that the presidents of both Columbia and Stanford supported Ginsburg. As a law professor, I felt I hadn't been completely castrated. But that's the problem. Even when I act personally, it gets taken as something else."
The result is that Dr. Casper became Mr. Cool. "I feel I must speak out on issues that concern the university," he said, "but I was not appointed to speak out on a whole range of social issues because when I do there will be those who disagree."
Yet he has proved extremely circumspect even when discussing university issues. For example, when a faculty groundswell indicated that Stanford might become one of the first major American universities to extend health insurance and other benefits to the homosexual partners of its faculty and staff, Dr. Casper declined to take a stand on the issue. He explained to a reporter: "If I took a position I would have possibly forced the trustees to choose between backing up their new president or rejecting their new president. I didn't want the trustees to be in that position."
Woodrow Wilson, who took on alumni, trustees and anyone else who stood in his way to fight the special privilege of the private dining clubs at Princeton University at the turn of the century, would have been appalled. The same goes for Mr. Hutchins of the University of Chicago, who -- never one to be accused of thinking small -- published a preliminary draft for a world constitution in 1948, or Mr. Conant of Harvard, who lectured the nation on the uses and misuses of science.
The exceptions to presidential timorousness are not likely to encourage outspokeness. Many academic leaders recall with a wince the ordeal of Kingman Brewster Jr. when president of Yale. In 1970, Yale students went on strike to show support for eight members of the Black Panthers then on trial in New Haven for murder and kidnapping. Mr. Brewster, who insisted that the university shouldn't become embroiled, tried to calm tensions by saying that he too was "skeptical of the ability of black revolutionaries to achieve a fair trial anywhere in the United States."
His supporters called the comment a political masterstroke that helped to defuse a powderkeg, but his critics -- many of whom were disgruntled alumni whose children had not been admitted to Yale under Mr. Brewster's stringent entrance requirements -- set up a howl that nearly drove him from office.
More recently, Stanley N. Katz, the president of the American Council of Learned Societies, was dropped as the Clinton Administration's candidate for Archivist of the United States. The reason, Congressional insiders say, is that Senate Republicans and conservative Democrats threatened to fight the nomination in retaliation for Mr. Katz's having challenged the policies of Lynne Cheney when she headed the National Endowment for the Humanities under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. A few academic leaders have lately found the courage to denounce political correctness -- oppression from the left -- and while these remarks are frequently hard-hitting they do not require great daring to deliver, especially in a present-day campus setting.
 
Rhetorical Tiptoeing
 There are a number of possible explanations for this rhetorical tiptoeing through the tulips. Vartan Gregorian, the president of Brown University, who was one of the first academic leaders to speak out against political correctness, said that today he and his colleagues are so preoccupied with fund raising that they fear offending virtually any faction. "It's not natural for me, but I must speak with tact and diplomacy," he said. "I have come to agree with Lord Chesterfield that wisdom is like carrying a watch. Unless asked, you don't have to tell everybody what time it is."
Mr. Katz said that current academic leaders are silent largely because they are overwhelmed with administrative burdens since universities have exploded in size, complexity and cost. "These institutions require feeding 24 hours a day," he said. "It's the same in industry. Nobody even knows who the head of Chrysler is today. That's because the people who run these organizations are swamped with administrative work."
"There's another reason, too," Mr. Katz said. "Both institutions and individuals today are looking for the main chance. They want to be rich and they won't let anything distract them from that. It's too bad, but it's an attribute of American life today."

HEADLINE: The World;
Pollution in Canada? Believe It.

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH 

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
FRAMED by three oceans, carved by the receding sheets of ice age glaciers, the world's second-largest country has great forests, crystal lakes and the bountiful granary of an endless prairie.
Canada: the very name calls up visions of snow-whitepeaks jutting into a clean blue sky, of wolf and moose and mink roaming the woods and plains as they did for eons before the British and French fought at Quebec to see who would reign over this vast land. 
 If images are to be believed, even Canada's cities seem like environmental paragons: Toronto, one of the cleanest metropolises in the hemisphere; Vancouver, one of the loveliest cities on the planet.
Many of Canada's 27 million people believe that their country has avoided much of the choking pollution and dehumanizing crowding that afflicts its huge neighbor to the South. It comes as a bit of a shock, then, to listen to leaders of the Cree community of the northern Manitoba village of Pukatawagan, who have been saying for months that their water is not fit to drink. After the ninth victim of a hepatitis outbreak was airlifted to a hospital two weeks ago, 300 Pukatawagan Crees began a protest march 400 miles south to Winnipeg.
The march was called off when the country's Indian Affairs Minister, Ron Irwin, flew to the area. He pledged $8 million to overhaul the local sewage and water system. Shown the water supply that was making people ill, a startled Mr. Irwin said, "That stuff's raw sewage."
In a way, Mr. Irwin's surprise could be seen as symbolic. For the truth is that if Canada is decades behind the United States in polluting its land, air and water, it has also been complacent -- even though pollution control is Canada's fifth-largest industry.
Most Canadians live within 100 miles of the United States. The frigid expanses stretching north 2,500 miles have little impact on their daily lives, which could explain why the plight of the Pukatawagan Cree attracted so little attention until the protest. "If you go to any of these communities, you're going to see the same problems," said James Dean, environmental health adviser for the Cree. The water contamination that made so many Cree ill was linked to a sewer discharge upstream from Pukatawagan's water intake on the Churchill River. But raw sewage discharge also occurs farther south, in cities and towns along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, like St. John's and smaller communities in Newfoundland, and in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and in Victoria, British Columbia. The reason: lack of money for treatment plants. Officials in those cities say the effect on the environment is negligible. The sea waters are generally too cold for swimming, the argument goes. Currents sweep the waste into deeper and even colder waters, where it disperses.
But on the West Coast, pollution has become an irritant between Canada and the United States, with Americans doing much of the complaining. Victoria is less than 20 miles across the Strait of Juan de Fuca from Washington State. Despite the complaints of people in Seattle and Port Angeles, Wash., voters of Victoria have consistently refused to authorize an investment in a sewage-treatment plant.
Although much of Canada is far removed from the smokestacks and sewers of industry, scientists are worried about an increasing variety of toxic contaminants, from pesticides to heavy metals, found in the snow, ice, water and air even in the Far North. And there are signs that the public is showing concern.
Some of Canada's environmental problems are not of its own making. Pollutants from around the world are carried north by rivers, ocean currents and atmospheric circulation. Because of reduced sunlight and extreme cold in the Far North, the chemicals break down slowly, scientists say, and have already begun contaminating the Arctic food chain from plankton to polar bears. Canada's Eskimos are especially vulnerable because of their reliance for food on wildlife.
One pollution source is a remnant of the cold war. At abandoned air bases and radar outposts along the old Distant Early Warning Line, everything from unexploded bombs to garbage dumps containing polychlorinated biphenyls was left behind. Canada's Defense Department has just earmarked $200 million over five years to clean up some of those hazardous wastes, although some officials say it may take three times that amount to undo the damage.
Environmentalists worry about pollution if diamonds are found in commercial quantities in the central Arctic. Some 200 mining companies have staked out 50 million acres north of Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories. Hundreds of camps have been built. Many grizzlies, wolves and caribou have been unsettled.
World Wildlife Fund Canada has just called for a moratorium on all mining activity until a broad environmental impact study is completed, a proposal that elicits little support from the mining companies.
MacMillan Bloedel Ltd., Canada's biggest logging company, has been locked in a yearlong struggle with environmentalists over clear-cutting old-growth cedar, hemlock, balsam and spruce in the formerly protected rain forests of Clayoquot Sound on British Columbia's Vancouver Island.
 
Civil Disobedience
 The Clayoquot confrontation produced what may be the largest civil disobedience action in Canadian history. Some 850 protesters, including Svend Robinson, a member of Parliament from a Vancouver suburb, have been arrested. Mr. Robinson faces up to five years in prison when he is sentenced on Tuesday.
MacMillan Bloedel says it is following the rules of the British Columbia Government, which supports the logging to boost economic activity. But protesters say all this comes at a terrible cost.
"Forestry still has not faced up to its responsibilities," said Henry Regier, professor of environmental studies at the University of Toronto. "There are many ways you can mess up this very fragile ecosystem."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
The Debilitating Malady Called Boyhood

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER 

 BODY:
UNTIL quite recently, the plain-spun tautology "boys will be boys" summed up everything parents needed to know about their Y-chromosome bundles. Boys will be very noisy and obnoxious. Boys will tear around the house and break heirlooms. They will transform any object longer than it is wide into a laser weapon with eight settings from stun to vaporize. They will swagger and brag and fib and not do their homework and leave their dirty underwear on the bathroom floor.
But they will also be. . .boys. They will be adventurous and brave. When they fall down, they'll get up, give a cavalier spit to the side, and try again. Tom Sawyer may have been a slob, a truant and a hedonist; he may have picked fights with strangers for no apparent reason; but he was also resourceful, spirited and deliciously clever. Huckleberry Finn was an illiterate outcast, but as a longterm rafting companion he had no peer. 
 Today, the world is no longer safe for boys. A boy being a shade too boyish risks finding himself under the scrutiny of parents, teachers, guidance counselors, child therapists -- all of them on watch for the early glimmerings of a medical syndrome, a bona fide behavioral disorder. Does the boy disregard authority, make snide comments in class, push other kids around and play hooky? Maybe he has a conduct disorder. Is he fidgety, impulsive, disruptive, easily bored?Perhaps he is suffering from attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, the disease of the hour and the most frequently diagnosed behavioral disorder of childhood. Does he prefer computer games and goofing off to homework? He might have dyslexia or another learning disorder.
"There is now an attempt to pathologize what was once considered the normal range of behavior of boys," said Melvin Konner of the departments of anthropology and psychiatry at Emory University in Atlanta. "Today, Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn surely would have been diagnosed with both conduct disorder and ADHD." And both, perhaps, would have been put on Ritalin, the drug of choice for treating attention-deficit disorder.
To be fair, many children do have genuine medical problems like ADHD, and they benefit enormously from the proper treatment. Psychiatrists insist that they work very carefully to distinguish between the merely rambunctious child, and the kid who has a serious, organic disorder that is disrupting his life and putting him at risk for all the demons of adulthood: drug addiction, shiftlessness, underemployment, criminality and the like.
 
It's a Boy Thing
 At the same time, some doctors and social critics cannot help but notice that so many of the childhood syndromes now being diagnosed in record numbers affect far more boys than girls. Attention deficit disorder, said to afflict 5 percent of all children, is thought to be about three to four times more common in boys than girls. Dyslexia is thought to be about four times more prevalent in boys than girls; and boys practically have the patent on conduct disorders. What is more, most of the traits that brand a child as a potential syndromeur just happen to be traits associated with young males: aggression, rowdiness, restlessness, loud-mouthedness, rebelliousness. None of these characteristics is exclusive to the male sex, of course -- for the ultimate display of aggressive intensity, try watching a group of city girls engaged in a serious game of jump-rope -- but boys more often will make a spectacle of themselves. And these days, the audience isn't smiling at the show.
"People are more sensitized to certain extremes of boyishness," said Dr. John Ratey, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School. "It's not as acceptable to be the class clown. You can't cut up. You won't be given slack anymore." Woe to the boy who combines misconduct with rotten grades; he is the likeliest of all to fall under professional observation. "If rowdiness and lack of performance go together, you see the button being pushed much quicker than ever before," he said, particularly in schools where high academic performance is demanded.
Lest males of all ages feel unfairly picked upon, researchers point out that boys may be diagnosed with behavioral syndromes and disorders more often than girls for a very good reason: their brains may be more vulnerable. As a boy is developing in the womb, the male hormones released by his tiny testes accelerate the maturation of his brain, locking a lot of the wiring in place early on; a girl's hormonal bath keeps her brain supple far longer. The result is that the infant male brain is a bit less flexible, less able to repair itself after slight injury that might come, for example, during the arduous trek down the birth canal. Hence, boys may well suffer disproportionately from behavioral disorders for reasons unrelated to cultural expectations.
However, biological insights can only go so far in explaining why American boyhood is coming to be seen as a state of proto-disease. After all, the brains of boys in other countries also were exposed to testosterone in utero, yet non-American doctors are highly unlikely to diagnose a wild boy as having a conduct disorder or ADHD.
"British psychiatrists require a very severe form of hyperactivity before they'll see it as a problem," said Dr. Paul R. McHugh, chairman and director of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore. "Unless a child is so clearly disturbed that he goes at it until he falls asleep in an inappropriate place like a wastebasket or a drawer, and then wakes up and starts it all over again, he won't be put on medication." Partly as a result of this sharp difference in attitudes, the use of Ritalin-like medications has remained fairly stable in Britain, while pharmaceutical companies here have bumped up production by 250 percent since 1991.
Perhaps part of the reason why boyish behavior is suspect these days is Americans' obsessive fear of crime. "We're all really terrified of violence," said Dr. Edward Hallowell, a child psychiatrist at Harvard. "Groups of people who have trouble containing aggression come under suspicion." And what group has more trouble containing aggression than males under the age of 21? Such suspiciousness is not helped by the fact that the rate of violent crime has climbed most steeply among the young, and that everybody seems to own a gun or know where to steal one. Sure, it's perfectly natural for boys to roll around in the dirt fighting and punching and kicking; but toss a firearm into the equation, and suddenly no level of aggression looks healthy.
 
Jokesters, Beware
 Another cause for the intolerance of boyish behavior is the current school system. It is more group-oriented than ever before, leaving little room for the jokester, the tough, the tortured individualist. American children are said to be excessively coddled and undisciplined, yet in fact they spend less time than their European or Japanese counterparts at recess, where kids can burn off the manic energy they've stored up while trapped in the classroom. Because boys have a somewhat higher average metabolism than do girls, they are likely to become more fidgety when forced to sit still and study.
The climate is not likely to improve for the world's Sawyers or Finns or James Deans or any other excessively colorful and unruly specimens of boyhood. Charlotte Tomaino, a clinical neuropsychologist in White Plains, notes that the road to success in this life has gotten increasingly narrow in recent years. "The person who used to have greater latitude in doing one thing and moving onto another suddenly is the person who can't hold a job," she said. "We define success as what you produce, how well you compete, how well you keep up with the tremendous cognitive and technical demands put upon you." The person who will thrive is not the restless version of a human tectonic plate, but the one who can sit still, concentrate and do his job for the 10, 12, 14 hours a day required.
A generation or two ago, a guy with a learning disability -- or an ornery temperament -- could drop out of school, pick up a trade and become, say, the best bridge builder in town. Now, if a guy cannot at the very least manage to finish college, the surging, roaring, indifferent Mississippi of the world's economy is likely to take his little raft, and break it into bits.

Remembering The Past; Repeating It Anyway

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti

 BODY:
ONCE again, the United States finds itself weighing military intervention in the Caribbean, with ships and troops poised just offshore, waiting for an order to move in and restore order to a country that has plunged into chaos and misery. For nearly a century now, that has been the standard American response when events in the region geographically closest to the United States threaten to get out of hand, and for just as long a time, those interventions have almost uniformly failed to produce the results that policy makers in Washington had hoped for.
Since its first sustained foray into the region during the Spanish-American War of 1898, which yielded a protectorate in Cuba, permanent possession of Puerto Rico and a colony in the far-off Philippines, the United States has intervened militarily in the insular Caribbean and in Central America more than a score of times. Some countries, such as the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua, have been invaded and occupied more than once, a phenomenon that probably most eloquently expresses America's historic inability to remake neighboring societies to its own satisfaction. Indeed, it has often seemed that the more the United States tinkers, the worse things become.
 
Many Tactics, One Rationale
 The forms of intervention have varied, of course, from quick campaigns such as in Nicaragua in 1912, Grenada in 1983 and Panama in 1989, to long occupations in Haiti and the Dominican Republic early in the century. Then, too, there was invasion by proxy, practiced in Central America in the 1980's, and even the creation of a country by fiat -- Panama in 1903. The locations have also varied, with Spanish-, French- or English-speaking parts of the Caribbean all having to surrender sovereignty and self-determination at one time or another. 
 Almost always, however, the American rationale has been the same. In 1915, the United States explained that it was occupying Haiti, in the words of the Wilson Administration, in order to eliminate "a public nuisance at our doorstep." Last week, President Clinton used similar language in describing six American vital interests in Haiti. "First of all, it's in our back yard," he said, before stressing the need to protect Americans living here and his desire to install democracy.
But strategic and commercial considerations, such as control of sugar, bananas and the customs revenues needed to pay back bank loans, have usually loomed behind such statements of high principle. Especially during the early decades of the century, "there was a common strategic thread that pretty much covers all the military interventions, and that was the need to defend the Panama Canal and the approaches thereof," said Ivan Musicant, author of "The Banana Wars," a study of American interventions in the Caribbean Basin between 1898 and 1989. More recently, following the rise of Fidel Castro, the fear of Communist expansion, of "another Cuba," has been paramount.
In at least a material sense, many of the occupied countries benefited from the American presence. Highways, railroads, bridges and streets were built; telephone, electrical and telegraph systems installed or extended; docks, ports and lighthouses modernized, and schools and hospitals constructed in places that had none. Infant mortality rates fell and life expectancy rose as clean water was brought to rural areas and public health campaigns reduced the incidence of tropical diseases such as malaria, yellow fever and yaws.
At the same time, American administrators insisted on balanced budgets and reduced the foreign debt, which helped create conditions for economic growth. The presence of American troops also discouraged the continuing parade of civil wars and coups that had been routine in countries such as Haiti and Nicaragua. "The 19 years that the United States was in Haiti were the 19 best years of Haiti's entire existence," Mr. Musicant asserted. "We left that country a far, far better place than we found it."
But the United States also insisted on creating a professional constabulary to enforce public order, first in Panama and Haiti and later in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua. The intention was to create an apolitical force that would guarantee that all parties played by the rules of the game. But those police forces quickly turned into armies, and that, in turn, paved the way for the emergence of despots such as Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic, the Somoza dynasty in Nicaragua, and much later, Generals Omar Torrijos and Manuel Noriega in Panama.
 
A Need to Return
 Obviously, the citizenry of each country had the greatest difficulty in adapting to the system left by the United States when it withdrew. But those decisions have also come back to haunt later generations of American policy makers, and to foster further American involvement in the internal affairs of Caribbean countries. Even now, the United States finds itself in the awkward position of trying to secure the cooperation of Trujillo's protege, Joaquin Balaguer, in preventing leaks in the economic sanctions against Haiti. Mr. Balaguer, who is now 87 and has been nearly blind for more than a decade, keeps getting elected President, most recently two months ago in an election where international observers accused his side of fraud.
And in country after country, the presence and the paternalistic attitude of American troops and military governors, no matter how noble their stated goals, wounded national pride and fomented a nationalist resistance. Augusto Sandino of Nicaragua is the most famous of such resistance leaders, thanks to the young guerrillas who half a century later would come to power invoking his name. Haiti had Charlemagne Peralte and his army of irregulars known as "cacos," while in the Dominican Republic there was Vicente Evangelista and his "gavillero" movement. Both men were hunted down and killed during American occupations, while civil liberties were suspended and press censorship was in force.
Indeed, resistance was so widespread that the United States developed a corps of experts who moved from one country to another, snuffing out rebellions and imposing imported political structures. The Marine commander Smedley Butler, for instance, led forces in Panama, Haiti, Honduras and Nicaragua, and once likened the American role in the region to that of "trustees of a huge estate that belonged to minors." He later repented his actions and in a famous autobiography called himself a "racketeer for capitalism," who "helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street."
Unfortunately, many of those who volunteered for such service had little respect or sympathy for the countries they ruled, did not understand the local language or culture and simply could not fathom the resentment their policies and attitudes, tinged with racism and condescension, generated. Woodrow Wilson's Secretary of State, William Jennings Bryan, once told the Haitian Ambassador in Washington that "the intelligent Haitians should feel gratified that it was the United States, rather than some other power whose motives might not be as unselfish as ours," that had chosen to occupy his country.
Given that legacy, if the United States should decide to invade Haiti again, it will be acting out of character. The last time United States troops landed on the island of Hispaniola, in the Dominican Republic in 1965, a civilian president elected with two-thirds of the popular vote after a long dictatorship, Juan Bosch, had been overthrown in a coup after only seven months in office and had been replaced by a military-dominated government. But when Lyndon Johnson sent in more than 20,000 troops, it was not to restore Mr. Bosch to power; it was to prevent the constitutional president from returning to office after his supporters began a rebellion. If G.I.'s go in this time, they will have the support of the Haitian people, at least initially. But that may not be enough to prevent history from repeating itself.

HEADLINE: The World;
When Money Talks, Governments Listen

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THINK about the meaning of these numbers: The global currency markets trade about $1 trillion worth of dollars each day. When the world's 17 largest central banks, led by the Federal Reserve, intervened last month to try to prop up the dollar, they dug deep into their pockets and came up with about $5 billion and change, which they threw into the market in an effort to bid up the value of the American currency. No wonder they had little effect on the dollar. The central banks were like a zoo keeper trying to calm a starved gorilla by offering it a raisin for lunch.
It really wasn't the fault of the governments, though. Raisins, it seems, are all they have sometimes, compared with the assets of the huge capital, currency and bond markets they are trying to influence. Whose world is this anyway? The answer is that it is increasingly Adam Smith's world -- a world in which the balance of power between global financial markets and governments is tilting toward markets. When it comes to global markets these days, the motto of governments is: "There they go, I must catch up, for I am their leader." 
 Twenty-two-year-old bond traders with ice water for blood tyrannize the President, passing judgment on his economic performance by raising or lowering interest rates; the markets devour central bank cash with nary a burp, and the portfolio managers, playing global Monopoly, move cash from country to country, deciding which governments deserve to "Pass Go" and collect $200 billion and which should go directly to jail and be starved of the capital to raise living standards.
This shift in power is driven by a combination of factors. The revolution in telecommunications and data transmission has knit Tokyo, Frankfurt, London and New York in a seamless web of financial interactions that operates at a speed, and in volumes, beyond the grasp of any single government. This technical revolution, though, has been accompanied and fueled by a political revolution. Over the past decade there has been a widening acknowledgment, from Albania to Alabama, that when it comes to allocating resources, markets work better than governments, whether the issue is providing telephone service or investment capital.
"Basically, governments have consented to a regime that allows markets to boss them around," said Stanford University economist Paul Krugman, "because the conventional wisdom, fed by experience, says that to throw up barriers to these market forces is to invite economic stagnation, if not disaster."
From the State of South Carolina to the government of Brazil, leaders believe that a central role of government is serving as a broker -- a broker between their constituents and the global markets. As more countries have gone capitalist, there is a huge global competition for cash and investors, so that governments can build the roads, power stations and telephone systems that are the foundation for higher living standards. Governments used to do that with their own cash -- as the Marshall Plan rebuilt much of Europe after World War II -- but they don't have it anymore.
So the role of governments now is increasingly to entice private investment -- to get B.M.W. to build a plant in Mississippi, or to get portfolio managers to invest in the Shanghai stock market -- by assuring stable currencies and sound economic fundamentals.
"During the cold war," said Labor Secretary Robert Reich, "we used the Soviet threat to get the public to accept certain changes and to build certain institutions, from the national highway system to the space program. They were all justified in national security terms. Today, with the Soviet threat gone, governments now use the global markets in the same way. We have to adopt this economic policy, initiate this training program for our work force, build this world-class airport, because if we don't we won't be able to attract global capital and raise our standard of living."
The role these markets have in promoting democracy is ambiguous. Markets demand stability, but they don't discriminate between the Singaporean form or the Jeffersonian form. "There is a brutal Darwinian logic to these markets," said the investment banker Felix Rohatyn. "They are nervous and greedy. They look for stability and transparency, but what they reward is not always our preferred form of democracy."
The struggle between markets and governments is not new. When the invention of the telegraph and the railroads knit the fragmented American economy into a single unit in the 19th century, it took 50 years for the Federal government to catch up and set up institutions like the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now national economies have been knit into a global economy, but so far national governments have not forged many super-national institutions to monitor it, because nations are reluctant to cede any sovereignty to global institutions.
 
An Enormous Challenge
 This creates an enormous challenge for regulators, says Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the S.E.C., which is responsible for upholding the standards of an American securities industry that is increasingly operating outside the S.E.C.'s grasp. "Morgan Stanley, dealing with a Tokyo insurance company, can have as big an impact on our system here as Morgan Stanley dealing with General Motors." The problem, though, added Mr. Levitt, is that many of the dealings between Morgan Stanley and a Tokyo insurance company are happening at a speed and in a global marketplace beyond the reach of his regulators.
The big debate in Congress over whether to ratify the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is over how much sovereignty to cede to this super-national trade body. Opponents argue that GATT will give the World Trade Organization in Geneva the power to override certain American environmental laws and safety and health standards, if they violate the principles of free trade. This is often called the "GATTzilla versus Flipper" debate because GATT has ruled against American laws banning the import of tuna caught in nets that also sweep up dolphins.
A similar debate is going on in Asia with its new economic grouping, called APEC for "Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation." But it has no last name. Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation -- what? Organization? Institution? The reason APEC has no last name is because the member states were so worried about ceding sovereignty to it, they would not even call it an organization.
"Those in America who worry about the loss of sovereignty to GATT, or those in England who worry about a loss of sovereignty to the European Union, may seem at times like the King who stood on the beach and tried to stop the tide," said the Harvard University political theorist Michael J. Sandel. "But those who are worried have a point. These global markets are not accountable to any citizens. They don't necessarily reflect decisions that we have made on the basis of our collective values. One of the biggest challenges for democracy in our time is to develop political institutions that will be powerful enough to deal with global markets, but accountable enough to enable citizens to feel that they are still in control."

Math Team Makes a Perfect Score

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

 BODY:
In the decade since a bipartisan national commission warned that a rising tide of mediocrity was threatening America's schools, a string of embarrassments has heightened concern about the quality of education.
On one math test, scores for American teen-agers were far below their counterparts in Europe and Asia. 
 In an economics study most students failed to define basic terms like profit and inflation.
And a geography survey found that most high school graduates had trouble picking out countries -- even their own -- on an unmarked map.
A rare opportunity to crow came last week with the announcement of the results of a mathematics competition in Hong Kong that brought together 360 teen-aged math whizzes from 69 countries. The six high school students representing the United States each achieved perfect scores on a two-day, nine-hour mathematics test. That flawless result, the first in the 35-year history of the International Mathematical Olympiad, astonished the judges and exhilarated their coach.
"They're a tremendous model for how our country can achieve excellence," said Walter E. Mientka, the mathematics professor who was the team's coach.
All six students have attended public schools. Their parents include professors of math, chemistry, electrical engineering, systems analysis and women's studies, as well as two lawyers. SAM DILLON

HEADLINE: Sleepless in Central Park;
In Wake of Crimes, the Police Try Moving Out the Homeless

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

 BODY:
Long after the last baby carriage was hurried through the twilight and the last runner raced the dark to Fifth Avenue, the homeless of Central Park faded into the quiet of the trees. The city and its millions were just out of reach, and it was easy to pretend, in the softly beating heart of Manhattan, that the park was safe.
Robin Miller went to bed Tuesday night on an orange air mattress in a dark corner of the park. She used to sleep easy here, but recently the 40-year-old woman had tossed and turned, and kept a butter knife hidden in her grimy clothes. She sharpened it on a piece of concrete. 
 "Don't mess with me," she said, more to the night around her than one person in particular.
Homeless women are the most vulnerable women in New York, advocates for the homeless say. Their lives expose them to harm, and for many, the best escape is to become invisible. For years, Central Park has been a green curtain for homeless women and men.
Now the police are making it plain that they are not wanted there. The murder of one woman and the rapes of three others over the last two weeks prove, the police say, that it is too dangerous to sleep where cries for help can go unheard.
The officers who patrol the park have orders from their superiors to move the homeless out after a 1 A.M. curfew, but advocates for the homeless say the real reason behind the sweeps has less to do with safety than with esthetics.
Six homeless women have been raped in the park this year, but instead of generating a greater sympathy for the victims, the violence has drawn unwanted attention to the use of the park as a bedroom, some advocates said. The police, echoing many park users, said the squatters left a wake of cardboard shanties, tents, molded mattresses and filth.
George McDonald of the Doe Fund Inc., an advocacy group for the homeless, said it was shameful that crimes against homeless women had become an excuse to flush them from the park. Under the guise of protecting the women, he said, the park is being swept clean.
"It's incredible," he said.
The sweeps are apparently working. On Tuesday night, a few homeless camps were still scattered through the park. Ms. Miller sat with a friend in the southern section of the park. Her air mattress had a slow leak and every few minutes she would blow it back up again. It was her furniture.
She likes the green. Here, in the middle of the giant, clanking metropolis, the air is a little cooler, and every now and then you can hear a cricket fiddle to its lover in the dark.
"I got no other place," said Ms. Miller, who has been homeless for between two and three years.
By Friday night she was gone, and a canvass of the park from north to south between midnight and 3 A.M. found one homeless person: a weary-looking woman, dressed in a long winter coat and carrying two heavy plastic bags, who went through a garbage can before sitting on a park bench with her chin on her chest.
A mile or so north, just off Central Park West, were the signs of a hasty retreat. One man's freshly laundered clothes still hung in the limbs of a tree where he had put them to dry, not far from a pair of women's boots.
A new-looking shopping cart, a prized possession in some circles, was abandoned near a subway grate, and in another place a pair of men's briefs flapped in the breeze from a low-hanging limb.
The week before, the police had estimated the number of homeless campers at 150.
It was a precinct commander's comments about the murder and rape, not the crimes themselves, that caused the greatest commotion. The commander, Capt. William Bayer, said the homeless ruined the park for law-abiding people. He said the way to solve the problem was to "cut off the head of the enemy," meaning move the homeless out.
He later apologized for his remarks. But Captain Bayer only put into words what others feel about homeless people in the park, said Mary Brosnahan, the executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless.
"If you replace the word homeless with black, Latino, Jew or gay, it animates the issue that homeless people seem to be the last group not afforded equal protection under the law," she said.
Deputy Commissioner John Miller said the reality is that the park was never intended for overnight users and is too big, dark and secluded for officers to cover completely. The homeless take a great risk by sleeping there, he said.
He said it was insulting to beat officers and detectives to say they do not try hard enough to close cases against the homeless. And, he said, it is untrue.
On July 9, Cheryl Newbold, 31, was found stabbed to death in a tent in Central Park. Two rapes were reported that day, and a third -- a 51-year-old woman -- on July 16. The police have a suspect in the killing, a homeless man, and in at least one of the rapes.
Ms. Brosnahan said most violence against homeless people is from the outside, but the police said the homeless often prey on one another.
In one camp, half-hidden by trees and bushes, two homeless men and one woman said they had learned to trust only their closest friends.
At suppertime on Tuesday, they shared a quart bottle of apple juice and an aluminum plate of donated food. They said they slept on the ground, and had a plastic sheet as a makeshift tent in case it rained.
The young woman, who did not want her name used because her family does not know she is homeless, said she was once attacked by another homeless man, but still felt safer surrounded by other homeless in a secluded place like the park than in shelters, or on doorsteps.
On Friday night, they were gone.
In the sunlight, Central Park is a beautiful garden. A Russian immigrant, Anur Neseanov, peddled hot dogs and root beer. Kathy Yonek, an actress, walked a fat beagle named Tess. Jose Perez, a bus driver, chatted drowsily about the national economy with retiree Helen Fireison on a park bench in the shade.
Mr. Neseanov works hard all day and has no respect for people who do not, and says the homeless mess up the park for the decent people. Ms. Fireison and Mr. Perez feel for the homeless, but do not think they should have free run of the park at night, or the freedom to ruin it for others.
"What we need," said Ms. Fireison, "is to bring back the W.P.A."
But Ms. Yonek said the police sweeps were a silly solution. If the homeless are pushed out of the park, she said, they do not disappear. They do not leave the city, only congregate in another corner of it.
"Pardon the expression," she said, "but it's a cop-out."
Police officials said it was too early to judge the results of their curfew-enforcement effort. But Ms. Brosnahan said the homeless would seek out another outdoor place.
New Yorkers should not be surprised, she said, to see them on their doorsteps.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Delegates' Vote Sets Up a Primary

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 23

 BODY:
John Rowland, the former Congressman who nearly won the 1990 race for governor, was overwhelmingly nominated at the state Republican convention today to try again. But the Secretary of the State, Pauline Kezer, narrowly qualified to challenge him in a primary.
After an excruciating four-and-a-half-hour roll-call in which intense pressure was put on Kezer delegates to change their votes and avoid a primary for the party, Mrs. Kezer ended up with 196 votes, three more than the 15 percent she needed. 
 Both Republicans and Democrats now face Sept. 13 primaries for governor. State Senator John Larson, who won the Democrats' endorsement at their convention last week, is being challenged by the state Comptroller, William Curry.
The only major-party candidate who will not have to spend time and money on a primary is Eunice S. Groark, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s Lieutenant Governor, who was nominated by acclamation tonight by A Connecticut Party at its convention in Wallingford.
The race could become a four-way contest if Tom Scott, the leader of an anti-income tax group, successfully petitions to get on the ballot.
 
Hoping for Unity
 Mr. Rowland, well-known in Connecticut from the 1990 campaign, came into the convention hoping to block Mrs. Kezer from a primary so he could concentrate his resources on the general election while the Democrats fought among themselves.
With Mr. Weicker not seeking re-election, Republicans were hopeful that Mr. Rowland had the recognition and financing to enable the party to win the governor's office for the first time since 1970.
The main issue facing the Republicans, he told delegates Friday night as the convention opened in the Bushnell Auditorium here, was "Can this Republican Party leave on Saturday night poised for victory, united against the Democrats?"
After earning his reputation as a conservative within the party, Mr. Rowland, 37, is offering a broader message, saying the state's return to economic health depends on improving public schools and helping people on welfare to find jobs, in addition to cutting taxes and fighting crime.
But Mrs. Kezer, 52, had pursued a primary from the start of the campaign, arguing that Mr. Rowland was too conservative to win a statewide contest in a moderate state like Connecticut.
 
Seeking to Open It Up
 She too says economic development and fighting crime are major issues, but is also advocating laws permitting referendums and initiatives and other ways to open the state's decision-making process to voters.
Mr. Rowland secured the convention's endorsement less than halfway through the roll-call, as it began with towns from western Connecticut, where Mr. Rowland represented the Fifth District for three terms. As he received his 652d vote, clinching the nomination, Mrs. Kezer had only 49.
"After the last time around, I had a lot of soul-searching to do about whether to come back or not," Mr. Rowland said after the nomination was won. "I decided that I would see how things went in the state, whether I thought the economy had turned around or whether I thought the quality of life had improved.
"Frankly, I don't think it has. So that really got to be my major impetus to run again."
The early landslide for Mr. Rowland put even more pressure on Mrs. Kezer's delegates as they waited to vote. But even as a second round for the first ballot was held, in which delegates could step forward to change their votes, nearly all of her delegates stood firm.
"We fought for what was ours, and we didn't want to lose what was ours," Mrs. Kezer said afterward.
 
A Second Primary
 The Republicans will also have primaries for lieutenant governor, United States Senator and, it appeared likely, attorney general.
Mr. Rowland's choice for lieutenant governor, Jodi Rell, a state representative from Brookfield, won the nomination, but Mrs. Kezer's choice, Joseph Rucci, a New Canaan lawyer, qualified for the primary.
The Senate candidate favored by party leaders, former state Sen. Gerald Labriola, won the nomination, but Dr. Joseph Bentivegna, a political newcomer, qualified for a primary.
In the convention's closest vote, Richard Arnold, a Trumbull lawyer, won the nomination for attorney general by only 40 votes over Joseph Broder, a lawyer from Glastonbury. With primaries set for most of the party's statewide nominations, one appeared likely here, too.
The party also nominated Christopher Burnham, a former State Representative from Stamford, for treasurer; Rep. Gene Gavin of Westport for comptroller, and Andrea Scott, a clerk in the state House of Representatives, for secretary of the state.
At its convention in Wallingford tonight, A Connecticut Party was filling out the rest of its slate, which has the top line on the November ballot, almost entirely by cross-endorsing Democrats, including Senator Joseph I. Lieberman.
The main exception will be Mrs. Groark's choice for lieutenant governor, Audrey Rowe, Connecticut's commissioner of social services. Her selection creates the state's first ticket with women in both top spots. It also, for the first time, puts a black candidate on the ballot for Connecticut's second-highest office.

HEADLINE: Bell Companies Use Regulation To Stop Rivals

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times 

 BODY:
Even as the nation's local telephone companies make a final push to compete against long-distance and cable television companies, many of them are using the very regulations that restrict them to block rivals that attack their own businesses.
Just last month, for example, the Bell Atlantic Corporation accused a group of fledgling rivals of offering "illegal" telephone services and demanded that the Federal Communications Commission fine them $1 million for each customer they serve. 
 Likewise, when Teleport Communications announced plans to build a fiber-optic network to offer private-line services in Houston, the Southwestern Bell Corporation said Teleport was violating state law and demanded that Texas regulators issue a "cease and desist" order. When the state recently adopted rules to promote more competition, Southwestern Bell challenged them in court.
Such hardball tactics aim at thwarting new competitors by embroiling them in mind-numbingly intricate legal and business disputes.
These actions also go to the heart of a major policy battle in Washington. Congress is in the final stages of debate on a sweeping overhaul of the nation's telecommunications laws that would relax many restrictions on telephone companies in exchange for forcing them to give up their traditional monopolies. Most experts agree that what once seemed like a "natural" monopoly in telephone service is now on borrowed time, thanks to the rush of technology and changes in the marketplace.
But while most lawmakers agree that all of the rivals should be allowed to compete directly, they are deeply divided over just how fast to free the so-called Baby Bells. While competition is increasingly feasible in terms of technology, it remains almost nonexistent.
Indeed, only four states have allowed rival companies to compete with the established providers of local phone service.
The Senate Commerce Committee is expected to vote this week on broad changes in telecommunications law proposed by Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina. On Friday, the Bell companies walked out of negotiations with Senate staff members, arguing that the bill would not let them into the long-distance business quickly enough.
The House of Representatives recently passed a bill supported by the Bells, and all sides in the debate are bracing for a final battle over the next two months.
 
 
Assault From All Sides
 The Bell companies argue passionately that they are hamstrung by restrictions at a time when they are under assault from a host of new rivals: cable television companies, long-distance carriers, specialized fiber-optic companies and new wireless telephone technologies.
"We feel like we've always played by the rules, doing what the regulators told us," said James Cullen, president of Bell Atlantic. "Now we're finding that all the lucrative markets are going to be opened. The feeling is that we're going into that with our hands tied."
But Robert Atkinson, senior vice president of the Teleport Communications Group of Staten Island, which has built fiber-optic networks in more than a dozen cities, said the Baby Bells had persistently indulged in "gamesmanship" to stop rivals. "It's delay, delay, delay," he said.
Some Bell companies have tried to declare the competitive services illegal. Some have refused to give rival companies telephone numbers to assign to customers, or have refused to let the rivals' customers list their numbers in telephone directories. Some have fought fiercely to stop long-distance companies from offering in-state long-distance service.
 
Suddenly, Unlisted Numbers
 When a tiny Texas company called Metrolink Telecom set up a special service between Houston and Galveston, Southwestern Bell tried to shut it down. Metrolink, which used lines leased from Southwestern, allowed people in Houston to call hotels in Galveston by making a local phone call. Southwestern Bell complained that the service was not allowed. When Metrolink refused to agree to a host of restrictions, Southwestern stopped listing the hotels' numbers in its telephone directory.
Last July, a Texas state court awarded Metrolink $5.7 million in antitrust damages. Southwestern Bell is appealing and has refused to pay.
And when Maryland regulators were preparing to certify a new company, MFS Communications of Omaha, to compete for basic telephone service, Bell Atlantic argued that MFS should reimburse it for almost all the revenue it lost from each customer who defected.
Invoking a team of economists led by Alfred C. Kahn -- who was one of President Jimmy Carter's top advisers on Government deregulation -- Bell Atlantic argued that MFS should pay it $34.95 a month for every business telephone line that it signed up, even though the cost of the line itself was only $12.81 a month. The rest of the "contribution," Bell Atlantic argued, was to cover the cost of subsidies that keep residential telephone service cheap. After enormous debate, Maryland officials cut MFS's payment to about $20 a line.
To be sure, some regional telephone companies have been more receptive to competition. Ameritech Inc., which is based in Chicago and operates local phone companies in the Midwest, has developed a detailed plan under which rivals would be allowed to plug into its network and provide a full range of local services. Just last week, Illinois approved an application by MFS to become a full-service telephone carrier.
 
 
Nynex Lets Rivals In
 In New York, where state regulators were among the first to press for competition, the Nynex Corporation has opened itself to full-service rivals like MFS and Teleport. "To Nynex's credit, it's worked out," said Lisa Rosenblum, vice chairwoman of the New York Public Service Commission. "They have seen that the world is very different."
Royce M. Holland, president of MFS Communications, suggested that regional companies that cooperate with competitors should be rewarded. "The regional Bell companies should no longer be viewed as a monolith," he said. "We think companies like Nynex and Ameritech ought to be let into the long-distance business five years before companies like Bell Atlantic."
Most experts agree with the Bell companies that the traditional regulatory practice of separating communications companies into protected fiefs is out of date, given that technology has created a trend toward competition among telephone, cable television and computer services.
Teleport and MFS have each built fiber-optic networks in more than a dozen cities that provide services to big corporate customers. Long-distance companies like AT&T and MCI Communications are edging back into local markets as both move to build nationwide wireless telephone networks. Both companies also compete against local Bell companies for in-state long-distance calls.
Perhaps most important, cable television companies are racing to offer both telephone and data communication services over their networks, which already pass by more than 90 percent of all American homes. Time Warner recently reached an agreement in Rochester to offer residential phone service, and Southwestern Bell applied to compete against Bell Atlantic in Maryland, using cable television systems it owns there to offer phone service.
 
 
Regulatory Hurdles
 Still, largely for regulatory reasons, the competition is more theoretical than real.
Only four states -- Illinois, Maryland, New York and Washington -- have authorized rival companies to offer what industry executives call "P.O.T.S." -- plain old telephone service. Rivals like Teleport and MFS generated only $251 million of revenues last year -- paltry beside the roughly $90 billion of revenues for the established telephone giants.
Telephone companies say the blame lies primarily with local regulators, who have used regulated telephone prices to construct elaborate subsidies. Residential phone prices are kept artificially low, they contend, while business services are inflated. These subsidies are possible only in a regulated monopoly environment, because competitors can instantly undercut prices that are far above actual costs.
"Companies like AT&T, Sprint and Teleport want to exploit business opportunities that exist solely because of the regulatory environment," said James Ellis, general counsel for Southwestern Bell, which has been an aggressive opponent of local competition. "It's an artificial situation."
 
 
Big Fines Demanded
 Even so, the Bell companies have been tenacious in raising obscure issues. In 1992, Bell Atlantic seized on a Federal court decision that required AT&T's long-distance rivals to disclose their prices. Bell Atlantic argued that the case also applied to its rivals and asked the F.C.C. to declare their services illegal. On June 30, Bell Atlantic demanded that the commission fine each competitor in its territory $1 million a customer.
Likewise, the BellSouth Corporation and other companies waged a shrill campaign two years ago to prevent the F.C.C. from forcing local telephone companies to let rivals set up their own equipment on Bell company premises. At one point, BellSouth's chairman, John L. Clendenin, wrote a blistering letter to an F.C.C. commissioner, Ervin S. Duggan, accusing him of failing to understand the issue.
At the local level, trench warfare has been persistent. In Texas, Southwestern Bell went to court to stop a small company called Centex Telemanagement from offering a package of services to small businesses. The company recently wrote off millions of dollars in legal expenses, and was sold to MFS Communications.
"If you're a competitor and you're thinking about investing a lot of money in this state, you start asking yourself, 'Why? Why should I go through all this?' " said Bill Magness, head of the Communications Coalition of Texas, an association that includes consumer groups, cable companies like Time Warner and aspiring rivals like Teleport Communications.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE WHIP;
A Republican Who Sees Himself as a Revolutionary on the Verge of Victory

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
While the Democratic leaders in Congress are struggling to write health legislation that follows President Clinton's principles, Newt Gingrich, the Republican whip, has united his party in the House of Representatives against such a bill and hopes to use the issue as a springboard to win Republican control of the House.
This would not be a modest accomplishment. Republicans now have 78 fewer seats than Democrats and have been a minority in the House for the last 40 years. 
 But Mr. Gingrich is not a modest man. He calls himself a revolutionary and freely compares what he is trying to do to the way Vaclav Havel, Lech Walesa and Boris N. Yeltsin brought down Communism in their countries.
In an interview in his office this week, Mr. Gingrich, in his rat-a-tat style, offered this capsule description of the state of American politics:
"We were faced with a system that was corrupt. The system refused to respond to the country as it changed. We adopted a series of positions that were very popular in the country -- a balanced-budget amendment, a line-item veto, no tax increases -- and the corrupt Democratic machine that should have responded remained rigid and stuck in place.
"It then won an accidental election for President with 43 percent of the vote, and instead of moving to the center, which would have required analyzing the Perot vote, which was anti-government and for cutting spending -- an amazing populist rebellion -- it moved to the left. What you got was Dukakis with a southern accent.
"Faced with that reality, whether it's the collapse of the Japanese system, the collapse of the Italian system, the collapse of the Russian system, the collapse of the Canadian governing party last year, we are the natural result. We are reformers. We are prepared to say bluntly what the machine is. And we're prepared to offer policies that are very popular in the country and very unpopular in this city. And that's fine with us. Our power base isn't in this city."
That sounds more like the grandiosity of a student radical from a generation ago than the cogent analysis of an experienced politician. But in the politically polarized world of the House, Mr. Gingrich's views are not seen as far-fetched.
Fifty-one years old and in his eighth term in Congress from a district on the outskirts of Atlanta, Mr. Gingrich has been the whip, the No. 2 position in his party's leadership in the House, since 1989. The Republican leader, Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, is retiring after this session of Congress, and Mr. Gingrich is assured of getting the top spot.
 
Republicans in Lock Step
 As whip, he has united Republicans in the House to an extent no party in Congress has been unified in the last half-century. All the Republicans voted against the Clinton budget last year, and odds are they will vote as a bloc against a health bill if it bears any resemblance to what the President proposed.
Even if the President's health measure passes over their solid opposition, as his budget did, Republicans will still benefit politically, Mr. Gingrich holds. He says most Americans do not want radical changes in the nation's health system.
Among Republicans in the House, the mood resembles that of a well-drilled army on the advance.
"There is a tremendous amount of excitement in the Republican Party today," said Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, a soft-spoken moderate who is miles apart from Mr. Gingrich in temperament and ideology but who gives Mr. Gingrich primary credit for what he calls a resurgence of the party in the House. If Republicans capture the House, Mr. Leach will become chairman of the Banking Committee.
"It is all related to the possibility that this is an earthquake year and, if not this year, then in the next election," Mr. Leach said.
The Democrats, meanwhile, seem dispirited. Groping for the right word, Representative Romano L. Mazzoli of Kentucky said, "There's a kind of uneasiness and wariness, a jumpiness about how all this is going to work out."
The Republicans maintain that the health issue is their lever for prying control of the House away from the Democrats.
"This goes to the core of the difference between Democrats and Republicans," Mr. Gingrich said last week in an interview in his office in the Capitol. "I suggested to Hillary a year and a half ago -- I said, 'I would not ever try to change 14 percent of the national economy in one bill.' I said they should bring in a bill a year, and they should do five good things a year and minimum damage. I said: 'You can't write a comprehensive bill. Nobody is smart enough to write a comprehensive bill.' "
On Friday, after the House had completed its regular business for the week, Mr. Gingrich took the floor and proposed the legislative equivalent of a duel. He suggested that the Democrats and Republicans put their versions of health legislation forward before the August Congressional recess and that the House vote on one or the other, with no amendments allowed, the first week after Congress returns in September. He also challenged President Clinton to a debate during the recess.
Mr. Gingrich said that among the elements of the Republicans' legislation, still an unfinished product, would be insurance reforms, tax breaks for small businesses and the self-employed, tax-free medical savings accounts, rules making it more difficult to win claims of medical malpractice, more leeway for states to manage their Medicaid programs and a large increase in the number of Government-supported community health centers.
 
The Republican Bill
 Unlike what President Clinton wants, the Republican measure would not guarantee universal health insurance coverage and would not require employers to provide insurance for their workers.
"I think I can solve a third of the problems of the system this year and do almost no damage," Mr. Gingrich said in the interview. "I think next year we can work on solving another third. And then, we'll look and see what's left to be done and do that."
Democrats argue that he is simply being an obstructionist. Representative David R. Obey, of Wisconsin, said Mr. Gingrich and his allies "would rather embarrass the majority than move the consensus; they will do whatever is necessary to deny Clinton a political victory."
Mr. Gingrich denied the accusation. He noted that he had supported the President and rounded up support for the North American Free Trade Agreement last year. Mr. Obey, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, voted against it.
Even so, Mr. Gingrich is surely the most partisan and most ideological leader the Republicans have had in Congress at least since World War II.
For years, the Republican leaders in the House were men like Mr. Michel and Gerald R. Ford, men who befriended their Democratic counterparts and fought hard but always clean. Outnumbered, they could be counted on to compromise in a way that often left them with little more than crumbs.
But with Ronald Reagan's election in 1980, the character of the party in the House began to change. Gradually, the Eastern prep school graduates and Midwestern Main Street bankers who had been dominant retired and were replaced by young, die-hard conservatives more interested in cause than class and who favored combat over conciliation.
Out in the country, Republicans are split between social and religious conservatives on the one hand and economic conservatives on the other. In the House they are mostly one and the same.
A bell curve charting the views of Republicans in the House would not only be to the right of one showing the views of Americans as a whole, it would also be more conservative than one charting the views of Republican voters alone.
This could hurt Mr. Gingrich's effort to win control of the House for Republicans, said James Thurber, a political scientist at American University who studies Congress and the Presidency. "The middle has shifted for the Republican Party in the House," Mr. Thurber said. "The data don't show that the middle has shifted in the country."
 
Death and Taxes
 Mr. Gingrich disagrees. He argues that a new center is developing over issues like the death penalty and low taxes.
In any case, winning a Republican majority in the House is a formidable task, but one that for the first time in many years even Democrats concede is within reach. With Republicans holding 178 seats now to 256 for the Democrats, 40 seats would have to change hands for the Republicans to take a majority.
Mr. Gingrich maintained that his party's best forecasters are predicting they will win 34 additional House seats in this November's election. If that happens, Mr. Gingrich said, he knows of six disaffected Democrats who have told him they will switch parties to put Republicans over the top.
More neutral forecasters think a 34-seat switch is unlikely. Charles E. Cook Jr., who publishes a nonpartisan newsletter that handicaps every race, says the turnover is likely be 15 to 25 seats. But even if Mr. Gingrich is wrong and Mr. Cook is right, a majority could be well within the Republicans' grasp in 1996.
Much of what happens, of course, depends on Mr. Clinton. The more popular he is at election time this year and in 1996, the more likely the Democrats will do well in Congressional races. And Mr. Clinton's popularity could depend to a large extent on whether he gets the health legislation he wants and whether the public approves of that legislation.
That prospect, Mr. Gingrich said, fills him with anticipation. He cannot wait to become Speaker of the House.

HEADLINE: Eight Tell What They'd Do If They Had Coliseum Site

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
The collapse of Mortimer B. Zuckerman's nine-year effort to build high-rise office and apartment buildings on the site of the New York Coliseum has left new uncertainty, and new possibilities, for what may be New York City's most highly coveted development parcel.
But what, if anything, will be built at Columbus Circle? Who will build it? And when? 
 One option is for the city and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to seek proposals from other developers quickly. Another is to put the Coliseum building to new uses, from stores to television studios. Yet another is simply to wait for an improving real-estate market to command a better price.
Few doubt that something, eventually, will be built. Eight people who have observed the saga of the Coliseum at close range offered their thoughts on the form that any development should take, and what should be done to plan for it. THOMAS J. LUECK
 
Edward I. Koch
Mayor, 1978-1989
We have a clean slate. That means the property can be kept off the market for two years while real-estate values go up. Then there should be a request for proposals that is not complicated but offers the total lot under the provision that a building will go up as a matter of right. That means no special approvals from the Planning Commission. Whatever current law allows in height restrictions should apply.
Building under existing codes should eliminate all lawsuits and will mean that finally you get a building up in a reasonable period of time. The only considerations should be the quality of architecture, the price paid for the property and the building's economic impact on the area. You don't necessarily take the highest price for the site if the building is not going to be high quality. Because of its economic impact, I would give points for a building that is a combination of housing and commercial space.
Finally, whatever proposal is accepted should require the developer to provide improvements to the subway station at Columbus Circle.

Robert A. Caro
Author of "The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York"
Every morning I walk by Columbus Circle and think to myself that this is a unique opportunity in the life of the city. The Coliseum site should be New York's version of the Etoile in Paris. It should be a great star,
something worthy of the city, of a new and shining New York.
In fact, it is a great star already, with broad avenues radiating from a circle and converging on it in all directions. It has a great park on one side, and a monumental entrance to that park. The foundation is in place to make it a symbol of a city that is at last going to be as great as it should have been.
I don't know what should go there, and I am not saying there shouldn't be apartments or offices, new jobs and revenue. But there should be something more.
This site is not something that should simply be left to developers. Its planning should be the responsibility of the city.
The young and idealistic Robert Moses would have agreed. It was the old Robert Moses -- the power broker Robert Moses -- who slapped down what we see now, this horrible Coliseum building. I always considered the Coliseum he built to be an example of the city's loss of vision.

Larry A. Silverstein
Manhattan developer, one of several builders who submitted proposals for the Coliseum project in 1985
It was a superb site then, and it is a superb site today. Nothing has changed except the value structure, which has been reduced from the halcyon days of the 1980's. The prices we felt we could obtain then for condominiums, and the rents for retail and office
space, are markedly different now.
But the reality is that the market is beginning to come back, and I have little doubt that if the property were put on the market in a year or two, developers will surface.
The type of project we envisioned in the 1980's is still the most appropriate for the site -- mixed use, with luxury condos and offices. Stepping back awhile, until the market recovers, may be the best approach.
I think a mixed-use building can be designed for that site that is very pleasing. But that assumes that the design is contextual and blends with the wonderful buildings along Central Park West. That means, to some degree, Art Deco.
There is no question in my mind that if there is an opportunity to do something that is sensitive to the buildings that permeate Central Park West, the public will support it and a building will go up.

Moshe Safdie
Architect who conceived Mr. Zuckerman's original plan for the Coliseum site
If I was the city, I would recognize that this is one of the most unique sites it has. I would demolish both the Coliseum and 10 Columbus Circle [the adjoining office building]. I would reinstate 59th Street as a visual corridor, if
not as a street, and I would redefine Columbus Circle as a public space. You need to define the circle as a pedestrian and vehicular route, and put more activity for people at street level.
By definition, whatever building goes up is going to be mixed use. I think there should be retail space and cultural activities, as well as condos and offices.
Having time is good. If a weak market means you wait two or three years, that's O.K. But this site demands ambition. The first thing the city ought to do is take the initiative to establish a compelling urban design framework. In the past it has been rather vague about what it hoped get out of this site.

Ruth W. Messinger
Manhattan Borough President
From 1980 to 1984, we had a comprehensive planning program for the entire Columbus Circle area, not just the Coliseum. It involved the M.T.A., the Parks Department, the Planning Commission. I think it now the appropriate time to re-create that kind of
collaborative effort.
The city could, as an interim step, reuse the Coliseum building as a convention hall. The Javits Center is overbooked, and we regularly get requests from people who want to put on trade shows. But ultimately the site has got to be developed.
It has always been hard for me to understand why what is potentially one of the most beautiful sites in the city is used as a motorcycle parking lot. It could be as great as any central square in Europe. It should be a circle, unlike the mishmash it has been for years, which flows naturally from Central Park. It should have statuary and a signature building.

Linda Davidoff
Executive director of the Parks Council
Looking toward a 21st-century New York that is a magnet for people, the city and the M.T.A., instead of cashing in every nickel that can be squeezed out of the site from a high-rise commercial development, should look for ways to build a splendid civic space.
Whatever structure goes up should help announce the entrance to Central Park. It should provide seating and viewing areas looking across Columbus Circle to the park. An open plaza should be incorporated into the lobby, flowing into the outside open space. And all the street-level space should connect with a splendid new subway concourse below ground, with clear views from the circle and the park to the concourse and back again.
It's important for the public agencies not to make the errors of the past, by giving approvals for a giant slab high-rise that would cast a shadow over the park and overwhelm Columbus Circle.

Richard Seth Hayden
Partner in Swanke Hayden Connell, a Manhattan architectural firm. His office, at 4 Columbus Circle, overlooks the Coliseum.
The wonderful thing about Columbus Circle is that it was once actually a circle. But it has been terribly broken up by the design of the present building. Part of going forward should be to bring it back as a circle.
Whatever is built should echo the circle
shape in its facade instead of the straight lines of the Coliseum. At least the first six to eight stories should be related to the streetscape, where we have the statue in Columbus Circle as a center point and the entrance to Central Park.
A little replanning is in order. There has been so much negativism surrounding this project that it would be refreshing to take another look.
We need to establish urban design guidelines. But it could be like the lovely intersections of Paris.

Kent L. Barwick
President of the Municipal Art Society
This is the finest site in New York. But we should not use it simply to raise enough money to balance the city's books for the next 10 years.
What really went wrong in this project that the city stepped out of its role as a referee
between the interests of builders and the public, and became a developer itself. It sold zoning.
Now we have a great opportunity to take a great public space next to the city's most beloved public space -- Central Park -- and make something coherent out of it.
No development is not the answer, and it is not realistic to expect something like a two-story cultural center. We are going to have two substantial New York City buildings, but we should be riveted on one simple thing -- the city has got to take a leadership role to determine the best development. It has to determine some basic design guidelines for the site.
This is exactly the moment not to rest but to plan and to provoke public discussion about what should be built. While the real-estate market is flat or just beginning to recover, it is time to establish basic design guidelines.

HEADLINE: The Key Issue on North Korea

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 23

 BODY:
The announcement on Thursday that despite the death two weeks ago of its absolute ruler, North Korea had agreed to resume high-level talks with Washington on its nuclear program has restored the hint of optimism that was injected into the crisis a month ago.
But Government officials, diplomats and experts say the prospects for real progress in halting the North's suspected nuclear weapons program remain about as clear as the muddy pond bristling with 8,000 radioactive fuel rods at a major nuclear complex in North Korea. 
 The fate of the nearly opaque pool of water is one of the most pressing issues the two sides will face when they meet in two weeks. In fact, what happens to the pool, believed to contain the raw material for four or five nuclear bombs, could determine the course of this dangerous standoff in a matter of weeks.
If the United States cannot persuade North Korea to abandon plans for quickly extracting the bomb material, plutonium, from the spent uranium rods, the talks appear likely to break down. That would push the two countries closer to a military confrontation long before they have had a chance to tackle the range of political and economic issues they have said they want to discuss.
"This issue will be the touchstone of the North's intentions," said Leonard S. Spector, an expert on nuclear issues at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "If this gets resolved in a positive way, it will demonstrate good faith. If they respond in another way, it would create very serious problems."
 
An Array of Complex Issues
 A senior American official involved in the issue added: "It's true. This must be handled first, and pretty quickly."
Even if the problem is resolved in time, it would still leave an array of immensely complex issues on the table. North Korea has asked for a modern light-water nuclear reactor for electric power generation to replace its outmoded graphite-core models. But who would finance a deal that could ultimately cost well over $10 billion, take a decade or more to complete and require the upgrading of North Korea's entire power transmission system?
Who would pay for and manage the modernization of North Korea's antiquated coal-fired power plants, which would be needed to sustain the economy until the new nuclear plant was built? How would the United States react if the North Koreans continued to refuse access to two nuclear waste sites, which may hold the key to determining how much plutonium the North already has?
And would North Korea, one of the most closed societies on earth, really be willing to reverse four decades of hostility to the non-Communist world and open up to build the political bridges it says it wants?
Even though the negotiators have so little time to overcome some of these hurdles, there is a sense of promise mixed in with the uncertainty, because of the unusual series of events over the last few months.
The turning point came in June. After 18 months of broken agreements by North Korea on opening its nuclear facilities to international inspections, the Government defied the International Atomic Energy Agency and removed the spent six-foot-long fuel rods from a small reactor at a complex at Yongbyon, about 60 miles north of the capital, Pyongyang.
If the rods were reprocessed, something the North Koreans said was necessary for safety reasons, the yield would be more than 20 pounds of plutonium, which can be used to create a nuclear explosion. The agency and the United States insisted that such a step had to be resisted vigorously, and so Washington pushed for United Nations trade sanctions. North Korea responded by vowing it would interpret an embargo as an act of war.
 
A Conciliatory Turn
 But suddenly, after mediation by former President Jimmy Carter, North Korea's hard-line leader, Kim Il Sung, took a sharp conciliatory turn. He agreed to freeze his nuclear plans and to hold the first summit meeting between North and South Korea since the two countries were created in 1948 if the United States would hold high-level talks.
The meetings with the United States began on July 8, and after one day American officials said they were encouraged. But the announcement the next day that Kim Il Sung had died of a heart attack put the talks on hold and left everyone wondering if the new mood could be sustained.
The first sign came this week, when North Korea agreed to resume the meetings with the United States on Aug. 5 in Geneva. It was the first tangible sign that Kim Jong Il, Mr. Kim's son and presumed successor, would continue his father's policies.
That still leaves the problem of the spent fuel rods. Two inspectors are currently at Yongbyon, intently watching to see if the North Koreans try to remove the rods and begin reprocessing.
 
Reactor as the Carrot
 Ultimately, the United States is seeking to have the rods removed entirely, so there would be no possibility that the uranium would be reprocessed. The inducement would be, in part, the light-water reactor, which the North Koreans have been requesting for the past year.
The modern light-water reactors produce far less plutonium than the graphite-moderated reactors used in North Korea. But they also use a fuel that the North does not produce, and they are very costly.
That is one of the reasons the discussions of the light-water reactor are so crucial: if North Korea accepts a deal -- abandoning its current nuclear program in favor of the new reactors and aid -- it would mean the biggest shift in foreign policy since the country began the Korean War in 1950. It would mean cooperation had replaced a war footing.
That is what is at stake.
"We're prepared to put more on the table than security issues," said Robert L. Gallucci, Assistant Secretary of State and head of the American delegation. "It's a very full agenda. But the nuclear issue has to be dealt with first."

HEADLINE: U.S. May Thwart China's Trade Goal

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, July 23

 BODY:
China, which has staked its national prestige on becoming a founding member of the World Trade Organization, must comply with the international group's rules before entry, a Clinton Administration official said here today.
In some of the bluntest language directed at Beijing over trade issues this year, Charlene Barshefsky, the deputy United States trade representative, accused the Chinese of widespread shortcomings in their compliance with global trade rules and demanded that the Chinese move toward resolving a list of outstanding trade grievances with Washington. 
 "First and foremost, the multilateral system has rules, and these are rules to which there are no exceptions, and there can be no exceptions for China," Ms. Barshefsky said. "As no one country is special and can have its own special series of rules, China is not special and should not have any unwarranted special rules that apply to it."
 
The U.S. Complaints
 The United States has complained that China has not complied with international rules on access to its markets and protection of copyrights and patents. China has argued that its status as a developing country should be taken into consideration.
The World Trade Organization, the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the body that is intended to promote global free trade by lowering tariffs and other barriers, will be formally constituted on Jan. 1.
Beijing has repeatedly declared that it intends and deserves to be a founding member of the trade group and has accused Washington of raising obstacles to its membership by making excessive demands. But Ms. Barshefsky said China's admission required more than polemics.
"We have indicated to the Chinese that we recognize the importance China attaches to this date," she said, "but we have indicated also that China has much to do if it is to meet this deadline it has set for itself. But we must have a protocol of accession that is on strict economic terms. This is not a political decision."
But a senior official at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris said the American position was at odds with that of Europe.
 
$23 Billion Trade Deficit
 "What's interesting is why the U.S. is taking a harsher position than others," said the official, who spoke only on the condition that he not be identified. "The Europeans have indicated they would rather have China in earlier than later. The U.S. is taking a harder line, and it has to do with the bilateral trade imbalance. If the U.S. really wants to block China it can, but it depends on what other games the U.S. is playing."
Indeed, last year the United States ran a $23 billion trade deficit with China, and in the first five months of this year the deficit was $9.2 billion.
Ms. Barshefsky's comments, made at a news conference at the United States Consulate here this morning, came after a visit to Beijing, where she outlined the Administration's demands for changes in China's trade policies and enforcement of laws that it has already enacted.
Chief among the bilateral issues addressed to the Chinese, the deputy trade representative said, was China's failure to enforce laws protecting copyrights. For many years, China has been a big source of pirated musical compact disks and video laser disks, the United States has asserted. In addition, virtually all the computer software distributed in China is illegally copied and distributed, Ms. Barshefsky said.
"China has changed its legal regime with respect to intellectual property rights," she said, "but there is no enforcement of the laws that have been very carefully crafted."
She said piracy and theft of American-produced music, videos and software in China was costing American companies $1 billion a year.
Ms. Barshefsky said the Administration had demanded that Beijing take immediate steps, which would not only go a great distance to resolving bilateral trade friction with Washington, but which would assist in China's effort to join the World Trade Organization.
At the top of the list was an insistence that Beijing move swiftly to close 26 factories in southern China that churn out, by Ms. Barshefsky's estimate, 75 million pirated compact disks and video laser disks a year.
Ms. Barshefsky said she had also told the Chinese Government that China must move to open its market for services to American companies.
 
Administration's Approach
 The Clinton Administration has been unequivocal in its assertions that the resolution of bilateral trade issues will have a direct bearing on how it views China's application to the World Trade Organization. In testimony earlier this month before the Senate Banking Committee, Treasury Under Secretary Lawrence H. Summers acknowledged that China's desire to be a founding member of the organization was the principal lever the Administration could use to persuade China to open its markets.
The O.E.C.D. official said China's compulsion to join the new trade group from the outset was driven by national prestige and by its desire to beat Taiwan, which has met virtually all the terms for membership. "It's national prestige," he said. "That's it. On the other hand, China's real concern is that it gets in before Taiwan, and Taiwan is pretty much ready to go."
"If the U.S. said no," the official said, "it would be extremely difficult for China to get in. The whole thing works on consensus. No one wants a blowup. But actually the Europeans rather enjoy the U.S. taking the hard line, while they take the soft line."
Ms. Barshefsky, consistent with the hard line adopted by the Administration, placed the burden of qualifying for membership squarely on Beijing. "We want China in the GATT and the W.T.O.," she said. "China surely must be in the great international institutions and multilateral system. But China is not special. China must make adjustments."

HEADLINE: Rebellion Of Greens Is Brewing In the West

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M., July 22

 BODY:
The politics of environmentalism is once again provoking outrage in the West, where anger among farmers and ranchers crystallized a generation ago in the Sagebrush Rebellion.
But this time it is environmentalists who are rebelling, fielding a third-party slate in New Mexico. 
 Political analysts here say that the Green Party, often referred to as the Greens, is not to be taken lightly in a state swelling with newcomers drawn largely by the natural splendors of soaring mountain peaks and lush valleys. As voters, such newcomers are far more likely to join the Sierra Club than the Cattlemen's Association.
Even the state's Democratic Party leaders, while discounting the chances of a Green victory in November elections, have expressed fears that the third party could help Republicans wrest the Governor's office from Bruce King, a Democrat seeking his fourth term.
"I wouldn't count the Greens out by any means," said Roger Morris, a political analyst and writer here who served in the Administrations of Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Lyndon B. Johnson. "There are a lot of people who have come to New Mexico looking for an alternative way. And they're going to give support and money to the Greens."
 
Experienced Candidate
 While third-party candidates generally face daunting odds, two Governors were elected as independents in 1990: Lowell P. Weicker Jr. in Connecticut and Walter J. Hickel in Alaska.
The Green Party here achieved instant credibility by virtue of its candidate for governor: Roberto Mondragon, a former Lieutenant Governor (as a Democrat) and Spanish-language radio broadcaster.
With his political background, Mr. Mondragon has helped to dispel the image of the Greens as pie-in-the-sky idealists without any practical experience in government. And as a native of Guadalupe County who grew up tending goats and chickens near the banks of the Pecos River, he lends ethnic diversity to a movement sometimes dismissed as a fashionable hobby for well-to-do whites.
"The Green Party stands for what the state Democratic Party ought to stand for," Mr. Mondragon said as he sat in the shade of a cottonwood tree in the plaza of downtown Santa Fe.
The party is also backing candidates for lieutenant governor, state treasurer, land commissioner and a Congressional seat.
 If the Greens achieve a measure of success in the New Mexico elections, environmentalists and political experts say it could presage similar campaigns in other Western states.
New Mexico, while culturally distinctive with its Spanish and ancient Indian cultures, is a traditional bellwether in national politics. Since it joined the union in 1912, the state has backed the winning Presidential candidate in every election but one, in 1976, when voters here supported Gerald R. Ford. And the changes taking place in New Mexico, with more new jobs being created in boutiques than on ranches, mirror the economic and political trends throughout the West.
 
Attracted to Party Stands
 Mr. Mondragon, who was elected to the New Mexico Legislature at the age of 25, worked in the Presidential campaigns of Robert F. Kennedy, George McGovern, Edward M. Kennedy and Jesse Jackson. He said he had never belonged to an environmental group but had accepted the offer to run as a Green because the party took liberal positions on a wide range of issues, from abortion rights to health care for all Americans.
"There used to be room for liberals in the Democratic Party here," he said. "But there isn't room anymore. If you look at the contributors for the Democratic Party today, it's the same people that you'll find on the list of contributors for the Republican Party."
On environmental issues, Mr. Mondragon said, the Green Party would take "a more realistic approach" than some environmentalists might favor. He said, for example, that he "wouldn't want to sacrifice the job of a local person for the sake of a tree."
But he said the Democrats in New Mexico had neglected the state's interests on many environmental issues. As examples, he cited Democratic support for a planned nuclear waste storage site near Carlsbad and tax breaks for Albuquerque corporations that consume huge amounts of water. And he said Democrats had failed to deal with the pollution of the Red River Valley by tailings from a molybdenum mine near Questa.
With his shoulder-length gray hair and beard, black boots and silver bracelet, Mr. Mondragon has a counterculture style that fits easily into the artsy world of Santa Fe. He has been known to draw a crowd simply by sitting on the hood of his car and strumming a guitar. It is less clear how voters in business suits in suburban Albuquerque and Las Cruces will warm to his candidacy.
He has said he will not accept contributions from individuals of more than $100. Mr. Mondragon, who appeared in the 1988 movie "The Milagro Bean Field Wars," hinted that "some Hollywood actors" might help his campaign raise money. The movie was produced by Robert Redford, who has long been active in liberal politics and environmental causes.
 
Republican Appears to Lead
 A survey of 500 registered voters on the governor's race, published in The Albuquerque Journal last Sunday, found the Republican candidate, Gary Johnson, leading with 37 percent. Governor King had 29 percent and Mr. Mondragon 9 percent. About one-quarter of the voters said they were undecided. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points for the survey, conducted July 12 through 14.
Political analysts say the poll was taken much too early in the campaign to be meaningful, especially since the Green Party announced its candidates only a few weeks ago. Even so, Mr. Morris said it was "astonishing" that Mr. Mondragon would draw nearly 10 percent of the vote even before his candidacy became widely known.
The Greens, a loose-knit political movement in the United States not connected with the political parties of the same name in Europe, also plans to sponsor candidates this fall in Alaska, Arizona, California and Hawaii.
The fortunes of the Greens here rest largely on the difficulties of the two major political parties. Governor King, a 70-year-old rancher with a folksy style and the reputation of a deal-making politician, appears to be vulnerable after a bruising Democratic primary. In a three-way contest, he won the nomination with just 39 percent of the vote.
And the Republicans enter almost any statewide race with a disadvantage, since they are outnumbered by Democrats nearly 2 to 1. If elected, Mr. Johnson, a self-made millionaire in the construction business, would be only the second Republican Governor here in more than 20 years.
 
Help Seen for G.O.P.
 Ray Powell, the Democratic Party chairman, expressed surprise and chagrin that Mr. Mondragon would run under the Green banner, a candidacy that Mr. Powell said could only help the Republicans.
"He has worked all his life for the benefit of disadvantaged people," Mr. Powell said. "And the only possible thing he's going to accomplish here is helping Gary Johnson, a man who is antagonistic to everything Roberto has ever stood for."
But John Rensenbrink, who publishes The Green Horizons newsletter on environmentalist politics, said the Democratic Party had not earned the loyalty of environmentalists.
"In some cases, it's true that our entry might result in a Republican winning," Mr. Rensenbrink said. "But the Democrats just have not come through for us."
Mr. Mondragon said he did not consider himself a spoiler, insisting, "We're in this to win."

HEADLINE: A Rights Leader Minimizes Racism as a Poverty Factor

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
In a marked departure from the longtime stance of many other civil rights leaders, the new head of the National Urban League is minimizing the significance of white racism as a factor in the poverty of inner-city blacks.
In a speech that he is to deliver on Sunday, Hugh P. Price, the league's president and chief executive officer, says that although racism is "still a well-documented and undeniable reality," intensified economic competition and employers' resulting need for better-educated, better-skilled workers are larger contributors to urban poverty. 
 "We must not let ourselves, and especially children, fall into the paranoid trap of thinking that racism accounts for all that plagues us," says the text of the speech, a copy of which was provided by the league. "The global realignment of work and wealth is, if anything, the bigger culprit."
The speech, the keynote address of the National Urban League's convention in Indianapolis, is the first policy statement by Mr. Price, a 52-year-old former vice president of the Rockefeller Foundation, since he assumed the leadership of the league on July 5. In tone and content, it reflects a sharp distinction from other civil rights leaders, most notably the Rev. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
 
'Racial Inclusion'
 For instance, while in recent months Mr. Chavis has publicly embraced black figures like Louis Farrakhan who have long advocated keeping political distance from whites, Mr. Price's speech emphasizes "racial inclusion."
"For all our suffering," the speech says, "we cannot become so fixated on our problems that we ignore our commonality of interests with others. All the problems I've addressed this evening -- inadequate schooling, idle and alienated youngsters, and chronic unemployment -- cut across racial lines. If we're ever to deal with them on a scale remotely equal to their size, we must coalesce with people of other complexions who feel the same pain, even if it isn't as acute."
And in a clear rebuff to Mr. Farrakhan, Mr. Price singles out Jews for praise, calling them "longstanding allies" for civil rights.
"Many whites of good will have accompanied us on our long journey for racial, social and economic justice," Mr. Price says. "None has matched the Jewish community as long-distance runners in the civil rights movement."
 
Focus on Underclass
 The speech is also noteworthy for its scarcity of references to goals that have been of primary interest to the black middle class: the setting aside of some government contracts for black-owned businesses and some scholarships for black students, the placement of more blacks in corporate board rooms and executive suites, and other affirmative action efforts. Instead, Mr. Price focuses on the inner-city poor, at one point asking the black middle class for financial contributions to a program intended to help poor youths.
"It's a moral imperative," Mr. Price said by telephone from Indianapolis, referring to his emphasis on the urban underclass. "And as a pragmatic matter, their pain affects us. The cynicism of kids growing up in the inner cities contributes to behaviors that are reported on the evening news, which ensnare all of our kids in negative stereotypes."
In his speech, Mr. Price urges blacks who can afford to do so to donate $500 or $1,000 to pay for counselors and other workers in the fledgling inner-city-youth program. The program, he says, would be run by community groups, other nonprofit bodies like the Y.M.C.A. and churches, and the Urban League would help raise the money and monitor how it was spent.
"There is that old saying that it takes a village to raise a child," Mr. Price said in the telephone interview. "Well, the black middle class has moved out of the village. That's the natural order of things. I don't ask the middle class to move back. But they have to move back spiritually, or at least financially."
In his address, Mr. Price also argues that business and government should be pressured to set aside jobs and training positions for poor people regardless of race, a stance that departs from civil rights groups' quarter-century-old advocacy of race-based preference programs.
Mr. Price contends that such a shift is needed both to respond to court rulings that have limited racial set-asides and to build political support.
"What if employers reserved training slots and real jobs for residents of neighborhoods or census tracts with high unemployment rates?" he said. "The way I see it, this wouldn't be a politically contentious race-based approach. Instead, it's a more palatable alternative which recognizes that poor people of all races need decent jobs."

HEADLINE: World Bank, At 50, Vows To Do Better

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
Marking its 50th anniversary, the World Bank vowed this week to be more selective about where it handed out loans and more sensitive to the environmental effects of its projects. It also promised to put more emphasis on human development programs rather than huge dams and power plants.
At a news conference at the World Bank's headquarters in Washington, the president of the bank, Lewis Preston, issued a "vision" statement detailing where the world's biggest lender intends to go in this new era dominated by free markets. 
 The World Bank, which originally focused on lending money to developing countries for projects like building roads, was born at an international conference at Bretton Woods, N.H., in July 1944.
In its statement, titled "Embracing the Future," Mr. Preston said the bank aimed now to meet five basic challenges. They include promoting broad-based economic growth that particularly benefits the poor and investing more in human development programs that support education, nutrition, family planning and the role of women. Human resource development now accounts for 17 percent of all World Bank loans, as opposed to 5 percent a decade ago.
 
'Increasing Diversity'
 Other goals are protecting the environment; stimulating private sectors so developing countries can become more competitive in the global economy, and reorienting governments to become more efficient at complementing the private sector, particularly in developing countries and former Communist lands.
"Given the increasing diversity among developing countries, the emphasis on each of those roles will vary according to specific circumstances," Mr. Preston said.
"In some of the middle-income nations of East Asia and Latin America, for example, those that can now attract high levels of private investment, the bank's financing will be relatively less important than its advice. By contrast, in the low-income countries of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, both our advice and large levels of financing will remain important for some time to come."
The needs of the centrally planned economies are different, Mr. Preston added. There, the bank's technical aid "will be important in helping to build market systems where there is little private-sector capacity and the bank's money will be catalytic in leveraging much larger flows of private capital."
 
The Critics Respond
 No sooner was Mr. Preston's report out than the bank's critics were responding. An ad hoc coalition known as the "50 Years Is Enough" campaign, made up of environmentalists, human rights advocates and some competing aid groups, suggested that the best change for the bank would be to go out of business.
The bank, the group said, should stop inflicting on the world a development approach that ignored the environment and a financing approach that emphasized macro-economic adjustment policies -- particularly cuts in Government spending and subsidies -- which tend to fall heaviest on the poor.
Doug Hellinger, managing director of the Development Gap and part of the "50 Years Is Enough" coalition, said: " 'Embracing the Future' should be entitled 'Shoving Aside the Poor.' In this new global economy the gap between rich and poor is widening and the destruction of the natural environment is accelerating."
At the news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Preston acknowledged that if there was one major mistake the bank made in its first 50 years, it was paying too little attention to environmental effects from projects.
 
200 Environmentalists Now
 "I think that the mistake the bank has paid the highest price for was not recognizing the importance of the environment," Mr. Preston said. "Initially they perceived that there was a conflict between development and environment. That mistake, I think, has in terms of the criticisms of the bank eroded some of the support the bank is entitled to."
Mr. Preston argued in an interview that this criticism was now "very much out of date" because in the 1980's there were three environmentalists on a staff of 11,000 employees and today there are 200.
Mr. Preston acknowledged that in the 1970's the bank had a clear-cut orientation toward helping state-owned enterprises become more efficient, but since then it has focused increasingly on getting countries to open their markets and sell off state-owned enterprises to put them in more efficient private hands. The bank, he said, has now financed more than 400 privatizations.

HEADLINE: As Vote Nears, Detroit Edges Closer to Gambling

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 23

 BODY:
Detroiters have rejected proposals to legalize casino gambling four times, most recently last year. But the success of gaming in a Canadian city just across the Detroit River may inspire voters to change their minds on Aug. 2.
On that day, Detroit residents will vote on two proposals, one to allow a casino on a moored riverboat and another to allow a casino owned by American Indians in Greektown, a downtown restaurant district. 
 The results could hinge on voters' feelings about the success of the new casino in Windsor, Ontario, which officials say has drawn nearly $1 million a day, much of it from Detroit, across the border.
Windsor, a staid blue-collar city of tidy small homes and just under 200,000 people, would not have been anyone's candidate for Canada's Reno. Since Casino Windsor, Ontario's first such operation, opened in a renovated art gallery on May 17, 19,000 people a day, on average, have been gambling, and casino and city officials say 80 percent to 85 percent of them come from the United States.
Those officials project that the crowds will get even bigger after a permanent casino is completed in 1995 at a cost of $300 million. As a result, many Detroit residents say it is time to grab a piece of the action.
 
Momentum Toward Approval
 "I think it would be a very good idea to have a casino in Detroit," said Sonya Grant, a 30-year-old student at Wayne State University and a former real estate broker. "I've been to the one in Windsor, but I don't like the idea of all our money going over there when we really need it here."
There have been no polls on the casino proposals, but the opposition to gambling in Detroit appears to be softening at a time when several states are turning to gambling as a source of revenue. After roundly rejecting casinos three times, the voters were more evenly split last year, with 51 percent opposed to legalizing gaming and 49 percent in favor.
Another factor in the vote may be black ministers. Their opinions are influential in Detroit, where 75 percent of the voters are black. Although the ministers solidly opposed the previous proposals, some prominent ministers are supporting the gambling proposals this year.
Gambling is still solidly condemned by the Council of Baptist Pastors and the city's new Mayor, Dennis Archer. While he is seeking economic growth, Mr. Archer said, "Casino gambling is not the answer."
But other Detroit residents are impressed with the 1,700 jobs that officials say Casino Windsor has created. The Detroit News, reversing its position, is supporting the proposals.
Some Windsor residents worry that Detroit casinos could end their city's miniboom. The Mayor there, Mike Hurst, said, "The casino is a very welcome part of our downtown revitalization, but just one part."
Mayor Hurst offered some advice for cities that are considering a casino: "The key is to do a lot of preparation, recognize that there is a down side to casinos, and don't put all your eggs in one basket."

HEADLINE: A Party for a Cleared Police Officer Stirs Up Racial Tension

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SPRINGFIELD, Mass., July 22

 BODY:
A month after Officer Donald Brown's welcome-back party, people here are still talking about it.
Officer Brown, who is white, had been on a paid leave of absence for killing an unarmed black man last winter, a case that had already caused an uproar, not least because of what many saw as the Police Department's unlikely portrayal of it: as an accident growing out of a mistake that stemmed from a hoax. 
 A grand jury cleared Officer Brown of wrongdoing, and a police commission decided not to hold disciplinary hearings, so his friends and colleagues decided to give him a party at the Ale House, a downtown tavern.
"Congratulate Don on a job well done (Keep up the good work)," read the invitations, which were posted at Police Headquarters.
 
Marches of Protest
 The party-givers say they were just trying to cheer up a colleague who had been devastated by the shooting. But to many others, the party sounded like a celebration of the death of Benjamin Schoolfield, the 20-year-old man whom the officer had shot to death. Blacks also point to a ham that was given to Officer Brown as a present at the party -- a gift traditionally exchanged, they say, by white vigilantes of the Old South.
Elected officials, white and black alike, have since denounced the party -- held on June 16 and attended by more than 200 people, about a third of them police officers -- as at least tasteless. Marches have been held to protest the gathering, and the police are now conducting an internal investigation of it.
The case has also led to a searching discussion of race and racism in this old, economically struggling New England city, the home of Merriam Webster dictionaries, George Washington's first arsenal, the Basketball Hall of Fame, Smith & Wesson guns, a growing number of violent street gangs and, according to the 1990 census, 156,983 people, of whom 28,484 are black.
"Why would they congratulate someone for a shooting?" said Chelan Jenkins, an 18-year-old friend of the Schoolfield family who has helped organize marches and vigils to protest both the shooting and the party.
To the protesters and their sympathizers, the party only heaped insult on injury; it came as the furor over the killing itself had not yet cooled.
 
Report of a Stolen Van
 The events that led to the killing began when a woman dialed 911 and reported that her van had been stolen at gunpoint. That call, the police now believe, was a hoax, perpetrated by the woman because she was afraid to tell her boyfriend that she had lent the van to an acquaintance, who in turn lent it to Mr. Schoolfield.
But when Officer Brown and his partner saw the van, a gray 1977 Dodge, on the night of Feb. 7, they assumed that armed robbers were driving it, the police said. Only a week earlier, three police officers in New England had been shot to death in the line of duty -- an extraordinary number for so brief a period in this region -- and Officer Brown had gone to one of the funerals, in Paxton, about 40 miles east of Springfield.
After the officers pulled the van over, Officer Brown, 27, who had been on the force for 17 months, got out of the police car. It is at this point that the police account becomes implausible, in the view of civil rights advocates here.
"Donald Brown approached the front of the van, and the window broke," Sergeant Reid said. "He misjudged his distance. He ran up to the van, and it just so happened that the gun and him went through the window. There was a struggle for the weapon. Brown was trying to retrieve his weapon from the van, and at the same time the van goes in reverse and the gun discharges, which propels Brown into the middle of the street."
 
What Did a Gift Mean?
 Despite the official rulings in Officer Brown's favor, rights organizations have persuaded the United States Justice Department to open an inquiry into the shooting. Tensions worsened when the Western Massachusetts Order of Black Law Enforcement Officers said that during the party last month, a ham was presented to Officer Brown. The ham, the group said, was a ritual gift of Old South vigilantes.
The Rev. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., the executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, says he heard of the ritual when he was growing up in eastern North Carolina.
"When African-Americans would escape from prison," Mr. Chavis said in an interview, "a posse would be formed. The people who brought him back, dead or alive, would be presented with hams. It's something that white vigilantes would be rewarded with sometimes for committing acts of racial violence."
At its recent convention in Chicago, the N.A.A.C.P. passed a resolution condemning both the shooting and the party.
To Chester J. Ardolino, the president of the Patrolmen's Union in Springfield, the N.A.A.C.P. response was an overreaction. "I don't think anybody was intentionally intending to offend anyone," said Mr. Ardolino, who was at the party. "At the worst, it was in poor taste."
Mr. Ardolino confirmed that a ham had been presented as a gift but said that he -- and, to his knowledge, everyone else at the party -- had been unaware of any ritual significance to it.
 
'An Unfair Shake'
 Officer Brown, on the advice of his lawyer, would discuss neither the shooting nor the party in detail. But in his first interview since the shooting, he said: "I have definitely gotten an unfair shake. It appears that there's a political game going on here."
He is supported by the Chief of Police, Ernest M. Stelzer. "I can see it happening," Chief Stelzer said of the police account of the shooting. "At night, under those circumstances, you're running with your weapon drawn."
A majority of the civilian commission that oversees the Police Department apparently agreed with that view; it voted 3 to 2 against holding disciplinary hearings. But Henry M. Thomas 3d, the panel's chairman, who is also the executive director of the local Urban League, said hearings should have been held. "I don't think anybody walked away with a confirmation of how the window got broken," he said. Mr. Thomas, who is black, and a Hispanic member voted for the hearings; the panel's three white members voted against.
Dante L. Molta, an investigator for the lawyers representing the Schoolfield family, says he has interviewed five witnesses who say that Officer Brown shot Mr. Schoolfield through the van's window.
Not likely, says the Hampden County District Attorney, William M. Bennett. He says forensic tests found no traces of glass on the bullet or in Mr. Schoolfield's wound, so the bullet could not have passed through the window. "I think the whole situation was a tragic accident," he said. "Period."
Mr. Bennett acknowledges that Officer Brown suffered no cuts or other injuries as a result of slamming his arm through the window. "Difficult to do," he said, "but not impossible."
Still, many people find it hard to believe that Officer Brown broke the van's window by smashing into it. "To accept it, you have to stretch the imagination a bit," said Benjamin Swan, who headed the local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. before he became a State Representative. "It left a lot of people in wonderment."
Mr. Schoolfield's family is now considering suing the city, the Schoolfields' lawyers say.
 
Bellwether Effort on Race
 A 32-year-old cousin, David Broxton, remembers Mr. Schoolfield, who was unemployed at the time of the shooting, as always playing Sega video games and basketball, a sport that was invented in this city just over a century ago.
"He was going to move to Oakland, Calif., with his father the next month," Mr. Broxton said, shaking his head. "He was going to do construction work with his father."
Springfield had thought that it quelled racial tensions half a century ago, a result of a program taught in the city's schools that these days would probably be called multicultural. Its efforts were chronicled in a 1945 book, "The Story of the Springfield Plan: One Community's Total War Against Prejudice," and a Warner Brothers film, "It Happened in Springfield."
But now residents are not so sure. Speaking of the welcome-back party for Officer Brown, Chief Stelzer said, "It just caused a lot of unnecessary tension and ill feeling throughout the department and the community."

HEADLINE: Benefits Are an Important Consideration

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "The New Faces of U.S. Manufacturing" (July 3), Louis Uchitelle writes that at the Rotoflow Corporation "automation has helped to keep the average blue collar wage at $13 an hour." This I did not say in my interview with him and it is totally incorrect. Average rates may be $13 an hour, but this is because of prevailing market rates and not because of automation. In fact, automation usually requires higher skilled workers (albeit fewer in number), and they can command higher pay rates for these skills. We have machinists earning over $19 an hour and, in general, wages at Rotoflow have been growing much faster than the national average. 
 Mr. Uchitelle doesn't even touch upon a significant portion of remuneration -- benefits. The impression from his article is that our employees are only payed $13 an hour and not much more than laborers in the garment and furniture industries. However, in the last few years we have introduced: family medical Insurance, 90 percent paid for by Rotoflow; sick leave; short- and long-term disability insurance; 401 (k) and pension plans, and annual leave of two, three or four weeks based on years of service.
I feel a balanced article should have made reference to the total remuneration package for our employees. We pay "market rates" in terms of the hourly rate but supplement this with the above benefits, thereby giving a compensation package well above the average.

HEADLINE: Squeeze the Dominican Republic

BYLINE: By Ronald V. Dellums; Ronald V. Dellums, Democrat of California, is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and a member of the Congressional Black Caucus.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Frustration over the Haitian military's refusal to restore the democratically elected Government, anxiety over waves of refugees heading to our shores and horror over capsized boats have generated calls for the forcible removal of Haiti's military. The Administration wants to preserve this option, and has sought explicit United Nations endorsement.
Macabre and protracted repression by Haiti's military has led many who have always opposed United States intervention abroad to embrace this position. Yet U.S. policymakers should consider the use of force -- anywhere -- only as a last resort. 
 The Administration has properly placed our enormous leverage on the side of democracy in Haiti. Since President Clinton appointed William Gray 3d as special envoy in May, U.S. policy has been far more resolute. To achieve our goals without military intervention, however, the White House must further refine its refugee policy and its push for comprehensive sanctions.
While rough seas and a crackdown by the Haitian military have stemmed the flow of refugees, there is no guarantee that this trend will last. And as long as the U.S. refuses to provide safe haven to any Haitian refugee intercepted at sea, our appeals to regional countries to do so will be met with understandable resistance. If we are to address charges of racism in our refugee policy, we must agree to provide safe haven to a reasonable percentage of boat people.
In addition, the Administration has not yet done all it can on sanctions. The U.S. has been maddeningly slow to use its full leverage to shut down the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. As soon as darkness falls, constant trade across it makes a joke of the embargo.
Only last week, the Administration pledged $15 million in military materiel, including helicopters, vehicles and communications equipment, to help the Dominican Republic seal the border, as Mr. Gray recommended two months ago. Mr. Clinton must not allow interagency squabbling, long the Achilles' heel of U.S. policy on Haiti, to undermine his authority. Yet the failure of the Dominican President, Joaquin Balaguer, to enforce sanctions cannot solely be ascribed to a lack of means to do so: it reflects both a lack of political will and longstanding links between business and military leaders in Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
President Clinton, therefore, ought to quickly incorporate into his Haiti policy provisions in the Governors Island Reinforcement Act, which now has more than 100 bipartisan co-sponsors in Congress, that would deny U.S. aid to the Dominican Republic if it continues to violate the sanctions.
Mr. Balaguer must be made to understand that $22 million in foreign aid for 1994 and the $180 million quota the U.S. reserves for Dominican sugar are at risk. And the Administration should make clear that, in return for military assistance, it expects quick, substantial progress on sealing the border.
The Haitian crisis is too dehumanizing for Haitians, too costly politically and economically for the U.S. and too threatening to democracy in the region for the Dominican Republic to be anything other than a committed partner in this effort. By not putting pressure on the Balaguer Government now, the Administration makes a military solution unavoidable.
A firm U.S. commitment to these strategies can restore democracy to Haiti without military force. But opposition to the use of force should not be misconstrued as a lessening of U.S. resolve that Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras and his high command must step down and of our commitment to restore the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the exiled President.
Many lament that sanctions will hurt only those we are trying to help. Yet while sanctions may hurt, Haiti's military kills -- more than 4,000 people since the 1991 coup. With neither airtight sanctions nor military intervention, the status quo will prevail. This would be a defeat not only for President Aristide and Haiti but for democracy throughout the region. And it would be a major failure for the Administration in light of its commitment to promote democracy abroad.
The Dominican Republic is Haiti's lifeline to the outside world, just as South Africa was Rhodesia's in the 1970's during Rhodesia's attempt to circumvent sanctions. The international community prevailed against white supremacy then, and we must prevail against despotism and military rule now.

HEADLINE: War Fever Over Haiti

 BODY:
President Clinton, feeling less pressure from refugees and sensing opposition at home, is having second thoughts about the urgency of invading Haiti. First, he wants a new, Desert Storm-style United Nations resolution that he hopes can persuade Gen. Raoul Cedras and his cronies to leave on their own. Yet the U.N. strategy, which would authorize member countries to use "all necessary means" to restore President Aristide to power and disarm his opponents, also relies on the logic of a military solution.
Meanwhile, U.S. forces conspicuously practice invasion preparations off the Haitian coast and White House and State Department aides pepper the airwaves with pointed warnings. Federal prosecutors investigate drug charges against Haitian military leaders in ways that are certain to recall the indictment of Manuel Noriega that became a key justification for the 1989 invasion of Panama. 
 Physically removing General Cedras and his cronies from Haiti should be easy work for a large enough expeditionary force. But then what? Military force is a notoriously blunt instrument for solving political problems.
Unlike many opponents of military intervention, this page fully endorses the return of President Aristide to power and harbors no illusions about the intentions of General Cedras and his murderous cohorts. But invasions, even of small countries with weak armies, are not a rational solution to Presidential frustration, the need to look tough or lack of other ideas. To invade would be an irresponsible use of the world's most formidable military force.
The Administration hopes for a U.N. vote this week. But it will take another month at least to recruit countries to join in an invasion and a subsequent peacekeeping force. Administration hawks should use the delay to throw off their war fever.
The Clinton Administration has yet to present compelling arguments that invading Haiti is in the best interests of the United States. Human rights are being massively and flagrantly abused. But over the long months when Washington looked the other way for fear of having to grant asylum to fleeing refugees, the terror was almost as bad. Similarly, drug allegations have been kicking around for years, but until very recently, Washington seemed eager to talk down their significance.
The surge of refugee departures has fallen off drastically in recent days, since Washington began denying boat people any chance of entry to the U.S., while providing safe havens elsewhere. At last, the Administration has found a politically sustainable refugee policy.
Meanwhile, public opinion remains skeptical or downright hostile to the use of U.S. military force in Haiti. The Constitution and the precedent established in the Persian Gulf war would require Congressional, not just U.N., approval for an invasion.
Horrible things are going on in Haiti. Democracy has been hijacked. People are being terrorized and a pitiful economy is being strangled. These are good reasons to put the strongest diplomatic and economic pressure on the junta and to provide sanctuary to fleeing refugees. They are not good reasons to send in the Marines.

HEADLINE: Hidden Arsenal: Gun Owners, Their Weapons and Their Reasons

 BODY:
Born of the frontier, America has always been an armed society. Scratch the surface and guns turn up in surprising places, for surprising reasons. As he traveled the New York area recently, a photographer for The New York Times asked people whether they were armed, and discovered a netherworld of weaponry. 
 Surveys show that close to half the country's households keep a firearm, and Federal officials estimate that 200 million guns or more may be in circulation. Even in places like New York, where the law severely restricts gun ownership, people keep guns for all kinds of purposes, from hunting to target shooting to collecting to self-defense to the furtherance of criminal deeds.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: CENTRAL BRONX;
4 Strip Malls Planned for Store-Scarce Neighborhoods

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
Four shopping strips are to be developed in the next year in the central Bronx under a city program intended to encourage the growth of retailing in inner-city neighborhoods. Two others are planned for the South Bronx.
Over the last two decades, three neighborhoods in these areas -- Tremont, Crotona Park and Mott Haven -- have seen a tremendous growth in low-cost housing units, but the population boom has not been matched by a growth in stores and other services. Fearful of crime and red-lining, retailers, especially national or regional chains, have stayed away. 
 "In those areas, you'll see thousands of people with virtually no commercial space around them," said Michael K. Pride, of the city Economic Development Corporation's Bronx bureau.
Mr. Pride said this was the first time the agency was testing its Neighborhood Retail Development Program in the Bronx. Several such retail strips have already been developed in Brooklyn. Under the program, the city sells public lands to developers at reduced interest rates and subsidizes construction costs. Although contracts have yet to be signed, the agency has chosen four local developers to build six retail sites, two in each neighborhood.
The Procida Organization, which has already built low-cost residential units in those areas, will build one strip in each. Christine Procida, a co-president of the company, said she hoped to open two of the three sites by the end of 1995.
In two sites -- on the corner of Freeman Street and Boulevard in Crotona Park East, and on Third Avenue between East 174 and 175th Streets in East Tremont -- the developer expects tenants like drug stores, video stores, dry cleaners and check-cashing centers. Clothing stores are likely to move into a third strip on East 149th Street and Brook Avenue in Mott Haven, she said.
These three sites, varying from 30,000 to 50,000 square feet, will be developed for about $10 million, Ms. Procida said.
"We like these three sites because they're in areas where our firm has built a lot of residential housing," she added. "We've been in this area. We know the marketplace. And we feel that it's an untapped market."
Independently of the city program, Procida is building a retail strip on East 180th Street and Crotona Avenue in East Tremont, which is to open next month. That center will include a Rite Aid Pharmacy as well as a dry cleaner, pet shop and Chinese food store, Ms. Procida said.
"Traditionally, in the inner city, we have local merchants that do well, but the main retailers haven't come to the inner city," she said. "They're starting to realize that there is a market here. They're not diving in, but they're getting their feet wet. Now, in the Bronx, people can't just go down the street and pay for affordable goods."
The Neighborhood Retail Development Program was initiated in 1992 under the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins. Speaking in the wake of the Los Angeles riots, the mayor emphasized the importance of building complete neighborhoods in New York -- with residential, as well as commercial, buildings. The city set aside $7.5 million in construction subsidies to spur the creation of businesses in areas with large populations but few services.
The communities in which the program was first tested were in Bushwick, along Broadway between Gates and Cornelia Streets; Brownsville, at Rockaway and Pitkin Avenues; and Coney Island, along Mermaid Avenue between West 29th and West 31st Streets. The city had built hundreds of low-, moderate- and middle-income housing units in these neighborhoods, but few businesses opened to meet the rising demand.
Often, banks have shied away from financing projects in poor neighborhoods. But Chase Manhattan and Chemical Banks agreed to make construction loans available to developers chosen by the Economic Development Corporation. NORIMITSU ONISHI

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: WILLETS POINT
Enough Yankees Already. The Mets Have Their Own Plans;
Industrial Park To Be Revamped Somewhere Else

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
Auto shops in buildings made of cinder blocks with plastic roofs perch alongside the dirt road. The sewers have not drained water in more than a decade, and the dirt road is almost always flooded, forcing drivers to crawl around huge puddles. Mountains of used tires have formed, overnight and illegally, on street corners.
And amid all this there is the chaos of an unregulated mini-economy. Equipment spills out of stores onto sidewalks and streets. Cars swerve to avoid collisions. A man shows two others how to use a circular saw in the middle of the street. 
 This is the Willets Point Industrial Park, a 13-block collection of small auto shops, food distributors and light manufacturers, just east of Shea Stadium. Bordered by 126th Street, Willets Point and Northern Boulevards, the industrial park is home to about 125 businesses that employ 3,000 people, according to the Willets Point Business Association.
But to many outsiders this industrial park -- as the businesses call themselves -- has long been an eyesore taking up space in a valuable real estate area. And although ground-breaking for the new domed Shea Stadium and an adjoining entertainment center is years away, the city says it is ready to begin taking steps toward relocating the Willets Point businesses.
"Our plan would look at total relocation," said Rudy Washington, commissioner of the city's Department of Business Services. "The massive size of the Mets' project would smother any existing businesses in the area." He said the timing and costs have yet to be determined, but the Mets have offered to defray some of the costs.
"Some people may be upset, but they should look at relocation as an opportunity," he said, since the businesses could move closer to demand centers. "We're not moving you out of the Taj Mahal."
Anne Fodera Rosengarten, an owner of the House of Fodera, a food distributorship, said she was worried the Willets Point businesses would have little say in their move.
"They've mentioned the Brooklyn Navy Yard, but I don't want to go to Brooklyn," she said. "What if I want to move to Nassau County or New Jersey? Will they pay for that? We're talking about a financially strapped city here."
This is not the first time that plans for development have threatened the Willets Point businesses.
In 1986, Donald J. Trump and others proposed building a domed stadium to win back the Jets, who left Shea Stadium for New Jersey in 1983. But neither the Jets nor any other football team could be lured to Flushing Bay.
Since that plan failed, new businesses, many of them Korean-owned, have opened despite the lack of paved roads and a deteriorated sewage system.
But the city has postponed spending $20 million on repairs. One frustrated business paved a side street on its own.
Daniel Feinstein is the owner of Feinstein Iron Works, which has been in Willets Point for 22 years and employs 20 people.
"I'm paying the same taxes here that I would in Long Island City on a paved street," he said. N.O.

Tough City, Gritty Streets, And Rock's Hidden Roots
 Did you realize that Elvis Presley recorded "Hound Dog" on 24th Street? Or that the tenement on Led Zeppelin's "Physical Graffiti" album cover is on St. Marks Place? 
 These are just a few of the facts that have been accumulated by Danny Fields, who used to manage rock acts, and Sal Cataldi, partners in a new venture called the Rock and Roll Tour of New York.
The bus tour, which began six weeks ago, starts and concludes at (where else?) the Hard Rock Cafe, at 221 West 57th Street.
Mr. Fields, a former manager of the Ramones, Iggy Pop and Lou Reed, who also worked as a publicity agent for the Doors, "has lots of inside stories to tell," said Mr. Cataldi.
"We go places like the original Peppermint Lounge, where a guy named Killer Joe Piro invented the twist," Mr. Cataldi said, "to Joni Mitchell's old apartment on West 16th Street where she wrote 'Chelsea Morning' -- the song that inspired Hillary and Bill -- to the last places that Kurt Cobain went to in his final trip to New York City."
Tickets for the two-hour tour are $25.
 
 
Now Lending in Queens: Household Finance
 As part of a nationwide expansion into urban areas, the Household Finance Corporation has opened a branch at 159-11 Jamaica Avenue in Jamaica, Queens.
The corporation, which offers home and consumer loans, was founded in 1878 and calls itself "the oldest consumer finance company" in the nation, according to George Shea, a company spokesman.
"Because of the growing economy in Jamaica there is a great demand in lending services," said Mr. Shea, noting the growth of the black middle class in Jamaica and other neighborhoods in southeast Queens.
 
 
A Temporary Closing To Reinvent Rumpelmayer's
 Rumpelmayer's, the very pink ice cream parlor that has been a sweet stomping ground for children since the 1930's, has closed temporarily, for what its management calls a "substantial renovation."
The ice-cream parlor, in the St. Moritz Hotel on Central Park South, closed July 4 and will reopen by Oct. 1 as an updated version of its old self.
"It's not going to be as pink," said Ralph Stephenson, managing director of the St. Moritz. "But it will have subtle pink tones."
When it reopens, Rumpelmayer's will have "three different modes of dining" -- a sidewalk cafe in front; a confectioner's shop with candy and lots of ice cream in the middle of the shop, and a quiet dining area in the back.

Trying to Turn Downtown Around

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
IN MORE than two decades of public service, Carl Weisbrod has held some of the most important and challenging economic policy jobs in New York City government. But while Mr. Weisbrod's newest job, as the first president of a new Business Improvement District for lower Manhattan, is outside of government, it may prove to be the most ambitious one yet.
The aim of the business improvement district is to help reverse the economic erosion of the city's downtown economic center, where the recession and technological and other changes in the financial industries have left many buildings with vast amounts of vacant office space. 
 Armed with a budget of $8.6 million from a self-assessed tax of downtown property owners, the new district is scheduled to start operating on Jan. 1. Awaiting formal approval from the City Council, it has already been cleared by the City Planning Commission. Other sections of the city, like Times Square and the Grand Central Terminal area, already have used the business improvement districts to help clean up the neighborhood and improve public safety.
In lower Manhattan, where the problems run even deeper, it is a sign of the critical role the new district is expected to play in the area's development that a person of Mr. Weisbrod's stature and experience has been recruited to head it.
Last week, Mr. Weisbrod sat in his temporary office at the New York City Partnership, across from Battery Park, for an interview. Here are some of his comments.
 Q. Why does downtown need a business improvement district?
 A. What makes a business improvement district so attractive is that the community itself, the business community and the taxpayers in a smaller geographic area, get to determine their own priorities for providing supplemental services to improve the quality of life. Moreover, the crucial thing about lower Manhattan is that it provides an enormous tax base for the city as a whole. That base needs to be preserved and enhanced. It's one of the economic engines that drives the city, and the engine has got to run pretty smoothly. So this is not a parochial issue.
 Q. What can a business improvement district can do about downtown's problems?
 A. Well, to start with, we will have to focus on the need for a greater diversity among the kinds of businesses that are down here. Financial services is still the core industry in lower Manhattan and will remain so. But the economic landscape is changing. Just take one example. We're aiming to locate a software and information technology center downtown, which should end up not only serving the financial industry but also helping to attract new types of business. Remember, the perimeter of lower Manhattan is strong, and that's where development is taking place. It's the heart of downtown that is struggling and really needs attention.
 Q. But what makes you think you can reverse the exodus from downtown?
 A. In order to make lower Manhattan more attractive, we're also going to need to generate more round-the-clock activity. There's a synergy between a residential population and commercial operations. The larger the residential population, the more the services that population needs, and the more those services will be able to support a broader, more diversified commercial population as well. We are going to have to look at breaking down the historic barrier zoning has erected between residential and commercial activity.
 Q. What else can you do to attract people downtown?
 A. Tourism is obviously another important area. This is the birthplace of the city and, in fact, technically it is the birthplace of the nation. Just look around those four corners of Wall and Broad Streets. It's where George Washington took the oath of office; it's where the anarchists tried to bomb out the House of Morgan. It's where John Peter Zenger was acquitted of criminal libel and established for the first time the legal principal that truth is an absolute defense. What we can do is market downtown's history more clearly, market it in different languages. I think New Yorkers and residents of the region have yet to discover the truly world-class attractions of lower Manhattan.
 Q. What are your biggest obstacles?
 A. There are transportation problems. The subway connections to lower Manhattan are great, but this should be . . . a place where people can transfer from subway to commuter rail, where people can come by ferry and also join up with other forms of transportation. We also have one of the most magnificent harbors and waterfronts in the world. Certainly the most magnificent urban waterfront. It's legendary, it's majestic, but it has to be opened up more physically so we can appreciate it. Ultimately, we should create a pedestrian esplanade running from Battery Park City, looping around to South Street and then up to the East River Park.
 Q. So, if you are successful, what would downtown look like a decade from now?
 A. I think it would have a much more diverse economy. We'd see a lot of foreign investment. It would be closer to a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week community with increased street life on the weekends and in the evenings. The waterfront would be more accessible. Many people might even find it possible to walk to work. Lower Manhattan would be seen as the hottest part of the city where people wanted to live and work.
 Q. That sounds like quite an ambitious dream.
 A. Well, we wouldn't get anywhere if we didn't aim high.

Just When You Thought the Worst Was Over

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
I KNEW I had it bad when the car turned onto a drive marked F.D.R. and the words "formal dining room" danced before my eyes. Maybe, I thought, I should have held out for an FDR, even though I think I did pretty well with my EIK w/Hrwd Flr, not to mention my Lo Mt and Gt Clsts.
They tell me that buying property ranks just below divorce and death in the stress sweepstakes. I believe it, especially in the funhouse mirror of New York real estate, where an agent once tried to convince me that a mini-refrigerator placed in a hallway detracted not a whit from the apartment's ambiance. 
 But with interest rates at a 30-year low and a recession-stricken market flooded with desperate sellers, I knew it was my time to buy. And so, feeling very grown-up and nervous and elated all at the same time, I became part of that 1994 first-quarter rise in condominium and co-op purchases recorded by the Real Estate Board of New York.
Now, there are plenty of books about how to negotiate mortgage rates, refinancing and the like. But I have yet to find a guide to help the first-time buyer make the necessary psychic adjustments after the deal is closed.
Fact, is, having survived brokers and closings and writing checks with many zeros, you are just getting to the good part.
From my present vantage point, at the beginning of the third quarter of 1994, I've come to believe that, as a first-time owner, life should be temporarily weird. You are obsessed with your new status, your new toy. You own a piece of the city, which is kind of like having a relationship with a manic-depressive with a lot of bad hair days.
As in any new venture, friends and relatives will weigh in with their opinions about things like knocking down walls, about which colors to paint the ones that stay up and about what to do about the floors.
I was also told that I should buy a dog. I was told that my place was big enough for children, even though I am single and live alone. I was told that ownership meant I would be stuck in New York forever, because the city was going down the tubes and people were fleeing in droves.
My advice about all this advice: Ignore it as soon as you put the house-warming gifts away.
This property-owner business does lead to a heightened desire to keep up with "the market." Now that I have absolutely no reasonable use for real-estate advertisements, I read them more avidly than ever, out of a perverse need to reassure myself that I got a sweet deal.
Like me, you will rejoice when you read in the newspaper that the entire area is slowly emerging from its five-year real-estate hibernation. Your heart will sink over phrases like "partial recovery." At parties, you will seek out the groups gossiping about purchase prices.
And you will start obsessing about facts of apartment life that you had learned to take for granted back in that simpler time when you were just a renter. The day will come when a neighbor casually says something like, "Yeah, the concert pianist with insomnia who lives under you is back from his European tour and he heads that committee determined to buy a new roof and increase the maintenance."
I've learned about the homeless man who was found living in my building, and about the time the mailroom door was stolen off its hinges. I discovered that the lights flicker. At my first shareholders' meeting, there was talk of mice, leaks and a slow super. I am afraid of scratches on my hardwood floors and disgusted by litter on the block. All of these things worry me. I'm starting to take them personally.
Still, it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience. Really. I moved into my Riverside Drive co-op apartment on a Friday back in April. I danced from room to room. I ran my fingers over the appliances and thought, "These are mine." I caressed my glass doorknobs, marveled at my mirrored closet doors and admired the classical lines of the (non-working) fireplace. I rose early to see the sunlight bursting through my eastern-exposure bedroom windows and stayed up to see the Hudson shimmering in the night.
Unlike all those unwanted advisers, friends in various stages of this property thing are like a support group. A lawyer friend and her husband hope to close soon on a huge apartment near Central Park. She admitted to me the other day that, like me, she still peruses the real estate classifieds to compare what they're getting with what they're selling.
"I'm living for my own bathroom," she said. "I love my husband to death, but I want my own bathroom."
Here's my advice:
Be nice to the neighbors, don't do anything drastic for a while, and go ahead and obsess. This is New York! Neurosis rules! Besides, you probably really did get a good deal.

HEADLINE: Co-ops Anxiously Await Bribery Details

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
MARTIN KARP is baffled. He doesn't know if his co-op was a victim in the wide-ranging scandal involving scores of apartment managers and superintendents, who allegedly received millions of dollars in kickbacks and bribes from vendors.
His 258-unit co-op, at 250 East 87th Street in Manhattan, has used the Charles H. Greenthal Company as a managing agent for the last two years; the firm has employed two agents who have been indicted; neither, though, worked for his building. 
 His building's previous manager was Brown Harris Stevens, an old white-glove firm that has had 17 of its past and present managing agents charged in the scandal; two worked for Mr. Karp's building.
"We aren't sure what to do," said Mr. Karp, who is a retired management consultant and the vice president of his co-op board. "The indictments are sealed, and we don't know the basis for the indictments. Maybe they have nothing to do with our building."
Such uncertainty has been pandemic among co-op and condominium boards in New York ever since last month when the Manhattan District Attorney's office, after a three-year-investigation, announced that 86 managing companies and management agents, as well as the president of one co-op board, had been indicted or pleaded guilty to charges of extorting payoffs from contractors and suppliers in exchange for steering business their way.
"Everyone is in such limbo," said Mary Ann Rothman, the executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives, a trade organization for 1,800 member co-ops and condominiums in the New York area. "It's just complete panic time. Everyone is waiting for the other shoe to fall."
Because the investigation is ongoing -- more charges and pleas are expected -- and the charges alleged thus far are sketchy, apartment owners are in the dark concerning what buildings and vendors are involved, how the payoffs worked and how much money has been lost by paying bills from plumbers, painters and other contractors that, according to the District Attorney's office, were inflated, often by 10 percent, to cover the costs of paying off managing agents and supervisors.
The uncertainty is especially troubling to co-op boards because they aren't sure whether they are currently employing a corrupt managing agent or vendor and if they should sever relationships. They also worry that if they switch agents or vendors, there is no guarantee that the new ones won't be charged in the future.
"The District Attorney's office invited us to the dance, but it's making us sit on the sidelines like wallflowers," said Errol Brett, a Manhattan lawyer who represents 120 co-op and condominium boards. "The D.A. knows who the co-conspirators are, and it is incumbent upon him to, without jeopardizing their investigation, let us know who the other players, the contractors are, so the buildings can re-evaluate their contracts and not enter into any new contracts with those vendors who are under investigation."
The District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, has said it might be months before apartment owners learn if and how they were bilked, and whether they can collect from a restitution fund. Brown Harris Stevens has already contributed $1 million to the fund, which may grow to as much $5 million.
Daniel J. Castleman, the District Attorney's director of investigations, said that by the end of September, co-op boards should have a list of buildings involved with the charges. He also predicted that by Thanksgiving the identity would be known of many, if not all, of those who have pleaded guilty, as well as some of the vendors. "Eventually, all of the identities of the vendors will be known, but it is an ongoing process that will take time," he said.
Mr. Castleman explained that it was difficult to document the fraud in particular buildings because agents often worked in several buildings. "It is not as simple as releasing a list," he said. "Such a list does not yet exist. We didn't approach the investigation building-by-building, but agent-by-agent and contractor-by-contractor. So, we have to go back and review our databases, which are substantial, to pull out any reference to particular buildings."
He said the indictments had either been sealed or contained little information since investigators didn't want to show their hands until required to. "In response to defense motions, we will have to put out more specific information about each charge," he said.
Mr. Castleman added that the names of vendors who were cooperating with investigators were being kept secret because some felt they had reason to fear for their economic livelihood and, possibly, their lives.
He also said that there was little the District Attorney's office could do to assuage the anger felt among some apartment owners that the vendors are escaping prosecution.
"There is a range of conduct," he said. "There are some vendors who were actively bribing people. There are others who were extorted. You have to take a look at the particular facts with individual vendors."
He said that some vendors might be charged in the future, but that, for the most part, they had entered into agreements to cooperate, meaning that they have immunity from prosecution for any crimes to which they confess. They can be charged, however, for illegal activities that investigators learn about on their own or through others.
"We chose to focus on agents, because it is the agents who owe a fiduciary responsibility to their boards," Mr. Castleman said. "While we have no illusion that some vendors are not angels, we have chosen to attack the problem where we believe it should be attacked."
"Does that mean that some vendors are going to escape prosecution?" he asked. "Yes -- but that's the reality in this type of investigation."
ANOTHER law enforcement official, who refused to speak unless promised anonymity, noted that the investigation could continue for two or three more years with spin-offs into other related fields, like commercial real estate, rental housing, public housing, institutional real estate.
"Essentially," the official added, "kickbacks in every facet of the real estate industry in New York."
In the meantime, board presidents, board members and apartment owners all wait and wonder. Robert S. Deutsch, for example, is a lawyer and the president of a co-op at 3777 Independence Avenue in Riverdale in the Bronx. His building was managed by Darwood Management and one of the indicted agents, but it is now managed by Regal Management; the co-op switched managing agents in 1992.
"There was unhappiness over the way the building was being managed," Mr. Deutsch said. "There was concern that they were not purchasing materials at the cheapest available price."
Mr. Deutsch said that he was not concerned that Regal would be implicated in the District Attorney's probe. His board, is not sure, however, whether they should take action against Darwood Management, though it seems likely. "We have taken the precaution of advising the D.A. of the facts and the concern we have, but we are truly in limbo as to how to proceed," he said. "We are awaiting the outcome of the investigation, and waiting to see whether we are put on a list for restitution."
Such patience, however, may not satisfy shareholders in many co-ops, and boards may find themselves under increasing pressure to seek restitution. Indeed, if a board doesn't act expeditiously, it might become the target of angry shareholders, who could hold a board liable for lack of oversight or for failing to act in a timely or prudent manner in recovering damages. Some shareholders -- citing a former co-op board president who has pleaded guilty to felony fraud and agreed to return $100,000 -- may even be suspicious of collusion by some boards.
Dennis Greenstein, a Manhattan lawyer whose firm represents 155 boards, noted that some boards had received letters from shareholders intimating that their board knew about a managing agent receiving kickbacks. "What happens is that there are people who don't understand the process, and there are discontents in every building," he said. "But the number of people is very very limited, and their claims are very vague. There are also absolutely no claims that I am aware of that have any substance."
He added that most board members had directors' and officers' liability insurance to protect them from such claims. "As long as there is no bad faith, dishonesty or self-dealing, they are protected," he said.
Even so, Mr. Greenstein recommended that boards inform shareholders promptly and often about any steps being taken in light of the District Attorney's charges.
He does not recommend initiating legal action at this time. Instead, the board should first have its accountant or treasurer audit the building's expenses since 1988; a six-year statute of limitations for breach of contract and fraud claims exists in New York. In particular, auditors should peruse emergency repair bills, higher than normal fuel costs in the winter and any unusual costs for construction projects that were higher than the original bids.
MR. GREENSTEIN noted, though, that auditors might find it very difficult, if not impossible, to uncover the kinds of fraud and kickbacks that have been alleged by the District Attorney. "What we are advising buildings to do if they did have large capital improvements, like $50,000 or $100,000 or more, they should look at the project and have it reviewed to see if there is anything that is inflated," he said. "The account should also look at other buildings and compare expenses."
He further cautioned that boards should not go overboard on their audits. "We are in the incipient stages of this, and, right now, I don't recommend spending thousands of dollars on auditing fees before a board has more information," he said.
Mr. Brett, the Manhattan lawyer, further suggested that boards develop a list of suppliers and contractors that were hired by their building since 1988 and how much each were paid. The list will be of assistance when the names of the vendors who allegedly bribed managing agents is released. "We also want to see if there is any pattern developing with one managing agent using one developer over a period of time," he said.
He also recommended that boards put in a clause in their purchasing contracts requiring vendors to state whether they are under investigation by the District Attorney. "Just in case they are under investigation, if they say they aren't that would be breach of contract, and the board would be able to terminate it," he said.
Thus far, few boards have terminated their managing agents because of the charges. Many managing-agent concerns that have not been implicated, however, have reported a surge of boards inquiring about their services. For example, Oskar Brecher, the managing director of American Landmark Management Corporation in Manhattan, manages 86 co-op and condominium buildings with 8,000 units in the five boroughs.
"We have been interviewed to a pretty significant extent," he said. "We have in the neighborhood of 20 buildings that have called since the scandal hit, and we are in the final stages of discussions with five buildings."
There has been a class action suit filed against Brown Harris Stevens on behalf of the 30-unit co-op at 103 East 84th Street on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. The suit, however, was filed largely to prevent the company, which has the financial wherewithal and legal expertise, to reach a speedy but small settlement with a "friendly" co-op, according to Stuart Saft, chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives and a partner in the Manhattan law firm that filed the suit. Such a settlement would prevent other co-op's from initiating a suit that could result in a larger settlement or judgment.
Instead of a lawsuit, Arthur Weinstein, a lawyer and vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives, advised that, even though damages could not be documented at this time, boards should file an insurance claim, particularly since it was not clear when insurers would deem the 120-day statute of limitations for claims has expired.
How to file a claim where there are no documented damages yet? Mr. Weinstein recommended a letter to the insurance company that issued the policy with an employee dishonesty clause. "This may stop the statute of limitations and put them formerly on notice of any claims that may exist," he said.
HE said boards could put their insurance carriers on notice of a potential for claims stemming from the District Attorney's investigation. Boards should also ask their insurers for guidance about whether they should dismiss a manager that has been indicted but not found guilty. (Provisions exist in the employee dishonesty clause that requires boards to take action against an employees who commit theft.)
Meanwhile, as boards struggle for information, management companies implicated in the scandal are contemplating or have already hired internal auditors to scrutinize contracts, bills and budgets for unusually high or low costs for services and supplies.
But self-policing, though, doesn't satisfy many people outside the industry. Mark Cherkasky, a former investigator with the District Attorney who worked in the building managers' case and is now a managing director at Kroll Monitoring Services in Manhattan, a new division of Kroll Associates, an international investigative security and consulting company, suggests hiring a firm like his that not only audits managers, but may also try to bribe them -- to test their honesty.
Some people in the industry, however, believe self-policing is akin to the proverbial fox guarding the hen house. For example, Jerome Belson, president of the Associated Builders and Owners of Greater New York, believes that building managers should be licensed by the state. "It is very unusual when an association is asking for more supervision rather than less," he said. "But we feel it is important to point out the fiduciary responsibility of building managers. and increase their standing as professionals."
"We have been advocating licensing for the past several years," he added. "Building managers are every bit as important as taxicab drivers or a manicurist."
Licensing, however, is often pooh-poohed, even by those, like Mr. Saft, who represent victimized co-op boards. "The problem here isn't competence but honesty," he said. "And you can't license honesty."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 7, 1994, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article on July 24 about the reaction of co-op boards to bribery charges against managing agents misattributed a quotation. It was Marc J. Luxemburg, not Stuart Saft, who said that it was impossible to license honesty.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Examining the Broad Brush Cuomo Uses to Paint Rival

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 23

 BODY:
Racing to define George E. Pataki before the obscure Republican Senator can define himself, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's re-election campaign is seeking to depict Mr. Pataki -- and the Republican Party in general -- as devoid of principle and willing to shift with the political breeze.
Central to that strategy is Mr. Cuomo's suggestion that his challenger has been inconsistent on the crucial issues of abortion, taxes and gun control. But as is often the case in campaigns, the full truth about Mr. Pataki is not as simple as Mr. Cuomo's characterization of him. 
 In a July 12 television interview, the Democratic Governor said: "He used to be supported by Right to Life and now he's pro-choice. He was a mayor who raised taxes 30 percent and now he's against taxes. He used to say he was for a ban on assault weapons, but then he voted not to ban assault weapons." Those assertions are a melange of truth, half-truth and misrepresentation, an examination of Mr. Pataki's record shows.
Although the 49-year-old Mr. Pataki spent three years as Mayor of Peekskill in Westchester County and eight years in the Assembly before joining the Senate in 1992, his record began to receive serious scrutiny only after he was designated the Republican Party's gubernatorial candidate at its state convention in May.
Mr. Pataki still must survive a primary challenge from Richard M. Rosenbaum before taking on Mr. Cuomo. But in a year when polls indicate that the voters may be willing to vote for any credible alternative, the Governor clearly considers Mr. Pataki his main threat.
In an interview this week about his record, Mr. Pataki acknowledged -- in greater detail than previously in the campaign -- that he had not always believed in the right to an abortion, as he says he now does. He said that the birth of his first child, Emily, who is 15, had a profound impact on his views.
On assault weapons, Mr. Pataki has offered a variety of explanations, some of them at odds with the others and with reality, for his April 25 vote against a Democratic amendment that would have banned many semiautomatic firearms in most circumstances. After first saying no vote had been taken, he later said he had voted to sustain a ruling that the amendment was not germane to the bill being debated. Neither was true. Now he dismisses the vote as procedural, but says he would have voted against the amendment anyway because he supports a stricter ban.
Mr. Pataki's record on taxes, however, has been significantly distorted by Mr. Cuomo and his aides. They have charged that real property taxes rose 30 percent during the three years that Mr. Pataki was mayor of Peekskill. But more than two-thirds of that increase came in the budget for Mr. Pataki's first year, which had been enacted by his Democratic predecessor.
Mr. Pataki called the Governor's charges about his record "utter absurdity," and said they were "sort of a sad commentary."
But he is likely to hear them often between now and November, because the Governor's advisers fear that the most dangerous opponent may be a candidate nobody knows.
 
Abortion Rights
 Throughout the campaign, Mr. Pataki has generated angry opposition from abortion rights advocates for referring to himself as an "unequivocal supporter" of a woman's right to choose. They argue that he has voted repeatedly against Medicaid financing of abortions for poor women and favors requiring the notification of parents before most girls under 16 can have abortions.
But Mr. Pataki, a Roman Catholic who said he has struggled intellectually, emotionally and religiously with the issue, also makes abortion rights groups nervous because of what he refers to as "an evolution" in his thinking. He said this week that he was "supporting pro-choice candidates against pro-life candidates" in the late 1970's, when he served as counsel to Senator Bernard G. Gordon, who supported abortion rights.
Then his daughter was born. "There's no question that has an impact on how you think, not just about abortion but about life," he said.
Mr. Pataki said he did not recall whether he favored making abortion illegal at that point. "Whether I would have called myself pro-life, certainly in the past there was a time when I would not have said that unequivocably it is the woman's decision regardless of what happens," he said.
Gustave S. Allmacher, the Conservative Party chairman of Cortlandt, a town near Mr. Pataki's home, said Mr. Pataki "was viewed at the time as being pro-life." So did Geraldine P. Oftedahl, chairwoman of the New York State Right to Life Committee, which endorsed Mr. Pataki in 1988.
When asked when he began referring to himself as "pro-choice," Mr. Pataki said, "It's been years, going back to before the '90 Republican convention." Mr. Pataki served that year as chairman of the platform committee, and drafted a plank that expressed the state party's "commitment to the right of privacy and reproductive rights."
Mr. Allmacher and Ms. Oftedahl said they did not recall Mr. Pataki's advertising himself as an abortion-rights supporter until 1990, when Mr. Pataki said he thought seriously about running for Governor.
Mr. Pataki has voted against annual bills to authorize Medicaid financing of abortions. But he currently says he will support Medicaid financing if the state requires health care providers to counsel women about birth control and abstinence when they receive abortions.
 
Assault Weapons
 Senator Richard A. Dollinger had tried several times during the previous four months to offer an amendment restricting possession of assault weapons to another gun licensing bill, a measure that had been proposed by Mr. Cuomo and had already passed the Assembly. Each time it was dismissed cursorily as non-germane by the presiding officer, a parliamentary procedure used by the Republican majority to kill Democratic proposals without a roll-call vote.
On April 25, however, the amendment was ruled germane and was debated at some length. And Mr. Pataki voted against it, along with every other Republican.
Mr. Pataki, who says he supports the concept of banning assault weapons, has been asked often to explain that vote. Some Democrats have suggested that his vote reflected the politics of the moment, when Mr. Pataki was battling Herbert London for the support of the Conservative Party, which abhors gun control.
When Gabe Pressman charged in an interview on WNBC-TV in late May that Mr. Pataki had voted against the bill, he responded, "No, we have not had a vote on assault weapons."
Then in a July 9 interview on WPIX, Mr. Pataki called the bill "an attempt to amend a bill that was on the floor that was ruled non-germane and I voted to sustain the ruling of the chair." He said it was "political gimmickry to try to create a vote."
In an interview this week, Mr. Pataki, who has made much of his independence from his Republican colleagues in voting against the state budget, described the measure as typical of the minority amendments "that as a routine matter are opposed by all Republicans."
But, he said, he probably would have voted against the bill anyway, because it would allow some gun collectors and competitive shooters to be licensed to own assault weapons. "The simplest thing, I believe, is you draw up a list of those guns that are assault weapons that pose an undue risk to the safety of the state and you ban them," he said.
 
Tax Rise in Peekskill
 Mr. Pataki's economic program centers on a large package of cuts in both income and business taxes, many of which he has yet to detail. But property taxes increased while he was Mayor of Peekskill from 1982 to 1984. They did not, however, increase by any amount near the 30 percent claimed by Mr. Cuomo.
Mr. Cuomo's calculation is based on a 21 percent increase in 1982, a 6.4 percent increase in 1983 and a 2 percent increase in 1984. But the 21 percent increase was proposed by the city manager and approved by the Common Council -- the mayor is one of seven members -- in late 1981, before Mr. Pataki took office.
Indeed, the third budget that Mr. Pataki controlled included no tax increase, according to Peekskill officials. That was at least partly because the city, which had a $12 million budget in 1985, began to receive large payments from Westchester County to compensate for the city's acceptance of the county's garbage incinerator. It received $1.6 million from the county in 1985, up from $200,000 in the three previous years.
Cuomo aides have suggested that Mr. Pataki should be held responsible for the 21 percent increase in 1982 because he did nothing to change it after taking office on Jan. 1. After all, they have said, Mr. Pataki and the new Republican majority on the Council changed spending priorities in the budget after taking office. And they pointed out that Mr. Pataki characterized the budget as "realistic and responsible," according to Common Council minutes.
But Peekskill's deputy corporation counsel, Stephen J. Mignano, said there is no authority in state law or in the city's charter for changing tax rates once they are set. The charter requires the tax rate to be set by Dec. 1 of the previous year.
Cynthia M. Munk, a spokeswoman for the State Comptroller, said her office's lawyers agreed with that general proposition as a matter of state law, although they had not studied Peekskill's charter.
Joel R. Benenson, the Cuomo campaign's spokesman, said his campaign's lawyers also had been unable to find such a statute. But he said the campaign would stand by its use of the 30 percent figure anyway.
"It is an accurate statement," he said. "While he was Mayor of Peekskill, taxes went up 30 percent. He reopened that budget and he didn't cut spending to give the tax money back the next year."
Said Mr. Pataki: "They're trying to backtrack after making a major distortion."

Love Among the Risk Takers and Risk Averse

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

 BODY:
IT seems they stood and talked like this before. She remembers, instantly, where (the Isle of Capri overlooking the bay of Naples) and when (22 years ago). It isn't long before he remembers, too. Now on a veranda with a drop-dead view of Boston Harbor, surrounded by stars as if in possession of them. And yes, they are thinking of asking for the moon.
In "Later Life" A. R. Gurney establishes his most romantic setting yet. The scenic designer for the production at Westport Country Playhouse, Richard Ellis, has lived up to his part of the celestial bargain. 
 And Austin (Frank Converse), who is divorced, and Ruth (Maureen Anderman), who is separated, are not only available -- "relatively free and clear" -- but connecting. That, Ruth observes, is "something very rare in this world that is falling apart." Who among the audience isn't rooting for the final clinch?
In the best of all possible fantasy worlds, Mr. Gurney would oblige. But it is his sense of missed second chances that has made him write a ruefully truthful play rather than a satisfyingly dreamy one.
Austin and Ruth had their brief encounter after college and before marriage. Austin, then a Navy man, is still at sea. On the surface, he is shipshape. This is, remember, a Gurney play.
"A prince of a man" in the Groton School yearbook, he came from one of Boston's finest families, married the boss's daughter (from one of Boston's finest families), became a banker -- and remained a perfect gentleman.
But inside Austin is raging. All the top-drawer values that defined his breed are dying out. This is, remember, a Gurney play, a darker and deeper one than ever. Austin, overcome by a sense of dread, cannot move. Even Austin's psychiatrist misunderstands him.
In a coup of casting, concept and good economic sense, the inimitable Carole Shelley of the original Off Broadway cast and John C. Vennema, an Off Broadway replacement, play motley guests at the cocktail party inside. Under David Saint's graceful direction, they come onto the veranda to eavesdrop on Austin and Ruth. Mr. Vennema is a recovering smoker, a computer junkie and a crotchety elderly man asking to go to his retirement home in Florida.
Ms. Shelley is his wife who won't go. They are an overly gregarious couple, just moved to Boston, determined to show off their multicultural tolerances. Ms. Shelley also performs the roles of a hilarious series of snooty besotted and bewildered women.
As the overpriviledged Austin with a "Puritan sense of damnation," Mr. Converse, all pent up with pursed lips and furrowed brow, is made to look like a cloning of Charles Kimbrough, the play's original star. This is bothersome for Mr. Converse is giving a deeply felt attractive performance. Ruth, whose life has been a catalogue of disasters, in contrast to Austin's success, stability and sheer luck, is nevertheless a spirited risk taker, even if it means she is bent on destructiveness. Married four times to three men, she is on the run from an abusive ne'er-do-well.
Ms. Anderman, recreating her original role, wears the camouflage of charm and elegance perfectly. Her passion for life surfaces, but so what?
Ruth keeps on dancing. Austin goes on standing there. If his psychiatrist cannot understand why, who can?
"Later Life" by A. R. Gurney at Westport Country Playhouse, 25 Powers Court, off Route 1. 227-4177. Performances through Saturday.

HEADLINE: A $326 Million Private Toll Road to Spur Growth

BYLINE: By JAMES R. HARDCASTLE 

DATELINE: LEESBURG, VA.

 BODY:
THE first private toll road to be built in Virginia in over 130 years is on budget and ahead of schedule, much to the delight of Northern Virginia land owners who expect the road to bring growth through an empty portion of Loudoun County.
The $326 million toll road is called the Dulles Greenway, a 14-mile highway from Leesburg, about 35 miles northwest of the Washington Monument, to Dulles International Airport, where it links with the existing state-owned Dulles Toll Road. Leesburg is the county seat of Loudoun County, whose population stood at 57,400 in the 1980 census, shot up to 86,100 in 1990 and continued its climb to an estimated 102,100 in April. 
 The Dulles Greenway and the five interchanges that will be built along its course will open up some 10,000 acres to development south of what has been a major area of residential growth in the Washington metropolitan area. Half this acreage is already zoned for commercial or residential development and is accessible to existing sewer and water treatment operations.
The investors in the toll road are led by the local Bryant family, which is betting $68 million that it can preserve its scenic open space by channeling the growth the road will bring and achieve a return on its money at the same time.
Cheering the investors on are land owners along the road who have contributed millions of dollars in land to make the deal work. Indeed, in one case, a group of landowners paid $4 million to purchase key parcels of land needed for the Greenway to insure that the road would run close their property, which they hope to develop.
How long it will be before the road makes a profit after it opens in early 1996 is anyone's guess. But in any case, it will put Leesburg a lot closer to the employment centers and in time attract new businesses out to the new Greenway corridor, said John Stokely, the developer of Ashburn Farm, one of the large planned residential communities in eastern Loudoun.
"Once it opens there will be a jump in land sales and residential absorption," he predicted.
Charles E. Williams, a retired major general in the Army Corps of Engineers, and former head of the New York City School Construction Authority, who serves as chief operating officer of the project, said that nine months into the 30-month construction schedule, 46 percent of the work on the road had been completed, suggesting that the opening might occur before the scheduled date.
The two most difficult hurdles the road's sponsors had to clear were financing the venture, which is the major privately bankrolled toll road to be proposed in the United States during modern times, and getting the needed right of way and easements from 26 land owners without the power of eminent domain. The road was first proposed in 1986.
"The marvel of it is that it is going to be happening at all after all the fits and starts it has been through," said John T. Hazel Jr., a Northern Virginia lawyer and real estate developer whose firm represented the venture in the early days of the project.
DEVELOPING the Greenway is the Toll Road Investors Partnership II. One general partner is the Shenandoah Greenway Corporation, an investment firm owned by Magalen Ohrstrom Bryant of Middleburg, Va., and her children. The other is Autostrade International, the operator of more than 2,800 kilometers of toll roads in Italy. Brown & Root Inc., a construction subsidiary of the Halliburton Company, has a $145 million fixed-fee contract to build the road and is a limited partner.
The road project will allow drivers willing to pay a $1.75 toll on the Greenway and an additional 85 cents on the state-owned Dulles Toll Road to drive to Washington or its closer-in suburbs without stopping for a traffic light or toll booth. Toll booths at the Greenway and the state-operated Dulles toll road will be compatible, equipped with automatic vehicle identification systems that will allow drivers to pass through tolls at speeds up to 45 miles an hour. Leesburg commuters unwilling to pay the toll will be required to stop at 23 lights as they drive along jammed highways to Washington.
To Mrs. Bryant and Michael Crane, her son by a previous marriage and the chief executive of the toll road partnership, the Greenway is a natural. Their family has been active in preserving open space in the western Loudoun and neighboring Fauquier County hunt country since Mrs. Bryant's father, George L. Ohrstrom, bought an estate near Middleburg in the 40's to pursue his love of fox hunting.
The family is still among the largest shareholders in the Dover Corporation, a New York-baased manufacturing company founded by Mr. Ohrstrom in the 1930's. During the 1970's and 1980's, the family became actively involved in obtaining scenic easements in the area -- covenants that assure the preservation of open land.
With the Greenway, "we're trying to preserve as much of the open space as possible by encouraging development to go where it's always been planned," Mr. Crane said.
Mrs. Bryant and her family put $22 million in equity into the toll road partnership. An additional $46 million of her family's capital is tied up in lines of credit that serve as guarantees against project risk.
The Greenway's investors decided that for political and regulatory reasons they would avoid becoming involved in real estate development in the Greenway corridor. They will seek return of capital and profits through tolls set by regulators at the State Corporation Commission.
The project will operate at a deficit in its early years, said Timothy Sutherland, president of C. C. Pace Resources Inc. of Fairfax, the project's investment banker. State reglators will allow toll road investors to receive a return on equity of up to 30 percent in the early days of the project.
ONCE toll revenues exceed debt service costs by 15 percent, the allowable return begins a five-step decline to 14 percent and that return remains in effect until the road reverts to the state at the end of 42.5 years. The state will allow investors to recover allowable earnings not achieved in the early days of the project out of revenues in the later years of the project.
Currently, Routes 7 and 50 are the only arterial roads linking Loudoun County to the metropolitan area's center. Almost all of the development in the county is now taking place along Route 7, which is already operating well in excess of capacity. There is essentially no development along the Route 50 corridor between Dulles Airport and Middleburg in southern Loudoun County.
One of Northern Virginia's premier developers, the Mobil Land Development Company, a Mobil subsidiary that is the developer of Reston, Va., and 13 other planned communities, announced in March that it had entered into a 50-50 partnership with a Northern Virginia builder-developer, the Van Metre Organization to build a 1,500-acre community that will be the first to use the Dulles Greenway as its principal gateway. The Broadlands project is zoned for 3,883 dwelling units, 3.6 million square feet of office space and 475,000 square feet of retail space.
James C. Cleveland, the president of Mobil Land, said the fast pace of construction of the Greenway after its groundbreaking last Sept. 29 clinched the deal. Because Van Metre was willing to donate right of way along a mile and a half of the Greenway, it was in a strong position to negotiate when the road was designed. As a result, the project will be served by three of the Dulles Greenway interchanges.

 EVEN contemporaries found it difficult to explain why so many ordinary colonists took up arms against George III. The odds in such a contest were terrible. But logic of this sort failed to discourage the Americans -- at least initially -- and in large numbers they united with strangers living in other parts of the continent to create a new nation.
Studies of Revolutionary America usually assume an urban point of view, focusing on violent protests in Boston, New York and Philadelphia. Moreover, popular narratives of rebellion often conclude with colonists taking a stand against British troops at Lexington and Concord. The long war and the subsequent challenge of rebuilding an exhausted nation seldom figure in our understanding of the birth of the Republic.
"The Price of Nationhood" takes a different perspective. In her study, Jean B. Lee, a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, reconstructs the experiences of the people who lived in rural Charles County, Md. The county's extensive southern boundary ran along the Potomac River, and most of its inhabitants, black slaves as well as white freemen, cultivated tobacco. However isolated the members of this agrarian community may have been, they joined other Americans in toppling royal authority. Their decisions at critical moments throughout this period deserve close attention, for as Ms. Lee reminds us, "without the support of rural communities, the Revolution could not have succeeded."
Ms. Lee forces us to rethink the traditional chronology of the Revolution. Her story of Charles County begins with a complaisant colonial society, but instead of stopping with the Declaration of Independence, she follows this community as it mobilized for war, adjusted to the opportunities and disappointments of a postwar economy, ratified a new Federal Government and, at the end of the century, struggled to keep pace with other regions in a rapidly expanding democracy.
The opening section of "The Price of Nationhood" recaptures the subtle textures of a lost colonial world. Before independence, the planters of Charles County produced splendid tobacco. Each year merchants flocked to the small port towns of the Potomac, exchanging British manufactured goods for the valuable crop. At midcentury, Charles County was a distant outpost of the old empire. Its imaginative horizons, which extended to London and Glasgow, did not yet include much of the rest of colonial America.
Although powerful gentry families dominated this rural society, special privilege was not in itself a source of resentment among white colonists. They accepted a hierarchical order in which the wealthiest gentlemen of Charles County presumed to speak for the entire community. Local government ran smoothly; the planters appeared prosperous. Indeed, one English visitor concluded that the people of Charles County seemed "to live very well, and [to be] exceedingly happy."
However happy the colonists of Charles County may have been, they soon succumbed to the contagion of rebellion. Parliament's insistence after 1765 on taxing Americans without representation provoked the rural planters. But Britain's ill-conceived policies were not in themselves sufficient to transform loyal subjects into revolutionaries, Ms. Lee maintains. Imperial authority in Charles County collapsed because external debates about rights and liberties gave powerful new meanings to local controversies. Political disputes that might once have been easily contained suddenly acquired explosive potential as ordinary white people in Charles County interpreted issues dividing their community within the framework of a radical ideology not of their own making. Ms. Lee effectively links the two levels of experience, showing how moderate planters staked out ever more extreme positions until by 1775 everyone seemed to have become, in the words of one frightened loyalist, "liberty mad."
In Charles County, the political madness never got out of hand. Throughout a long, difficult war, the local gentry remained firmly in control. No one advocated a radical new social order. Perhaps because they were so fearful of sparking unrest among the slaves, the poorest whites never gave serious thought to storming the great houses of the old colonial elite. Members of the leading families stepped forward in the crisis, recruiting soldiers for the Continental Army, organizing local defenses and gathering food and supplies for the American troops. William Smallwood, a wealthy planter who had frequently been elected to Maryland's colonial assembly, served with distinction as a general in the army. To be sure, the ordinary people of Charles County sometimes dragged their feet, but at war's end in 1783 the entire community could justly celebrate its role in defeating the British.
The postwar period revealed the full social implications of revolution. Charles County was a very different community from the one that had welcomed independence. The experiences of war itself -- perhaps even more than exposure to radical new republican ideas -- eroded the old hierarchical structure. The elite maintained dominance, but it found that it had to be more responsive to the needs of ordinary planters. And they in turn voiced their economic demands more aggressively. Although the African-Americans did not substantially improve their lot -- and Ms. Lee sedulously retrieves the stories of obscure slaves -- white men and women redefined "the complex gradations of freedom characteristic of the colonial social order." Indentured servitude for poor whites virtually disappeared in Charles County. As Ms. Lee explains, "Men in the aggregate enjoyed greater political power; women, higher status; and everyone, religious liberty."
The narrative of revolution in Charles County concludes on a bittersweet note. Nationhood did not restore prosperity. The tobacco market collapsed, and proud gentry families found they could no longer pay their debts. During the 1790's white people began leaving Charles County, many migrating to the fertile lands to the west. They left behind a struggling, uncertain community whose population was dramatically poorer and blacker than it had been in the colonial period. "Gone were the intensity of the nation's formative years, the expansive commercialism and the self-assured gentry leadership," Ms. Lee writes. "Drained of many of its people and much of its economic vitality, the county slipped quietly into the 19th century."
The decline of Charles County probably would have occurred even without revolution. Still, one wonders whether the local patriots of 1776 would have supported independence so enthusiastically had they comprehended the full price of nationhood.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE CAMPAIGN;
Health Care Bus: Lots of Miles, Not so Much Talk

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY, July 24

 BODY:
From Oregon through Idaho and on to Utah, passengers on a cross-country bus trip in support of health care change have moved with a cheerful mien across the Western landscape, sharing personal stories and anxious accounts of the need for Congress to overhaul the American health insurance system.
But so far, they have spoken mostly to themselves. 
 The three buses that make up the first caravan on what will become a five-route health care crusade financed by supporters of President Clinton's health plan have moved from town to town making barely a ripple in the health care debate. In contrast to the bus journeys that Bill Clinton made during his campaign for the Presidency in 1992, there are no cheering crowds or passionate exchanges. Scattered protests have mostly been avoided, and long stretches of the road pass with no people in sight at all.
"We can't be 'reform riders' if we don't talk to people," said Christa Jaeger, a temporarily exasperated member of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. The union is one of three organizations behind a $2 million tour that will culminate in Washington the first week in August with rallies and the delivery of what the organizers hope will be thousands of letters urging Congress to pass a broad health care bill.
 
Avoiding Confrontation
 Though trip organizers vow that big rallies and intimate exchanges are coming, so far they have been few and far between. Instead, since the buses were sent off by Hillary Rodham Clinton in Portland, Ore., the traveling band has chosen to keep a low profile and avoid confrontation as it tries to win positive press coverage on a difficult issue.
In Boise, Idaho, last night, a handful of protesters so spooked the tour's organizers that they chose to skip their own rally and instead diverted the buses to a church not yet ready to serve them dinner. Local reporters covering the event were not allowed into the church, so as the "reform riders" stood to tell one another, and a tiny audience, stories of health care woe, it raised a modern variation on the classic philosophical question: "If a tree falls in the forest but no one hears it -- did it fall?"
This morning, as the buses headed to Salt Lake City for a reception, the riders agreed to face the protesters head-on -- and soon were given the opportunity. At a noon stop here, the buses were met by a small band of protesters bearing signs opposing "socialized health care" and declaring that the Idaho system works quite well. The mild-mannered debates that sprang up marked one of the first times the bus passengers had a chance to get their message out.
On Friday, as the buses snaked through the mountains of central Oregon, mechanical difficulties and logistical problems left the caravan running hours behind schedule. When the group arrived for a rally in Pendleton, a 300-seat auditorium lay silent and empty.
 
Disquieting Stories
 Later, at the Umatilla Indian reservation in La Grande, Indian tribal leaders provided a gracious feast but few listeners. And tribal officials complained that Federal promises of health care for all Indians had long since fallen behind the tribe's needs.
Roberta Wilson, the chairwoman of a tribal health and welfare commission, rattled off a catalogue of ills, noting that American Indians had the lowest birthrate, the shortest life span, and the highest suicide, alcoholism and unemployment rates in the nation.
The bus riders themselves are full of disquieting stories, too. At the same stop in Oregon, Elizabeth and Lawrence Clifton moved their fellow passengers to silence as they detailed the difficulties they have wrestled with since their daughter was struck by a car in 1991 and fell into a seven-month coma.
"We thought we were covered," Mr. Clifton said. Instead, the family entered a maze of insurance regulations that turned them into advocates. Among their myriad frustrations, he said, was the insurance company's willingness to pay $150 a month -- year after year -- to rent a hospital bed while it refused to cover a one-time $350 bill to buy a used bed.
Such stories seem to have deeply touched the few people the riders have so far reached. But the extraordinary complexity of the debate has been clear both on and off the buses. Although they agree on the basic concept of universal health care, many of the passengers disagree on other points, including coverage for abortions, employer financing and the "single payer" option in which the Government pays all the health bills.
Many in the audiences have revealed the depth of the division, too. At the Pendleton stop, Ron Pahl described his family's health care problems to a small audience waiting for the buses. But later he told a reporter that he did not support an overhaul because he opposed provisions requiring employers to finance workers' insurance.
On the bus, there is deep concern that change take a responsible course. Dianne Brownson, a 49-year-old nurse from Pasco, Wash., said she joined the trip because she believed that health care was suffering a general decline. "I've seen young people die because they can't get insurance," she said. "That shouldn't happen."
As they moved east today, through a dusty landscape dotted with small churches, large cornfields, sprawling cattle ranches and narrow, twisting rivers, the riders played cards, shared stories and vowed to move to the debate off their buses and into the heartland.
"We're not hiding," said Edward Kerns, a 37-year-old paraplegic from Portland who was injured in a car accident 16 years ago. "We are learning as we go. I would have liked to talk to those protesters. But I don't know too much about politics. I think we are a little green, yet. And we are heading into more conservative country."
As the buses pulled up here, Daniel Lumley, a 30-year-old from Seattle who lost an arm and a leg in a motorcycle accident, cheered his fellow passengers on. "The troops no longer are retreating," he said cheerfully, after warning them about the crowd of about 50 people outside, about half of them protesters.
Then, as an aside, he added, "If they get rough, I'll take my leg off and beat them with it."
With that resolve, the passengers all disembarked.
 
DIARY
HEALTH CARE DEVELOPMENTS
 
YESTERDAY
 
Democratic Congressional leaders and Vice President Al Gore predicted that Congress would adopt a national health insurance bill guaranteeing coverage to all Americans.
 
IN CONGRESS
 
The Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, and the House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, said Congress would stay in session as long as it took to pass a health care bill. Varying bills have emerged from committees. The Senate is to begin debate the week of Aug. 1; the House, on Aug. 8.
 
AT THE WHITE HOUSE
 
Vice President Gore acknowledged that the goal of universal health care coverage might have to be phased in over years to win Congressional approval. He said the President would not accept a Senate Finance Committee proposal that would seek to insure about 95 percent of Americans by offering business incentives, tax credits and subsidies to the poor.
 
WHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK
 
Senator Mitchell and Representative Gephardt will decide on what the bills they will put before Congress will contain and what sections they will take from measures recommended by two committees from each house. Pressure is building on Congress to pass some form of health care legislation before adjourning for the fall elections. Under ferocious deadlines, Congressional budget overseers are trying to calculate what some alternatives will cost.

HEADLINE: An Energetic Trustbuster, but Not a Boat Rocker

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
To the surprise of nobody, Anne K. Bingaman, in her first year as the top Justice Department trustbuster, has transformed a dormant antitrust operation into a fountain of activity, the ideal place for a veteran of the corporate litigation trenches to fulfill herself in making policy.
"This is the dream of my life," Ms. Bingaman, who is 51, said in her Southwestern twang a few days after announcing that the Government had forced the Microsoft Corporation, the software giant, to change some of the ways it does business. "I get out of bed every day and ask how could I be so lucky." 
 Ms. Bingaman, a liberal Democrat who is married to Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, has surprised many Washingtonians not only by publicly espousing some conservative-sounding views but by praising her Reagan-era predecessor, William F. Baxter. Ms. Bingaman calls Mr. Baxter, once her professor at Stanford and now a good friend, a "phenomenal" antitrust intellect who left a "monumental" legacy.
 
Merger Rules Remain
 Despite the urging of some colleagues, Ms. Bingaman has made no effort to overhaul the formal guidelines used by the division since 1982 in evaluating mergers, preferring to let stand what Mr. Baxter is said to regard as his crowning achievement.
"A lot of people seemed to think I was going to wholesale rewrite the guidelines, but I think that would have been precipitous, frankly," Ms. Bingaman said. The need for amendment would have to be demonstrated, she added, since the guidelines "appeared economically sound."
But while the philosophical gap with her Republican predecessors appears not particularly large, the Assistant Attorney General's dynamism makes for maximum contrast in style. Not only is she finding and bringing cases at a rapid clip -- some of them innovative -- she eagerly proclaims results, a practice that in itself can make companies think twice about cutting corners.
To be sure, antitrust, like economics, is a field in which practitioners largely agree on most basic issues and find their differences often grotesquely magnified when injected into politics. "There's a popularization about antitrust" that tends to produce sloganeering and distortion, Ms. Bingaman suggested.
Her skills in salesmanship were evident in the Microsoft settlement, which some computer-industry executives belittled as too narrow, leaving untouched the core of Microsoft's power.
Ms. Bingaman bristles at such talk. "We looked at every aspect of this," she said. "We brought the case that was there to bring. I'm extremely proud of this result. We've got 100 percent of what we could ever hope to achieve in a court."
She pulled out a legal pad and sketched a diagram of the settlement terms, which she said Microsoft had "fought like tigers" to avoid, opening the market to makers of competing operating systems. She challenged those who "think this isn't a big deal" to ask some intended beneficiaries, like I.B.M. and Novell.
"We think it's excellent for Novell and good for the industry," said David R. Bradford, senior vice president and general counsel of Novell, the software producer in Provo, Utah.
The critics were less impressed, arguing that the consent decree failed to address the most important aspects of Microsoft's strengths.
"Microsoft will continue to be very powerful," Martin Goetz, a co-founder of Applied Data Research, the nation's first software company, said at the time. "The Justice Department hasn't listened to the cries of the software companies."
And Richard Shaffer of Technologic Partners, a research firm in New York, said Microsoft "is the winner" and "the Standard Oil of its day."
 
Beyond the Borders
 The Microsoft settlement overshadowed another case announced earlier this month in which the division teamed up with Canadian counterparts to break up what the regulators said was a price-fixing conspiracy in thermal paper for facsimile machines that involved the North American operations of the Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan.
The international dimension is becoming a Bingaman trademark. She is the first antitrust chief to name a deputy to work exclusively on such cases, and these cases represent the division's work at the frontiers of its authority. The fax paper case was preceded by one in which the division won agreement from Pilkington P.L.C., the British glass company, to stop licensing only one user of its technology in each country, a practice that kept American glassmakers from opening factories overseas.
While the policy change, which allows the department to pursue antitrust cases against foreign companies that inhibit American exports, came during the Bush Administration, Ms. Bingaman cast the international push as more of a jobs issue.
This has raised questions among some specialists, including Donald I. Baker, a division chief under President Gerald R. Ford and now in private law practice here. Mr. Baker said he found the Pilkington case "an echo of the Clinton campaign" and called such action "quite confrontational," and running the risk of retaliation.
Over all, however, Mr. Baker characterized Ms. Bingaman's first 13 months as "pretty successful," though perhaps helped by increased corporate worry over legal costs that might make some companies more inclined to settle than to litigate.
With a score of merger cases challenged, revised or abandoned in the last year, including the July 15 agreement imposing conditions on AT&T's purchase of McCaw Cellular, Ms. Bingaman boasts of setting a 12-month record for such activity.
While retaining the guidelines on mergers, she lost no time repealing guidelines governing vertical restraints of trade -- those involving companies at different stages in the chain of commerce, like a manufacturer of photographic equipment and a local camera store.
In the next few months, she intends to bring cases involving manufacturers' specification of minimum prices for their products, and the methods, like termination of dealerships, they use to enforce compliance.
She said she rejected the argument that retail price maintenance often benefited consumers by supporting dealer networks that are able to provide better advice and service. "I'm a believer in vigorous price competition, period," Ms. Bingaman said. "I think it's up to the public to decide if they want service, and it's not up to us to be engineering what kinds of stores people buy products in."
Ms. Bingaman -- who said she had wanted to be a lawyer since, at age 9, she met "my great, great hero in life," Adlai E. Stevenson -- was suitably wary about disclosing other possible targets of antitrust action. But she couldn't help musing, as a consumer with a 14-year-old son, John, about the high price of breakfast cereal, for which she pays up to $6 a box. That just "drives me nuts," she said.
The job also seems to have resulted in a more satisfying personal life. Ms. Bingaman now rides to work with her husband from their home in northwest Washington in their 1986 Chevrolet, providing nearly an hour a day of additional togetherness. "This job saved my marriage," she quipped, adding that she "used to be able to afford a car" of her own.

HEADLINE: Iowa Farmers Rebel Against Subsidies, Seeking New Setup

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: COGGON, Iowa

 BODY:
Few people get a better deal from the Government than farmers, big-city politicians often complain. Growers of the biggest crops can collect checks from the taxpayers for producing nothing at all. And farmers who produce too much can sell the excess to Washington rather than eat a big loss.
After 60 years of this Depression-born system, which currently gives farmers about $11 billion a year in subsidies, an insurrection is rising in, of all places, Iowa. 
 Here in the nation's bread basket, in a state of 102,000 farms, representatives of 11 leading farm organizations have formed a coalition with the single purpose of pressuring Congress and the Clinton Administration to scrap the system of subsidies in 1995, when a new five-year farm law is enacted.
The current system, a labyrinth of regulation and bureaucracy, restricts farmers' production to prevent surpluses. In return, it pays premiums to many to raise the prices they would otherwise get for their crops.
But in recent years, Federal money for subsidies has dropped precipitously, a measure of the long, slow erosion of farmers' political clout in Washington.
Against that backdrop, the farmers' coalition, the Iowa Farm Bill Study Team, proposes replacing the current system with something much simpler -- a safety net of guaranteed income, which they call revenue assurance.
Under revenue assurance, instead of paying all participating growers a per-bushel subsidy as it does now, the Government would make payments only to farmers who suffered steep plunges in revenue from setbacks like ruinous drought, flood or collapse in prices. And then it would pay a farmer only enough to restore his revenue for that year to 70 percent of his average revenue during the previous five years.
The Department of Agriculture calculates that under the revenue assurance plan, farms would end up with less than half the aid they now receive. But the Iowans say farmers would be freed of most Government control over what they produce, so they would make up losses in aid by producing as much as they wanted of whatever they wanted.
The Department of Agriculture's immense regulatory bureaucracy would shrivel, the coalition argues, and with it, the reams of paperwork that farmers must complete under the current system.
Some farm-state lawmakers and most of the national farm lobby deride the idea. They argue that the current system insures that the country will have a cheap and reliable food supply and helps farmers to survive hazards that no other important industry faces. The historically cohesive farm lobby now faces the phenomenon of dissent within.
 
Official Sees Tests Program
 But what intrigues some members of Congress and the Administration is not the proposal itself so much as its source. "What catches everyone's attention is that this doesn't come from me, or the Office of Management and Budget or a university," said Joseph Glauber, the principal agricultural consultant at the Department of Agriculture and part of the Administration team working on the new farm law. "It comes from a bunch of farmers."
With next year's law not yet in the works, few members of Congress have started discussing details. Mr. Glauber said the Administration's review was just beginning. But he predicted that Congress would create a pilot program based on the Iowa plan, which could be expanded if it is successful.
Another group that is intrigued by the idea is the influential American Association of Agricultural Economists, which has scheduled a full day to discuss the plan when it meets here in August.
Primarily, the Iowans say, they are simply being pragmatic. They argue that their plan would protect them from new cuts in farm supports next year and in future farm bills. As farmers have declined in numbers and political power, Congress has been chipping away at the old programs amid efforts to pare Federal spending.
"There aren't very many people who are going to be affected by a cut in agricultural programs," said Doran Zumbach, the leader of the Iowa group. "One-hundred percent of the people in this country are eaters, and just 2 percent are producers."
He says most members of Congress were not even in office in 1990, when the last bill was enacted, and they face other demands for Government largess. "Farmers can yell up and down all they want," he said. "They are going to have less."
Mr. Zumbach is a corn and soybean farmer in Coggon, 40 miles north of Cedar Rapids along arrow-straight roads through emerald green vistas of newly tasseling corn.
On the wall of his home office, above a computer, fax machine, printer and a terminal that reports minute-by-minute changes in commodity prices, is a long row of wall plaques proclaiming Mr. Zumbach a frequent winner of statewide growing contests.
Mr. Zumbach is vice president of the Iowa Corn Growers Association and chairman of the Iowa coalition, whose members include representatives of the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation, the Agribusiness Association of Iowa, National Farmers Organization, the Iowa Institute of Cooperatives, and the corn, soybean, dairy, pork, sheep, cattle and poultry associations.
He and other team members were in Washington on July 11 and 12, lobbying the White House, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Agriculture and the staffs of farm state lawmakers in Congress.
 
A Complicated Arrangement
 The current system is an extraordinarily complex arrangement of policies and regulations. Its principal beneficiaries, growers of corn, sorghum, barley, wheat, rice and cotton, agree to plant no more land than the Government asks. In that way, the Government tries to prevent surpluses and resulting plunging prices. In return, farmers receive deficiency payments representing the difference between the price they get for their crops and arbitrary, invariably higher target prices that Congress sets.
For example, the target price for corn under the current five-year program is $2.75 a bushel, which is well above the $2.40 a bushel that farmers are now typically getting for their corn on the open market. So the Government pays them an extra 35 cents a bushel.
Farmers are not required to participate, but most do. And they withdraw from the system only at great peril to their incomes. Because the subsidy paid in any year is calculated on the acreage planted with a subsidized crop in the previous year, returning to the system means going for an entire year without any Federal money.
 
What the Farm Lobby Says
 For years, the agricultural lobby and its allies in Congress have argued that besides protecting food supplies and farmers from disaster, the system protects family farms and rural communities.
But many economists and urban politicians say the system favors giant corporate farms on which no one lives. They say it forces small family farms out of business and discourages diversity in farming.
Other critics argue that the system encourages farmers to squeeze greater harvests of subsidized crops out of the acreage to which they have been limited; to do this, they damage the soil with overuse of herbicides and pesticides, while diverse crops would help sustain the soil.
Both arguments have taken a toll on Congress's support for the current system of the price- and income-support system. In the last farm bill, four years ago, Congress removed 15 percent of each farmer's land from the base that qualifies for support. And last year, Congress pushed wool, mohair and honey producers out of the system entirely.
 
Decline Since 1986
 Payments to farmers, which reached a record $25.8 billion in 1986, have averaged only $10 billion over the last five years.
Mr. Zumback argues that the Iowans' plan to bring a farmer's revenues to 70 percent of average provides no more than a safety net.
Since farmers' profits, the money they live on, are from 5 to 10 percent of revenue, "they have suffered a huge loss before revenue assurance ever kicks in," he said.
Foes of the plan say farmers could make out like bandits, taking a year off and still collecting most of their income. But Mr. Zumbach says they would then risk losing future aid because the revenue on which the aid is based would plunge. He says efficient farmers, free to grow more and more varied crops would have an opportunity to earn more than they can now.
 
Aid Expected 1 in 5 Years
 He calculates that a farmer would need revenue assurance about every five years. "I would hope I would never need it," he said. Had revenue assurance been available earlier, he said it would have kicked in three times in his 25 years of farming, most recently last year, when the floods in the Midwest cut his corn revenues to 60 percent of previous five years.
The Iowans would keep some features of the current system. One is the compensation they receive for keeping land fallow at the Government's request for environmental purposes.
Another would be the "nonrecourse loan." At the end of a harvest, farmers take a low-interest loan from the Government based on another, Government-managed price for the crop, known as a loan rate, and consign the harvest to the Government.
If later, usually within nine months, the market price rises above the loan rate, the farmer sells the crop and repays the loan. But if the market price falls below the loan rate, the Government keeps the crop, and the farmer keeps the loan, owing nothing.
 
Protection From the Market
 The loan system would help to protect farmers from having to sell their crops the moment they harvest them. With all farmers selling at the same time, prices would plunge.
Many agricultural economists see merit in the Iowa plan, although they say it needs much more scrutiny. Robert T. Thompson, the Reagan Administration's top farm economist, said, "I'm encouraged by this -- farmers getting their heads together and coming up with something that might well be a better mouse trap.'
In Congress and the national farm organizations, few people flatly reject the idea of replacing the current system with revenue assurance. They see it as a last resort but disagree over the political proximity of the resort.
Iowa's Democratic Senator Tom Harkin said: "If you assume that all supports are going to be thrown out, then this might look good. But that's not going to happen."
 
Urban-Rural Coalition
 But some urban legislators are impressed with the Iowans' proposal. Two are Representatives Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, and Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, ideological opposites on most issues who were instrumental in cutting spending from the 1990 farm bill.
"It seems to me this is an enormously more rational approach to supplementing the income of people on the land," Mr. Armey said.
Mr. Schumer promised battles royal over the law next year and said the Iowa plan might bear the seeds of a truce.
"If Iowa farmers are smelling in the winds that it's going to be harder to sustain agricultural subsidies as they are now," he said, "they're right."

HEADLINE: U.S. CORPORATIONS EXPANDING ABROAD AT A QUICKER PACE

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
American companies are once again rapidly expanding their operations abroad -- demonstrating that no matter what the incentives for keeping business in the United States, the urge to spread factories, offices, stores and jobs overseas is irresistible.
The surge in these investments and the jobs they create overseas comes just when exports should be climbing more rapidly than investment abroad. A weak dollar and falling labor costs have made American products increasingly competitive. Yet overseas investment is rising at twice the rate of exports. And for each dollar earned from exports, American companies take in nearly $2 from the sale of what they produce abroad. 
 "If you are going to be really important in the world market, you are going to grow by producing in many countries, and not by exporting, which has its limits," said Robert E. Lipsey, an expert on overseas investment at the National Bureau of Economic Research. "There are circumstances where this might not be the case, but by and large that is the story."
The issue, of course, is jobs, and who will hold them. American companies employ 5.4 million people abroad, 80 percent of them in manufacturing, and the hot issue in the late 1980's, during a similar surge in overseas investment, was this: Why can't the goods and services that these foreign workers produce be supplied from the United States? Why must companies migrate abroad, shedding some of their national identity and loyalty?
Now that debate is likely to revive, although perhaps with less intensity. American investment overseas remains concentrated in manufacturing, particularly in Europe, Canada and Japan, but manufacturing was an area of more rapid growth in the 1980's than it is today. This time companies like Wal-Mart and Morgan Stanley & Company are leaders -- and that tones down the job issue.
Opening a factory in Europe or Mexico or East Asia often suggests that one in the United States may be closed. Wal-Mart's new retail investments in Canada, Brazil and Mexico, on the other hand, or Morgan Stanley's eight offices in East Asia do not suggest cutbacks at home.
"What we are sending abroad, apart from money, is our skill and experience as investment bankers, and you really have to be on site to do this sort of thing," said Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley, in a telephone interview from Hong Kong, where he was helping his local colleagues advise the Chinese Government on the privatization of an airline.
Morgan Stanley employs 410 people in Hong Kong, and expects to increase that to 500 by year's end, Mr. Roach said. Most of the firm's Asia offices, including two in China, have opened since the late 1980's.
The new surge in investment, in all types of businesses, showed up in recently released Commerce Department data. This investment by American companies in overseas operations rose last year to $716.2 billion, when measured as the cost of replacing the buildings and equipment. The 7.2 percent increase, coming after two years of much less growth, matched some of the better years of the 1980's. In the first quarter of 1994, investment increased even more quickly.
 
Manufacturing Lags Behind
 But while manufacturing still dominates the numbers, representing nearly 40 percent of the total, manufacturing investment rose by only 7 percent last year. Outlays for retail, finance and the like went up by twice that percentage or more.
"It is our belief that, with trade barriers coming down, the world is going to be one great big marketplace, and he who gets there first does the best," said Donald Shinkel, a spokesman at Wal-Mart, which had no stores overseas in the 1980's.
The investment surge, after two years of relatively little growth, coincides with incipient recoveries in Europe and Japan after periods of recession. As business has picked up, sales and profits have risen at American operations abroad, making more money available for investment. These reinvested profits accounted for more than half the outlays last year, the Commerce Department reports.
Booming economies in East Asia, particularly China, Singapore and Hong Kong, also drew investment, and so did nearly every Western Hemisphere country, with Canada, Mexico, Argentina and Bermuda among the leaders -- Bermuda being an offshore haven for American banking and insurance companies, while Canada, Mexico and Argentina attracted mainly manufacturing investment.
But the European nations and Japan attracted the biggest share of the manufacturing investment. They almost always do, although they are industrial countries with stronger currencies and higher average labor costs than in the United States.
American manufacturing companies engage in three types of overseas investment, and the one involving the industrial countries is perhaps the most difficult to justify -- given that exporting from the United States can be less expensive, said Raymond Vernon, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
Still this investment does not draw the greatest criticism, which has been reserved for companies that relocate labor-intensive operations, like auto assembly, or apparel manufacturing, or the assembly of some electronics products, to low-wage countries like Mexico or Thailand. "The United States is simply not the lowest-cost producer in the world, and moving abroad to these countries is inevitable," Mr. Vernon said.
Then there are the Wal-Marts and Morgan Stanleys trying to penetrate new markets in the only way possible, by putting a store or an investment house on site. Since these companies do not hold back operations at home to expand abroad, their tactics are seldom criticized.
Finally there are the situations in which a company can export its product inexpensively enough, particularly when the dollar is weak, but chooses instead to manufacture abroad, mainly for "insurance," as Mr. Vernon puts it. Of course, foreign companies, particularly the Japanese, adopt the same strategy for the United States, establishing many factories here that create jobs for Americans. But they employ 4.9 million Americans, which is 500,000 fewer than the American corporate payroll abroad.
Jobs are also created in the United States when American companies, investing abroad, export parts or machinery to help make their products overseas. But this "American content" makes up only 9 percent, on average, of the merchandise produced, the Commerce Department says. The rest is obtained overseas.
The Gillette Company embraces the strategy of manufacturing abroad rather than exporting, generating jobs overseas rather than in the United States. That has happened most recently in the case of Gillette's new Sensor XL razor blade cartridge.
The cartridge, simple for consumers to use, is difficult to manufacture, involving 10 welds with high-technology laser machines. Production started nearly two years ago at Gillette's main plant, in Boston, but all the output was exported to Europe. "We introduced the product in Europe because razor blade sales there are greater than in the United States," said Thomas Skelly, a Gillette senior vice president.
The new Sensor model is to be sold in the United States starting this year. But rather than expand the Boston operation to handle the additional production -- and add jobs, perhaps -- Gillette is adding the extra capacity to its Berlin plant, a high-technology factory that will take over the European market.
 
Currency Issues Discounted
 Cost is not the issue; blades are small and not difficult to ship, and the weak dollar gives the United States an advantage -- but one that Mr. Skelly, and other corporate executives, dismiss as insignificant. "In the long run, these currency fluctuations, up and down, don't mean a whit in the decision where to manufacture," he said.
Over the years, Gillette has put 62 factories in 28 countries and each tries to operate as if it were a regional company, adjusting as quickly as possible to local competitors. Being close to a market is a priority, promising better returns than exporting from the United States, Mr. Skelly says.
"We are also concerned about having only one place where a product is made," he said. "There could be an explosion, or labor problems." If the Boston workers struck, for example, Gillette would supply the Sensor XL to Europe and the United States from the Berlin plant, and vice versa.
The upshot of this approach is that Gillette employs 2,300 people in the manufacture of razors and blades in the United States and 7,700 -- more than three times as many -- abroad.
Some of those workers are making blades at Gillette plants in Poland, Russia and China, where production costs are less than in the United States. But that is not the case in Germany. "You could ship the blades from here, but you set up there for insurance," Mr. Vernon said. "And the justifications for this approach are not so clear cut."

HEADLINE: G.E. Finds Tough Going in Hungary

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BUDAPEST, July 23

 BODY:
Five years ago, amid handshakes and grins, the General Electric Company agreed to acquire Tungsram, a maker of lighting products and one of Hungary's industrial gems, in a deal that many believed would show other leading Western corporations how to turn Communist-run enterprises into money makers.
Almost immediately, other ambitious American companies took notice of General Electric's investment in Eastern Europe, and it became a beacon of hope for Hungary's workers and Government leaders. 
 But as losses mounted, General Electric soon faced the reality of what happens when grand expectations collide with the grim realities of an embedded culture of waste, inefficiency and indifference about customers and quality.
The Americans huffed that the Hungarians were lackadaisical; the Hungarians thought the Americans pushy. The company's aggressive management system depends on communication between workers and managers; the Communist system had forbidden it.
The Americans wanted sales, marketing and pampering of customers; the Hungarians believed these things took care of themselves. Hungarians expected General Electric to deliver lush Western-style wages. But the company came to Hungary to pay lower wages for making and exporting light bulbs, auto headlights and other products to Western Europe. After a series of raises Tungsram workers now average $2 an hour.
"Human engineering was much more difficult than product engineering," said Charles P. Pieper, the General Electric executive brought in 19 months ago by John F. Welch Jr., chairman and chief executive, to rescue G.E.'s investment. Now the company says it has turned the corner at Tungsram and the operation has been profitable for a year.
Getting there meant laying off half of Tungsram's nearly 20,000 workers including three of every four managers. The company began weekly huddles between Tungsram and American managers linked by conference call and it created a system of worker team meetings to devise ways to work more efficiently.
It also invested in new equipment to increase productivity and reduce waste. When General Electric arrived, half of what the workers made was scrapped because of defects. Now, the company says it has raised productivity by 50 percent.
 
Timing Not Understood
 Outside analysts who have studied General Electric's acquisition say it will turn out to be a wise investment in the long term. "But once they made the strategic decision of buying a Communist-run company in Eastern Europe, General Electric didn't understand how long it would take to bring things up to par," said Paul Marer, professor of international business at Indiana University.
A former employee, Istvan Kosa, 40, a financial analyst, said he understood General Electric's strategy but that emotionally it was draining.
"For those who lived through it, it seemed cruel," he said. "We were forced into a situation where we had to sit down two or three times a year and decide how we were going to reduce the number of employees and reorganize the cost. When I started in that accounting unit in 1991 there were 36 of us, when I left there were only 8."
 General Electric has long been considered by business leaders as one of America's most admired companies. It has never had an annual loss, and until a scandal at its brokerage firm subsidiary this year it had a string of 73 quarters in which it had recorded rising profits. Its chief, Mr. Welch, is a fierce competitor who wants to dominate each of General Electric's 12 businesses.
 
Toiling for Capitalism
 Mr. Welch's ambitions have reached the most remote Tungsram plant, where his drive for productivity raised some unusual parallels. "In Hungary many of us had to attend the Marx-Engels-Lenin university and learn slogans," said Janos Szlivka, the leader of the Independent Trade Union of Tungsram Employees at the Kisvarda factory in eastern Hungary. Instead of "Work, work, work for the Worker's Brigade," Tungsram employees were told to toil so General Electric could "become the most productive company on earth."
Mr. Szlivka pulled out a copy of a General Electric book given to him at a motivational seminar and thumbed through the pages. "Welch's slogans," he said, " 'If we're not No. 1 or No. 2 in a business, improve it, close it or sell it.' The workers don't like it."
General Electric says that in ordering layoffs it was careful to first edge out those near retirement. Employees received nine months of wages, well above what Hungarian law requires and were given counseling for other opportunities. But many women on Hungary's generous three-year maternity leave have not been rehired. And as General Electric bore down on productivity goals in 1992 and 1993, many workers were dismissed because the company no longer believed that they were needed.
 
Machines, Not People
 Those who stayed were told to work harder. The company adapted its American system of "action workouts" at Tungsram to wring more efficiencies out of the workers. These "workouts," or teams of workers tackling specific problems, reflect Mr. Welch's belief in a "boundaryless" culture in which employees remove obstacles to work more efficiently. The goal, General Electric assured skeptical Tungsram workers, was to make quality lights to improve sales which in turn would increase orders to the plants.
But workouts resulted in more machines and fewer people, making them a hard sell on the factory floor.
Mr. Szlivka, the union official, said these efficiencies had gone as far as humanly possible. "I don't know if the workers can be squeezed any more," he said.
If General Electric methods were demanding for the workers, they were an ordeal for the managers.
"For the first year, it was very difficult to know whether I could live up to the expectations or not. Not only for me but for the other managers," said Miklos Horvath, 54, the manager of the Tungsram plant in Nagykanisza, in southwest Hungary.
 
Classes in English
 Mr. Horvath, like most of the survivors, had to attend English classes, a daunting undertaking at his age. He knew if he could not perform smoothly in weekly conference calls with his American peers he would not last.
Many did not. "A lot of people who were not driven and who couldn't stomach it left," said Ivan Volgyes, a G.E. consultant.
General Electric agreed to pay $150 million for 50.1 percent of Tungsram in 1989, but in less than four years it announced that it had "lost the equity value of the company" and pumped in another $195 million of fresh capital. Still more money followed and all told, General Electric has invested $550 million in Tungsram and now virtually owns it.
Tungsram, which accounted for 3 percent of Hungary's gross national product, was a low-cost way for General Electric to enter the Western European market where it had never been much of a force in the lighting business. Tungsram had 7 percent of the Western European market in 1989, and Mercedes-Benz was a big customer of its headlights. Tungsgram's share was better than General Electric's 2 percent slice of the market. General Electric also believed that Tungsram would be the vehicle for taking on Philips, the big Dutch electronics company, and the Osram unit of Siemens of Germany.
 
Hard-Headed Guidelines
 But a year into the deal, General Electric discovered outdated equipment, poor distribution and sales, and arcane accounting procedures that had disguised losses.
To cut costs, Mr. Pieper issued hard-headed guidelines for layoffs: "I said, 'If we have 10 people in an area look at the requirements for the next 10 years. If we need six, consider not laying off four but laying off six and adding two later.' "
Company officials now say the combination of General Electric's productivity drive and Hungarian scientific ability is bringing results. With Tungsram and a British subsidiary, the former lighting business of Thorn EMI P.L.C., General Electric now has 16 percent of the market, company officials said.
"I hope now you're looking at a winning culture," said Mr. Pieper, who is based in London. "Our yields today are equal to the best we have in the world."
 
Better Productivity Cited
 Mr. Pieper attributed much of the improved picture to better productivity. "This is where the workouts are important," he said.
For example, a war room plastered with productivity goals was opened at the Nagykanisza plant so adjusters could move from the factory floor to a conference table and figure out how to rejigger machines to save time and improve quality.
In one instance, the time it took to reset a machine from making one kind of lamp to making another kind was reduced from 955 minutes in March 1993 to 480 minutes to 200 minutes three months later.
In May, General Electric persuaded the Hungarian Government to grant another five-year tax holiday on profits, arguing that a similar break in the first five years had meant little because there were no profits.
 
Higher Wages Sought
 So as the operation turns profitable and some assembly-line workers are being rehired at the Tungsram plants in Kisvarda and Nagykanisza, the question of higher wages looms. Mr. Szlivka, the union leader, says the workers feel cheated because they were told in 1990 that with fewer workers wages would rise.
But pay has failed to keep up with inflation. Last year, Hungary's inflation was 28 percent but Tungsram wages rose only 6 percent. This year, with inflation at 22 percent, the union won a 16 percent increase.
A national survey by the union last year showed that 36 percent of Tungsram workers lived in families that were on the Hungarian poverty line, a far higher number than in 1988.
General Electric says that Tungsram wages, which average $320 a month, are in the top 25 percent in each of the eight plant towns.
"Labor is so cheap here," Mr. Szlivka said. "In England, people who work in this industry make 10 an hour. They make 1 an hour here. The past four years have really meant that people have had to work more and the money they make doesn't even come near the inflation level. So it shouldn't be any surprise they are not crazy about General Electric."
But General Electric's experience has not translated into a ground swell against foreign takeovers.
"I don't think General Electric has made people against foreign investment," Mr. Szlivka said. "The workers are not against development but at the same time they want to be able to make a living. The workers don't understand why they make less money if the products they produce are as good as Philips's. Why is there such a difference in wages? Since the Iron Curtain was removed, people can see what is happening elsewhere."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
A Surge in Advertising Across the Radio Dial

BYLINE: By JOSHUA MILLS 

 BODY:
Helped by qualitative ratings and research that provide a snapshot of listeners' buying habits, radio advertising has been surging this year at stations big and small around the country.
Advertising revenues rose 12 percent in May, the last month for which data are available, from May 1993. The gain was the fourth double-digit increase in five months. 
 "Radio is taking some business from other media, largely because radio broadcasters have become a good deal more sophisticated in how they market their stations," said Tom Moon, the managing editor of Radio Business Report, an industry newspaper published in Alexandria, Va. "There's less emphasis today on selling by raw audience numbers and more on saying, 'Here's a profile of your consumers, and here's how that matches the profile of our listeners.' "
Qualitative ratings might be useful, for example, for a classical music station that is not ranked among a market's top 20 stations in total audience. The profile might show, how-ever, that the station is in the top 10 among people who take at least 10 business trips a year, or among people with graduate-school educations. That information might not help the station attract soup advertising, but it would be useful in courting airlines or makers of luxury cars.
 
Fast-Paced Growth
 As the American economy has strengthened, advertising has increased in all markets and at stations of all sizes, said Gary R. Fries, president of the Radio Advertising Bureau, which is based in New York and is the industry's sales and marketing arm.
"Radio's recovery started more than a year ago, before the economy was recognized as growing, and it's growing faster than the economy, faster than ad spending in general, faster than most other media," Mr. Fries said.
The bureau conducts a monthly survey of radio advertising in 115 areas around the country, and has found that percentage increases in smaller markets are similar to those in bigger markets, a spokeswoman said.
Unlike most daily newspapers and the television networks, which seek the broadest audience possible, radio has generally thrived by developing formats that carve out specific pieces of the listening audience. And while the growth of cable television, video games and personal computing has reduced the time that many people spend with traditional media, time spent listening to the radio has actually increased, largely because so much radio listening is done in the car and elsewhere outside the home.
For many years, radio relied on ratings provided by the Arbitron Company of New York to measure its total audience, and the time spent listening, within broad age groups. These ratings, of course, benefited the stations with the largest audiences and hurt others.
 
Audience Portraits
 As recently as last year, owners and executives of some stations that specialized in classical music or jazz were bemoaning the reliance of media buyers on the raw Arbitron numbers.
No longer.
"We used to do body-count research, but now we do qualitative research," Mr. Fries said. "Any radio station can tell you a profile of their listeners."
Statistics released earlier this month by the Radio Advertising Bureau show that local and national ad revenues were each up 12 percent in May, and rose an equal amount for the January-May period, compared with 1993.
 "July-August-September looks like the same type of increases, even though summer has traditionally been not as spirited a time as other seasons," Mr. Fries said.
Radio stations can now use software provided by Arbitron to tap into a data base and pull out specific findings. A New York station that wants to seek advertising from northern New Jersey retailers, for instance, can break down the cumulative Arbitron numbers to see just how many listeners it has in New Jersey, and what their demographics are.
The Arbitron data base, compiled from listener diaries, can divide the audience statistics by age, sex, family status and education. The new software also allows stations to link up with other data bases and obtain census data and spending patterns compiled by other companies.
 In addition to Arbitron, a number of small companies offer qualitative research into listening and buying habits.
 
New Programs, New Rules
 The strong ad performance reflects the successful syndication of program hosts including Rush Limbaugh, Howard Stern and Don Imus, and rule changes adopted by the Federal Communications Commission in 1992, industry executives and industry watchers say.
The new rules increased the number of stations a single entity could hold to 30 AM and 30 FM stations, from 12 of each, and allowed one owner to have more than two stations in a single market.
"The impact has been huge," said Gerry Boehme, senior vice president for research at the Katz Radio Group, a company in New York that helps local radio stations court national and regional advertisers. "You can cut costs, change marketing." By putting more money into marketing and defining its audience more precisely, a station might even wind up creating a new format, he said.
At the time of the rule change, some broadcasting critics, and at least one F.C.C. commissioner, said the higher limits would reduce program diversity.
Not so, insisted Mr. Boehme. Echoing the traditional industry view, he said: "It's a real positive for consumers, because stronger operators have taken over stations and pumped in more money. That's led to more format choice for the consumer, and strong stations can promote better and differentiate themselves."

Utility Investors Find They've Become Real Estate Owners.

BYLINE: By Laurence Zuckerman 

 BODY:
MUTUAL funds that specialize in utility companies have traditionally been conservative investments favored by retired or elderly investors seeking to supplement their incomes. So it may come as a surprise to them that many utility funds are rounding out their portfolios by investing in a sector that some consider to be highly speculative: real estate.
The Stratton Monthly Dividend Shares fund has about 65 percent of its $137 million portfolio invested in electric and telephone companies, but 24 percent of the fund is invested in six real estate investment trusts, or REIT's. Eaton Vance's Total Return Trust, which normally has from 75 to 100 percent of its $533 million portfolio invested in utilities, has about 18 percent invested in real estate trusts. 
 "How could they do that?" asked H. Dale Hemmerdinger, president of Atco Property and Management, a Manhattan property owner. "I think that is a highly dangerous speculation for a fund which is supposed to be very secure and low risk."
But the fund managers wonder if Mr. Hemmerdinger has had a good look at utility stocks recently. The sector has taken a beating since fall amid interest rate increases and deregulation concerns.
"Talk about risk," said Edwin W. Bragdon, a vice president at Eaton Vance and portfolio manager of the Total Return Trust. "Utilities dropped 30 percent in nine months and REIT's went up. At least in the short term it was not a bad idea. In the long run we'll see how it turns out."
After several sharp ups and downs in the 1970's and 80's, a flood of REIT offerings have poured out of Wall Street in the last 18 months. These latest trusts generally own and manage portfolios of properties in a sector of the property market, like multifamily apartments, office buildings, hotels or shopping centers.
By law, a REIT is exempt from corporate taxes, but must distribute at least 95 percent of its net income to shareholders in the form of a dividend. The relatively high yield and growth prospects of the trusts especially appeal to the managers of utility funds that emphasize current income.
"We need a high yield, and not many other areas beside electric utilities and REIT's offer that," said James W. Stratton, the founder of Stratton management and the firm's chief investment officer. In the first quarter, the Stratton fund offered the highest yield, 7.8 percent, of any utility fund tracked by Lipper Analytical Services.
Strictly speaking, there is nothing to prevent utility fund managers from buying REIT's. Most sector funds require managers to invest up to 65 percent of assets in the given specialty, leaving them free to invest the rest in cash or other securities. The funds regularly disclose their holdings to investors so that no one who reads the documentation carefully should be surprised.
But critics point out that the real estate market is not nearly as regulated as are utilities and is not providing an essential service that is always in demand, like electric power. It is also subject to much wilder boom-and-bust cycles.
"Traditionally, real estate has been a rich man's game because it is very risky," Mr. Hemmerdinger said. "Think of all the people who have gone broke" in recent years.
The trusts are also very difficult to analyze unless you have a sophisticated understanding of the real estate business. "Does my mutual fund manager who knows everything there is to know about utility stocks know what there is to know about real estate?" asked Barry Vinocur, editor in chief of Realty Stock Review, which closely tracks REIT offerings.
Several fund managers agree, saying that they carefully scrutinize the management of the REIT's they invest in. "This is a sector that has gone through boom-and-bust times," said Sheldon Simon, manager of the $1 billion Putnam Utilities Growth and Income Fund, which has about 2 percent of its assets invested in property trusts. "There's no reason to think that you wouldn't find trouble if you invest in the wrong REIT."
Other managers say they have to diversify to get the stability they are seeking, because utility stocks are so sensitive to rate changes. "If I bought 100 percent utilities, then I would be completely at the whim of the bond market," said Christopher H. Wiles, who manages two utility funds for Federated Investors in Pittsburgh.

Food Stamps

 BODY:
The number of households in the region receiving food stamps has jumped 51 percent since the start of the decade. The area's sluggish economy has been the main reason, but the Agriculture Department also says the Clinton Administration's efforts to issue food stamps to all who qualify has increased the rolls. If the local economy continues to improve, the number of food stamp recipients should begin to decline in the next year or two. The statistics released earlier this month on overpayment and error rates for food stamps concerned mistakes involving the issuance of food stamps. They did not reflect the smaller, but growing, problem of merchants buying food stamps, usually at 60 to 70 cents on the dollar, and redeeming them at full price from the Federal Government.

HEADLINE: New Head of Landmarks Panel Looks to Future

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
A 38-year-old lawyer has been named chairwoman of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, and she says she will move quickly to look at the future of buildings in lower Manhattan and to cultivate public-private partnerships in the care of landmarks.
 The chairwoman, Jennifer J. Raab, a litigation associate in the firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, was named to the post last week by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. She was the issues director for his 1989 mayoral campaign. 
Although Ms. Raab is little known in preservation circles, news of her appointment was greeted with cautious enthusiasm by leading preservationists. It was also welcomed by the Real Estate Board of New York.
 "I see landmarks as New York's treasure, our history and legacy," Ms. Raab said. "I'm very excited to be able to bring my skills as an advocate to something I really believe in: safeguarding the landmarks process in New York."
 
Deeper Implications
 Given the interest of City Hall in promoting real-estate development --which can conflict with historic preservation -- Mr. Giuliani's choice of a landmarks chief may have significant implications.
 In lower Manhattan, for example, are dozens of buildings from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that are architecturally significant but economically stagnant, full of embellishments but devoid of tenants. Many owners would just as soon raze these buildings, few of which are official landmarks.
 Ms. Raab said downtown was "one of the first things I have to look at," though she shied away from specifics.
 She said she did not anticipate any "discontinuity" between her tenure and that of her predecessor, Laurie Beckelman, who is to become a vice president of the LaSalle Partners real-estate concern.
 Ms. Raab said Ms. Beckelman's focus on Harlem landmarks is "something I certainly want to continue."
 Noting that the commission's budget and staff had been shrinking "without any shrinking of the needs in preservation," Ms. Raab also raised the prospect of public-private partnerships.
 While the commission is best known for creating landmarks and historic districts, its broader role is regulatory. Owners may not alter or demolish designated structures without approval from the commission. There are some 19,000 structures under its aegis, roughly 2 percent of all properties in New York City.
 Ms. Raab's appointment is subject to review by the City Council. Absent any controversy, she could take over the 11-member panel in September.
 
Praise From Officials
 About her successor, Ms. Beckelman said: "She's a lawyer and I think she'll be passionate in upholding the landmarks law. And it's good that she has a strong relationship with the Mayor. I think she'll fare well."
 The Real Estate Board "knows her to be a capable attorney, bright and fair," said Warren Wechsler, its first senior vice president.
 Similar words came from Kent L. Barwick, president of the Municipal Art Society, who said Ms. Raab seemed "very intelligent and caring about the city" and "is thought not to be an ideologue."
 Peg Breen, president of the New York Landmarks Conservancy, said "someone who isn't out of the preservation school" may be able to "help drive across the message that preservation is really a part of the economic development, tourism and culture of the city."
 Ms. Raab was a member of the legal team in 1992 that successfully defended, on behalf of tenants, the landmark designation of an entire Upper East Side housing complex, known as the City and Suburban York Avenue Estate. Its owner at the time, Peter S. Kalikow, sought to strip four of the 14 buildings of landmark status to build a new apartment tower between 78th and 79th Streets.
 Ms. Raab holds degrees from Cornell, Princeton and Harvard Universities. She has worked for the City Planning Commission, the South Bronx Development Organization and the law firms of Tufo & Zuccotti and Cravath, Swaine & Moore.
In 1988 she directed the unsuccessful State Senate campaign of Joseph B. Rose, who is now chairman of the City Planning Commission. Ms. Raab is married to Michael Goodwin, the deputy editorial page editor of The Daily News.

Excerpts From Remarks by U.S., Israel and Jordan

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks made today by President Clinton, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and King Hussein of Jordan after the signing of the Washington Declaration, as transcribed by the Federal News Service for Reuters and with translation of the Hebrew portion of Mr. Rabin's remarks by The New York Times:
 
BY PRESIDENT CLINTON
 After generations of hostility, blood and tears, the leaders of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the state of Israel will solemnly declare with the world as their witness that they have ended the state of belligerency between them. From this day forward, they pledge to settle their differences by peaceful means. Both countries will refrain from actions that may adversely affect the security of the other and will thwart all those who would use terrorism to threaten either side. 
 The Washington Declaration is the product of much hard work. Less than a year ago, Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan and Foreign Minister Peres of Israel met here publicly for the first time. Together, with the wise counsel and persistent energy of the Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, Israel and Jordan -- Israel and Jordan have pursued peace, and we are all in their debt.
It takes but a minute or two to cross the River Jordan, but for as long as most of us can remember, the distance has seemed immense. The awful power of ancient arguments and the raw wounds of recent wars have left generations of Israelis, Jordanians and Palestinians unable to imagine, much less build, a life of peace and security. Today King Hussein and Prime Minister Rabin give their people a new currency of hope and the chance to prosper in a region of peace. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	Your Majesty, at our first meeting you wrote me a -- after our first meeting you wrote me a heartfelt letter in which you referred to your revered grandfather, King Abdullah. You told me that his untimely assassination at the entrance to Jerusalem's Al Aksa Mosque had come at a time when he was intent on making peace with Israel.
Had he completed his mission, you said to me, your region would have been spared four decades of war. Today, 43 years later, Abdullah's grandson has fulfilled his legacy. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	Prime Minister, when you first visited me in the White House, you spoke eloquently of your soldier's life, defending and guiding your nation through four bloody decades of struggling to survive. You told me your people had had enough bloodshed, that this was time to make peace. Ten months ago you stood on this same lawn and shook the hand of Yasir Arafat, the leader of the Palestinian people. Today you stand together with King Hussein, descendant of the Prophet Mohammed, to declare that Jordan and Israel have ended their conflict. In holding out to your people the hope of a normal, secure life, you, sir, have fulfilled the mission of your life and of all those who have
fought by your side for so long.
 
BY KING HUSSEIN
 President Clinton, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, ladies and gentlemen, and so it is that on this day at this house of the great American people we have been able to take a historic step which we hope and pray will be to the benefit of our peoples within our entire region -- Jordanians, Israelis and others. This is the moment of a commitment and of a vision. Not all of what is possible is within the document we have just ratified, but a modest, determined beginning to bring to our region and our peoples the security from fear, which I must admit has prevailed over all the years of our lives, the uncertainty of every day as to how it might end, the suspicion, the bitterness, the lack of human contact. We are on our way now truly towards what is normal in relations between our peoples and ourselves and what is worthy. We will meet as often as we are able to and as required with pleasure to shepherd this process on in the times ahead.
At this moment, I would like to share with you all the pride I have in my people, the people of Jordan, and their maturity and their courage and, in what I have been blessed with, their trust and confidence, and I believe the commitment of the overwhelming majority to the cause of peace.
The term used in international documents as they affected us so far is the state of belligerency and the end of the state of belligerency. I think both in Arabic and in Hebrew our people do not have such a term. But we have accomplished and what we are committed to is the end of the state of war between Jordan and Israel.
Thank you so very much indeed, Mr. President, for all your kindness.
Thank you, Prime Minister.
Thank you, all our dear friends. A warm thanks to the American people -- our partners in the past, in the present, and in the future. God bless you and bless our march for the future and towards the future of peace in our region. Thank you.
 
BY PRIME MINISTER RABIN
 Mr. President, Your Majesty, it is dusk at our homes in the Middle East. Soon darkness will prevail. But the citizens of Israel and Jordan will see a great light. We have today taken a major step on the road to peace. We and Jordan have chosen to speak to each other rather than to continue the state of war. From here, in the distance of thousands of miles from home, I would like to congratulate today the inhabitants of Israel and of Jordan to remember the fallen in the wars on both sides and to tell children on both sides of the border we hope and pray that your life will be different than ours.
I believe that we are a small country with a big heart. We are aware of world agonies and suffering of human beings anywhere. At this hour, when we are celebrating here in Washington, Israeli defense soldiers and medical units are trying to save the lives of thousands, if not more, of people on the verge of death in Rwanda.
But at the very same time, Israeli soldiers, a rescue team in Buenos Aires, on the invitation of -- of their Argentinian government, are endeavoring to rescue the lives or bodies of those who were attacked, killed and disappeared, bodies of their own brothers as well as of the other human beings from buildings destroyed by vicious terrorists. This terrible crime was committed against Jews just because they were Jews. The Israeli rescue soldiers in Rwanda as well as those in Argentina, together with their comrades in arms defending us at home, are the same side of the same coin.
Mr. President, Your Majesty, there is much more in the Washington Declaration than parties were planning when they decided to prepare this declaration ten days ago. It bears witness to our ability in Israel and Jordan to accelerate our efforts towards peace, to overcome obstacles, to achieve a breakthrough, and to put an end to 46 years of hostility.
Mr. President, thank you. Thank you for all you have done for us and for what you will do. We embark on a road which must still be completed, and I am appealing to the United States, the leader of peace efforts in the Middle East, to assist those -- those countries, those peoples who demonstrate courage and who take risks, risks for peace because it is a worthwhile goal. The political achievement presented today to the public here in Washington are part of a whole agenda that must still be clarified in serious deliberations ahead of us, from the difficult subjects of boundaries and water to trade and economic relations on which peace in our region will be based -- and of course, security and diplomatic relations.
Our duty, starting today, is to turn the articles written on the paper into a living reality. This fine job could not have been completed without your leadership and determination in the Middle East peacemaking. You have already established your place in our history, an honorable place, and thank you. Our heartfelt gratitude our heartfelt gratitude goes also to Secretary of State Warren Christopher and his peace team who devotedly seek peace, and to generations of former U.S. Administration members who have for years searched for [a]bridge between Israel, Jordan and the other Arab peoples.
Your Excellency, the president of the United States, Your Majesty, the king of Jordan, let me say a few words in Hebrew to the citizens of Israel who are watching us now.
(In Hebrew) Dear Citizens of Israel, today we add another rung to the ladder rising to the fulfillment of the dream of peace. Full peace with Jordan is achievable. We will work to conclude it. Today we are all blessed with the Washington Declaration: Israelis, Jordanians, all those in the world who seek freedom and peace. Tomorrow morning we will all arise to a new page in our history, of which it can be said: "This is the day that God has made, let us rejoice in it." Good evening to you back home in Israel. Tomorrow, we hope, everything can be different. Regards to you from the peace effort.
Thank you very much.

HEADLINE: $20 Million Settlement in Exxon Case

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ANCHORAGE, July 25

 BODY:
The Exxon Corporation today agreed to pay $20 million to Alaskan native villagers who contended in a Federal lawsuit that the Exxon Valdez oil spill ruined their hunting grounds.
The settlement is intended to pay for damage to fish, seals, kelp and other foods that native Alaskans in 18 villages harvest from Prince William Sound and other regions of Alaska polluted by the spill five years ago. 
 The agreement affects roughly 3,500 people or about a quarter of the Alaskan residents and fishermen who are seeking billions of dollars from Exxon in a Federal trial here that began on May 2. The settlement must be approved by Judge H. Russel Holland, who is presiding over the trial in Federal District Court.
Even as the settlement was announced this morning, some 10,000 commercial fishermen, who are also plaintiffs, were awaiting a verdict in the second phase of the Federal trial, which involves allegations that the spill severely damaged herring and salmon catches in southeast Alaska. The jury of nine women and three men were in their 10th day of deliberations on assertions made by fishermen that the Valdez spill cost them $895 million in direct losses.
Still to come is the trial's third phase when the jury will consider punitive damages: Plaintiffs' lawyers in the case said they were seeking $15 billion. In June, the jury cleared the way for the punitive damage phase of the case when it decided that the spill had been caused by the reckless behavior of Exxon and the ship's captain, Joseph J. Hazelwood.
As part of the settlement announced today, lawyers from both sides agreed not to discuss it with reporters. But before the announcement, a representative from the plaintiffs' legal team said the settlement was intended, in part, to simplify and speed the grueling legal match taking place in Federal District Court here this summer. Had the settlement not been negotiated, both sides would have presented their cases in court and awaited a separate verdict. The process could have added at least a week to a trial that is already in its 13th week.
The extent of the bitterness and rivalry between the plaintiffs and Exxon was on display here in the trial's second phase, which began on June 21. Both sides presented an array of scientists, economists and other experts to argue either that the Exxon Valdez spill caused devastating biological and economic damage to fishing, Alaska's second largest industry, or that the oil spill was a temporary problem, the effects of which long ago vanished. Lawyers from both sides mocked each other in their opening and closing arguments, and often while questioning witnesses.
 
Delicacy or 'Spam'?
 Among the many contentious points argued before the jury were arcane details like whether Japanese consumers, who buy most of Alaska's salmon, consider the fish "filet mignon," as the plaintiffs' lawyers contend, or an "everyday sort of Spam of fish," as Patrick Lynch, Exxon's lawyer, said.
The issue is critical because the plaintiffs' lawyers asserted that the taint of the Valdez spill had caused consumers in Japan to stop buying Alaska salmon, while Exxon maintains that the drop off in Japanese salmon purchases was the result of the greater availability of lower-priced, farm-raised salmon from other regions.
Before the spill Japan purchased 80 percent of its salmon from Alaska. Today, roughly 56 percent of Japan's salmon comes from Alaskan waters. Saying that the Japanese consider salmon to be a premium product, if not a delicacy, and are thus not sensitive to its cost, the plaintiffs' experts argued that it was the spill that resulted in the collapse of the Japanese market. That, in turn, caused prices to collapse and was a significant factor in lowering the value of boats and permits. The result, they said, was economic hardship in fishing communities along the 1,500 miles of Alaska coastline soiled by the spill.
Exxon countered by presenting Yuko Kusakabe, an economist and expert in Japanese fish marketing from Seattle. Ms. Kusakabe testified that she conducted a survey in Japan of Japanese consumers and fish buyers in 1989 that was financed by Exxon. She said the survey showed that the spill did not strongly influence Japanese buying habits and that the price declines in Alaskan salmon had been caused by other factors, particularly competition from lower-priced farm-raised salmon from Washington state and Chile. Ms. Kusakabe said that Japanese buyers were sensitive to salmon prices and were substituting lower-priced salmon from other regions of the world, a clear signal that Japanese do not consider Alaskan salmon a delicacy.
Representatives from both sides said the verdict in this second phase, which is expected sometime this week, is likely to provide much clearer signals about the jury's intention in the third phase.
Should the jury decide on compensatory damages close to what is being sought by the plaintiffs' lawyers, it would be another indication that Exxon is failing to provide convincing witnesses and may be setting itself up for a huge punitive damage award. If, however, the jury decides on compensatory damages that are much lower than what the plaintiffs seek, then Exxon will move into the third phase more confident that punitive damages will not be as high as some corporate executives now fear.

HEADLINE: States Able To Stabilize Their Budgets

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
Aided by a resurgent economy, state legislatures across the country were able to stabilize their finances this year, with most avoiding tax increases and deep budget cuts, according to a national study of legislative budgets released yesterday.
The study, conducted annually by the National Conference of State Legislatures, found that Medicaid, the Federal-state health program for the poor, and state prison programs continued to command the largest increases in state budgets in the fiscal year that began this month. But the average increase in spending in those two categories has actually slowed, the conference found, leaving additional money available for other programs, like public schools. 
 Over all, it said, spending is expected to increase by 4.1 percent while revenues are expected to increase by about 4.2 percent as a result of an improved economy. And even though the states enacted tax increases totaling $3.8 billion over the next year, the conference said state taxpayers would end up paying $1.1 billion less over all because of shifts from local property taxes.
 
State Budget Constraints
 Unlike the Federal Government, which can spend more money than it takes in, most states are required by their respective constitutions to balance their books each year.
"Large industrial states in the Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes regions, as well as the southeastern and southwestern states, enjoyed the strongest economic performance in the fiscal year 1994," the study said.
"The healthy economy, particularly in these regions, allowed lawmakers the luxury of significant tax cuts for the first time since the mid-1980's," it said. It cited New Jersey's tax cut of $665 million as the largest of any state.
But steady increases in the cost of providing health care for the poor continued to haunt legislatures amid predictions that Medicaid alone could absorb a third of state spending by the end of the decade. Even the prospect of a national health plan did not appear to offer the states any fiscal relief, the report said, on the assumption that any plan would require them to pay as much as they do now.
 
Pressures on Schools
 Moreover, a wave of increases in the number of schoolchildren produced by baby boomers and in the number of immigrants in states like California and New York is expected to create new fiscal pressures on school systems throughout the country as they move to build new schools and hire more teachers.
"Right now, things are relatively quiet because there's enough water under us that you don't see the rocks below," said the director of the conference's fiscal program, Ronald K. Snell. "But as we move toward the rapids, things could get a lot worse."
Despite the expected problems, Mr. Snell said, "a surprising number of states cut spending and cut taxes." Besides the recent cuts urged by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, he cited cuts in corporate income taxes as a sign that the states had been persuaded to help propel the economic recovery.
 
Effect of Longer Sentences
 In a telephone interview from New Orleans, where the conference was holding its annual meeting, Mr. Snell said the average cost to build a prison cell was $25,000, with $18,000 to $25,000 a year required to maintain that cell when it is occupied. Because the states are under increasing pressure for sentences of life without parole, legislative officials predicted that the cost of prisons would soon present state governments with one of their biggest fiscal problems.
Mr. Snell said the increased cost of corrections would be nearly 8 percent next year, almost twice the rate of increase of overall state spending.
The study said steady increases in state Medicaid and prison spending had "squeezed out" other state programs, particularly those for higher education. But with the financial stability reflected in most new budgets, it said, there has been a shift toward increasing money for state colleges and universities.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST ACCORD;
Text of Washington Declaration Signed by Jordan and Israel

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
Following is the text of the Washington Declaration signed today by Israel and Jordan, signed by King Hussein of Jordan, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and President Clinton:
[A]
After generations of hostility, blood and tears and in the wake of years of pain and wars, His Majesty King Hussein and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin are determined to bring an end to bloodshed and sorrow. It is in this spirit that His Majesty King Hussein of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, Mr. Yitzhak Rabin of Israel, met in Washington today at the invitation of President William J. Clinton of the United States of America. The initiative of President William J. Clinton constitutes an historic landmark in the United States' untiring efforts in promoting peace and stability in the Middle East. The personal involvement of the president has made it possible to realize agreement on the content of this historic declaration. The signing of this declaration bears testimony to the president's vision and devotion to the cause of peace.
[B]
In their meeting, His Majesty King Hussein and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin have jointly reaffirmed the five underlying principles of their understanding on an Agreed Common Agenda designed to reach the goal of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace between the Arab States and the Palestinians, with Israel. 
 1. Jordan and Israel aim at the achievement of just, lasting and comprehensive peace between Israel and its neighbors and at the conclusion of a Treaty of Peace between both countries.
2. The two countries will vigorously continue their negotiations to arrive at a state of peace, based on Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 in all their aspects, and founded on freedom, equality and justice.
3. Israel respects the present special role of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in Muslim Holy shrines in Jerusalem. When negotiations on the permanent status will take place, Israel will give high priority to the Jordanian historic role in these shrines. In addition the two sides have agreed to act together to promote interfaith relations among the three monotheistic religions.
4. The two countries recognize their right and obligation to live in peace with each other as well as with all states within secure and recognized boundaries. The two states affirmed their respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every state in the area.
5. The two countries desire to develop good neighborly relations of co-operation between them to insure lasting security and to avoid threats and the use of force between them.
[C]
The long conflict between the two states is now coming to an end. In this spirit, the state of belligerency between Jordan and Israel has been terminated.
[D]
Following this declaration and in keeping with the Agreed Common Agenda both countries will refrain from actions or activities by either side that may adversely affect the security of the other or may prejudice the final outcome of negotiations. Neither side will threaten the other by use of force, weapons or any other means against each other and both sides will thwart threats to security resulting from all kinds of terrorism.
[E]
His Majesty King Hussein and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin took note of the progress made in the bilateral negotiations within the Jordan-Israel track last week on the steps decided to implement the sub-agendas on borders, territorial matters, security, water, energy, environment and the Jordan Rift Valley.
In this framework, mindful of items of the Agreed Common Agenda (borders and territorial matters) they noted that the boundary sub-commission has reached agreement in July 1994 in fulfillment of part of the role entrusted to it in the sub-agenda. They also noted that the sub-commission for water, environment and energy agreed to mutually recognize, as the role of their negotiations, the rightful allocations of the two sides in Jordan River and Yarmuk River waters and to fully respect and comply with the negotiated rightful allocations, in accordance with agreed acceptable principles with mutually acceptable quality.
Similarly, His Majesty King Hussein and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin expressed their deep satisfaction and pride in the work of the trilateral commission in its meeting held in Jordan on Wednesday, July 20, 1994, hosted by the Jordanian Prime Minister, Dr. Abdessalam al-Majali, and attended by Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. They voiced their pleasure at the association and commitment of the United States in this endeavor.
[F]
His Majesty King Hussein and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin believe that steps must be taken to both overcome psychological barriers and to break with the legacy of war. By working with optimism towards the dividends of peace for all the people in the region, Jordan and Israel are determined to shoulder their responsibilities towards the human dimension of peacemaking. The recognized imbalances and disparities are a root cause of extremism, which thrives on poverty and unemployment and the degradation of human dignity. In this spirit, His Majesty King Hussein and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin have today approved a series of steps to symbolize the new era which is now at hand:
1. Direct telephone links will be opened between Jordan and Israel.
2. The electricity grids of Jordan and Israel will be linked as part of a regional concept.
3. Two new border crossings will be opened between Jordan and Israel -- one at the southern tip of Aqaba-Eilat and the other at a mutually agreed point in the north.
4. In principle free access will be given to third country tourists traveling between Jordan and Israel.
5. Negotiations will be accelerated on opening an international air corridor between both countries.
6. The police forces of Jordan and Israel will cooperate in combating crime with emphasis on smuggling and particularly drug smuggling. The United States will be invited to participate in this joint endeavor.
7. Negotiations on economic matters will continue in order to prepare for future bilateral cooperation including the abolition of all economic boycotts.
All these steps are being implemented within the framework of regional infrastructural development plans and in conjunction with the Jordan-Israel bilaterals on boundaries, security, water and related issues and without prejudice to the final outcome of the negotiations on the items included in the Agreed Common Agenda between Jordan and Israel.
[G]
His Majesty King Hussein and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin have agreed to meet periodically or whenever they feel necessary to review the progress of the negotiations and express their firm intention to shepherd and direct the process in entirety.
H. In conclusion, His Majesty King Hussein and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin wish to express once again their profound thanks and appreciation to President William J. Clinton and his Administration for their untiring efforts in furthering the cause of peace, justice and prosperity for all the peoples of the region. They wish to thank the President personally for his warm welcome and hospitality. In recognition of their appreciation to the President, His Majesty King Hussein and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin have asked President William J. Clinton to sign this document as a witness and as a host to their meeting.

HEADLINE: U.N.'s Team in Iraq Sees Arms Gains

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 25

 BODY:
The flickering image of a boiler-like machine on a television screen at a United Nations office here indicates that the monitoring system imposed on Iraqi industry four years ago is achieving its aim of preventing President Saddam Hussein from building weapons of mass destruction.
But it also means that the oil embargo and other sanctions against Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait are closer to being lifted without having achieved their unstated aim -- in the eyes of the United States and some other countries -- of removing President Hussein from power as well. 
 A little green line, constantly expanding and contracting at the bottom of the television screen at the United Nations office, means the picture is being relayed live from a camera trained on an instrument known as a vacuum furnace on a factory floor somewhere in Iraq.
The television camera is part of a highly sophisticated industrial monitoring system, requiring 20 tons of sensors and other electronic equipment and hundreds of miles of wiring, which the United Nations is installing in 30 key plants. It is designed to guarantee that Iraq does not develop nuclear, chemical or biological weapons or long-range rockets.
 
New U.N. Center Being Built
 Meanwhile, the second floor of the United Nations office here is being ripped apart as a high-security control center is being built for an 80-member team that expects to be monitoring Iraqi industry for years.
A new 300-foot high red and white tower has just been completed to receive signals from all the remote control cameras and sensors installed in factories around the country. The same tower will transmit radio signals from the control center to inspectors in the field.
"This is the most sophisticated and intrusive industrial monitoring system ever devised," said Guy Martelle, an American engineer on the project, which he said he expects to be fully operational by September.
All this equipment, together with the regular checks United Nations inspectors will make on some 150 industrial sites that could be used for prohibited weapons development, represents a political turning point in Iraq's troubled relations with the United Nations Security Council.
As part of the terms for ending the Persian Gulf war in 1991, the Security Council created the United Nations Special Commission and ordered it to eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and insure that Baghdad never acquires them again. When this has been done to its satisfaction, the Council said, the embargo on Iraqi oil sales will end.
 
Cooperation Is Seen
 After first trying to hide his secret military programs and then obstructing the arms inspectors sent to ferret them out, Mr. Hussein now appears to be cooperating fully with the commission in the hope that the Security Council will lift the oil embargo early next year.
Earlier this month, when the Council last reviewed that embargo, Rolf Ekeus, the Swedish head of special commission said the first part of his task was almost complete.
Some documents relating to weapons programs are still missing. But Mr. Ekeus said he hoped to report "shortly that the full accounting of Iraq's programs which the Council required has been completed."
The Council still needs to adopt a resolution requiring companies selling equipment with military potential to Iraq to report such sales so the monitors can insure that it is not used in weapons development.
But after a probationary period to make sure the monitoring system works -- Mr. Ekeus suggested six months -- the commission now believes that it will be in a position to report that Iraq has complied fully with the Council's disarmament terms next March, indicating that the embargo should be lifted.
 
Iraq Said to Aid Monitoring
 All the evidence now suggests Iraq is determined to insure that the monitoring system works well.
In November Mr. Hussein formally agreed to it. In December Iraq decreed that tampering with the monitoring system was "a major crime." And Mr. Ekeus said in a recent interview that he believes that Mr. Hussein personally ordered full cooperation with the United Nations commission in May.
"Cooperation is excellent," said Jaako Ylitalo, the Finnish head of the United Nations team. "The Iraqis have created a special authority to work with us, and we have hundreds of them helping install the system."
But two major difficulties may still make the Security Council reluctant to lift economic sanctions.
The first is Iraq's continuing attitude toward Kuwait, which Iraq annexed and invaded in 1990. While Iraq's rubber-stamp Parliament officially annulled the 1990 annexation after the gulf war, the following year, the Government-controlled news media in Baghdad continue to refer to Kuwait as part of Iraq.
All Security Council members agree that Iraq should recognize Kuwait and accept the new United Nations-demarcated boundaries between the two countries before the sanctions against Baghdad are lifted.
The second difficulty is the attitude of the Clinton Administration, which seems to be following in the footsteps of its predecessor, arguing that Iraq cannot be trusted to behave so long as Mr. Hussein remains in power.
Referring to the United Nations Special Commission by its diplomatic shorthand, Anthony Lake, President Clinton's national security adviser, wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine in April: "There is plenty of evidence to suggest the only reason the Iraqi regime is beginning to cooperate with Unscom is to secure the lifting of oil sanctions. Once the oil starts flowing again, Washington must assume Saddam will renege on long-term monitoring and begin rebuilding his weapons of mass destruction program."
 
Sanctions Losing Support
 But an important group of Security Council members, led by France and Russia, both of which are eager to resume trading with Iraq and see it repay its $70 billion foreign debt, believe that sanctions should be ended if the industrial monitoring goes well and Iraq recognizes Kuwait.
The steady erosion of support for continuing sanctions has been apparent at the last three reviews, at which France, Russia, China, Brazil, Pakistan and Rwanda have all favored issuing a statement praising Iraq's behavior as an inducement to further cooperation. The United States and Britain blocked such a statement.
Meanwhile, smelling an end to the embargo, foreign businessmen are flocking to Baghdad these days to scout out deals. France's two big oil companies -- Total and Els -- have signed initial agreements to develop the southern oil fields of Majnnon and Nahr Omar once the sanctions end.
Trade delegations from Japan, Italy, Spain and Canada as well as other countries have all showed up here in the last few weeks, and Iraq this month signed an economic cooperation agreement with the Czech Republic, now a Security Council member, that also takes effect only after sanctions are lifted.

Italy Sees Smoother Sailing (Yachting's In Again)

 BODY:
There are some people around this town of provincial purposefulness, sparkling marinas and bustling boatyards who believe there is some link between the state of Italian yachting and that of the nation's soul.
Maybe it is because the country's postwar economic miracle went hand in hand with a boom in the building of big sleek boats, as the hobby of monarchs and tycoons slid down to the middle class. Maybe, too, it is because a major public tragedy played out in Italy last year seemed so inextricably intertwined with yachting. After all, was not the daring -- though ultimately unsuccessful -- effort of Raul Gardini's yacht, Il Moro di Venezia, to seize the America's Cup for Italy a metaphor for the kind of extravagances that ultimately bankrupted the big Montedison corporation of Mr. Gardini and led to his suicide, an incident that became an emblem of the corporate and political scandals that have racked the national spirit in recent years? 
 As the country and its leaders fell into a bout of soul-stirring introspection at the start of the decade, the Mercedes-Benzes with the license plates of Milan, Italy's corporate capital, became a less frequent sight around here. The yachts of 1980's prosperity took cover in safe havens up and down the Ligurian coast, a stretch of sinuous bays and inlets that is to Italian yachting what Milan's fashionable Via Montenapoleone is to shopping.
At the Sangermani yards here, which Italian newspapers like to call the Ferrari of Italian boating, Cesare Sangermani Jr., the owner, says he understands why the yachts went under cover.
"Yachts were looked upon as the greatest of luxury goods," Mr. Sangermani said, blaming one of the periodic binges of wealth-baiting for the industry's most recent malaise. "They saw someone out in a boat, they said, 'That guy's rich.' The next day the fiscal police showed up at his door, and of course everyone's got some skeleton in the closet. They destroyed the desire of people to sail."
These were unpleasant times for Italian sensibilities, but ultimately there were national elections and the installation of a new Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, a fabulously successful businessman and ardent boatsman. Yachting is back in fashion.
Recently, half the Cabinet and many of the leaders of Parliament -- like Defense Minister Cesare Previti aboard his two-masted Barbarossa, and the Senate Speaker, Carlo Scognamiglio, sailing Resolute Solomon -- entered a regatta at Portofino. Their appearance served nicely to reassure Italians, just a bit, that gradually things are returning to normal.
Now Mr. Sangermani begins to feel a fresher, stiffer breeze blowing. He finds encouragement in the government of yachtsmen, whose nautical images capture the new spirit. Luciano Merigliano, a legislator allied to Mr. Berlusconi, compared Italy recently in a Rome paper to an "abandoned galleon."
"We've all got to give a hand to right her," said Mr. Merigliano, an impassioned boatsman from youth, in a a kind of pep talk to the crew. "Then we can think about changes at the helm, to the sails, and the rest."
For Mario Giusfredi, the president of the National Association of Shipyards, Nautical and Related Industries, what better place to start than the yacht yards? "Three years of uninterrupted crisis have driven the sector into the ground," Mr. Giusfredi said.
A recent Government decree, not unlike one during the Reagan Administration, he said, eliminated the 39 percent luxury tax on some yachts and sailboats. But he said that more was needed to revive an industry that was so much a marker of the national spirit.
Mr. Sangermani's yard, for instance, which builds three or four yachts a year, launched only one boat in all 1993, focusing instead on restoring used yachts.
But some are not taking a chance that the revival of Italian market will sustain them. One of these is Antonio Ruggieri, down the coast at the Valdettaro Shipyard, on the edge of Portovenere. "We operate exclusively in the international market," he said, guiding a visitor across a shipyard that has its own helicopter pad.
When Princess Caroline of Monaco overhauled her motor yacht, Pacha III, built in 1936 for the Renault family of French auto barons, she flew in regularly to inspect progress. So did the Sultan of Oman, when his little navy's training vessel, the sleek three-masted Shabab Oman, was in drydock here.
Such is Valdettaro's renown that when a Florida-based foundation, the U.S.S. Williamsburg Corporation, needed someone for a $65 million restoration of Harry S. Truman's Presidential yacht, they brought it here.
Now, a Valdettaro construction division is building three immense yachting basins with hotels, golf links, boating berths and ship repair yards in the Caribbean and Mexico. In a sense, Mr. Ruggieri said, "we're creating our own future customers."
Later this month, the Prime Minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, the Caribbean island chain, is stopping by to pick up twin 105-foot sloops for charter cruises, at $5 million apiece, so entirely computerized, Mr. Ruggieri said, "they practically sail themselves."
