HEADLINE: Conservationists Write a Seafood Menu to Save Fish

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
As overfishing depletes the seas of prized species like cod, tuna and swordfish, conservation groups are urging consumers to make dining choices they say will help damaged ecosystems recover and support sustainable fisheries. Their lists recommend seafoods to eat and avoid.
"It's an environmental problem whose solution is in your hands every time you buy seafood," says the Monterey Bay Aquarium's seafood guide, which made its debut last month. "Make wise choices and you help assure healthy oceans for the future." 
 The aquarium, in Monterey, Calif., lists 11 species that it calls best choices, 14 that are potential problems and 15 that are better to avoid. Proposed for prohibition are such fish as cod, American lobster, monkfish, orange roughy, Chilean sea bass, shark, prawns, swordfish and bluefin tuna, all of whose populations are in decline or headed there.
In some cases, the proposed taboos are based on habitat destruction and risk, rather than population drops. For instance, the aquarium urges consumers to avoid farmed salmon because the ocean pens in which they live can pollute the water with feces and spread disease.
It adds that farmed salmon are usually Atlantic in origin -- even those raised in Pacific waters. Salmon that escape can cause problems for native populations, the aquarium says.
By contrast, the aquarium gives a thumbs up to wild Alaskan salmon. These fisheries, it says, are healthy, well-regulated and "the most environmentally sound choice."
A final criterion in the aquarium's rankings is the size of the fishery's bycatch -- unwanted creatures that are caught inadvertently and thrown back, usually dead. For instance, its guide lists albacore tuna as a potential problem because some methods of catching them kill dolphins, sea birds and tons of untargeted fish.
Similar campaigns have been mounted by the National Audubon Society and are planned by the Environmental Defense Fund. Experts say such efforts are starting to unnerve seafood companies.
"These guys are running scared," said Michael Sutton, head of the fisheries program at the Packard Foundation, based in Los Altos, Calif., which this year is spending $7 million to spur sustainable fisheries. "Their customers are beginning to become better informed. That's a real change. It's not just green consumers any more."
Seafood producers say they applaud the goal of sustainable fisheries but not necessarily the environmentalist tactics. In some cases, they suggest, the groups overstate the woes.
"They can do more harm than good," said Justin LeBlanc, head of government relations for the National Fisheries Institute, a trade association of the seafood industry based in Arlington, Va. "If you take away the marketplace, you remove the incentive for effective management and for fishermen to do the right thing."
A growing number of people prefer fish to red meat or chicken as a way to promote health and longevity. But worldwide, after centuries of steady growth, the total catch of wild fish peaked in 1989 and has since declined or plateaued for most species, prompting efforts to avoid population crashes and the possibility in some cases of extinction of stocks.
Despite remedial efforts and scattered improvements, the overfishing problem is generally seen as getting worse. By some estimates, more than two-thirds of all commercially important fish populations are now classified as "fully fished" or "over exploited."
Last month, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the federal agency that oversees the nation's commercial fishing fleets, issued an annual report to Congress that said 98 species were now overfished, up from 90 last year. Among the new additions are the Georgs Bank cod, the Bering Sea snow crab, the yellowtail flounder and the Gulf of Maine haddock.
"This report is significant because it provides the clearest picture of the precarious state of the nation's fisheries that we've seen to date," said Lee Crockett, executive director of the Marine Fish Conservation Network, which is based in Washington.
The effort to guide consumer choices made a surprisingly strong debut last year when the Natural Resources Defense Council and SeaWeb, a conservation project of the Pew Charitable Trusts, mounted a successful effort to "Give Swordfish a Break" because of population drops. The effort prompted many restaurants, including some top New York City establishments, to forgo the delicacy. Market prices for swordfish dropped.
The campaign irked commercial fishermen and some federal regulators, who said it ignored American efforts to rebuild fallen swordfish stocks. The problem, some regulators said, was foreign states that ignored quotas and fishing agreements.
After the swordfish effort, the push widened last year as the Living Oceans Program of the National Audubon Society, based in Islip, N.Y., published a guide to seafood that made recommendations among 21 species, later expanded to 34 species.
The ratings ranged from green to red -- from fine for dining (tilapia, striped bass, mahi-mahi) to better left uneaten (snapper, grouper, Atlantic halibut). "As you can imagine, not everybody in the red category was pleased with us," said Dr. Carl Safina, who heads the program.
The Living Oceans Program is now publishing the Audubon Seafood Lover's Almanac, a 96-page guide due out in January that expands on the advice. "Bluefish," the almanac says, "is one of the very few fish for which fishing controls were put in place before problems began." On the same page, it gives a bluefish recipe, Lady M's Marinade, laced with ginger, parsley, oregano and basil.
Officials at the Monterey Bay Aquarium say its own Seafood Watch program began in an effort to assess whether its restaurant and catered events were practicing what the organization preached.
"We started with our menu, things we serve here," said Sue Lisin, a Monterey research biologist who heads Seafood Watch. She added that the seafood recommendations, posted on the aquarium's Web site (www.montereybayaquarium.org), would change with fishery ups and downs.
For instance, Ms. Lisin said, snow crabs, now listed as a potential problem for sea-friendly consumers, may soon move into the avoid column since their Alaskan fishery is in decline. "It's looking very bad," she said.
The Environmental Defense Fund, based in New York City, is setting up a Web site tentatively called Seafood Scorecard, which will give consumer advice with a special emphasis on aquaculture, which globally now accounts for more than 25 percent of all seafood.
"There is a strong need and a big market for knowing what's environmentally sound," said Dr. Rebecca J. Goldburg, a senior scientist at the fund. "A lot of folks are interested."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "An Environmental Agenda at the Dinner Table"
With more and more people eating more and more fish, some fish populations are crashing. Now environmental groups are offering consumers advice about which commercial fisheries are in good shape, and which are struggling.
 
FISH: CHILEAN SEA BASS BASS
STATUS: Heavy unregulated fishing is wiping out this slow-growing deep ocean species
CONCERNS: As long as the illegal catch is 10 times as great as the amount legally allowed the future is dim.
 
FISH: SHARK
STATUS: Because sharks are slow-growing fish that produce relatively few offspring, intensive fishing has been devastating. Most species on the East Coast are depleted.
CONCERNS: Shark-fishing methods also endanger turtles and marine mammals.
 
FISH: SWORDFISH, MARLIN
STATUS: Atlantic species are depleted. Conditions in the Pacific are unknown
CONCERNS: Efforts to limit fishing are ineffective in the Atlantic, virtually nonexistent in the Pacific.
 
FISH: SHRIMP
STATUS: About half the shrimp sold today is farmed, but shrimp farms can pollute and destroy habitat. Shrimp are plentiful in some regions, depleted elsewhere.
CONCERNS: The number of unwanted fish caught while harvesting shrimp is so high that, on average, every pound of shrimp sold means seven pounds of non-shrimp killed.
 
FISH: ORANGE ROUGHY
STATUS: Native waters of Australia and New Zealand are depleted; since fish take many years to grow they will not rebound quickly.
CONCERNS: Nets used to catch these fish do significant damage to the ocean bottom.
 
FISH: GROUPER
STATUS: Fishing in spawning areas has seriously depleted many populations.
CONCERNS: Management in the southeastern United States is improving, but the catch is unregulated elsewhere.
 
FISH: ATLANTIC COD, HADDOCK, POLLOCK
STATUS: Decades of overfishing caused populations to crash, severely disrupting the fishing economies of Maritime Canada and New England.
CONCERNS: Nets dragged along the bottom damage the ocean floor, decreasing chances of recovery. But stocks are slowly rising in areas closed to fishing.
 
FISH: SCALLOPS
STATUS: Sea scallops are seriously overfished. Bay scallops are vulnerable to algae blooms and pollution.
CONCERNS: Dredging for scallops disrupts habitat and takes in many other species. (Some scallops are farmed indoors.)
 
FISH: SALMON
STATUS: Healthy in Alaska; wild salmon elsewhere are in serious difficulty.
CONCERNS: About half of salmon on the market is farmed, but farming pollutes, displaces wild fish and encourages the shooting of wild seals, which prey on farmed fish.
 
FISH: TUNA
STATUS: Most large bluefin tuna are sold to Japan for sushi; bluefins are severely overfished, other species are declining.
CONCERNS: Prospects in the Atlantic are poor; management in the Pacific is inadequate.
 
FISH: SNAPPERS
STATUS: Red snapper is depleted. Status of yellowtail snapper is unknown.
CONCERNS: Management is generally poor. Shrimpers kill billions of juveniles each year.
 
FISH: LOBSTER
STATUS: Because they grow slowly, lobsters are vulnerable to overfishing, which is widespread.
CONCERNS: Because most lobsters are caught in species-specific traps, lobster fishing does little damage to the environment.
 
FISH: HALIBUT
STATUS: Severely depleted in the Atlantic, but doing better in the Pacific.
CONCERNS: Habitats are well managed in the Pacific, especially off Alaska.
 
FISH: MAHI-MAHI
STATUS: This fish grows fast and reproduces readily, so it is widespread and abundant.
CONCERNS: So far, in the United States, most are caught by rod and reel; increasing use of longlines could increase the number of unwanted fish caught. unwanted bycatch.
 
FISH: BLUEFISH
STATUS: Overfished, but regulations are now in place to address the problem.
CONCERNS: There are few environmental worries from bluefishing, most of which is by rod and reel.
 
FISH: SQUID
STATUS: Because they mature quickly, squid are abundant worldwide.
CONCERNS: On the west coast, worries about overfishing are on the rise.
 
FISH: CRABS
STATUS: Varies. Good for Dungeness crabs, poor for Alaska king crabs.
CONCERNS: In many areas, crabs are affected by pollution.
 
FISH: STRIPED BASS
STATUS: On the East Coast, restrictions on fishing have brought an endangered species back from the brink.
CONCERNS: The fish was introduced to the West Coast in the 1800's, but suffers from habitat damage. (Sources: The Audubon Guide to Seafood, The Monterey Bay Aquarium)

HEADLINE: Too Easy on Emissions

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Gov. George E. Pataki's decision to impose tougher auto emissions standards is welcome news (front page, Nov. 7). But the public needs to understand that neither new state standards nor existing federal emissions regulations cover the dominant emission from fossil-fueled motor vehicles -- carbon dioxide, the leading cause of global climate change. 
 Only by burning less fuel will we reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Unfortunately, mandating higher fuel economy for vehicles has become a political impossibility in today's Congress. Meanwhile, the auto industry and consumers continue to drive the country's average fuel mileage down and carbon dioxide emissions up as they produce and embrace ever larger, less efficient vehicles like sport utilities.

HEADLINE: Acquisition Of 2 Banks To Proceed

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
A prolonged delay in HSBC Holdings $9.9 billion acquisition of the Republic New York Corporation and Safra Republic Holdings ended today after Edmond J. Safra, who founded both banks, agreed to accept $450 million less for his stakes.
HSBC had delayed completion of the acquisitions pending the outcome of an investigation by Japanese regulators into Republic's securities unit. The inquiry started in September. 
Officials from the United States and Japan say William H. Rogers, who was president of the futures unit of Republic New York Securities, aided his client, Martin A. Armstrong, founder and chairman of Princeton Economics International Ltd. and its Hong Kong brokerage subsidiary Cresvale International Ltd., in defrauding investors of more than $500 million.
The investigation is far from over, but HSBC's internal investigation has concluded that its liability for possible damages is manageable enough to proceed with the deal. Mr. Safra has also agreed to be personally liable for up to an additional $180 million in liability costs related to the investigation beyond an already agreed and undisclosed amount.
"I am taking this action because I believe that a swift completion of the transaction will be to the benefit of Republic's clients, shareholders and employees to whom my life's work has been devoted," Mr. Safra said.
While Mr. Safra will get about $57.41 a share for his stake in the two banks, Republic shareholders will still get $72 a share, under terms of HSBC's original offer in May. Under the new agreement, Mr. Safra, who was supposed to get a payout of $2.75 billion, will now get $2.3 billion.
Sir John R. H. Bond, group chairman of HSBC, said of today's arrangement: "I am pleased that, after a period of uncertainty, we have found a way forward."
Analysts praised the agreement, which will allow HSBC to increase its retail banking and private banking presence in the United States.
Shares of HSBC rose 7.5 pence, or about 1 percent, to 763 pence or $12.36 in London, while shares of Republic rose $4.4375, or 6.7 percent, to $70.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.
While investors and analysts seemed pleased that the acquisition would move forward, some analysts were still uneasy about the possible liabilities related to the fraud accusations.
"The deal with Safra is some indication of the level of losses," said James Johnson, an analyst for Credit Lyonnais in London. "I don't think the case is resolved at all."
Others dismissed the potential liabilities as simply a distraction. "All along the financial issue has not been the question," Mr. Coleman said. "It was really whether the bank's reputation had been damaged." Nonetheless, he said, "I suspect HSBC negotiated pretty hard."

HEADLINE: A Coming-Together of Foes To Assess Internet's Impact

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Over the weekend, Robert J. Herbold, the chief operating officer of Microsoft, and James L. Barksdale, the former president of Netscape Communications, appeared on television, radio and in newspapers, commenting from opposite sides of the Microsoft antitrust case.
But today, they are putting those differences aside to focus on a shared interest in high technology as board members of a new research organization, the Internet Policy Institute. The founders -- a diverse collection of corporate sponsors, Internet pioneers and political figures -- say their Washington-based nonprofit institute is intended to be a source of influential and independent research for policy makers. 
 "The Internet is surrounded by noise, hype and marketing, but there is little hard data on which policy makers can base critical decisions that will determine the future of the new medium and how it affects society," said Mr. Barksdale, co-chairman of the institute's board and now an independent investor.
The institute, its founders say, has ambitions to become a major research center -- a kind of "Brookings Institution for the Internet," according to Kimberly Jenkins, who functions as its president.
The research group is looking for offices in Washington and plans to grow quickly over the next couple of years to support 30 or so resident scholars and outside research projects, with an annual operating budget of $10 million. "We want to move fast because the next three to five years is the formative stage when so many of the key policy decisions will be made about the Internet," Ms. Jenkins said.
The institute plans to focus its research on assessing the Internet's impact in areas including the economy, privacy, security, government, society and innovation. Along with publishing its research and sponsoring conferences, it plans to hold briefings for the presidential candidates on Internet issues starting next March. It will also support international research projects.
The 19-member board is expected to make sure that the institute's work is noticed in both government and industry circles. Mr. Barksdale is an adviser to the Republican front-runner for president, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Other board members well connected politically include Ira Magaziner, a former senior policy adviser to the Clinton administration; the former House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, and Adam Clayton Powell III, vice president for technology programs of Freedom Forum.
Internet pioneers on the institute's board include Vinton G. Cerf, a senior vice president of MCI Worldcom, and Robert E. Kahn, who is president of the Corporation for National Research Initiatives. Its corporate representatives, besides Mr. Herbold of Microsoft, include George Vradenburg III, senior vice president for policy at America Online.
The board's diversity, the founders say, represents an effort to make sure that its work will not carry an ideological or political slant. "Unlike other organizations focused on the Net, this is not going to be an advocacy group or a trade association," said Esther Dyson, a board member and currently interim chairwoman of an Internet governing body for assigning online names and addresses. "The objective here is to do research without an agenda."
The first project the institute is sponsoring is a study of the impact of the Internet on the economy -- headed by Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, and Alice M. Rivlin, an economist and former Federal Reserve vice chairwoman, who is also at Brookings.
The yearlong project will try to assess the likely impact of Internet technology on productivity, prices and costs. The research, according to Mr. Litan, will look forward, trying to assess the Internet's effects as they are diffused across the economy.
"It won't be traditional economics and it won't be easy," Mr. Litan said. "But the potential policy implications would be to help assess the appropriate speed limits on monetary policy in the future and to assess just how new the so-called new economy really is."

HEADLINE: Indonesia's Students Pledge To Press Democratic Agenda

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia

 BODY:
"Welcome, Gus," read a big white banner the other day, using a nickname for Indonesia's new president. "We are the students and we will be your opposition."
Motorists slowed down to avoid the small, lively crowd and sighed in weariness. More student demonstrations. Hadn't they already gotten what they wanted? 
 Yes and no. As the country has learned over the last two years, there is no compromising with the students' moral agenda. And there is no denying their influence. Indonesia would not be where it is today without the students: free of a dictator, under a government duly elected by a national assembly and moving forward with democratic reforms.
It was their relentless rallies that kept alive the struggle early last year against President Suharto, when he had almost managed to quash his opposition.
It was their exhausting enthusiasm in the months following Mr. Suharto's resignation in May 1998 -- their often daily protests, their hair-trigger moral indignation, their deaths at the hands of the military -- that assured that democratic reforms would not founder in inertia.
Now, after the election on Oct. 20 of President Abdurrahman Wahid -- also known as Gus Dur -- the student movement is redefining itself as his political opposition. They will do what they do best: keep the heat on.
"A new president is not a new era," said Bachtiar Firdaus, 23, an engineering student. "Transition to democracy is a long journey, so we must watch what the government does. So we declare that the student movement has changed from a reform movement to an opposition movement, from an agent of change to a director of change."
Daniel S. Lev, a professor of political science at the University of Washington, said: "Those students out there have made a big difference. If you want to talk about democracy, it's right there on the streets. Those students from the beginning have been the ones who kept their minds most on national interests."
Their basic agenda stays the same: the withdrawal of the military from politics, the supremacy of law, clean government and an investigation of corruption by Mr. Suharto.
Students have been a moral force with potential political influence throughout Indonesia's history, and they have their own lore and their own notable generations, somewhat like the graduating classes of military academies.
Mr. Firdaus said they were now acting on the lessons learned in the 1960's, when a student movement that had helped Mr. Suharto come to power allowed itself to be co-opted and neutralized, only to see him become more and more repressive.
Perhaps abashed by their own passivity, members of Indonesia's middle class have allowed their children to lead them. When the protests became dangerous, professional groups sometimes supported the students with food and money. Some professors urged their students to cut class and save the nation.
But few people joined them on the front lines. Indonesia's protests have been notable for the absence of labor unions, professionals or religious or political leaders.
Megawati Sukarnoputri, the figurehead of opposition to Mr. Suharto and his successor, B. J. Habibie, shunned the protests. More than once, she refused requests to step in when demonstrators were being killed in her name.
On the day of her inauguration as vice president on Oct. 21, though, she thanked them. Their noisy protests during the electoral assembly, and the threat of widespread unrest if she lost, had been one of the strongest planks of her campaign.
Now that the tide has turned and the students' democratic agenda dominates, even the military feels compelled to offer them a bow.
The country's most prominent military figure, Gen. Wiranto, the former armed forces chief of staff, has called the students heroes and offered condolences for those who had died in clashes with his men.
The "Welcome, Gus" demonstration was tiny by the standards Jakarta has come to know, perhaps 50 people in all. The demonstrators raised their fists as they read a list of demands: Public figures must disclose their wealth; unqualified ministers must be fired; military officers must withdraw from government positions; the political, economic, social, cultural and educational systems must be improved.
Then, with eight police officers following in a small van, the students marched down a familiar protest route near the house where Mr. Suharto lives.
Many of them have spent far more time over the last two years in political teach-ins than at their studies, and they explain their role with the confidence of youth.
"All the political parties want to be part of the government and no one wants to be in the opposition," said one of the small group's leaders, Goenawan, 22, an engineering student. "That is not a good way to be a democratic country. We want to make a democratic system that will be balanced. The students can do that. We are a moral and intellectual movement. We have no ambition to be in government."
Muhammad Firman, a law student who is a leader of a militant group called City Forum, said its platform is governed by "what most of the people want."
"That is pure democracy, am I right?" he said. "We don't have our own interests. We don't bargain."
But as they have shown, they do have bargaining power.
And he warned: "If the government starts to forget what the people want, we will start the demonstrations, we will go down the street again. We don't care who is in the government; we don't care. If you want to do your job and be credible in people's eyes, just listen to us."

HEADLINE: A Minimum Wage Bill for the Well Off

 BODY:
The Senate will vote today on a Republican-sponsored amendment to raise the minimum wage by $1, to $6.15 an hour, over three years. Though the Democrats propose the same hike spread over only two years, the basic proposal is uncontroversial. Both parties recognize the popularity and wisdom of raising wages of low-paid workers when unemployment rates are at their lowest levels in 30 years and workers, therefore, face no threat of mass layoffs.
Sadly, the Republicans are not content to do this good deed and go home. They have loaded the amendment with tax cuts that are fiscally damaging and cynically focused on wealthy workers. 
 The Republican package would cost about $75 billion over 10 years. Pointing to a $1 trillion surplus outside Social Security, the Republicans say their tax cuts are affordable. But that expected surplus assumes that Congress will live with current budget caps and cut domestic discretionary spending -- every program other than the military and entitlements like Medicare -- by at least 10 percent after accounting for inflation. Passing a $75 billion tax cut would force further cuts in programs that will soon be squeezed anyway.
Almost all the Republican tax cuts go to the wealthy. The proposal would, for example, raise the amount of salary on which pension contributions may be made to $200,000 from $160,000. Worse still, Peter Orszag, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, points out that the Republicans have structured their plan in a way that could encourage companies to reduce contributions they make to the pensions of low-paid workers.
The Republican plan would also provide a new tax deduction for health care premiums paid by workers whose employers cover no more than half the cost. The tax deduction would be most valuable to high-wage workers and would do little to make health coverage affordable for the vast majority of the 40 million Americans who are uninsured.
Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal research group, estimates that the highest-earning 1 percent of taxpayers would get almost 20 percent of the proposal's tax cuts, averaging about $1,600 a year. But the lowest-earning 20 percent would get only about 3 percent of the tax cut, averaging about $13 a year. That feature alone makes it a plan that President Clinton should veto. Next year, politicians preparing for election will almost certainly send him a bill to raise the minimum wage -- without attaching pernicious tax cuts.

HEADLINE: ON THE RECORD: Governor Bush and the Environment;
Bush Approach to Pollution: Preference for Self-Policing

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
Early this summer, with political pressure mounting to address his state's severe air pollution problems, Gov. George W. Bush signed a law he regards as the gold star of his green resume: A program to regulate outdated industrial plants that are among the heaviest polluters in Texas.
For Mr. Bush, who began his career in the oil fields of West Texas, the program meant confronting the oil, gas and chemical industries that are among his most generous contributors. With the law, Mr. Bush now boasts that he is the first Texas governor "to ever have brought industry together and said, 'Get into compliance.' " 
 What he actually did was a little different, and it offers insight into Mr. Bush's operating style on environmental issues, a style widely praised by business but heavily criticized by environmental groups.
Although state regulators had been considering mandatory restrictions on polluters, state documents indicate that Mr. Bush thought the approach should be voluntary and essentially asked industry leaders to draft such a proposal, which they did in private meetings with state officials two years ago. No environmental groups or other public interest groups were invited, and they only learned about the meetings early this year.
In any assessment of Mr. Bush's environmental record, the unmistakable subtext is the governor's relationship with business and industrial leaders. As an advocate of limited government, Mr. Bush believes that lawsuits and regulations are not the best way to achieve clean air and water. Instead, his aides say, Mr. Bush has pursued a cooperative approach that emphasizes voluntary solutions instead of government mandates.
But with Mr. Bush leading the Republican presidential race, environmentalists are criticizing his closeness to the industries regulated by his administration in Texas. Campaign records indicate that the companies that helped draft the new pollution law have since donated nearly $1 million to Mr. Bush's presidential campaign.
In addition, environmentalists say the law, which allows companies to comply voluntarily with state permit requirements, is weak and riddled with loopholes. They say other laws and policy changes during Mr. Bush's tenure have had the accumulated effect of weakening state oversight of industry.
"It's an environmental policy being run by business and industry and their friends in the regulatory agency," said Ken Kramer, director of the Lone Star chapter of the Sierra Club. "That means there will be very little scrutiny."
Unlike his father, former President George Bush, who declared himself "the environmental president," the younger Mr. Bush has not emphasized environmental issues since he became governor in 1995, despite the fact that Texas ranks as one of the most polluted states in the country.
In his presidential campaign, the governor has yet to articulate an environmental policy, as he has on issues like education and health.
His critics say the environment hardly registers on Mr. Bush's political radar; his admirers say Mr. Bush is not hostile to the environment but merely reflects the conservative politics of Texas.
"Texas is not California," said Andrew Sansom, the executive director of the Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife. "There's no groundswell of support for environmental issues."
Even many Democrats say there are limits to what can be accomplished in Texas. The biggest environmental victory this year came when the Legislature passed a deregulation bill that required outdated utilities to cut pollution. The author of the bill, State Representative Steven Wolens, a Democrat from Dallas, praises Mr. Bush for endorsing it.
By comparison, Mr. Wolens characterized the voluntary law championed by Mr. Bush as "a lot of sweet talk with no teeth in it." Still, he said, "it's better than having no bill."
 
The Problem
Air Quality Problems All Across Texas
Many people, including federal regulators, say Texas can no longer afford any apathy toward its environment. The problems of automobile exhaust and industrial pollution have created severe air quality problems.
Overall, nearly half of the state's 19 million people live in areas that have failed to meet federal standards for ozone, which is linked to lung damage and is a primary ingredient in smog.
This year, the state's largest city, Houston, was expected to pass Los Angeles as the nation's smog leader. And the state's second-largest metropolitan area, Dallas-Fort Worth, has been downgraded by the United States Environmental Protection Agency from "moderate" to "serious" for its high levels of ozone. In March, the state failed to meet a deadline to submit a complete plan to the E.P.A. detailing how Dallas-Fort Worth would reduce ozone levels. Two months later, the E.P.A. threatened to suspend federal highway money if a plan was not developed by next year.
Pollution is not new to Texas, a heavily industrial state, which might explain why most Texans do not seem to blame Mr. Bush for the air problems. The governor has even boasted that air quality had improved during his tenure. "You've got to ask the question, 'Is the air cleaner since I became governor?' " Mr. Bush said in the spring. "And the answer is yes."
Such blanket statements are not easily proved, particularly since pollution can be measured in different ways. Compared with two decades ago, when industry operated with fewer restrictions, air quality has generally improved in Texas. Hundreds of pollutants like benzene, ammonia and chlorine were once the primary measuring stick for air quality. Linked to cancer as well as neurological and developmental problems, these toxic pollutants have declined in Texas since the late 1980's, though the state still leads the nation in such toxic emissions.
Environmentalists, however, attribute the reductions to federal initiatives and laws passed under Mr. Bush's predecessor as governor, Ann Richards, a point that Mr. Bush's aides do not dispute. Aides point out that Texas leads the nation in the reduction of toxic pollutants; however, environmentalists say that is misleading.
An analysis shows that reduction rates were higher under Ms. Richards, whose administration received mixed reviews from environmental groups.
Today, attention is focused on ozone pollution, which is formed from nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compounds that are emitted by gasoline stations, automobiles and smokestacks. In recent months, the severe ozone problems in Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth have led to increased criticism of Mr. Bush and his appointees by newspaper editorial writers as well as environmentalists.
Without question, Texas has endured one of the worst ozone summers on record. So far this year, the state has registered the 24 worst smog readings in the country, including a reading in Houston on Oct. 7 that registered at twice the maximum level allowed by national health standards.
 
The Meetings
Industry Gathers To Draft Legislation
For nearly three decades, the problem of air pollution in Texas attracted limited attention. The state passed a Clean Air Act in 1971, but the law did not require existing industries to obtain permits. Eventually, the law's supporters reasoned, these "grand-fathered" industries would become obsolete and shut down.
But by late 1996, as the E.P.A. pressured state and local officials to clean up the air, state officials began to realize that more than a third of Texas's industrial air pollution was coming from outdated smokestacks operating without permits. Overall, almost half of the state's 1,648 industrial plants enjoyed some sort of exemption.
In December 1996, Ralph Marquez, Mr. Bush's first appointee to the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission, met with industry representatives. Minutes of the meetings indicate that state officials were considering a plan to force the outdated plants to upgrade pollution equipment and reduce emissions.
On Jan. 14, 1997, however, John Howard, the governor's environmental policy director, wrote a memo to Mr. Bush. "Industry has expressed concern that the T.N.R.C.C. is moving too quickly and may rashly seek legislation this session," he wrote.
Instead, Mr. Howard recommended that the governor support a proposal to create a public task force that would prepare a voluntary plan that could be presented in the 1999 Legislature. This idea became a reality on Sept. 10, 1997, when Mr. Bush announced the Clean Air Responsibility Enterprise Committee, which included business leaders and environmentalists.
But eight months before the public committee was formed, industry executives, state regulators and on some occasions, Mr. Howard, had already begun holding a series of private meetings. In fact, on June 19, 1997, Ansel L. Condray, the president of Exxon, and Victor G. Beghini, the president of Marathon Oil, presented a proposal to petrochemical executives. Their plan did not require companies to meet state pollution standards, but instead made the program voluntary, allowing a grace period for companies that choose to take part.
In a memorandum circulated at the meeting, the two executives noted that Mr. Bush had asked them to draft a proposal. Aides to Mr. Bush say the meetings were nothing more than "preliminary fact-finding" that is common in developing legislation. But at least one participant on June 19 found the meeting unusual.
"It was a very strange meeting to me in that the approach of the presenters was pretty much like, 'This is the way it's going to be -- do you want to get on board or not?' " one of the participants, Jim E. Kennedy, an engineer with the DuPont Company, wrote in an e-mail message the next day to other chemical industry executives.
"Clearly, the 'insiders' from oil and gas believe that the governor's office will 'persuade' the T.N.R.C.C. to accept whatever program is developed between the industry group and the governor's office," Mr. Kennedy added. He concluded: "The concept paper has no 'meat' with respect to actual emissions reductions. One of the leaders actually stated that emissions reductions was not a primary driver for the program."
The Kennedy e-mail message was included in documents that became public early this summer after an Austin-based environmentalist, Peter Altman, filed an open records request.
"Nobody in the environmental community knew these meetings were going on to shape policy, and no one was invited to participate," said Mr. Altman, executive director of Sustainable Energy & Economic Development Coalition.
The law was passed this year by the Legislature, and though it did undergo some changes, it resembles the proposal pitched by industry in the private meetings. Environmentalists tried, but largely failed, to strengthen the law.
State officials say the law will allow them to regulate companies that had operated for decades without pollution permits. But Mr. Altman and other environmentalists complain that the law is weak, does not establish goals for reducing emissions and will not significantly cut pollution.
E.P.A. officials confirmed that reductions in the law will not allow the state to meet federal ozone standards.
Robin Schneider, executive director of Public Research Works, a nonprofit, environmental research and education organization, said the companies that attended the meetings were among Mr. Bush's most reliable and generous contributors. Analyzing Mr. Bush's presidential campaign contributions between March and June, Ms. Schneider traced at least $973,000 to employees or family members of the companies attending the meetings, or to lawyers and lobbyists that represent the companies.
The same analysis showed that Mr. Beghini, who retired last month as Marathon Oil president, gave the maximum $1,000 contribution, as did his wife. At least nine of Mr. Bush's "pioneers" -- people who have pledged to raise at least $100,000 for his campaign -- are connected to the companies.
"We think business executives know to invest in the Bush campaign for pollution friendly policies," Ms. Schneider said. "They're hoping he will be making air pollution policies at the national level."
Mr. Marquez, however, said environmentalists wrongly believed that government must have an adversarial relationship with industry. "Texas has always worked with the regulated community in coming up with solutions," said Mr. Marquez, who attended several of the 1997 meetings.
Scott McClellan, a Bush campaign spokesman, said the governor did not make decisions based on campaign contributions but on "what is best for Texas." He also said that Mr. Kennedy's characterization of the June 19 meeting "was not accurate." Mr. Kennedy could not be reached for comment. Exxon officials declined to comment, but a Marathon Oil spokesman said his company frequently met with state and local officials to discuss policy.
For his part, Mr. Bush considers the law a significant accomplishment.
"I'm the person who initiated the discussions, I'm the person who asked industry to get into compliance, and they did," Mr. Bush said. No other Texas governor, he noted, had addressed the issue.
 
The Agenda
Government Working With Business
In an interview last month, Mr. Bush said the best way to achieve clean air and water was "to work with local jurisdictions using market-based solutions and not try to sue our way or regulate our way to clean air and clean water."
In outlining Mr. Bush's environmental beliefs, his aides say he has tried to balance the needs of industry with the need for clean air and water.
While campaigning for president, Mr. Bush has taken a few environmental positions, notably his opposition to an agreement signed in Kyoto, Japan, that establishes emission targets for industrial nations. In the past he has criticized federal regulation, particularly when he regards it as too intrusive; in his 1994 campaign for governor, he lashed out against the Endangered Species Act as overly intrusive on landowners.
Environmentalists say Mr. Bush has eroded environmental protections since becoming governor in 1995. During the 1995 legislative session, Mr. Bush and lawmakers overturned a law signed by Ms. Richard that required vehicles to undergo emissions tests.
In 1995, Mr. Bush signed a law that allows companies to audit themselves for environmental violations. If a company found any violations, the law allowed it to report the violations without fear of fine or penalty as long as the company presented a cleanup plan. Nor would the violation be made public.
"From our experience," Mr. Marquez said, "things we are seeing reported are things our inspectors might never have found."
Critics described the law as a "stay out of jail" card for polluters. Ms. Schneider of Public Research Works noted that the same industry groups who supported the law also contributed more than $4 million to Mr. Bush's gubernatorial campaigns.
Nelly Rocha, special counsel to the E.P.A.'s regional administrator in Dallas, called the audit privilege law in Texas one of the most generous to industry of its kind. When the E.P.A. protested to Texas officials, the law was amended in 1997 to, among other things, remove the criminal immunity.
But Ms. Rocha said the law still "is probably one of the most liberal laws in our viewpoint." Mr. Rocha said federal regulators oppose all state laws that provide privilege immunity to polluting companies. State officials say that 1,057 companies have conducted self-audits since the law went into effect and 260 of them disclosed some type of violation.
In 1995, Mr. Bush also reshaped the three-member state environmental regulatory commission by first appointing Mr. Marquez, a former employee of Monsanto Chemical. Currently, all three commissioners have industry connections.
The state commission, in turn, has established what environmentalists consider to be a business-friendly tone. For years, Texas has boasted a statute that allows citizens to challenge pollution permits through a process much like a court trial. Such hearings are rare, but citizen groups have used the procedure to stop unwanted projects. Most recently, a planned nuclear waste dump in West Texas was blocked, in part, because of opposition from a hearing. The new commission, however, has reduced the number of hearings to 8 in 1998 from 25 in 1996, statistics show; in 4 cases, state courts have overturned the commission's refusal to hold a hearing.
The same commission approved a policy change that forbade surprise inspections of industries. The commission eventually backed down after heavy criticism, though surprise inspections are still considered rare.
"We've cut out public oversight and public participation, and we're adding greater pollution to our water and our land," said Richard W. Lowerre, an Austin environmental lawyer.
There is no doubt that environmental issues will nag at Texas as Mr. Bush campaigns for president. State and local officials are preparing an ozone reduction plan for Dallas-Fort Worth.
In Houston, where the planning is further along, the city is facing potentially draconian changes: huge cuts in industrial pollution, a suspension of heavy construction projects during morning hours and more stringent emissions testing for automobiles.
Last week, as rush hour commuters in Houston drove along a clogged street, a small band of protesters waved placards: "We finally beat L.A.," one sign read. "Houston No. 1 in air pollution."

HEADLINE: Clinton Sends Envoys to Try to Close a Deal on Opening Chinese Markets to the U.S.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
After a long telephone call with President Jiang Zemin of China on Saturday night, President Clinton sent his trade representative and his top economic adviser to Beijing today. They will try to close a deal to bring China into the World Trade Organization in return for a broad opening of its markets to American-made goods.
Mr. Clinton's speed in sending them suggests that the Administration now believes that an agreement may be within reach. 
 It would be one of the most important American accords with China since the resumption of diplomatic relations two decades ago. It would also give Mr. Clinton a long-sought foreign policy accomplishment: a claim to have helped integrate the world's most populous country into the global economy, putting it under the rule of international law with an accord that could also spur China's faltering economic reforms.
Today, the White House would not publicly discuss Mr. Clinton's conversation with Mr. Jiang, and on Sunday White House officials even denied that it had taken place. Mr. Clinton has insisted on a veil of secrecy around the delicate talks.
But one official close to the negotiations, insisting on anonymity, said Mr. Clinton and other top officials had had a hard time evaluating Mr. Jiang's intentions during the conversation on Saturday.
While the Chinese leader agreed to receive Mr. Clinton's delegation, it is unclear whether he is ready to overcome the political opposition in China to opening the country's markets -- including allowing American companies to invest heavily in telecommunications, finance and other Chinese industries.
"Things didn't sound as positive as we would like," the official said. "It was kind of right down the middle, and so we decided that there was very little to lose in trying" to go and strike the deal. Another official said: "There seemed to have been enough there to make it worth the effort. But the fact is they don't know exactly what they are headed into."
In a previous telephone conversation with Mr. Jiang, on Oct. 16, Mr. Clinton offered to put together a "bottom line" offer, a description of what China must do to get into the trade group.
Presumably that includes resolving existing disagreements on telecommunications, financial services, textiles and Washington's rights to impose sanctions unilaterally if it believes that China is dumping its exports in the United States.
The last point is a critical one for Vice President Al Gore, who has been under tremendous pressure from American labor unions -- which have opposed a trade deal with China -- not to give up the right to slap punitive tariffs on low-cost Chinese steel, textiles and other products.
The enormously complex agreement would entail hundreds of pages of trade concessions by China. Mr. Clinton's team does not have much time to negotiate before the world's trade ministers gather in Seattle at the end of this month.
That meeting gives Mr. Clinton some leverage, because if it is clear that China is about to join the trade organization, Beijing will be able to play a role in setting the agenda for the next global round of trade negotiations.
But Mr. Clinton is under pressure too. The organization's legitimacy is reduced if one of the world's biggest trading nations is not included.
Mr. Clinton is clearly sensitive about the criticism that he missed a huge diplomatic moment with China in April, when Pime Minister Zhu Rongji arrived in Washington with an offer to open China's markets that impressed American business executives with its breadth and depth.
Mr. Clinton's own advisers have said he was focused on other things at the time, notably the war over Kosovo, and feared that Congress would reject China's proposal.
The President commented on that decision for the first time last week. "A lot of people have said we had an agreement in April and that we walked away from it because there was opposition from the American labor movement," he said. "I've read that a hundred times. That is absolutely not true."
Today Mr. Clinton said little about his weekend decision to send Charlene Barshefsky, his trade representative, and Gene Sperling, who heads the National Economic Council and would ordinarily have spent the week in last-minute budget negotiations with Congress.
Asked to rate the chances of striking a deal, the President said: "I don't know, but I hope so. Ambassador Barshefsky and Mr. Sperling have gone over there to work on it, and we're doing our best."
Sending along Mr. Sperling may send two different political messages simultaneously, one to the Chinese and another to labor and other American opponents of the deal.
Chinese officials clearly seem to feel mistreated by the White House's handling of Prime Minister Zhu's visit in April, and they know that Mr. Sperling, along with Robert E. Rubin, who was then the Treasury Secretary, thought the deal could not be sold to Congress.
Mr. Sperling was among those who advised Mr. Clinton to walk away from the deal in April. His appearance alongside Ms. Barshefsky -- who urged Mr. Clinton to accept the deal with some amendments -- is a sign that she and the White House are now on the same wavelength.
More important, Mr. Sperling is more attuned to the mood of Congress and labor. "The thinking is that Gene's more inclined to protect Clinton and Gore politically," one of his associates said today.

HEADLINE: First Seat on School Bus Proves Hardest to Fill

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: DENVER, Nov. 5

 BODY:
A national shortage of school bus drivers, caused by the roaring economy and a rise in the school-age population, is making students wait up to an hour for a ride, delaying and canceling field trips and athletic events, and forcing mechanics, transportation supervisors and even some teachers to get behind the wheel.
School districts and private bus companies are responding to the shortage with ambitious recruiting initiatives, offering $1,000 signing bonuses, higher wages, longer hours, child care and other benefits, plus cash prizes for referrals and good attendance. They are seeking drivers through television and radio advertisements as well as through job fairs and, in some areas, door-to-door canvasses. 
 Industry experts, who attribute the shortage mainly to record low unemployment levels, are worried that the pool of potential drivers has largely disappeared as fewer people pursue part-time work, particularly the kind that involves discipline of and responsibility for children.
And parents are concerned that the shortage is compromising safety, though it is difficult to tell, because there are no statistics on nonfatal accidents and other school bus problems.
Richard Fischer, a school bus consultant based in Peyton, Colo., put the national driver shortfall at 20 percent. In recent surveys by School Bus Fleet, a trade magazine published in Torrance, Calif., more than 70 percent of the nation's school districts said they were struggling to fill drivers' seats, with officials in 44 states citing the shortage as a problem, and 17 of them calling it severe.
"It's a huge problem that no one seems to have an answer for right now," said Michael Martin, executive director of the National Association for Pupil Transportation, whose annual convention here this week was dominated by discussion of the dearth of drivers. "It's not a problem that's getting better, it's a problem that's getting worse."
Schools throughout the country have stretched starting times further apart so that buses can deliver elementary school pupils, loop around to pick up middle school students and then make a third run for high schoolers. Athletes on Long Island and in Florida have forfeited games because they had no way to get there. In Hartford, dozens of students missed breakfast at school and morning classes in September because buses arrived as late as 10 a.m. The student ski club in Aurora, Colo., now has to charter buses to the slopes, and in Caledonia, Mich., field trips must be squeezed in between picking up and dropping off students.
A bus company in New Hampshire is offering to pay for drivers' college tuition, and one in New Jersey is posting fliers on golf courses, suggesting that players drive the morning route, hit the links, then return for the afternoon run. Laidlaw Transit, based in Burlington, Ontario, the largest private contractor in the business with 35,000 buses in 35 states, has hired full-time recruiters and has begun offering a 401(k) plan for the first time in many areas.
In Basalt, Colo., an old mining town near Aspen that has become a bedroom community for service workers at nearby resorts, a driver was straddling two routes, delivering some children to school an hour early and making others wait an hour after classes for their ride home. Then last month, Ronald Goth, who teaches first- through fourth-graders, agreed to take on a second job.
Like several of his colleagues, Mr. Goth had obtained a commercial driver's license so that he could take students on field trips without having to hire a bus. While reluctant at first to give up his early morning lesson preparation time, Mr. Goth said that picking up and dropping off 65 students at a trailer park each day helped broaden his understanding of his students' lives, and had padded his income to help with expenses for his 9-month-old daughter, Annie.
Of Basalt's nine drivers, six are teachers, and signs posted in the elementary school sound the bell for more.
"She doesn't like to wake up," Mr. Goth, 32, said as he turned the key of his hulking bus in the chill mountain air just after sunrise on Thursday. "None of us do."
Kicking tires and checking hoses is not exactly what Mr. Goth expected when he chose a career in education. And while he enjoys the serenity of cruising alongside the Roaring Fork River, surrounded by white-blanketed mountain peaks, his responsibility on the road is, in some ways, more daunting than the challenges of the classroom.
"If somebody has trouble reading, I can work with a child over and over until the child gets it," Mr. Goth said. "If I injure a child with this bus, it's something I can never get over."
School bus accidents -- like the one last month in Albany that has prompted a $10 million lawsuit against the bus company and its 79-year-old driver, or the one last week in Odessa, Fla., in which a 10-year-old boy was dropped at the wrong stop, four miles from home, and than was struck by a car and killed -- routinely make headlines. But statistically, the big yellow bus is among the safest ways to travel.
About 24 million children, half the nation's students, ride 418,000 school buses 4.5 billion miles a year in the United States. From 1988 to 1998, school buses were involved in just three-tenths of 1 percent of the nation's 416,000 fatal traffic accidents, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says. There have been an average of 128 fatalities per year in school bus accidents, though only 10 percent of those victims were riding on the buses.
"It's safer to be in a yellow school bus going to school than to walk or to have your mother drive you," said a spokesman for the traffic safety agency, Tim Hurd. "There are special mirrors and lights and regulations that make it the safest way to get from point A to point B."
But neither the federal government nor the school transportation industry tracks nonfatal crashes or other incidents, like students being dropped at the wrong place or abandoned in the back of the bus.
Throughout the New York region, there have been notable incidents of children being abandoned on buses, drivers stopping on railroad tracks and buses showing up late or not at all. A Westchester County grand jury recommended two weeks ago that a trained monitor ride every bus in New York State and escort children off at each stop, and that vehicles have alarms to make sure riders are not left behind.
At the convention here, vendors were hawking devices that survey seats for passengers before drivers leave the bus, suggesting a growing concern.
Industry leaders insisted that the driver shortage is not causing them to cut corners on qualifications and training, but they acknowledged that scrambling for substitutes could lead to safety problems.
"Substitute drivers don't know the routes, don't know the children, can't control the kids," said Steve Hirano, editor of School Bus Fleet. "That's when a lot of accidents happen."
Tracy Sutherland, director of transportation for the Academy School District in Colorado Springs, took her cellular phone along when she drove a route recently because she knew a driver would need her counsel on dealing with a parent.
"The phone rang, I said to the kids, 'I need to pull over to do my other job,' " Ms. Sutherland said.
Managers in most school districts have patched together solutions to cover the shortfall in the short term, but they are worried about the future, especially in light of the growing student population.
In the last decade, requirements for drivers have gotten more rigorous. Federal law now mandates drug and alcohol testing, and most states conduct criminal background checks and physical exams. All this for a job that pays as little as $8 an hour (in large cities like Boston and San Francisco, it can be $16 to $18), often for just four hours a day, starting before most people are awake.
Turnover is high, and many school districts complain that they train applicants only to lose them to more lucrative jobs in trucking once they obtain their commercial licenses.
Robert C. Page, who is president of the national pupil transportation group and director of transportation for the schools in Lawrence, N.Y., on the southern shore of western Long Island, said a Suffolk County company this year spent $100,000 to recruit and another $100,000 to train 92 drivers. Only two remain on the job.
"You can make more money at McDonald's flipping hamburgers," said Mr. Fischer, the consultant.
Many districts are trying to provide longer hours -- either by combining driving with custodial or cafeteria work, or by guaranteeing pay even if there is no midday driving -- because they say their traditional work force of stay-at-home mothers, college students and retired people seems less available.
Private companies are filling out driver schedules with charter work. Contractors and schools alike are allowing drivers to take their own young children on routes, or paying for child care. Health benefits are becoming common even for part-time workers. In Houston, starting salaries rose to $11.22 an hour from $9.36 an hour in one year.
Jean Mann, the transportation supervisor in Lincoln, Neb., started the school year short 40 of 170 drivers. Students sat in gymnasiums while drivers circled back on double and triple routes; office staff members drove every day, then stayed until 10 p.m. to do paperwork.
"Every phone call I get, it's usually somebody complaining about the service," said Ms. Mann, who wore a pewter school bus pin. "After we've said, 'Your children are safe; I'm sorry we're late,' I say, 'Would you like to drive a bus?' "

HEADLINE: A Mirage of Amazonian Size;
Delusions of Economic Grandeur Deep in Brazil's Interior

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MONTE DOURADO, Brazil

 BODY:
Two decades ago, the American billionaire Daniel K. Ludwig took a bold but very expensive gamble here. After buying a piece of the Amazon jungle larger than the state of Connecticut, the shipping magnate spent a large chunk of his fortune building an industrial, mining and agricultural complex that he imagined would prosper as a result of the world's growing appetite for products like paper, aluminum, porcelain, rice, beef and pork.
Today, Jari Celulose, as a scaled-down version of the project is known, is for sale, available to any bidder -- for one dollar. Better yet, the current owners, a Brazilian consortium that has seen only one profitable year since taking over after Mr. Ludwig gave up in 1982, may even throw in a bonus of up to $20 million to the buyer who will take the venture off their hands. 
 There is a catch to the largely symbolic sale price, of course. Jari comes with $354 million in debt, its attractive bauxite and clay mines have already been spun off, and the project will require several hundred million dollars in new investment, including $100 million to build an electric power plant, if it is to continue to manufacture high-quality cellulose, the fiber used to make paper.
Like the big hopes for the China market, the notion that there are unlimited riches to be had from the Amazon is one of those dreams that never seems to die. Since the first Spanish colonizers in the New World fell under the spell of the legend of El Dorado, adventurers have arrived with the conviction they can build empires in places such as this, only to run afoul of one of the most hostile natural and business environments on the planet.
Jari may be an object lesson in such hazards, but it has fared better than most previous efforts, like Fordlandia, Henry Ford's failed effort to grow rubber 200 miles southwest of here. More than 30 years after Mr. Ludwig bought 6,301 square miles of inhospitable jungle for $3.1 million, the project is still a going concern and remains the focus of controversy and a symbol of both sovereignty and tenacity.
From the start, Mr. Ludwig invited scrutiny by thinking in grandiose terms.
When construction of a 17-story paper mill and power plant on the site he had selected proved impossible, he spent more than $269 million to have them built at his favorite shipyard in Japan and then towed 17,800 miles across the Indian and Atlantic Oceans.
He also installed 3,000 miles of road, 37 miles of railway, a deep-water port and a company town that now has 9,500 inhabitants. More than 260,000 acres were planted with Burmese melina and Caribbean pine trees, which did not flourish in this harsh equatorial climate, and, eventually after much costly experimentation, eucalyptus, which did.
"I always wanted to plant rows of trees like corn," Mr. Ludwig, who died in 1992 at the age of 95, said in a rare interview, published in 1980 in National Geographic magazine.
But the very scale of Mr. Ludwig's ambitions aroused suspicion among Brazilians, who have been distrustful of any foreign presence in the Amazon since the British destroyed Brazil's rubber industry a century ago by spiriting seeds away to Malaysia. Books with titles like "Jari: The American Invasion," and press reports suggested that Mr. Ludwig was creating his own nation with its own armed forces, using slave labor, destroying the jungle and smuggling gold abroad.
Though Brazilians are taught in school that the Amazon is a natural wonder, and can recite the names of the river's tributaries with ease, relatively few from the big cities 1,500 miles to the south have ever set foot in the region or have a desire to visit. This distance fuels nationalistic slogans like "the Amazon is ours," but produces very little knowledge of or sympathy for the obstacles faced by any undertaking in the jungle.
In part because Brazilians regard the Amazon as a place of quick and easy riches, "the state has not played its proper role" in the region, said Erton Sesquim Sanchez, Jari's current operations director. "They have not come in to build schools and basic sewage systems, pave roads, install electric power. We're here 20 years, and we still have to confront ourselves those and other problems that are really the responsibility of the state."
Despite the social role that companies like Jari are forced to play, calls for these companies to be expelled persist today. The October edition of Amazon Agenda, a monthly newsletter published by Lucio Flavio Pinto, author of a critical history of Jari and the region's best-known investigative reporter, describes Jari and projects like it as "Trojan Horses in the Amazon" that enrich foreigners at the expense of ordinary Brazilians.
In Mr. Ludwig's case, after he could not get government approval for a dam he wanted and walked away from Jari, the nationalists got their wish, though not quite in the form they had anticipated. Since the early 1980's, two government-owned banks, the National Bank for Economic and Social Development and Banco do Brasil, have poured at least $350 million into the effort to keep Jari going and together now hold a one-third stake in the cellulose project.
Over the years, the ambitions originally envisioned by Mr. Ludwig have also been pared down. Plans to raise cattle and pigs were shelved. A project to grow rice along the banks of the Amazon River, intended to turn Brazil into a rice exporter, was abandoned. That area has since been turned over to an entrepreneur who is trying to turn it into a fish farm.
"Our focus these days is immensely different from what it was back in those early days," said Jose Ricardo Cordeiro, president of Jarcel Celulose, the project's holding company. "Before, everything was on a large scale. But we are aware we are not a big company, that Jari will never be the mega-enterprise it was projected to be, and we act accordingly."
Now, however, the process has come full circle: Jari's current owners are once again actively seeking a foreign partner. "We are in a global market, and so there are no restrictions," Mr. Sanchez said during an interview at his office at the paper mill. "The most important thing is not the origin of the capital, but the capacity to carry this undertaking ahead."
Israel H. Coslovsky, chairman of Jari's board, said in an interview in Rio de Janeiro that preliminary talks with an American and a Canadian company, which he declined to identify, are already under way. But Brazilian market analysts are skeptical of the company's ability to attract significant foreign or domestic investment.
"Jari is the ugly duckling of the paper industry, a project in which no serious player has an interest," said Thomas Mello Souza, who follows the Brazil pulp and steel industries for Merrill Lynch's office in Sao Paulo. "Despite being close to the American and European markets, it is in an isolated area of difficult access, and that complicates the operation of the business, adds to operational costs and makes for a very high turnover."
Though Jari's cash flow is now positive, to expand and modernize its plant for an increasingly finicky international market will require an additional $400 million in investment, Mr. Souza estimated. "They are looking for a white knight, but I think it is a mission impossible," he said, "especially at a time when there are properties in Brazil that are more attractive, with better economies of scale, and which can't find buyers."
Mr. Coslovsky and Mr. Cordeiro, however, contend that the company has turned the corner. Production is at 295,000 tons of cellulose this year, two-thirds exported to Europe and another 10 percent to North America. Production is expected to rise to 330,000 tons next year. The price of Jari-made pulp has also risen, from $320 a ton in 1998 to $580 this year.
"For the first time, I am optimistic" Mr. Coslovsky said. "Two years ago we had not one cent of working capital" after a fire that forced the project to shut down for several months, but "conditions today have never been more propitious than in the entire history of Jari, with a market that is stable and a government that has shown good will to resolve our problems."
Jari's debt, 70 percent of it in dollars, is owed to nearly a score of Brazilian and foreign banks, including, Mr. Coslovsky said, the Citibank unit of Citigroup and J. P. Morgan. But the 40 percent devaluation of Brazil's currency, the real, this year has had minimal effect on the company for two reasons: Jari earns dollars exporting its products, and "the debt was unpayable before, and it is unpayable now," as Mr. Sanchez put it.
Though some nationalist groups have argued that Jari should simply be closed, that seems unlikely, since the social and political cost to the Brazilian government would be so high. Though the project itself has only 1,050 employees, more than 70,000 people now live here or in ramshackle communities along the Jari River, and would be left without a livelihood if strictly economic logic were applied.
"The economy of this entire region revolves around the Jari projects," Joao Firmino Rafael, manager of the local branch of the Hongkong Shanghai Banking Corporation, said, referring to the cellulose, bauxite and kaolin plants as a whole. "They can't shut down. If they were to do that, a lot of other businesses would have to close, too, and we would have no reason to be here."
Near the center of this tidy little town, named Gilded Mountain in Portuguese, the simple wooden house where Mr. Ludwig stayed during his frequent visits here in the 1970's is now a museum that describes him as a visionary. The museum and a similar display at the pulp mill offer plenty of data about the history and functioning of the project, but make no explicit mention of the main lesson to be learned from Jari's experience.
"The Amazon has advantages but it also has disadvantages," Mr. Coslovsky said. "You have to be very much aware of them before you do anything in the region."

HEADLINE: History Is Made by an Old-Fashioned chief.gov

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Already the master of the rope line and televised town meeting, President Clinton took a technological leap into the computer age tonight by becoming the first president to participate in a live Internet chat.
The president, who describes himself as old-fashioned and technologically challenged when it comes to computers, never touched a keyboard or a mouse. He merely sat in front of a Toshiba laptop on a stage at George Washington University and responded verbally to questions sent to him. 
His remarks scrolled word for word across tens of thousands of computer screens. The president appeared in a tiny video box, and could be seen -- albeit sometimes just barely -- putting his hand to his chin, sipping from a soda can and looking amused at the entire extravaganza.
"Like F.D.R.'s fireside chats and President Kennedy's live press conferences, this first presidential town hall meeting on the Internet taps the most modern technology for old-fashioned communication between the American people and their president," Mr. Clinton said.
But on the computer, the affair looked far less grandiose. The video was often fuzzy. The audio sometimes sounded like Mr. Clinton had marbles in his mouth. And only the most powerful machines seemed able to handle the connection, Internet experts said.
Further, unlike a real town meeting, which allows back and forth between the president and the audience, this one had plenty of stage managing, with questions screened by the event's organizers.
"This was online but it wasn't a chat," said Mike Cornfield, a professor at George Washington University who specializes in online politics and watched the event from the audience. "This could have been a national conversation. Instead we had a bunch of politicians telling us what they thought."
Many of the questions were softballs on health care, gun control and other issues that Mr. Clinton has answered many times before. He mixed serious policy answers with chuckles at occasional technical glitches and some of the e-mail names of the questioners -- monikers like T Love and Sissy Bill.
A questioner using the name GBH1935 asked Mr. Clinton how people who were not computer literate would be affected by the computer revolution. Economic prospects for the poor would increase, Mr. Clinton said, if "we have the same density of computer and Internet access that we have with telephone access."
Another questioner, Cynthia in Arizona, wondered whether Mr. Clinton would stockpile food for the start of the new millennium if he were an "ordinary citizen."
Mr. Clinton said there was no need for anybody to bunker down in fear. "The United States is doing fine and I wouldn't hoard food and I wouldn't hide," he said.
The president's participation in the virtual town hall meeting on Excite@Home was another first in the rapidly changing world of cyberspace, which has transformed entertainment, education and commerce and is moving rapidly into politics.
"For a sitting president to do this is not only groundbreaking but it shows how the Internet is becoming a fundamental tool in politics," said Tom Hockaday, president of Campaign Solutions, a company based in Alexandria, Va., that helps candidates use the Web to enhance their campaigns.
Those in the field envision a day when e-mail replaces 30-second television advertisements and even voting takes place with the click of a mouse.
Compared with other celebrity chats, Mr. Clinton's event, limited to 50,000 participants, was modest. Pop singer Britney Spears drew a record 234,000 participants in her celebrity chat on America Online.
The numbers for Mr. Clinton's town hall were about the same as those for past chats with Michael Jackson and Rod Stewart.
Mr. Clinton acknowledges that he is better at talking Internet policy than actually surfing the Net. Aides said that Mr. Clinton owns a computer but does not use it on his desk in the Oval Office and prefers to write notes longhand.
"He's definitely been on the Internet," one aide said. "He's sent e-mails but he basically is from the era of the typewriter."
Just the same, Mr. Clinton frequently mentions in speeches the need to connect schools in poor neighborhoods to the Internet and prepare for the next millennium with a technologically advanced work force. But Mr. Clinton has ceded technology to Vice President Al Gore, who unlike his boss knows that spam is not a processed lunch meat and that RAM is a computer storage device, not a horned animal.
Mr. Gore, who once boasted in an interview that he helped invent the Internet, held his first electronic town meeting in 1994.
It remains to be seen whether history books will make note of Mr. Clinton's chat, perhaps alongside Woodrow Wilson's first formal news conference and Dwight D. Eisenhower's media briefings over that cutting-edge technology called television.
"Someday this will look like the first flight at Kitty Hawk -- not too impressive, pretty crude, but it was the first," said Craig Crawford, editor in chief of Hotline, the Web-based political newsletter.
The event was as political and commercial as it was historic. The idea was conceived at the Democratic Leadership Council, which used the event to show off centrists it hoped would help fill Mr. Clinton's shoes in the next century. Excite@Home, the Internet concern that provided the technology, saw the chat as a way to tout its Internet software.
Participating from other sites across the country were Mayor Don Cunningham of Bethlehem, Pa.; Mayor Ron Gonzales of San Jose, Calif.; Assemblyman Antonio Riley of Wisconsin; Gov. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire; and Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend of Maryland.
Also involved in the chat were Al From, president of the Democratic Leadership Council, who was the moderator, and Marc Andreessen, the founder of Netscape.
Mr. Cunningham, who at 34 is one of the country's youngest mayors, said he used his computer every day, but understood why Mr. Clinton did not.
"The president is in the same generation as my father, the 50-something baby boomers," Mr. Cunningham said in an interview. "Some of them are into computers and some of them are not. My father just got e-mail. But the world is changing and this event shows that everyone has to get online, even the president."

HEADLINE: Despite Boom, Flea Markets Buzz

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: MONROE, Ohio, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Darryl Haun has discovered yet another opportunity in the great American tradition of making a buck. Mr. Haun is a machinist during the workweek, but at amusement parks he has become an ace thrower of objects at targets, like rings around bottles and quarters on plates. "After you figure it out," he explained, "it's not total chance."
As a reward for his unerring aim, Mr. Haun wins stuffed animals that are bigger than most 7-year-olds. Every four or five months, he hauls his bounty off to the Traders' World flea market here. This weekend he was selling many of the animals for $29 each, a lot less than they would cost in a conventional store but a lot more than they cost him. 
 Traders' World, midway between Cincinnati and Dayton on Interstate 75, has almost half a million square feet of indoor and outdoor selling space for 1,200 vendors, who do business with more than 20,000 shoppers pouring through every weekend. And it is hardly alone: scores of giant flea markets like it dot the country, although most, unlike Traders' World, operate only part of the year. Even in a robust economy, it seems, the flea market can thrive by drawing enough bargain hunters, particularly those who crave the opportunity to find a product not only cheap but perhaps quite rare or even unique.
Traders' World, one of the largest, charges a vendor $40 a weekend to set up a table outside and $68 for a booth inside, prices that offer novice merchants a cheap way to enter the marketplace with their goods. Fall weekends are its busiest time of the year, and all available space was in use both Saturday and Sunday.
While no one keeps comprehensive statistics on flea markets, what evidence there is suggests that others are having at least some of the success enjoyed by the one here. Ron Simmons, president and general manager of the 1,800-vendor Traders Village near Dallas and senior vice president of the National Flea Market Association, says that when he surveyed 130 of more than 2,500 markets around the country last summer, he found that as a whole they were more than holding their own.
"The industry is up as a rule," Mr. Simmons said. "Fifty-three percent of the markets showed an increase in attendance and gross income" from the summer before. "About 20 percent showed a decrease, and the rest were showing the same. The decreases were the result of road construction, competition or extreme weather conditions."
Traders' World is a wonder of enterprising vision, the fantasy of a sod farmer, Jay Frick Sr., who opened it 15 years ago at the age of 62 and has made it a major contender for the dollar of southwestern Ohio's consumers. Starting with 3 buildings then, he has now erected 13, which look like ribs extending from a spine-like core building.
Mr. Frick pipes in polkas, waltzes and golden oldies, has decorated the interior with hundreds of rural artifacts and has strung aphorisms from the ceilings like "It's hard to be humble when you're as great as I am" and "Don't spend all your money on wine, women and song. Save some to spend foolishly."
It's all a little overdone to Becky Lugibihl, a visitor who said she preferred garage sales. Ms. Lugibihl, a 43-year-old word processor for the State of Ohio, had taken a bus tour to Traders' World from Lima, Ohio, an hour and a half away. "I got some zucchini for 39 cents a pound," she said, 40 cents less than what she can find it for at home. "And I got two cans of Sani-Flush for $1 each. At stores they're $2 something." But the savings did not pay for the $24 trip.
For every Becky Lugibihl, though, there is a couple like Scott Wood, 42, and his wife, Margie, 29, of Erlanger, Ky., 40 minutes away. They have seized on flea markets, where the vendors own the business and there are bargains galore, as an alternative to malls, where the sellers are sometimes ill-informed clerks.
"I love thrift shopping, so I can buy more," Mrs. Wood said. "Jeans. I got a pair for $1.50, and they're new." Mr. Wood said he was considering a leather jacket that costs $297 here and $429 at a mall. The Woods said they could find just about everything here: appliances and antiques, new wedding gowns and used boots, jeans and custom-embroidered sweatshirts, old compact discs and old videotapes, birdhouses and produce, fast food and pony rides. Few merchants carry silk purses anymore, but sows' ears are $1 each. Dogs use them to gnaw on.
On the other side of the transaction, there are at least some success stories. Flea-market merchandising has been a boon to Gary Berding, strictly a wholesale liquidator until he opened a booth here six weeks ago to try retail liquidation.
"We sell shelf-pulls," Mr. Berding said -- that is, he buys goods that big stores like Wal-Mart and Target cannot sell and that manufacturers therefore pull off the stores' shelves and sell to him. "I'm kind of like a cemetery," he said.
Mr. Berding's hottest items this weekend were Foster Grant reading glasses with original price tags of $13.49. He was selling them for $2 each or three for $5.
"We're averaging $2,000 a weekend," he said, or about four times the receipts that Jay Frick Jr., who has taken over management of the market from his father, estimates to be the average for all booths.
Business is slipping, however, among a mainstay of flea markets, vendors of limited-edition collectibles: thematic plates with images of Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley, Hummel figurines, Beanie Baby dolls. Nancy and Ron Dornbusch said their hottest line was Precious Moments, white porcelain figurines of children, every one with dewy black eyes. New ones are $30. Discontinued models can exceed $900.
But "something's going on," Mrs. Dornbusch said. "Ebay," she said, referring to the Internet auction service. "I have people coming in and saying, 'I bought the same thing on the Internet.' "
Tom and Linda Engelhaupt speculate that in the lush economy, too many merchants have sprung up to court the consumer, intensifying the competition. From a large indoor booth, the Engelhaupts sell jackets, shirts and baseball caps that they embroider on order on the premises.
"Fifteen years ago," Mr. Engelhaupt said, "there weren't a lot of embroidering machines. It was great. It peaked three years ago. Everybody and his brother has a machine now."
Outside, David and Maria Hamm sell a variety of collectibles and knickknacks. "Cookie jars are real hot," Mrs. Hamm said, as are Christmas items. But they said shoppers were tougher than ever.
"They want something real expensive," Mr. Hamm said, "that doesn't cost very much."

HEADLINE: BIG H.M.O. TO GIVE DECISIONS ON CARE BACK TO DOCTORS

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
The United Health Group said yesterday that it was returning decision-making power over patient care to physicians, breaking with a longstanding element of managed care that has infuriated many doctors and frustrated their patients.
United, one of the nation's biggest managed care companies, said that a patient's doctor would be able to decide without the insurer's interference whether to admit health plan members to a hospital or provide other treatment. 
 That does not mean the company, which is based in Minneapolis, is giving up cost controls. The company will still review decisions after the fact and urge doctors not to exceed certain averages. When persuasion does not work, doctors can be dismissed from the company's network of approved physicians -- thus forcing patients to transfer to other doctors -- but the company said that sanction was rarely used.
United, which insures 14.5 million people, including 8.7 million in health maintenance organizations and other managed care units, said the rules were being phased in nationally. United has 1.1 million members in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
With the decision, United, which said it approves 9 out of 10 care decisions anyway, will save about $100 million, much of which will be spent elsewhere. It also gets a chance to smooth relations with doctors and patients, attract more customers and perhaps avoid some future legal liability as health plans battle a backlash against managed care in Congress and the states and a series of class-action lawsuits. Those suits generally contend that managed care companies misrepresent that clients are getting the best possible care when in fact, the suits say, the cost of care is the determining factor.
The announcement by United is one of several changes by insurance companies that analysts attribute to the backlash. United, Aetna Inc. and several Blue Cross plans have separately offered their members the right to appeal denials of care to an independent panel outside the company. Such panels would be required in the Congressional measures and are already required in 30 states, including New York.
And several big nonprofit H.M.O.'s, like Kaiser Permanente, based in California, and Harvard Pilgrim in Boston, have long relied on doctors to decide when care is considered medically necessary.
Other managed care companies declined to comment on the United announcement, which was reported yesterday in The Dallas Morning News. Spokeswomen for Oxford Health Plans, Aetna U.S. Healthcare, and Empire Blue Cross said they had not seen United's official account.
Physicians and consumer advocates hailed United's move yesterday.
"It's a response to the consumer and political backlash," said Ken Jacobsen, a health care expert in New York at the Segal Company, a consulting firm. "This is a big, significant step."
Explaining its decision to stop requiring doctors to get prior approval for care, United said it was "no secret that state and federal lawmakers want to put an end to much of this practice."
But officials of the American Association of Health Plans, a managed care trade group in Washington, disagreed that the changes being made by health plans were prompted by developments like the "patients' rights" legislation that is awaiting action by a Senate-House conference committee. Provisions include the right to sue health plans for medical malpractice, the right to appeal denials of care to independent review panels and guaranteed access to specialists.
Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for the trade groups, said the United announcement was "the next stage in the evolution of health care, the edge of a wave of change."
John Stone, a spokesman for Representative Charles Norwood, Republican of Georgia, who sponsored the House bill, said that managed care companies that turned over medical decision-making to physicians would not be liable to medical malpractice lawsuits under the bill.
Republican leaders in the House and insurance company lobbyists have argued that the right to sue the companies would increase costs for health plan members. But Mr. Norwood said in a statement yesterday that his bill would "very likely result in lower costs." He said, "the best care in the long run is less expensive than cutting corners."
"This action is historic," said Dr. Thomas Reardon, president of the American Medical Association. He said it was "a long overdue victory for American patients and the care they receive."
Jeffrey Roth, a Manhattan dermatologist, said the change would "help re-establish a sense of trust between the insurers and the doctors" and reduce burdensome paperwork in doctor's offices that they denounce as "the hassle factor."
Health care experts and critics of managed care said the prior review system had outlived its usefulness and was actually costing the companies more than they saved. "This is a confession that H.M.O. bureaucrats cost more than they save," said Jamie Court, a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, an advocacy coalition.
Wall Street investors reacted to the news by driving United Health Group stock up $2.375 yesterday, to $54.9375.
Robert Hoehn, a health care analyst with ING Barings, said that the higher stock price may reflect the belief of traders that the new policy would give United "an advantage over other companies in terms of marketing" and "further insulate them from the risk of litigation."
Dr. Archelle Georgiou, chief medical officer of the United Healthcare unit of the company, said that it had been spending $100 million a year to respond to requests for approval of care, which were almost always granted.
Some of the money saved will go toward programs for patients, she said, like telling patients what to expect in the hospital and keeping tabs on them so they get appropriate care promptly and can return home.
The company will still track doctors' decisions after they are made and urge physicians who exceed the average costs on certain types of health care to bring their practices in line. "When we are talking to physicians and not calling to deny a service, they are so much more willing to listen," Dr. Georgiou said.
"Doctors will still have to be mindful of economic outcomes," Mr. Jacobsen, the consultant said.
Like other health care companies, United will still negotiate discounts on payments to doctors and hospitals. And it will continue to try to minimize expensive hospital stays by reminding members with chronic ailments like asthma, diabetes and congestive heart failure to take their medication and closely follow their doctors' orders.
Mr. Hoehn, the analyst, said that managed care had succeeded in bringing health costs down. Fifteen years ago, he said, reviews like those being dropped by United played an important role in holding down costs. "Now quality and access to care are taking precedence," he said, as prior reviews could no longer show savings.
Dr. Lee Sacks, a family physician in Oak Brook Ill., said he was "encouraged that United is trying to figure out how to work with physicians and patients to provide the best care." Dr. Sacks, a senior executive of Advocate Health Care, a group of 2,700 doctors, said that previously United had approved the group's requests for prior approval of care "in 99 out of 100 cases."
Helen Darling, a senior health care consultant with the Watson Wyatt consulting group, said that "health plans, for the most part, are approving everything."

HEADLINE: Namesake as Spoils of War;
North vs. South, With a Battleship to the Victor

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN 

 BODY:
Call it the battle for the battleship, or the north versus the south.
As the much-decorated and now decommissioned battleship New Jersey heads slowly toward that state, the Navy is trying to decide which of two cities will become its permanent home. 
 The contest is between two decidedly unglamorous places trying to transform themselves: Bayonne, an industrial city in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty, and Camden, an industrial city across the Delaware River from Philadelphia.
The ship, which had been berthed in Bremerton, Wash., since being decommissioned in 1991, was towed through the Panama Canal toward the East Coast. Long before its expected arrival on Thursday, it had become an object of intense attention, from veterans and military buffs eager to walk its teak decks and from the two cities eager to attract tourists. Each city is seeking to persuade the Navy that it is best suited to accommodate the ship and preserve it as a museum, and the competition has started to take on the undertones of the north-south rivalry that often defines New Jersey politics.
Bayonne supporters say that the battleship, the most decorated in the American fleet, should be where most New Jersey residents can have access to it. They reason that because two-thirds of the state's residents live north of Trenton, the ship is likely to attract more tourists if it is in the New York City metropolitan area, which would help support its expensive upkeep.
Camden backers say the battleship ought to be near its birthplace, the Philadelphia Naval Shipyards, where it was built in 1942. The battleship will be set up as a museum on the revitalized Camden waterfront, next to the New Jersey Aquarium and just across the Delaware from downtown Philadelphia and its historical attractions. The Delaware River, they also point out, will provide a freshwater port for the ship, an important consideration in preserving the battleship's aging steel hull.
Both sides cite a long list of pros and cons, and many who care about the ship's fate fear that a decision will come down to politics. If that is the case, some say, North Jersey could prevail, as it often has.
"They have more clout up in the north than we do here in the south," said John Horan of Cherry Hill, N.J., who was a signalman on the original crew for two and a half years during World War II. Mr. Horan, who said he would visit the ship no matter where it ended up, said he would rather see it in Camden, 10 minutes from his home, but expected the north to win. "In the state as a whole, North Jersey gets a lot more than South Jersey," he said.
But maybe not this time. A few days before the ship is to arrive in Philadelphia, its temporary home, the scales may be tipping in Camden's favor. While the Navy wouldn't say what it would do before a decision was announced, possibly in January, Camden's proposal has gained powerful support in Washington. Backers include senators and representatives and the Secretary for Housing and Urban Development, Andrew M. Cuomo. Meanwhile, the Bayonne plan has been garnering more critics, including several United States representatives from the New York City area, and the directors of the Intrepid, a similar floating museum at a Manhattan pier.
As the competition comes down to the last few months, the criticisms have become sharper. State Assemblyman Joseph Azzolina said that Camden, which is under state control because of fiscal mismanagement, was too intimidating for most tourists. Mr. Azzolina is chairman of the state-appointed U.S.S. New Jersey Battleship Commission, which favors Bayonne. While Camden's refurbished waterfront is attracting thousands of tourists weekly, he said, the city itself has one of the highest crime rates in the country.
"As soon as you walk off the parking lot, you're in the middle of the murder capital of the world," he said.
United States Representative James H. Saxton, whose district includes Camden, fired back with a shot of his own. "All I can say is, when Brendan Byrne was governor, he said he wanted to be buried in Bayonne so he could continue in politics," he said.
The return of the 45,000-ton ship to New Jersey, after serving in three wars -- World War II, The Korean War and Vietnam -- ends a 30-year sentimental journey by dozens of veterans who worked to persuade the Navy to donate it to its namesake state.
Chief among them is Mr. Azzolina, Republican of Middletown, a retired Navy captain who served on the New Jersey in the 1980's.
Mr. Azzolina, who has made a fortune in the grocery store business, was named chairman of the Battleship Commission when it was formed by Governor Byrne in 1981 and has held the job ever since. "It's probably my greatest achievement ever in my life, in my career, in politics, that the New Jersey is finally coming back home," Mr. Azzolina said recently. "It's a symbol of freedom. It will be a great teaching tool."
The commission was set up to pick a site for the ship and raise money for its return and upkeep. Most of the money is coming from the sale of auto license plates showing the battleship and from state income tax checkoffs allowing taxpayers to contribute to the ship's cause.
Few ports in the state could accommodate the ship. It is six stories high above the waterline, the length of three football fields and 108 feet wide at its beam. Only three cities applied: Bayonne, Camden and Jersey City. Eight commission members voted for Bayonne, saying the city could easily berth the ship at a dock on the Military Ocean Terminal, a 437-acre former naval base turned over to the city in September. Four members voted for Jersey City, which wanted to put the ship near the Liberty Science Center, next to Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. One voted for Camden.
But Camden backers did not take the defeat easily, surprising Mr. Azzolina, who had never envisioned the ship's being located anywhere but North Jersey.
Shortly after the commission's vote, Jersey City threw its support to Bayonne, and Camden County officials filed a lawsuit. Camden supporters complained that only one commission member was from that area. They also asserted that the commission's chairman was biased in favor of Bayonne because of his friendship with its mayor, Joseph Doria, who was then the Assembly's Democratic majority leader. Mr. Azzolina denied the allegations. Camden backers said that of the three choices, Bayonne had the least to offer tourists.
The lawsuit was withdrawn after Navy officials hinted to county officials that litigation would keep them from handing over the ship to either city. But by then, RepresentativeSaxton, who is on the House Armed Services Committee, which sets the Navy budget, met with top Navy officials and learned that they, and not the state commission, would have the last word on where the ship would go.
Since then, support for Camden has grown stronger, and Bayonne's getting the ship has become less of a given. Even Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who appointed some of the commission members, reversed her decision to support the commission's choice, and said in May that instead, she would support whichever city the Navy picked.
Camden's backers say it can support the ship because 22 million visitors come to the Philadelphia area every year. Camden's revitalized waterfront, with its neat brick-lined river walk, is a five-minute ferry ride or a short drive from Philadelphia's Penn's Landing, with its maritime attractions and restaurants. The city would have to spend $2.9 million to build a pier for the battleship, and Secretary Cuomo of HUD has pledged $1 million in federal empowerment zone money for the project.
Mr. Azzolina, as head of the battleship commission, feels confident that the Navy will take the commission's application more seriously, since it comes from an official state body.
Bayonne already has a 1,200-foot-long dock at the old Military Ocean Terminal that could take the ship, although refurbishing the site would be costly. But Mr. Azzolina said that redevelopment of the old base was about five years away, because the city of Bayonne, which only recently took control of the base, had yet to decide on a plan. If Bayonne did get the battleship, it would be the only reason for New York-area tourists to visit Hudson County's southernmost city.
With the confidence of someone from North Jersey, Mr. Azzolina said Bayonne just made more sense as a home for the ship. "It's on the Hudson waterfront," he said. "The population there is three times what it is in Camden. You've got to have at least 400,000 visitors a year to make this work, and Camden can't do that. It's not a north-south war. It's an economic war. You've got to go where it's best for the ship."

HEADLINE: Whitman and Forbes, Separated Now by Political Ideology

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Steve Forbes brought his Republican presidential campaign into New Jersey's capital today, speaking on the steps of a war memorial a block from the office of his childhood pal, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman.
Mrs. Whitman made her own public appearance in a Revolutionary War barracks just a few hundred yards away. But Mr. Forbes and the governor did not visit with each other or speak during his daylong stop in Trenton, and that conspicuous silence was a stark reminder that their friendship of nearly a half century has become a casualty in the battle between the various factions of the Republican Party. 
 Once schoolmates, political allies and young Republican bluebloods in New Jersey's hunt country, Mr. Forbes and Mrs. Whitman now find themselves on opposing sides of the Republican Party divide.
Mrs. Whitman, who has been vilified by her party's right wing for her support of abortion rights, has publicly criticized Mr. Forbes's shift on social issues several times this year, accusing him of caving in to the conservative voters who dominate the party's primaries.
During the course of a conversation with reporters today, the governor offered a few kind words for Mr. Forbes. When she was asked whether she knew that campaign aides for her longtime friend had been trying to win votes by bluntly portraying him as the anti-Whitman, her expression made it clear that she was hardly heartened.
"Steve was certainly a Christie Whitman Republican when I first ran for governor," Mrs. Whitman said with a smile, "and I haven't changed on the issues that were important to me then and are important to me now. If he's changed, that's up to him. And that's fine."
Mr. Forbes came to Trenton to rally social conservatives supporting a proposal to make every student in New Jersey begin the school day by reciting part of the Declaration of Independence in addition to the Pledge of Allegiance.
He also took the occasion to brush aside any suggestion that he might abandon his presidential bid and seek the party's nomination for United States Senate next year. That race has been in turmoil since Governor Whitman dropped out of contention in September. Chuck Haytaian, chairman of the state Republican Party, said he had no indication that Mr. Forbes might be interested in the Senate race if his presidential bid is unsuccessful.
"He's running for the presidency; he still thinks he has a shot," Mr. Haytaian said. "Think about it. He spent $37 million to run for president last time; he's spent $15 million this time. After all that, why would he back away to run for the Senate?"
Other than their background and party affiliation, Mr. Forbes and Mrs. Whitman have little in common now. She will complete her final term as governor next year, and has traveled the country trying to raise money and support for Republican moderates. Mr. Forbes has spent much of the last four years courting conservatives, occasionally at the expense of Mrs. Whitman.
A former Republican governor, Tom Kean, who has known both Mr. Forbes and Mrs. Whitman for decades, said it was inevitable that they would go their separate ways once Mr. Forbes acted on his ambitions for national office.
"On the national stage, there's only room for one person from New Jersey," Mr. Kean said. "There's a rivalry that develops, quite naturally. So there's a certain wariness among supporters and friends."
Although both Mr. Forbes and Mrs. Whitman have tried to play down politely any conflict between them, they often display uncomfortable facial expressions when asked about each other.
In the minds of many New Jersey Republicans, young Christie and Steve were indelibly linked at the Republican presidential convention in 1956, which nominated Dwight D. Eisenhower to a second term in the White House. Christie Todd, age 9, and Steve Forbes, age 8, appeared on stage together to present ceremonial gifts to the children of the renominated vice president, Richard M. Nixon.
They attended Far Hills Country Day School in Somerset County together, and were raised in prominent and politically active Republican families in affluent Somerset County and grew up in estates about 10 minutes apart.
Mr. Forbes's father, Malcolm Forbes, was both a successful magazine publisher and an unsuccessful candidate for New Jersey governor. Mrs. Whitman's parents were paragons of Eastern establishment Republicanism, and had close ties to Wendell Wilkie, Dwight Eisenhower and Nelson Rockefeller.
Once they entered politics, their early careers also ran a parallel course. Mrs. Whitman first ran for freeholder of Somerset County in 1982, and worked closely with Mr. Forbes as parks commissioner on a variety of civic boards and community projects, said Ray Bateman, a state legislator and gubernatorial candidate from Somerset County at the time.
"Neither of them were really considered rising stars at the time," said Mr. Bateman, who is now chairman of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, appointed by Mrs. Whitman. "They were participants, bright and enthusiastic, but I don't think anyone then figured that they'd be governor or a presidential candidate. There were other people who appeared far more likely to go places in the party." For an example, he mentioned her brother, Dan Todd.
Mrs. Whitman catapulted above the pack of ambitious Republicans by running for the Senate in 1990, when she came startlingly close to unseating Bill Bradley, a popular incumbent. When she ran for governor against Jim Florio in 1993, Mr. Forbes was one of a handful of advisers who saved her campaign six weeks before the election by persuading her to adopt a proposal to cut income tax rates by 30 percent. Mrs. Whitman reluctantly agreed, won the election and has since made tax cuts a cornerstone of her agenda and her national reputation as a fiscal conservative.
Mr. Forbes's surprise presidential run in 1996 focused largely on his call for a simplification of the income tax system, but some New Jersey analysts thought Governor Whitman stood to gain from his success because they appeared to share much the same ideology.
"Certainly in 1996, people thought they were coming out of the same wing of the party and that Steve Forbes could help her and the moderates outflank some of those conservative Republicans whom they considered fanatical," said David P. Rebovich, a professor of political science at Rider University.
Instead, Mrs. Whitman delivered a crushing blow to Mr. Forbes's aspirations by choosing practicality over loyalty and endorsing Bob Dole in the weeks before the 1996 New Hampshire primary.
Relations between them have never quite been the same, party leaders said, even though Mr. Forbes endorsed her for re-election in 1997. He has used her strong support for abortion rights as a way of highlighting his own anti-abortion stand, and urged the Legislature to override her veto of the ban on a late-term abortion procedure opponents call partial birth abortion. Just last month, one of Mr. Forbes's campaign managers described him as a real "Reagan Republican, not some Christie Whitman Republican."
Even today, when Mr. Forbes heard that the governor was skeptical of the Declaration of Independence bill, he pounced on the opportunity to make a point about what he considers the differences in the way he and Ms. Whitman express their devotion to American values.
"If we can't spare a couple of minutes to understand the founding document of this country, then we're in very sorry shape," he said.
The governor has not yet endorsed anyone seeking her party's presidential nomination, but her past references to Mr. Forbes as a kind of moderate gone astray make it seem unlikely she will support him.
"I think he's an extraordinarily bright person when it comes to economic issues," she said. "Obviously, he seems to have changed a bit on social issues from where he was when we were working together."
Mr. Forbes said he fully expected Mrs. Whitman to endorse Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for the nomination, and he playfully promised that he would welcome support from both of them after he captures the Republican nomination himself.
Despite the different political paths Mr. Forbes and Mrs. Whitman have chosen, he said he hoped that they would manage to preserve their lifelong friendship. On issues like abortion, "We do disagree, but we have friendly and civil relations," he said. Then Mr. Forbes added, "We still have them as far as I know."

HEADLINE: At Berlin Wall: The Crumbling, Then and Now

SERIES: ONE EUROPE, 10 YEARS -- After the Wall

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Having guarded the ramparts of East German Communism for 28 years, Harald Jaeger knew his business at the Berlin Wall. So the statement by the Politburo member on television on that night -- Nov. 9, 1989 -- struck him as lunacy.
But the words were clear enough. Gunter Schabowski, representing the Communist state's highest authority, said that East Germans were free to travel "without meeting special provisions" and that the new rule would go into effect "immediately." 
 Mr. Jaeger, then a 46-year-old lieutenant colonel in the East German border guards, almost choked on his sandwich. "On the one hand, I knew what the party said was law," he said recently. "On the other, I was commanding a critical border post, and nobody had alerted us to any change of policy."
A decade later, it is clear that Mr. Jaeger's confusion was widely shared. Virtually nobody predicted the fall of the Berlin Wall, and apparently nobody planned it. At its most sensitive point, the Soviet empire imploded, undone by economic decay and by Mikhail S. Gorbachev's renunciation of the force ultimately needed to hold it together.
As a result, two German states with utterly divergent ideologies and cultures found themselves propelled toward union on the panicky reaction of a border guard, Mr. Jaeger, who opened the gate at Berlin's Bornholmer Strasse crossing, in the absence of instructions about what to do. Some of the effects of that precipitation are still evident today.
Most fundamentally, a united Germany is not quite sure of its identity. "Is Germany a great power?" the weekly magazine Der Spiegel asked this week on the cover of its issue commemorating the 10th anniversary of the wall's fall. The image above the question: a German eagle borne aloft by the Brandenburg Gate's winged goddess of Victory.
Chancellor Gerhard Schroder recently answered the question in the affirmative, calling Germany a "great European power." On one level, even though the country has no nuclear bomb, he is clearly right.
The German economy is one-third bigger than any other in Europe. And a German general now commands allied forces in Kosovo, something unthinkable even five years ago.
But the nature of that power, and of a new German patriotism, is less clear because German unity abruptly brought together in a single state zealous Communists like Mr. Jaeger, mild West Germans eager to escape German identity by calling themselves "Europeans" and some East Germans with strong nationalistic feelings for a united Germany.
What seems evident, a decade after the wall's fall, is that the postwar consensus around the "constitutional patriotism" proposed by the prominent intellectual Jurgen Habermas -- built on values like free speech and the rule of law -- has eroded.
In its place is a jumble. Hans-Peter Muller, a political scientist, said, "The reference point of 'never again' to the Holocaust still exists, but alongside it we have the patriotic nostalgia of those who feel they lost their state in the East, the right-wing radicalism of the frustrated and some conservative attempts to lift German taboos."
The project of the last decade has been the unification of a highly developed Western country that is ashamed of its past and rooted in NATO with a crumbling East German state raised to to see NATO as its mortal enemy. Given the dimensions of the task, difficulties were inevitable. But most Germans now agree that, however great the achievements of the last decade, there were also mistakes.
Among them were the headlong economic reforms that left about 20 percent of eastern Germans unemployed, a failure in the west to come up with gestures to soften the eastern sense of being taken over and the too-easy promises that suggested to eastern Germans that capitalism was a code word for get-rich-quick.
"We have paid for having no plan," said Willi Heidemann, the top administrative official in Jerxheim, a town that once stood just west of the border. "West Germany's Constitution made clear from 1949 that the aim was unification, but it was an aim without a project right up to the last moment. Nobody believed that border would disappear."
Least of all Mr. Jaeger, who became a border guard when the wall went up in 1961 to stanch the flow of 2,000 people a day fleeing to the West.
He believed in socialism; he believed that the people on the western side of the wall were his "class enemy." He considered it the state's right to protect its borders as it saw fit, even after the killing of more than 450 people who had tried to escape.
"I was lucky I was never placed in that situation, but believing what I believed then, I too would have shot anyone trying to flee," said Mr. Jaeger, who now runs a small newspaper store in Berlin. "At the same time, by that night in 1989, I could see that we were directionless, that the leadership had lost control."
Beginning in the summer of 1989, thousands of East Germans had been escaping through Hungary's newly opened borders with the West. In East Germany, on Oct. 18, Egon Krenz eased out Erich Honecker, who had governed since 1971.
Mr. Krenz visited Moscow on Oct. 31 and met Mr. Gorbachev, who made clear that the Soviet leadership opposed German unification, but also opposed any use of force. The people, Mr. Gorbachev said, should not be regarded as an enemy; on the contrary, policies should be found to bring them around.
Accordingly, Mr. Jaeger said, he received instructions several days before Nov. 9 that force should not be used on any account. In the early evening, shortly after Mr. Schabowski's televised news conference, 10 or 15 people gathered in front of Mr. Jaeger, shouting that the party had declared they were free to travel "immediately."
Mr. Jaeger was at a loss. So he called his superior, Col. Rudi Ziegenhorn, to ask what to do. The following conversation, as Mr. Jaeger recalled it, ensued.
"Did you hear that nonsense on television?" Colonel Ziegenhorn asked.
"Yes, that's why I'm calling."
"How many are there in front of you?"
"About 15."
"You know the law -- send them back," the colonel said.
The group of soldiers under Mr. Jaeger's command tried to do just that, but more people kept arriving, and the border guards had no means of coercion.
About a half-hour later, Colonel Ziegenhorn called back, saying the people he described as "provocateurs" -- essentially those shouting loudest -- should be allowed out with the understanding that they would not be allowed to return.
"The idea was to open the valve a little and relieve the tension through what amounted to selective expulsions," Mr. Jaeger said. "But the idea proved disastrous because people got the impression that if they shouted loudly enough, they would be allowed out."
So he called his superior again. Colonel Ziegenhorn had meanwhile spoken to his superior to see if anyone knew what should be done. Apparently no one did.
"Ziegenhorn told me that there were no more orders, nothing else to say," Mr. Jaeger said. "In effect, I was on my own."
By 10:30 p.m., thousands were in the street. The soldiers were urging him to make a decision. "But," Mr. Jaeger said, "that wall was my life. I'd defended it for 28 years. It was not like kicking over a bucket."
For about another 30 minutes, Mr. Jaeger wavered, torn between fear of a violent catastrophe and terror of opening up a wall he regarded as his. He gave the order, shortly after 11 p.m., to open the gates.
"I did not free Europe, or release my people, or any of that nonsense," Mr. Jaeger said. "It was that crowd in front of me, and the hopeless confusion of my leadership, that opened those gates."
Overwhelmed by what he had done, Mr. Jaeger hesitated to call Colonel Ziegenhorn back. But eventually he informed his superior of his decision. "Das ist gut, mein Junge," -- "You did right, young man" -- was the cursory reply.
So ended East Germany, the division of Europe, the cold war, and around the globe, much else that, for good or ill, had depended on the global struggle between capitalism and Communism. Mr. Jaeger's long career as a border guard also ended.
As for millions of eastern Germans, unemployment followed for him and for his wife, and a long struggle to adjust to the values of a society he had long opposed.
Hundreds of thousands of East Germans moved from the east to the west. But an increasing number of western Germans also move to the east. Last year, the Federal Statistics Office reported, 182,000 moved from east to west, 30,000 more than in the opposite direction.
Mr. Jaeger stayed in Berlin, and finally, in 1997, he was able to borrow the money so that he and his wife could start a newspaper store.
"I suppose I'm a capitalist," he said. "I exploit my wife, and she exploits me. That's our capitalism. But I listen to the people in the store worrying about jobs for their children, and I still have my doubts about this system."
He is not alone. "Wir sind das Volk" -- "We are the people" -- was the cry of East German protesters in 1989. Today, a large, sad banner hangs at the Alexanderplatz, the former center of East Berlin, saying: "Wir waren das Volk" -- "We were the people."
Nearby, stalls sell T-shirts emblazoned with the German eagle and the bold word: "Deutschland." Between the nostalgic disillusionment of that banner and the patriotism of that shirt, a united Germany struggles today to define itself.
This article is part of a series on Europe a decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Previous articles have looked at key players and at the aftermath for Germany and neighboring countries, and at the lives of Germans who fled and those who stayed behind.

HEADLINE: Ignoring State Curriculum Caused Poor Scores, Experts Say

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
When New York State announced the poor results of its tough new fourth- and eighth-grade math tests on Friday, the dismay was not confined, as so often in the past, to New York City and other big cities. Many parents, teachers and administrators in the state's wealthiest areas -- where people buy expensive homes thinking that they are also buying outstanding public schools -- were in shock, too.
For decades, residents there had been lulled into a sense of complacency because the state had used a minimum competency test to measure student performance, a test on which children in places like Westchester County and Long Island routinely scored near 100 percent -- so high that there was no statistical room for improvement. 
 That complacency was rudely shattered last week when one out of five children in even the most exclusive suburbs, like Rye, Great Neck and Mamaroneck, failed to meet state standards in eighth-grade math.
What went wrong? parents throughout the state wondered. Was the test asking the wrong questions, or were schools failing to teach what children should know?
From Syracuse to New York City, educators said yesterday that they believed the test itself was not to blame. State officials said that the new test -- far from expecting children to demonstrate an unprecedented level of knowledge -- was actually based on elements of the state curriculum that have been in place for more than 30 years.
The problem, they said was that -- especially in the middle grades -- those standards had never before been tested. And since no one was watching, officials said, teachers felt free to ignore the state curriculum, relying on inadequate textbooks or their own judgment.
"I wasn't surprised," the state education commissioner, Richard Mills, who pushed the State Board of Regents to adopt the new tests, said yesterday.
Judith Rizzo, deputy chancellor for instruction in New York City, where 77 percent of eighth graders failed to meet the new math standards, agreed.
"I know everybody wants to blame the test," Ms. Rizzo said. "But you can't. There's nothing wrong with this test. It's that it measures standards that, across the state, people have not been preparing kids for. And it's that simple."
Stung as they were by the dismal results, some education officials said the test revealed problems that pervade eighth-grade math classes across the country, and not just in New York, including shortages of qualified teachers, early tracking of students and a focus on rote learning rather than understanding.
The lack of testing in middle school also explains why fourth graders did better than eighth graders on the new test, said Lynn Richbart, a mathematics specialist for the state Education Department. Fifty-four percent of eighth graders failed outside New York City, but just 23 percent of fourth graders did (it was 50 percent in New York City).
Since 1965, Mr. Richbart said, the state has tested heavily in third grade through sixth grade, forcing teachers to focus on state standards. But this is the first year that eighth graders have been required to take math tests, he said.
The new tests are in many ways a reaction to the freedom, experimentation and idiosyncratic curriculums that came to characterize American schools in the last generation, educators said. In New York City, curricular unorthodoxy was heightened by decentralization.
The tests, given during the last school year, grew out of a broader re-examination of how students across the nation were being taught math. In 1989, state officials said, the National Council of Mathematics recommended new math standards.
In 1993, New York State, influenced by the council, toughened its own math standards. Five years later, seeing a need to make those standards more concrete, the state put out a new math curriculum for kindergarten through eighth grade. These were the standards used for the latest tests.
Now that the results are out, the next step, Mr. Mills said, is to use those results as a force to improve the curriculum and teaching.
"This is not a pop quiz," Mr. Mills, the education commissioner, said. "We had standards, curriculum, test results. If you don't like the results, what do you do? First of all, you look at what is actually taught in every school in every classroom."
Echoing Mr. Mills, several math teachers said yesterday that the concepts used in the eighth-grade test are not particularly difficult and that the problem is they have too often been taught by rote, or not at all.
Many elementary school teachers, they said, suffer from a kind of math phobia, often brought on by lack of training, that limits them to teaching simple calculation and formulas, without giving students a richer understanding of the abstract concepts the calculations are based on.
Martin Davis, a math teacher in New York City, said that he began the last school year by trying to teach algebra to his ninth graders at Bayard Rustin High School for Humanities in Manhattan. As they asked questions, he said, it became clear that many of them did not know how to multiply two double-digit numbers, and he had to start over.
"Theoretical math, in essence, is really play, it's games," said Mr. Davis, who has since moved to a different school. "If kids don't start playing those games and thinking about them, and thinking about strategies, they miss out on a great opportunity to succeed in seventh- or eighth-grade math."
Dr. Rizzo said she expected scores to improve when the test was given a second time this year. But even if they do not, she said, the city will use the next scores as one factor in determining whether students move to the next grade.
"If the kids don't have the skills and they're not going to succeed at the next grade level, what's the point?" she said.
Like Dr. Rizzo, officials in District 2, one of the city's most successful districts, which runs from TriBeCa to the Upper East Side, believe that teacher training is the key to success on the new test. For the last three years, the district has assigned master teachers to work all year long in classrooms with individual teachers and with groups of teachers.
"You can't teach what you don't know," said Lucy West, director of mathematics for District 2. Fifty-two percent of the district's eighth graders met the math standards, more than double the citywide average.
In a suburban setting, Sherry King, superintendent of Mamaroneck schools, said she chalked up the first year's performance to unfamiliarity with the test and to the problems of children who are in special education or who do not speak English fluently.
The tests, Dr. King said, are just one measure of what schools are doing right. "They don't pay any attention to our rich focus on the arts, to what we're doing in creating community, in keeping our schools from becoming like Columbine; to the growing issues of economic and social diversity."
Mr. Mills said he had little patience with the argument that disadvantaged children could not be held to the same standards as more affluent ones who came to school with more learning from home. In the job market, he said, they would all face the same demands.
"People don't say before we have this job interview, would you please tell me did you come from a good school or a bad school, an advantaged community or a disadvantaged community?" he said.
Susan S. Lewen, the mother of two children in Mamaroneck schools, said that while she took the test scores "with a grain of salt," she could not help but use them to compare schools.
Her son, Michael, now in the fourth grade, is being taught much more sophisticated math than her daughter, now in seventh grade, was taught just three years ago, she said. Michael has become skilled at writing his own mathematical story problems, long the bane of schoolchildren everywhere. He keeps a journal of his thoughts and ideas for English and a similar journal for math.
The schools are teaching to the test, Mrs. Lewen admitted, but to her surprise, she doesn't object. "I thought I might feel badly about it, but I don't," Mrs. Lewen said. "I think to some extent, this test does reflect best practice in the classroom."

HEADLINE: After 40 Years, New York-Havana Flights Will Resume

BYLINE: By MIRTA OJITO

 BODY:
Almost 40 years after the last Havana-bound commercial airplane took off from a New York City airport, flights between the two cities will resume next month, fulfilling one of the key elements of the Clinton administration's more relaxed policy toward Cuba.
The direct flights are expected to start Dec. 3 from Kennedy International Airport. While it will remain illegal for American tourists to travel to Cuba, the flights will make it easier and faster for the thousands of Cuban-Americans in the New York-New Jersey region to legally visit relatives on the island. 
 It will also ease travel for an increasing number of United States citizens from the Northeast traveling as scholars, journalists or members of religious groups, who are exempt from a provision of the American trade embargo on Cuba that prohibits traveling there. Until now, flying to Havana has required traveling through Miami, the Bahamas or Mexico.
Marazul Charters has been approved by both governments to handle the flights. The company, which has begun selling tickets from its office in Weehawken, N.J., has scheduled one flight per week to Cuba that will leave Kennedy at 8:35 p.m. on Fridays, with a return flight scheduled for before dawn every Saturday.
United States Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Harlem, who called the direct flights "a giant step for America," said he believed the flights would help normalize relations between the two countries and might encourage his colleagues in Congress to move toward lifting the decades-old embargo.
"There is no reason today why we can't trade with Cuba," Mr. Rangel said yesterday at a breakfast sponsored by Marazul Charters. "The more people travel to Cuba and come back with stories that the Cuban people really love us, the better it is."
About 140,000 United States citizens travel to Cuba every year, said John S. Kavulich II, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, a New York group that advocates the lifting of the embargo. About 25,000 travel illegally through third countries, he said.
Mr. Kavulich said 92 percent of the people who traveled to the island legally were Cuban-Americans with relatives there. He also said that American business people were increasingly traveling to the island in anticipation that the embargo would be lifted; by the end of this year, he said, 3,000 business people will have traveled to Cuba, 500 more than last year.
Francisco Aruca, president of Marazul Charters, said the bulk of his customers were among the 200,000 Cuban-Americans who live in the New York-New Jersey region, who now must travel to Miami to board a flight to Cuba. The direct flights from New York will be flown by Grupo Taca, an alliance of Central American airlines, and a round trip will cost $629; most of the 150 seats on the first flight have already been sold, Marazul officials said yesterday.
"With these flights we hope to provide needed services, but we are also creating a link between the financial capital of the world and Havana," said Mr. Aruca, who for years has been a loud anti-embargo voice among Cuban-Americans in Miami. "Within the law, we stand ready to facilitate communication between the two countries, in accordance with the new policy of the United States."
Earlier this year, President Clinton announced measures intended to increase contacts between people in the United States and the people of Cuba. They included expanding direct charter flights, allowing more Americans -- not just those with relatives on the island -- to send money to Cubans, establishing direct mail service and permitting the sale of food and agricultural supplies to nongovernmental entities.
The president's initiative was well received by those who oppose the embargo and by many who support it. Some supporters of the embargo, who fear that tourism would amount to economic support for Cuba's Communist leader, Fidel Castro, described the initiative as a sign that the president was committed to keep a tough policy toward Cuba while helping families. Opponents of sanctions said the president's announcement was an opening that could help unite the voices of people asking Congress to lift the embargo.
Armando Collazo, an official with the Cuban Interest Section in Washington, Cuba's only formal diplomatic presence in the United States, said yesterday that the direct flights would contribute to "normalcy in the communications and the relations between Cuban families, here and over there."
But Yvonne Conde, a free lance writer in Manhattan who left Cuba 38 years ago and has never been back, said she feared the flights would facilitate travel to Cuba for those who have no family there.
"Nowadays, anyone can be a scholar," she said. "Anybody can say they are doing research, when in fact it is tourism. I can't condemn anyone who goes to Cuba to see relatives, but I find tourism to Cuba appalling."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 10, 1999, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the resumption of direct flights from New York to Havana misstated the views of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council on the American trade embargo on Cuba. The council takes no position; it does not advocate lifting the embargo. The article also misstated the council's statistics on United States citizens who travel to Cuba. The council's president, John S. Kavulich II, estimated that 140,000 U.S. citizens would travel to Cuba this year; he did not say that 140,000 U.S. citizens travel there every year.

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT: THE BOSS;
Learning atMayor's Knee, Mayor La Guardia's Knee

BYLINE: By David Rockefeller with Richard A. Oppel Jr.; David Rockefeller, the patriarch of perhaps the most influential family business empire of this century, was an unpaid aide to Mayor Fiorello La Guardia in 1940 and 1941.

 BODY:
I was his aide for a year and a half. It was a $1-a-year proposition. I did a variety of things for him, like traveling with him in his big car when he visited a dedication of a big school or Department of Sanitation garages. He also gave me a number of special assignments, which included finding ways to get to La Guardia Airport and how they could increase their revenue by having shops and things like that.
He could change his manner very quickly. I would sit in his office while people would come in. An elderly lady would have a very sad story to report, and he would be extremely considerate and warm, and then some commissioner who had done something he didn't like would come in, and he'd fly into a rage and throw his glasses at him. 
 He could turn on whatever was needed in terms of attitude, depending on who it was. He was very versatile and very charismatic, but he could also be very angry and tough. But basically, I liked him very much. I remember when I got engaged to be married while I was with him, he took us out to Tavern on the Green. It was a nice thing for the mayor to do.
He taught me how to deal with many different people, even though one had no prior connection or background with them. He understood the role and importance of city government, and I think he helped me recognize the extraordinary diversity and complexity of the city and to realize that one was dealing with people of different backgrounds and needs and aspirations, and it was the responsibility of the mayor to be helpful to all those groups.
He was an extraordinarily colorful figure, and he had a sense of the audience he was talking to to a degree I've never seen. He would go to a school or some other gathering without having prepared anything and sense what the audience was interested in, and he'd always get loud applause.
He gave me a feel for the city I wouldn't have otherwise had. What I learned from him was an ability to deal with a broad variety of people. I realized one thing, that the city of New York was a great deal broader than Manhattan Island south of 96th Street.
The Chamber of Commerce for many years dealt mostly with the large businesses downtown; one who wanted to have organization really citywide had to include a large variety of people from many different ethnic and cultural groups and from many parts of the city and many economic levels, and the New York City Partnership a leading business advocacy group Mr. Rockefeller founded does. It was important that a private sector group that wanted to speak for the city was more inclusive. That had been my experience with the mayor.
This was a very good way to get a sense of city government and the relationship of the city to the private sector, and I feel very strongly that many activities should not be handled exclusively by either city government or the private sector.

HEADLINE: Scratching the Popular Itch to Switch Jobs

BYLINE: By CHARLES BUTLER 

 BODY:
Sally Poliak will never forget her political victories. She also never wants to relive them.
For nearly 14 years, starting shortly after graduating from college in 1983, Ms. Poliak was a top Republican Party consultant in Washington State. From her Seattle headquarters, she ran campaigns for offices ranging from county commissioner to member of Congress. She also organized fund-raising events, including several for former President George Bush. Her political high point came in November 1994 when she won $200 in the Hacks and Flacks pool, an election-day wager among political consultants and reporters in the Seattle area, even as more than two dozen state legislative candidates she represented won office. 
 It should have been a dream job. At a young age, Ms. Poliak was making her mark on Republican politics of a large state, quite an accomplishment considering that she had been born into a family of Democrats and that her father, Paul Poliak, was campaign treasurer for Brock Adams, who was a Democratic Senator from Washington. Between campaigns, she had time to ski and travel and once took three months off to go scuba diving in the South Pacific. Best of all, she was her own boss. In 1993, she and a partner started a consulting company, Polis Political Services, and it thrived.
But by the spring of 1996, the political passions that had burned since the early 1970's, when she and her family debated Richard M. Nixon's policies over dinner, began to wane. The repetitiveness of developing strategies, polling voters and tweaking campaign messages had become a grind. So, in April 1997, she left her business, took a pay cut and joined the legions of marketing professionals at the Microsoft Corporation, in suburban Redmond.
"I had burned out of politics," said Ms. Poliak, now 38. "There were no new challenges. It was like, 'I have been to the peak and I'm beginning to slide down the back slope.' I wanted to get out before I became like a lot of my friends who hated their jobs."
Ms. Poliak, join the crowd. As the baby-boom generation ages, the inclination of those in its ranks to strike out in different directions is finding fertile soil in the booming economy. As corporations downsized in the first half of the 1990's, managers and other professionals became used to the idea of switching jobs, albeit by way of the pink slip. Now, with labor shortages forcing employers to beg for help, people with marketable skills are discovering how easy it is to switch their working way of life. "Because the economy is good, people are more verbal about what stresses them and are willing to risk making a change," said Harold Weinstein, a consultant with Caliper Human Strategies Inc. in Princeton, N.J.
Sometimes the motive is to make more money; sometimes it is boredom, or a longing to fulfill a childhood ambition.
For Joe Benigno, it was a transport to his true calling. For 18 years, Mr. Benigno was a food distributor, most recently selling gourmet fare like French jams and British teas to Manhattan supermarkets. But sports was his love, and he was such a regular caller to WFAN-AM, the New York all-sports radio station, that the station's hosts dubbed him "Joe from Saddle River," his New Jersey town.
In 1994, WFAN invited him to come on air for an hour. It was a gimmick, but he was such a hit that eight months later, he was offered a job as host of the station's overnight show. He quit his sales job that day.
"When I was a salesman, all I ever thought about was sports," said Mr. Benigno, 46, who makes about as much as he did in his good years as a salesman. "I knew that some day I had to find my way into it."
Quitting a lifetime vocation for a new line of work was not unheard of a decade or even a century ago, of course. But until recently, lifetime loyalty to the employer was still the ideal, and switching professional gears was often prompted by incompetence or a desire to make more money.
In 1976, for example, Peter Rubolotta ended an eight-year stint as a high school teacher in New Jersey to become a stockbroker at Merrill Lynch. Even though he got an immediate 25 percent raise, to $15,000 from $12,000, friends thought he was making a mistake by giving up his job tenure. "Now everybody tells me I did the right thing," said Mr. Rubolotta, 53, who still works for Merrill Lynch in Florham Park, N.J.
Sometimes, the urge to move on to something new can be overpowering. Ms. Poliak says her lagging interest in political work had made her "lethargic." Her enthusiasm for playing tennis and soccer flagged, she said, and she stopped frequenting jazz clubs that she had haunted for years.
Then, over coffee at a Starbuck's cafe one day in April 1996, she informed her business partner, Stan Shore, that she was going to quit after the fall election, even though she had no idea what she would do next.
In the ensuing months, she rummaged through boxes of high school memorabilia looking for inspiration, and even jotted down lists of things she wanted to avoid in her next career. At the top was the anxiety of meeting payroll and the drudgery of keeping track of billable hours. "That ruled out working in an agency," she said.
Finally, in December, still with no grand aspirations, she took a friend up on a suggestion to seek an interview at Microsoft. A few months later, the company offered her a job, even though she had no experience in technology.
That very lack was almost a plus, to hear Microsoft tell it. "She is smart, likes to learn and is a risk-taker," said Lisa Kelley, her boss. "Changing your career in midlife is risky."
When she started her new job in April 1997, Ms. Poliak left behind her Rolodex of political contacts and photographs that showed her chatting with the likes of Dan Quayle and Barbara Bush. She did not want the relics of her old career to distract her from learning the software acronyms and marketing strategies of her new one.
She proved a quick study; soon, her colleagues were calling her Dr. Poliak, and she developed a new direct-mail program for her division. Eighteen months after she arrived, she was promoted to management.
She has also discovered something else about herself: She is not a morning person. "Politics has 7 a.m. meetings," Ms. Poliak said. "That just doesn't happen here. It is much more civilized."

Memories of Berlin
 
More than 250 paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints, books, poems, letters, posters and theater memorabilia will go on display beginning on Sunday at the Jewish Museum. Running through April 23, "Berlin Metropolis: Jews and the New Culture, 1890-1918" will focus on a city of rapid economic, social and physical growth at a time when Jews were central to the development of its modern culture. Among the artists represented are Wassily Kandinsky, Oskar Kokoschka, Robert Delaunay and Edvard Munch. 

Global Picture
 
Babar and Celeste will deliver greetings. So will Wallace and Gromit, and Blondie and Dagwood. They won't be alone. Tapping 22 countries, the Museum of Television and Radio in cooperation with the United Nations will present the Eighth International Children's Television Festival beginning on Saturday. On weekends through Dec. 5 in New York and through Nov. 28 in Los Angeles, where the series began last Saturday, the museum will screen outstanding children's programming in an effort to foster cross-cultural awareness.
 
Saving Adelia
 
A serious opera by Donizetti with a happy ending for its heroine will have what is described at its United States premiere when Eve Queler's Opera Orchestra of New York performs it in concert version at 8 tomorrow night in Carnegie Hall. The work is "Adelia," first performed at the Teatro Apollo in Rome in the 1840-41 season and, though well received, something of a rarity afterward. But the Italian lyric soprano Mariella Devia, who recently gave the first performance in modern times in Genoa, will sing the title role at Carnegie Hall in a cast including the bass Paul Plishka, the tenor Warren Mok and the baritone Stephan Pyatnychko. The original plot called for the heroine to leap to her doom from her balcony. But Roman censors forbade depiction of suicide, so Donizetti changed "Adelia" to allow his heroine and her true love to live happily ever after.
 
Hand and Foot
 
Throughout New York City, 41 artists including Christo and Jean-Claude, Andres Serrano, Dale Chihuly, Sandro Chia, Joel Shapiro, Cecily Brown and Damian Loeb will open their studios from 2 to 5 p.m. on Saturday for 13 walking tours that are part of the Fifth Annual Artwalk NY. The daylong event, presented by the Coalition for the Homeless, begins at 11 a.m. with a slide lecture in the Puck Building, 295 Lafayette Street in SoHo. It ends there with a 6:30 p.m. reception and auction of some 175 donated works of art to benefit the homeless.

Does Social Class Matter in School?

BYLINE: By Richard Rothstein 

 BODY:
A DANGEROUS myth was once conventional -- that disadvantaged children could not learn. So poor children were assigned to tracks and taught less challenging lessons. Educators took little responsibility for low achievement, blaming children's poverty and home lives.
Many schools still deliver diluted curriculums to poor and minority children, from whom teachers expect little. 
 Yet there has been a reaction. The New York Regents now insist that children of all backgrounds show similar achievement. Parents today, by a ratio of three to one, tell pollsters that all children should be held to identical standards. We have gone overboard. To counter the earlier myth, we have developed a new, equally dangerous one: that social class no longer matters in education and that all children, regardless of background, can achieve to the same high standards if only schools demand it. We term schools, regardless of who attends them, "successful" if average test scores are above the median (typically termed "grade level" performance), and "failing" if below.
We cannot seriously believe this. Consider how typical middle-class families raise children. Infants' first toys are "touch and feel" books. Toddlers soon "read" stories from memory. Magnetic letters decorate refrigerator doors. Sitting on parents' laps, children "help" compose on computers before they can talk.
These children then attend preschool with equally verbal toddlers. They adopt family assumptions that someday they too will become professionals. Expected to attend college, the only question is how selective it will be.
But other children's homes are without books, magnetic letters or computers. These children have day care, not preschool. Some enter kindergarten not knowing how to hold pencils. Their poorly paid parents are unlikely to have attended college. Television, not newspapers, dominates their homes. In economically and racially segregated neighborhoods, their play and schoolmates have similar experiences.
Do we really expect typical children in poor communities, even in good schools, to achieve just like typical children in schools where most had a middle-class "head start?" In truth, schools with privileged children should be termed failing if they test only at the 70th percentile. Though already well above grade level, they should do even better. A school with many poor children, scoring at the 35th percentile, could be highly successful, though it tests below average. Nothing could be more dangerous to education reform than schemes to reward the first and penalize the second. By labeling all schools in poor communities with below-norm achievement failing (and all suburban schools successful), we paralyze our ability to distinguish good schools from bad.
Demography is not destiny. Some poor children will, with effort, natural ability and good schooling, achieve more than most privileged children. "Rags to riches" stories abound -- some disadvantaged children excel in school and became leaders. But these stories are not universal. On average, with equal school quality, children with more academic support at home will have higher achievement. The power of social class will not disappear if we pretend it does not exist.
Can we avoid the defeatist myth, that schools make no difference, without bouncing to the other extreme, that they make all the difference? From taking too little responsibility, must schools now take too much?
In the 1980's, South Carolina sought a middle ground, holding all schools to higher standards -- but not the same standards. It categorized schools in five bands, based on average poverty, and gave bonuses to the best performers within each band. To win, the best schools serving children of textile-mill workers did not have to outscore schools serving children of urban professionals. Schools were rewarded when teachers evoked higher achievement than was typical in similar communities. The state later abandoned this daring but controversial program. But it was the right idea.
With similar insight, the advocacy group Education Trust this year identified schools where most children were poor, but where scores were higher than in other high-poverty schools. It described practices that might have caused this achievement -- more attention to standards, or better staff training, for example.
Better schools can narrow the gaps between typical achievement of poor and middle-class students. But significant gaps will remain. To figure out how these schools succeed, and to imitate them, we will have to understand the gaps we have closed, not focus only on those that remain. If we want schools to make a difference, we will need more sensible assessments of how much of a difference it can be.

HEADLINE: How to Get Paid Not to Work

BYLINE: By Jerry Jasinowski; Jerry Jasinowski is president of the National Association of Manufacturers.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Naturally government and employers want to help Americans balance their family lives and their jobs. But the Clinton administration's plan to let states use unemployment insurance money to pay employees on leave after the birth of children is shortsighted, misguided and politically motivated.
Unemployment insurance is a rainy day fund, and during periods of recession like the late 70's and early 80's, it has come perilously close to bankruptcy in some states. It's easy to forget those bad times as we enjoy an unprecedented economic expansion, but it is dangerously myopic to ignore the cyclical nature of our economy. 
 With the number of women eligible to take advantage of paid leave under the Clinton proposal as high as 1.9 million a year, the policy that Mr. Clinton recommends would seriously drain unemployment insurance funds, even without the inevitable economic downturn. And this number does not even consider the significant number of men who could be eligible to collect these benefits as well.
Unemployment insurance is supposed to help keep the unemployed afloat while they look for new jobs. Workers taking leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act are in a different situation altogether. They are voluntarily stepping out of the work force and are entitled to go back to their jobs after three months.
Most manufacturers have adopted programs to help their employees balance work and family life. They have found that flexible scheduling, expanded birth and adoption leave, on-site day care and other programs for parents help boost morale, productivity and retention of employees.
Undermining the unemployment safety net by dipping into what looks like a leftover pot of money during good times is the wrong way to help working parents.
By unilaterally moving forward with this proposal, despite objections from members of Congress, employers and -- most importantly -- state officials who administer the unemployment insurance system, President Clinton has shown that he is more interested in fulfilling old campaign promises to make the family leave law a government-run paid-leave program than in fiscally sound public policy.

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT: Soothing Savage Structures;
A Leaderless Orchestra Offers Lessons for Business

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
It seemed to be magic. Music burst forth from two dozen string and wind instruments in perfect synchronization, without a conductor to summon it.
An hour later, during a break, the business school students who had been watching the chamber orchestra rehearse had the same question: How did you all start playing at the same moment? 
 "Body gestures," Eriko Sato, the first violinist on the piece, Telemann's "Water Music," said as she shrugged her shoulders to demonstrate. The musicians watch one another closely, they explained, and as each new movement begins, they know where to look for their cue.
This is Orpheus, the orchestra with no conductor and the ultimate flat, nonhierarchical organization. Its members had come to the Zicklin School of Business at Baruch College, the only M.B.A.-granting public school in New York City, to explain how they won three Grammys this year and have become an annual fixture at Carnegie Hall without ever having an onstage boss.
It was a compelling sight: Artists who make about $30,000 a year teaching would-be executives who will bring home twice that in their first year out of school. But Orpheus has more in common with some of America's largest companies than the casual observer might think. The group has become a living, and entertaining, microcosm of a management theory that has been transforming corporate America throughout the 1990's.
Spurred first by the corporate downsizing that began the decade and then by the Internet explosion that is ending it, hundreds of American companies are trying to become "flatter" by removing management layers between top executives and people in the field. The movement began as an effort to cut costs, but it has picked up steam, even during the current economic expansion, as executives try to reshape their companies to react quickly to technological change.
"Speed is becoming the most important criterion for growth and survival," said C. K. Prahalad, a professor at the University of Michigan Business School who has advised Citicorp and Oracle. "That is taking decision-making and accountability to levels that are closest to the business."
A 1996 survey of large companies by the Center for Effective Organizations at the University of Southern California found that 78 percent had removed at least one layer of management in the previous decade, while 14 percent reported getting rid of at least three.
The proponents of flatter structures are some of the best-performing companies of the 1990's, like Wal-Mart and Cisco Systems. "The more nodes in a communications link, the more likely it is that bad information goes up to the top," said Steven Kerr, the vice president for leadership development at General Electric, which has tried to remove management layers. At their worst, Mr. Kerr added, bureaucratic organizations can resemble the childhood game of telephone, in which children line up and pass a whispered message from one to the next, only to have the end result barely resemble the original statement.
Orpheus -- named for a mythological Greek character whose beautiful music tamed wild beasts -- has never needed to eliminate layers because, onstage at least, it has never had any. Julian Fifer, a cellist, and a few friends founded the group in 1972 with the aim of replicating the give-and-take of small chamber music groups in the larger setting of a chamber orchestra.
For every piece, a core group of musicians meets to decide how to play it. The first violinist, known as the concertmaster, typically leads the rehearsals, distilling the core group's plan into one voice. During pauses, other musicians call out suggestions, or objections, and hold smaller debates within their section of the orchestra.
When disagreements arise, Orpheus members try to talk them out until they reach a consensus. Failing that, they take a vote.
It is not always smooth sailing. Last year, Mr. Fifer, who had stopped playing with the group in 1990, stepped down as its executive director, a job in which he oversaw the group's schedule and business matters. His resignation came after he had clashed with group members who thought Orpheus was spending too much time on international tours.
Without a conductor to make final decisions, smaller matters can be tricky, too. At the Zicklin School rehearsal, the students noticed that some musicians had spoken much more often than others and wondered whether more outgoing people had too big a say in decisions. Many of the musicians smiled, to acknowledge that this was an issue, but said they tried to speak up frequently only when they were members of the core group.
As a whole, however, they are not shy about offering criticism. At Zicklin, for example, Nardo Poy, a violist, stood up at one point and said, "I know it's water music, but it sounds like it's a little at sea." At another break, Ms. Sato politely but firmly dismissed a criticism by waving her hand and saying, "We are working on this."
In a standard orchestra, where the conductor is king, such give-and-take is virtually unheard of. Much as a corporate vice president's word can be final in a highly structured company, musicians do not question a conductor during rehearsal. One result is a message that is clear but, Orpheus members say, stifles creativity.
Renee Jolles, a violinist who plays with the group frequently, said, "When you play with a conductor, it's easy to sit there and do what you're told." Orpheus members, by contrast, are willing to lend advice to other musicians, knowing that critiquing the performance is not the job solely of one person.
"Orpheus gives every individual the opportunity to lead," said Harvey Seifter, the current executive director. "But it also creates an imperative that everyone pull together."
That seeming contradiction has helped the group land consulting gigs. Earlier this year, Kraft Foods invited Orpheus to its Illinois headquarters in an attempt to teach product managers to be more honest about their disagreements, Mr. Seifter said. And over the next two years, the orchestra will hold seminars for hospital administrators in the United States and for companies in Berlin and Paris. Eventually, Mr. Seifter said, 10 percent of the orchestra's income could come from such activities.
Companies, for their part, are hoping that shedding bureaucracy will help them replicate the connection that Orpheus members, who often devote hours to hashing out musical decisions, feel to the group. That connection can reduce employee turnover, which has become a crucial issue for businesses as the unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level in 29 years.
Sturman Industries, a mechanical-valve designer in Woodland Park, Colo., might be considered the Orpheus of the corporate world. The 140-person company is split into 12 functional groups, each with a coordinator who oversees administrative functions and can make final decisions when a consensus is unreachable. Other than the coordinators and the company's president, Carol Sturman, nobody has a title.
"It's not the easy route," Ms. Sturman said, because people are used to working in a more structured environment and are sometimes confused about what to do. But it has paid off: Sales at Sturman, a privately held company, are expected to increase 60 percent this year. And since moving to Colorado from California three years ago, the company said it had lost only four employees, a remarkable retention rate in the current labor market.
The move toward flatter organizations shows little sign of abating. Management textbooks, which once extolled "seven-by-seven" companies that had seven levels of management and assigned seven workers to most managers, now trumpet the elimination of hierarchy.
Business schools besides Zicklin are training their students to work in a less structured world, too. At the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, for example, Prof. Michael Useem has brought an improvisational acting group into his classroom and led a group of M.B.A.'s on trekking trips in the Himalayas, all with an eye to better understanding how less structured groups interact.
"When you have a hierarchical structure, you can get away with having managers who get people to do things because of their position," said Mike Jenner, who teaches leadership at the University of Chicago. The more relevant question now, he said, is "how can you manage the performance of others when you don't have the power over them?"

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
The latest surcharge at many hotels intends to make guests pay for using phone lines too long.

BYLINE: By Jane L. Levere; The Business Travel column appears each Wednesday. The electronic-mail address for Jane L. Levere is levere@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
TO keep guests from plugging in their laptops for hours and tying up trunk lines, a growing number of hotels are imposing new fees on extended use of local and toll-free telephone numbers.
Sheraton, Westin and Four Points hotels, all Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide chains, are the latest to charge these fees. The three companies impose a surcharge of 10 cents a minute on toll-free calls that last longer than 60 minutes. 
 Last year, the Hilton Hotels Corporation set a similar policy; its hotels charge 10 cents a minute for local and toll-free calls longer than 30 minutes.
In most markets, Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, a unit of Wyndham International, is charging between 25 cents and 95 cents for both local and toll-free calls, regardless of length. Les Bentley, Wyndham Hotels' president, said, though, that this policy is not enforced in many suburban markets, or if guests complain.
The Hyatt Hotels Corporation is now conducting a trial at the Hyatt Regency Chicago in which it is charging a fee of 10 cents a minute for toll-free calls that are longer than 20 minutes, according to Gary Ross, a spokesman for Hyatt. He said that the test would last another few months, but that he could not comment on findings so far.
And Jennifer Ploszaj, a spokeswoman for Bass Hotels and Resorts, a division of Bass P.L.C., said that United States hotels operated under the Bass Inter-Continental brand could charge a fee for toll-free calls if desired for competitive reasons. But she said that other Bass hotel brands -- which include Holiday Inn, Holiday Inn Express and Crowne Plaza Hotels and Resorts -- were not charging such fees.
Julieann Knudsen, manager of telecommunications for Carlson Hospitality Worldwide, which operates Radisson and Country Inns and Suites hotels, said the company had considered imposing fees on lengthy toll-free phone calls, but so far had decided not to charge them. And a spokesman for Marriott International said that his company -- whose chains include Marriott, Courtyard by Marriott, Fairfield Inn, Residence Inn and Renaissance hotels -- has no plans to impose such fees.
Many hotel companies say that once they offer high-speed Internet access in guest rooms -- something many are in the process of installing -- the phone-line problem caused by laptop users will end.
But Charles Rutstein, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., disagrees. He said it would "probably be another couple of years before employees of the majority of U.S. companies can use the Internet for a secure connection to their home network. In the meantime, a lot of companies will still require employees to dial up directly to get their e-mail or contact headquarters."
Bjorn Hanson, who heads the lodging practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said that an even greater number of hotels independently impose phone surcharges than their management companies realize; he believes almost half of all hotels in the United States impose such fees. And he predicted that 65 percent of all American hotels would charge these fees in the next few years.
Hotels have imposed these fees -- along with new or higher fees for parking, minibar items and business center services -- to generate revenue as occupancy rates decline, he said. And he said that they are not always using income from the telephone fees to upgrade their telecommunications systems.
Mr. Rutstein said such upgrades are actually not necessary in the long run because travelers will eventually be able to access their corporate network through the Internet.
 
Parking at Newark Airport
 The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is eliminating 540 parking spaces in the parking lots of Terminal C at Newark International Airport as it begins a $1.5 billion redevelopment program there.
Alternate parking for travelers who normally use Terminal C's daily parking lot is available in the daily parking lots of terminals A and B; in the valet parking next to monorail station E; and in monorail parking lots D and E.
Port Authority officials are advising travelers to allow an extra 30 minutes to park while the redevelopment program is underway. It is slated to be completed in two years.
 
Airline Update
 Trans World Airlines is giving small businesses special benefits if they spend a minimum of $7,500 a quarter traveling on the carrier. Benefits include upgrades on domestic flights, free domestic tickets, membership in T.W.A.'s airport lounges, and elite status in its frequent-flier program. A maximum of 10 employees of each company can participate in the program; all must join T.W.A.'s frequent-flier program.
US Airways is showing programming from the FOX News Channel on its A320 shuttle flights between LaGuardia Airport in New York and both Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington and Logan International Airport in Boston.

HEADLINE: For the Wall's Fall, East Germans Are Given Their Due

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Nov. 9

 BODY:
At a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder made very clear today which Germans deserve special praise, saying, "The wall fell from east to west, pushed down by brave and fearless East Germans."
Mr. Schroder, addressing Parliament in the presence of former President George Bush, seemed at pains to assuage the feelings of bitterness felt by some eastern Germans over the alienation and high unemployment that have accompanied unification. He called their "civil courage" a lesson to Germany. 
 But the Rev. Joachim Gauck, a leading protester in 1989 who was hurriedly added to today's ceremony after complaints that former East Germans had been excluded, had a grimmer view. "After reunification, many of us felt like strangers in our own country," he said. "We dreamed of paradise and woke up in North-Rhine Westphalia."
The chancellor's reference to "Zivilcourage" was particularly resonant on a day that also marks the 61st anniversary of the Nazi rampage against the Jews known as Kristallnacht. Mr. Schroder clearly wanted to suggest that more acts of conscience and courage like those in East Germany a decade ago might have hindered or halted Hitler.
The word Zivilcourage has become a rallying cry of modern German identity, a shorthand for "never again" to the destruction and burning of synagogues and Jewish stores on Nov. 9, 1938, and the Holocaust, which followed. "November 9th is a day of joy, but also a day of shame and a time of reflection," Mr. Schroder said. "It is a day of euphoria but also a day, in 1938, that led to an abyss of inhumanity."
This being Germany, it was perhaps inevitable that light and dark should so mingle a decade after Europe's division was ended and half a continent was set free. Few public expressions of emotion or pride, it seems, ever contrive to be altogether unclouded by Hitler's long shadow.
But in general it was celebration that prevailed as the former Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and former Chancellor Helmut Kohl joined Mr. Bush in the refurbished Reichstag, home once again to the German Parliament.
Mr. Bush said there had been many difficult moments in his presidency, among them the military campaign against Iraq, but "in many ways no situation was as dicey as the one we all faced on Nov. 9, 1989."
On a television in the study next to the Oval Office, Mr. Bush watched a decade ago what he called the "surreal sight" of East Germans streaming through the breached wall. His joy, he said, was tempered by concern over a backlash like the one that quashed the Prague Spring democracy movement of 1968.
"Some of our leaders on Capitol Hill suggested that I come over here to the Berlin Wall and dance on the wall," Mr. Bush said, conjuring up an altogether unlikely image. "In my view that would have been an open provocation, tantamount to sticking our fingers in the eyes of the Soviet military."
The former president, made an "honorary citizen" of Berlin on Monday, was clearly at pains to defend his cautious initial statement that he was "very pleased" by the fall of the Berlin Wall. At the time, the path that would lead from the wall's breach to German unification 11 months later was by no means charted. Indeed, there was no sign that the Soviet Union was prepared to accept the unification of Germany, particularly in such a way that Germany remained within NATO.
Mr. Kohl reminded the Parliament that it was not just Russia that viewed a united Germany with suspicion a decade ago. "Mr. Bush saw that a free Germany, a sovereign Germany would have to be a united Germany, and that was important because many others were very difficult to convince," he said.
The skeptics included Francois Mitterrand, the former French president, who was fond of the old quip that Germany was such a splendid place, it was a good thing there were two of them. Margaret Thatcher was equally hesitant. The absence of a British or French leader at today's Berlin ceremony was striking.
Mr. Gorbachev, looking wan after the recent death of his wife, Raisa, recalled the intense sparring between himself, Mr. Bush and Mr. Kohl over whether Germany should remain in NATO. He suggested that the contribution of the east bloc, and particularly East German politicians, to peaceful unification within NATO had been unfairly belittled.
"There are some undercurrents in your life that I just do not understand," he said. "It is strange that right now you are sentencing those very people from the East German leadership who decided to make the world transparent."
Egon Krenz, the former East German leader who ruled for six weeks before the Berlin Wall fell, lost an appeal on Monday of a six-and-a-half-year sentence for his role in the shootings of people who tried to escape over the wall. More than 450 people were killed during the wall's 28-year existence.
Mr. Gorbachev's criticism was met by a frosty silence in the Reichstag building, but in general the mood was self-congratulatory and festive as Mr. Schroder painted a picture of "a second chance for Germany and Europe" that should lead to a united continent at peace.
"Ten years after the fall of the wall, Europe must not be divided by a 'prosperity border' between the European Union and its eastern neighbors," he said. Nor, Mr. Schroder continued, "can Europe any longer accept the trampling of human rights, as the Kosovo campaign shows."
The chancellor said Germany would work energetically to bring countries like Poland into the European Union. In fact, well before the "civil courage" of East Germans became manifest, it was the Poles and their Solidarity union that set Europe on the road to ending the cold war.
Mr. Schroder acknowledged this, thanking Poland and other central European countries for helping Germany out of its postwar division.
The unification that came on Oct. 3, 1990, brought initial euphoria, but was followed by what Mr. Gauck, who is now in charge of analyzing and releasing the six million files of the East German Stasi, or secret police, for East Germany's 17 million people, today called "feelings of helplessness and disappointment" in the eastern part of the country.
Unemployment soared in the east, growing to more than double western levels. Humiliated and feeling worthless, some "Ossis" came to see "Wessis" as arrogant in their wholesale takeover of the country; "Wessis," in turn, started to resent large transfers of public money eastward.
But alongside those resentments, a staggeringly rapid transformation took place, bringing modern telecommunications, new industries, new roads and new possibilities to a once decaying, gloomy eastern landscape.
Mr. Schroder insisted that Berlin should remember those achievements and today live "a moment of joy." Concerts, light shows, parties and fireworks were among the attractions offered to express that joy in a city still searching through light and shadow to make itself one after a century of almost relentless trauma.

HEADLINE: EDUCATION;
Helping City Schools Bring a Taste of the Arts to Students

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
After a long morning of drills in reading, third graders at Public School 156 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, spent an hour last Friday dancing to the urgent flutter of flamenco music. Their small hands spiraled and their sneakers thumped as a professional dancer, Andrea Del Conte, guided them through stomps and whirls in a classroom with mirrored walls and glossy floors.
Dance is an indispensable part of the curriculum for all 750 students at P.S. 156, along with music, art and creative writing. Poems paper the school walls, parents sew costumes for special dance performances, and teachers gamely join students in daily artistic experiments linked to the subjects they are studying. Flamenco, for example, ties into social studies and language arts lessons on the history and culture of Spain. 
 The school has developed a comprehensive arts program not on its own, but in partnership with several of New York City's nonprofit cultural institutions whose employees have advised the teachers, helped write the curriculum and frequently visited the classrooms to teach students about different art forms.
For the last two decades, schools like P.S. 156 have increasingly turned to the city's museums, concert halls and theaters for lessons in art, music and dance. They began to do so in the 1970's, when the city's near-bankruptcy eliminated hundreds of arts instructors. Now, cultural institutions as large as the New York Philharmonic and as small as neighborhood dance troupes have become a permanent part of the city's educational landscape. Even though the city is investing in arts education again, the institutions are playing a greater role than ever, not just giving occasional performances or tours as they once did, but helping schools retool their curriculums to integrate art, music and dance into every academic subject.
The institutions are becoming more involved not just to improve arts education, but out of self-interest: They want to cultivate future audiences and impress potential donors at a time when improving public education is considered an especially pressing and honorable cause.
Carnegie Hall spends close to $1 million a year training teachers to use music in the classroom, putting on concerts for school children and sending musicians to 22 schools across the city for seven visits per class over a school year. The Roundabout Theater sends teaching artists to 40 classrooms in the city for 10 visits each. Those artists teach students about reading, writing, directing and acting in plays as part of their language arts and social studies curriculums.
And artists from Lotus Music and Dance Studios in Chelsea work intensively with six schools across the city, including P.S. 156, teaching students about the music and dance of different cultures.
The enthusiasm for such programs is striking at a time when city schools are under intense pressure to prepare students for increasingly rigorous standardized tests. But while Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Chancellor Rudy Crew have goaded schools to focus on reading and math, they have also increased the arts education budget by $150 million since 1997, providing about 1,000 art and music teachers and badly needed supplies for the city's 1,100 public schools.
That investment is not enough to bring the arts into every classroom, but in this flush economy, private foundations are joining cultural institutions in spending money on arts education partnerships. Most notably, the philanthropist Walter Annenberg pledged $12 million to New York City schools in 1993 for academic offerings in the arts in a matching-fund program that is to total $36 million. So far, 81 schools have received grants, most of them $75,000 a year, to develop programs with nonprofit institutions.
"The question now is not whether to teach the arts, but how to put them at the core of everything a school does," said Hollis Headrick, executive director of the Center for Arts Education, which oversees the Annenberg partnerships.
Even with the infusion of money and the enthusiasm of cultural institutions, progress in arts education is slow. Some institutions report tensions with teachers who say the programs occupy too much of their time. And so far, only the most motivated schools are truly integrating the arts into their curriculums, a process that requires extra work and money and a willingness to change teaching styles and methods drastically.
This week, educators from 40 countries are discussing how to speed the progress at the International Conference on the Future of Arts Education, sponsored by the New York International Festival of the Arts, at I.B.M.'s conference site in Palisades, N.Y. "We still need to teach the basic skills, but students today need an education that recognizes a much wider range of intellectual abilities and ways of communicating," said Ken Robinson, co-chairman of the conference and a professor of arts education at the University of Warwick in England.
Despite the booming economy, most arts organizations charge schools a fee for their expertise, ranging from a few dollars per student for a single lecture or performance to upward of $50,000 for ongoing classroom visits and teacher training by several teaching artists.
"It takes so much extra work to start something like this," said Verano LaRue, the arts education specialist at Lotus Music and Dance Studios, which P.S. 156 is paying about $40,000 this year to incorporate dance into the school's curriculum.
At P.S. 156 last week, the principal, Martha Rodriguez-Torres, nodded approvingly at a teacher and an aide who were learning steps with the young flamenco dancers, then walked down the hall to offer encouragement to fifth graders writing poems about things that comfort them -- part of a project on Native Americans that uses the help of another cultural group, Teachers and Writers Collaborative.
"Come on, Dennis, let the ideas flow through you!" she told a boy who had put down his pencil after writing one line. And she clapped loudly when another student read a poem that began, "Oh dresser drawer, you smell so good with your aroma of fried chicken."
Ms. Rodriguez-Torres said that reading and math scores at P.S. 156, while still relatively low, have improved since the school won an Annenberg grant two years ago that has allowed it to work closely with cultural institutions.
"Our reading scores have improved every year, and I can say that our children now enjoy writing," Ms. Rodriguez-Torres said.
But even schools whose principals and teachers highly value the arts may have to work hard to convince parents and even students that they are as important an academic subject as math, reading and science. After ebulliently whirling to the flamenco music last week, Katherine Nevarez, a third grader, solemnly said that while the rhythms lingered in her mind all day, dancing was not her favorite subject. "When we do it, it's fun," she said. "But my uncle told me that if I study math I'll get a college degree."
One way of getting families to value the arts as much as they value math is to measure student progress with traditional assessment tools, and New York State has started doing so by introducing standards that outline what students should learn through arts instruction. But Terry L. Baker, an education consultant who is trying to measure the effectiveness of the Annenberg programs, said educators still are not sure how to assess a student's grasp of such "abstract, emotional and spiritual" subjects as music and painting.
"If the arts are going to be taken seriously, they have to be held accountable in the same way that other disciplines are," he said. "But we are still some distance from figuring out the best way to do that."

HEADLINE: Oversight of Derivatives Said to Be Adequate

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
Despite the collapse of a giant hedge fund last year that required a rescue arranged by the Federal Reserve, top government regulators have concluded that they do not need to supervise the use of complex financial contracts by hedge funds or other institutions.
Four government agencies that oversee banks, brokerage houses and financial markets dismissed the idea that regulators need fresh power to police financial derivatives that are traded privately, or over the counter. The conclusion was contained in a report to Congress, which had requested the review. It strikes a blow against those who had sought more official oversight of the multitrillion dollar derivatives market. 
 Congress had asked a working group of four agencies -- the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department -- to consider the issue even before the rescue of Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge fund based in Greenwich, Conn., that nearly collapsed, roiling financial markets in September 1998. But the fund's near-collapse added urgency to the study, with some in Congress and the academic world expressing concern that loose regulation of derivatives might have contributed to the troubles.
Long-Term Capital lost about $4 billion when bets it had placed in stock and bond markets -- most through private derivatives contracts -- went bad. Wall Street banks and brokerage firms saved the hedge fund to prevent what some feared might be global financial panic.
The same working group made recommendations on supervision of hedge funds earlier this year. The group said then that hedge funds should reveal more about their risk profile to the public, and that banks and brokerage houses that deal with hedge funds should take steps to make sure that the use of borrowed money does not get out of hand.
But in the latest report the regulators sided with people in the financial industry in recommending against any direct supervision of derivatives, which are contracts based on stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies. Privately traded derivatives are a major part of everyday business for banks, securities firms, hedge funds, and many companies looking to protect their assets against some future financial event.
"It's really a small number of people who wanted any kind of new regulation," said Bradley P. Ziff, an expert on derivatives and risk at the consulting firm Arthur Andersen.

$558 Million Ordered Repaid In Stock Grants

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
FOR want of a clause, a fortune was lost.
A Delaware judge ruled yesterday that the three top executives of Computer Associates must return company stock worth more than half a billion dollars, part of an enormous stock grant that infuriated shareholders last year. The judge found that the executives' pay contract lacked a provision authorizing adjustments in the number of shares awarded in the event of stock splits. 
 The executives were ordered to return 9.5 million of the 20.25 million shares they received. The 9.5 million shares are worth almost $558 million, based on yesterday's price, a sum that approaches the $626 million profit that the company, based in Islandia, N.Y., earned in the year ended March 1.
The issues in the case were so clear, Vice Chancellor Myron Steele of Delaware Chancery Court wrote in his 33-page opinion, that he did not need to hold a trial to rule that Computer Associates' directors had improperly given away more stock than shareholders had authorized.
The language in the performance pay contract was straightforward, the judge wrote, ruling solely on the basis of pleadings from both sides. He said the company and the three executives wanted him to read the contract in a way that "distorts the plan's plain language."
Computer Associates said it might appeal because the "decision runs counter to the reasonable expectations that all the parties had when the plan was approved" by shareholders.
The stock award was widely criticized at the time as excessive, even by the lavish standards of executive pay that have made some chief executives billionaires. The 20.25 million shares were worth $1.1 billion, or 3.75 percent of the company's value, in May 1998, when the bulk of the shares were awarded after a stock price target had been met.
Charles B. Wang, the chief executive, received a total of 12.15 million shares worth $669.8 million; Sanjay Kumar, the president, received 6.075 million shares worth $334.9 million, and Russell M. Artzt, the executive vice president, received 2.025 million shares worth $111.6 million. The shares came with restrictions on their sale for seven years.
The judge, in recounting details of the performance pay plan approved by shareholders, said the contract authorized up to six million shares for the three executives if Computer Associates stock sold for more than $180 a share for 60 trading days in any 12-month period.
The plan contained a provision adjusting the stock price in the event of stock splits. But, Mr. Steele wrote, "the corresponding and conspicuous absence of a provision authorizing alteration" of the number of shares that could be awarded reinforced his conclusion. He specifically found that the reasonable expectation of shareholders was that no more than six million shares would be awarded.
The judge found that the stock was allotted in two steps.
In May 1995, the executives were awarded two million shares. He held that they were entitled to the dividends on those shares, including any additional shares allotted in stock splits, since technically a split is a dividend paid in the form of additional shares. Because of splits, those 2 million shares had grown to 6.75 million three years later.
In May 1998, the executives were given 13.5 million more shares, which reflected the remaining 4 million of the 6 million shares specified in the plan adjusted for several stock splits. But the judge ruled that the board had no authority to adjust these shares after the stock had split and that it thus could hand out only four million of this block of shares.
In all, Mr. Steele ruled, the executives were entitled to 10.75 million shares -- the 6.75 million from the 1995 grant and the 4 million given to them in 1998 -- not the 20.25 million the board approved.
Just two months after the 1998 stock award, shares of Computer Associates, which had been trading in the mid-50's, lost about a third of their value, eventually tumbling to $26 by the end of August.
The company said the economic crisis in Asia had depressed orders and led to a business slowdown, but critics also noted that the 1998 stock award, taken as a charge against earnings, turned a profitable quarter into one with a $480.8 million loss.
The stock has since recovered. It closed yesterday at $58.6875, up 6.25 cents, after trading as high as $63.48125 in early October.
The judge wrote that even with his ruling, the executives were well rewarded for their efforts. "Even under the strictest reading of the plan," he wrote, "the three participants will together still receive nearly $320 million. $320 million is no bagatelle. I find it remarkable that defendants would believe that CA shareholders would consider that $320 million for three individuals failed to 'encourage, recognize and reward sustained outstanding individual performance by certain key employees.' "
Without testimony, he said, he could not decide if the directors had acted with mere carelessness or with such a breach of their duty to shareholders that they should be held individually liable. It is unclear whether the shareholders who brought the suits will pursue the matter.
Richard A. Grasso, a director of Computer Associates who is also chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange, declined a request for comment on the judge's ruling. The other directors named in the lawsuit are Irving Goldstein, Shirley Strum Kenny, Willem F. P. de Vogel and the three executives.
Martin Unger of the Tenzer Greenblatt law firm, who argued the shareholders' case, said the decision "shows that you have to live with what the shareholders approve."
"The broader lesson," he added, "is that shareholders do have rights and that company directors can't just make it up as they go along."
Mr. Unger, who said his major business was defending companies in securities cases, said that Computer Associates would probably owe attorney fees and nothing more. Separate lawsuits that accuse the company of providing misleading information before the company's stock price fell last year are pending.
Robert Salwen, an executive compensation lawyer in Manhattan, said that had the case been tried under New York law, the stock splits would probably have been found to be implicit in the contract. He said contracts require careful review because "language disappears all the time in computers."
Graef Crystal, author of the Crystal Report, a newsletter on executive compensation, said the case displayed "stunning incompetence on the part of the lawyers who drafted this -- it will be interesting to see if Charlie Wang sues these idiots for failing Compensation 101."
The company did not respond to requests for information on who drafted the plan.

HEADLINE: Haiti's Paralysis Spreads as U.S. Troops Pack Up

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti

 BODY:
Five years after an American-led force of 20,000 troops invaded this island and restored constitutional rule, the Haitian people are entering a new and uncertain era.
While crime, insecurity and a crumbling infrastructure continue to threaten residents, the Haitian government has been virtually paralyzed for more than two years. Now, the last of the regular American military presence in the capital is set to end in January, with the 400 troops to be replaced by shifts of reservists on short-term training missions throughout the country. 
 That is yet another blow for a country that has made dishearteningly little progress despite high expectations -- perhaps unrealistic -- since the invasion. By the end of this year, police trainers and human rights monitors from the United Nations and the Organization of American States are also to leave, although United Nations officials hope to maintain a smaller mission.
After Jean-Bertrand Aristide, then a radical Roman Catholic priest, was elected in 1990 as Haiti's first democratically chosen president in decades, an army-led coup drove him into exile in 1991. After three years of repression, he was restored to power in a negotiated settlement backed by an American-led occupation. The current president, Rene Preval, was his hand-picked successor, but Mr. Aristide, who resigned from the priesthood in 1994, remains Haiti's leading political figure and is expected to run again next year.
The American military's role in Haiti has gone from ensuring security to carrying out the kind of work that brings tangible relief to the residents of the hemisphere's poorest nation -- providing free medical care, repairing wells and building schools. While thousands of Haitians have benefited from this assistance, countless more have taken psychological comfort from the mere presence of the American troops.
On a recent day, Anes Anis came home from her factory job to find an American soldier sitting behind his M-60 machine gun atop a Humvee while another paced the side of her hilly dirt street. She said she welcomed those silent sentries.
"We're happy to see them," she said. "If something happens now, we could call on them. Otherwise, we have nothing at all to protect us."
But the soldiers were not there to bring peace to her neighborhood. They had only come to secure the area while dozens of American sailors painted a local schoolhouse.
Like Ms. Anis, many Haitians hoped that the intervention would solve day-to-day problems. The departing forces leave behind a nation that is still trying to create a democratic, functioning state.
The Haitian Army was disbanded but not disarmed, contributing to an increase in street and drug crimes. While a new police force struggles to enforce the law, a dysfunctional judiciary has hampered its efforts. People and cars crowd the streets in midday, but few people venture out very early or late, lest they become targets for bandits.
Foreign investment has been a trickle. With unemployment hovering at 60 percent, factory owners have been closing up as clients shift orders to nations with equally cheap labor but more stability.
With regularity, residents in some neighborhoods vent their frustration and try to get the government's attention by hauling tires and trash into the street and setting up flaming roadblocks.
It has hardly helped. The government itself has been virtually paralyzed since 1997 while Mr. Preval fought with his opposition in Parliament over his choice for prime minister. He finally appointed a de facto prime minister earlier this year when the Parliament's term ended, leaving the nation without a functioning legislature.
Throughout the standoff, the government failed to pass either a budget or laws that would have brought $500 million in international aid to shore up its crumbling infrastructure and reduce suffering.
Legislative elections have been pushed back from December of this year to March 19, prompting fears of campaign fraud or violence. International observers and diplomats have accused supporters of Mr. Aristide of trying to wrest control of the civilian police force to use it for their political advantage. Recently, a daylong voter education event sponsored by the national electoral council was disrupted by hecklers.
The governmental paralysis has disappointed both Haitians and other countries, which are coming to realize that they also had unrealistic expectations.
Decades of dictatorship under Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier and his son, Jean-Claude, left the country with scant experience with democratic rule. Now, as Haiti continues the transition to democracy that it began when Duvalier rule ended in 1986, other nations say that they are willing to help but that the Haitian people must take the initiative.
"The real challenge is for Haitians to come together and address their past so they can come up with answers that will help them create their future," said the American ambassador, Timothy Carney. "The political culture has got to change."
The years since the intervention have brought some improvements. The United States, working through private contractors and nongovernmental organizations, has provided $300 million for health care, education and judicial reform. Inflation has been reduced to single-digit figures, and the currency is stable.
Most important, the leaders of a coup that had ousted Mr. Aristide and ushered in years of repression were removed. Diplomats say the nation's human rights record has improved and individual freedoms have grown.
The formation of the Haitian National Police from 5,300 mostly raw recruits has also been seen as a positive development, although the force is hampered by insufficient resources and inexperienced mid-level commanders. Since its inception three years ago, more than 800 officers have been dismissed for offenses ranging from corruption to human rights violations. Yet even that is seen as evidence that it is willing to ensure its integrity by rooting out malfeasance.
"On the human rights side, clearly a number of things have improved," said Colin Granderson, the executive director of the United Nations/Organization of American States International Civilian Mission in Haiti. "There is an emphasis on accountability, which was unheard of before. Serious human rights violations are no longer a policy of the authorities."
But with every advance there have been setbacks that make Haiti, in the words of one diplomat, "a country of push-pull doors." While the police have been trying to enforce the law, they have been stymied by an inept and backlogged judiciary: about 80 percent of all Haitian prisoners are awaiting trial. A school supported by international donors has been training judges, and the government recently increased judges' salaries to make them less susceptible to bribes. But some feel that the reforms did not address the fundamental flaw.
"The problem is we're still functioning with an old justice system we inherited from the days of the military dictatorship," said Prime Minister Jacques-Edouard Alexis.
He added that despite the obstacles, the administration was able to carry out some programs. Land reform has reduced supply costs for farmers. Cooperatives have been established, he said. And while the pace has been slow, the government is privatizing the operations of ports and the airport.
But much more could have been accomplished had it not been for the paralysis that overtook the government shortly after the 1997 Parliamentary elections. Members of the opposition, the Organization of People in Struggle, accused the governing Lavalas Party of fraud. For two years, they blocked Mr. Preval's choice for Prime Minister, and accomplished little else, said diplomats and international officials.
The deadlock has frozen $500 million in loans from the Interamerican Development Bank, the World Bank and other institutions.
"A lot of that money is going to be lost," Mr. Granderson said. "That money is not going to be held for Haitians until they make up their minds that they're ready to use it. The window is closing."
The fatigue felt by donors is shared by ordinary Haitians. Craters filled with mud and putrid sewage cover long stretches of the National Highway, which runs past the sprawling slums of Cite Soleil.
"This is the government's problem," said Israel Domones, on a recent day after he hit a hole and the bottom of his tractor-trailer, filled with sacks of flour, fell out, causing a huge traffic jam. "The water is deep and I did not see how big the hole was. The road is stuck. The country is stuck."
When the Americans first invaded Haiti in 1915, they stayed long enough to build up the country's infrastructure. This time, their focus has been on aid, like the free clinics where hundreds of Haitians line up for hours to receive medical care.
The military has also built many schools and repaired wells. The American soldiers speak enthusiastically about their mission, but they also admit that the nation's impoverished social conditions can seem overwhelming.
"Do they need roads or water now, or do they need education?" said Lt. Comdr. Joseph Larry of the Navy, the American military support group's chief engineer. "It's a tough nut to crack as to what Haiti needs more of."
There is also little time remaining for elections, which are seen as the only way out of the government's paralysis. "People are clamoring for elections to take place as soon as possible so we can get back to a government of parliamentary normalcy," Mr. Alexis said. "Democracy cannot be decreed. It can only be built."
With only four months to go, the logistical obstacles are daunting in a country where phone lines, electricity and other basics are unreliable.
Some diplomats and Haitians fear that the elections could be delayed again, possibly combined with the presidential elections scheduled for next November. They say supporters of Mr. Aristide favor that possibility, hoping to use his coattails to win seats in Parliament.
Diplomats and international observers also worry about reports of intimidation by Aristide supporters and reports they they are trying to gain control of the police.
Yvon Neptune, a spokesman for Mr. Aristide's party, denied those accusations. "We hope the election schedule is going to be kept," he said. Much is at stake in the coming elections, and not just the return of a functioning, daily government. The country is at a point where it is being urged to find a national consensus on how government can work for all sectors of Haitian society.
"The government itself has been the situation, in their total lack of management, vision and honesty," said Georges Sassine, an apparel factory owner and vice president of the Association of Haitian Industries. "You feel there are 200 different governments and within each branch you have sub-branches and they all go their separate ways. I'm not going to call it anarchy. Yet."
He spoke inside his vast, empty factory, where he had just laid off 260 workers. While the government has been paralyzed, orders from the United States dried up. In the last two months, 22 factories have closed, leaving nearly 5,000 people jobless, he said. Some people have done well, including those who have taken advantage of government inaction and desperate poverty to make fast money in contraband, he said. But most are still waiting.
"Haiti has not learned there is no individual salvation," Mr. Sassine said. "If you're in a sinking boat and you jump out, are you really saved? It's either everybody gets saved or nobody does."

HEADLINE: A Shift in the H.M.O. Revolution

 BODY:
The UnitedHealth Group's decision to let doctors decide -- without the approval of the insurance company -- what care a patient should receive could signal a major change of course in the managed-care revolution. When the managed-care concept first burst upon the American health scene a decade or so ago it was touted as the best way to control runaway medical costs and to assure that all patients received the care they needed but not unnecessary care. As one key element of "managing" costs, insurance plan administrators were given the power to approve, in advance, any costly procedures and hospitalizations recommended by doctors participating in the plan. Whatever merit this approach had as a management tool, it was despised by both patients and doctors.
But now, in a move that some describe as heralding a wave of change in the evolution of health care, United, one of the nation's largest managed-care companies, has said it will abandon the practice of questioning doctors' decisions before approving payment of medical bills. 
 There appear to be both economic and political reasons for the decision. Surprisingly, United concluded that the bureaucracy it had set up to second-guess the doctors cost more to operate than it saved in denying claims. More than 99 percent of all the cases reviewed got approved in the end, suggesting that the overwhelming majority of doctors were making the right decisions to begin with. True, some suggest that United had been overly lenient in reviewing its doctors, while others suggest that the doctors were making the right decisions in part because they knew they would be second-guessed. But when United conducted some experiments around the country, they clearly showed that costs went down when the reviews were abandoned.
The second factor forcing change was the uproar among patients and doctors who despised this element of managed care above all others and whose protests put pressure on Congress to enact a patients' bill of rights. The managed-care reviews angered many consumers, who were happy with lower premiums but choked when they felt they were denied needed care at the whim of faceless bureaucrats. The reviews also outraged doctors and their powerful professional associations, which resented second-guessing of medical decisions by administrators they deemed unqualified to make such judgments, not to mention the resulting loss of income.
The change at United does not, by any means, mean that the managed-care industry is giving up on the goal of cost containment, nor should it. United itself does not plan to abandon all cost controls over participating physicians. What United will do now is review physicians' decisions and patterns of practice after the fact. Where it feels doctors are resorting to needless or overly costly procedures, United will lean on them to change their practices. The long-range effectiveness of that approach remains to be demonstrated. Nor is it clear whether the rest of the industry will follow United's lead or wait and see what happens. If United starts marketing itself as the hassle-free plan, others may feel compelled to follow, or if Congress passes a patients' rights bill allowing all health insurance plans to be sued, many plans may wish to duck liability by leaving all medical decisions to the doctors.
But whatever course is taken by the health insurance industry, some form of cost control remains desirable. The managed-care companies have already achieved substantial cost savings by reducing hospital stays and negotiating prices with hospitals and medical groups. They will need to retain some tools to prevent another explosion of health care costs on the scale that spawned managed care to begin with.
Meanwhile, United's action does not eliminate the need to pass a strong patients' rights bill in Congress, a bill that will apply to all health insurers and will deal with matters of access and liability that have little to do with the issue United has laid to rest for its own customers and physicians. United's action is not a final solution to the problems of managed care, nor does it mean an abandonment of the goal of cost containment. It does suggest that the mechanism of insurance companies telling doctors what to do is being revised as a result of consumer and political pressures, economic efficiency and practical experience.

HEADLINE: New York Trails in Race to Lure Biotechnology, Comptroller Says

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
Despite its vast resources in medical research, New York State has "missed the boat" on biotechnology, a promising new industry that has pumped billions of dollars into other states' economies, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall said yesterday.
"Cities like Boston, San Francisco and Baltimore have taken advantage of the biotech revolution, harnessing their academic medical institutions to encourage start-up biotech firms," Mr. McCall said in a speech to the New York Biotechnology Association, a trade group. "Sadly, New York City and this state as a whole have not laid the groundwork we need to make sure this is a key location for biotechnology." 
 The comptroller, a Democrat, is a frequent critic of the Republican administrations in Albany and New York. Taking issue with his comments, officials in both places said yesterday that biotechnology was a high priority.
In his speech at the New York Hilton and Towers, Mr. McCall said the industry's most pressing need was for affordable laboratory space for start-up and growing companies.
He also said the city's economy had become increasingly dependent on the volatile financial industry. Five percent of the jobs in New York City are on Wall Street, and yet financial services accounted for 56 percent of the increase in earnings citywide between 1992 and 1997. This growth has done nothing to help upstate residents, he said.
He said the state spends $200 million a year on economic development but lacks a strategic plan. "For too long," Mr. McCall said, "New York's economic development strategy has consisted of waiting to hear that some company is leaving, and we chase them across the border, waving a check at them and trying to make a deal for them to stay."
Pataki administration officials denied that the state's economy was too heavily dependent on Wall Street, saying that more than 500,000 jobs have been created throughout the state since Gov. George E. Pataki took office.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York recently reported, however, that although the upstate economy has shown signs of improvement lately, "its growth is still fairly small compared with that of the entire state and nation."
Joseph Conway, a spokesman for the State Division of the Budget also noted that the Legislature recently passed a tax credit bill to help investors in emerging technologies, including biotechnology. Today, the governor is to sign a bill recommending that the comptroller invest $250 million of state funds in high technology.
New York City officials said they were responding to the need for laboratory space. Michael G. Carey, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said partners are being sought to develop 250,000 square feet of property that the city owns near New York University Medical Center for biotechnology labs and other medical uses.

HEADLINE: Poll Finds Greater Confidence in Democrats

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER with JANET ELDER 

 BODY:
A year before the election, Democrats enjoy public confidence on most critical election issues, from health care to education to Social Security, and more voters say they will vote for Democrats than Republicans in the the House of Representatives, the latest New York Times/ CBS News Poll shows.
The poll does contain some good news for the Republicans. The party still has the leading candidate in the presidential race: George W. Bush, who holds a clear though somewhat smaller lead over both Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley. 
 In addition, the Republicans, whose image suffered badly during the battle to impeach President Clinton, have recovered some ground on several issues and for the first time in more than a year have an overall favorable standing with the public. But the gains are modest and do not affect Democratic dominance on issues that voters say they care about the most.
The strongest number for the Democrats in the poll was on how people expected to vote in House races next year. Forty-five percent said they would vote for a Democrat in their district, while 38 percent said they would vote for a Republican. While a national poll cannot predict the results of 435 House elections, an actual seven percentage point advantage in the November 2000 election would ensure a Democratic House.
The public clearly finds the most fault with the Republicans who control Congress. A Gallup Poll, conducted on the same days, Thursday through Sunday, as the Times/CBS News Poll, showed 53 percent of the public disapproved of Congressional Republicans, while 38 percent approved. For Democrats in Congress, 49 percent approved and 42 percent disapproved.
On issues, the poll measured one especially striking Republican failure. Despite their spending much of the summer and fall trying to assert that their party was trying to protect Social Security while Democrats were about to squander its resources, the public solidly prefers the Democrats to make the "right decisions" about Social Security. Forty-nine percent preferred the Democrats; 33 percent the Republicans.
Similarly, 49 percent to 33 percent favored the Democrats on improving education in the nation.
When the public was asked which party would do a better job of improving the health care system, 54 percent cited the Democrats, compared with 28 percent who named the Republicans.
But on the question of which party would do best at ensuring a strong military, Republicans held a 57 percent to 37 percent advantage. Yet that advantage has little apparent political value. Only 2 percent of the public considered defense the "single most important problem for the president and Congress to deal with." Six percent cited education, 8 percent cited Social Security, and 13 percent cited health care.
The poll also suggested that the early dominance of Mr. Bush may be softening in the presidential race. The poll showed that he led Vice President Al Gore by 50 percent to 41 percent and former Senator Bill Bradley by 51 to 39 percent. The differences between those two hypothetical races are not statistically significant in this poll of 1,162 adults, of whom 953 said they were registered voters. In both groups the margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points.
Mr. Bush led Mr. Gore by wider margins in CBS News Polls conducted earlier this fall, by 17 points in September and 15 points in October. His lead over Mr. Bradley has fluctuated, going from 12 points in September to 22 in October and back to 12 points in this poll.
Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore retained wide leads, nationally, for their party's nomination, though those figures do not reflect the standings in particular states, like New Hampshire, where several surveys have found the races much closer.
Among people who said they were likely to vote in a Democratic primary or caucus, Mr. Gore led Mr. Bradley, 56 percent to 30 percent. That was slightly less than his 58 percent to 26 percent lead in a CBS News Poll last month. And while both trailed Mr. Bush, both led Senator John McCain in a trial matchup; Mr. Gore's lead was 47 percent to 36 percent. Mr. Bradley's was 47 percent to 30 percent.
Of all the candidates in both parties, Mr. Gore's support seemed firmest. Forty percent of his Democratic backers said their minds were made up, while 59 percent said it was too early to be certain. Among Mr. Bradley's primary supporters 27 percent said their minds were made up.
Mr. Gore also enjoyed another edge over Mr. Bradley, and Mr. Bush, too. When people who said they would vote for him in a general election were asked why they liked him, 86 percent gave a specific reason, like his experience or a position on an issue. Seventy-two percent of Mr. Bradley's supporters had that sort of answer.
The differences were even more striking between Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain. Sixty-one percent of Bush backers and 86 percent of McCain supporters had a specific reason. Mr. Bush had a number of backers who said "I like him" or "He can win."
While Mr. Bush's national lead is immense, with two-thirds of Republican primary voters supporting him, and no one else in shouting distance at the moment, the vagueness of support could be troublesome. Backers who support someone because he can win can be quickly discouraged if he loses in a single primary. A dramatic example of that came in February 1980, when the governor's father, former President George Bush, led Ronald Reagan but Mr. Reagan's backers were much clearer in their reasons. After Mr. Bush lost in New Hampshire, his backing dissolved.
Among people who said they were likely to vote in a Republican primary or caucus, Mr. Bush was supported by 68 percent. No one else had more than 8 percent, the total for Mr. McCain of Arizona, who in recent weeks has attracted a surge of support in New Hampshire, the site of the first primary. In a CBS News Poll last month, his nationwide support stood at 14 percent.
Steve Forbes, the publisher, had 5 percent in the most recent poll, followed by Alan Keyes with 3 percent, and Senator Orrin G. Hatch and Gary L. Bauer at 2 percent.
Mr. Bush was viewed favorably by 60 percent of Republican primary voters, and unfavorably by 7 just percent. The only other Republicans with more favorable than unfavorable ratings were Mr. McCain and Mr. Keyes.
Among Republican primary voters, there was little difference in the intensity of support. For Mr. Bush, 28 percent said their minds were made up. For all the others, the total pools of supporters were too small to provide a reliable measure.
One key to Mr. Bush's strength in the nomination process is his party's belief that he has the best chance to win in November. And a persistent key to his strength is his support from women and from Democrats.
Over the last two decades, election polling has consistently shown that women are less likely than men to support the Republican Party and its candidates. But those differences become statistically meaningless in Mr. Bush's case. He led Mr. Gore 51 to 41 percent among men and 50 percent to 41 percent among women. He led Mr. Bradley by the same 51 to 41 percent among men, and 51 to 38 percent among women.
Mr. Bush also attracted substantial numbers of Democrats, 20 percent against Mr. Gore and 24 percent against Mr. Bradley. Those party defectors tended to be southern, conservative and religious.
Mr. Bush lost only 6 percent of Republicans to Mr. Gore and 8 percent to Mr. Bradley. While Republicans often have lower defection rates than Democrats, the difference between the rates involving Mr. Bush are greater than usual. For instance, in the 1996 presidential election, there were about an equal number of defections on both sides. Thirteen percent of Republicans voted for Mr. Clinton and a roughly equal 10 percent of Democrats voted for former Senator Bob Dole.
The poll did show a favorable standing for Mr. Bush's party. Forty-eight percent of the respondents viewed the Republicans favorably, while 43 percent had an unfavorable opinion, and 9 percent had no opinion at all. For the Democratic Party, the results were a bit better; 52 percent had a favorable view; 39 percent an unfavorable opinion, and 9 percent no opinion.
The nation's political wild card, the Reform Party, has a strongly negative image. Fifty-three percent have an unfavorable view, 26 percent a favorable opinion, and 21 percent no opinion.
Nor are its potential presidential candidates highly regarded. Patrick J. Buchanan draws 6 percent of the vote if matched against Mr. Bush and either Mr. Gore or Mr. Bradley. In both matchups, Mr. Buchanan takes votes mainly from Mr. Bush and narrows Mr. Bush's lead over the Democrat.
Mr. Buchanan is viewed unfavorably by 54 percent of the voters, and favorably by 10 percent.
But that is not nearly as negative as the view held about Donald J. Trump, the New York real estate magnate who has just joined the Reform Party and says he will seek its nomination if he believes he can win the presidency.
Just 7 percent of Americans have a favorable view and 70 percent an unfavorable opinion. That is the highest unfavorable view ever recorded by a Times/CBS News Poll.
The last comparably negative rating was a 3 percent favorable, 55 percent unfavorable recorded by Linda R. Tripp, the former friend of Monica S. Lewinsky, in October 1998.
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Nov. 4 through 7 with 1,162 adults throughout the United States. Of these, 953 said they were registered to vote.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups the margin of sampling error is larger.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: 'Walkers' Make a Tentative Stand;
African Deliverymen Complain, Gently, of a Tough Job

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
As pickets go, the labor protest outside an Upper West Side supermarket two weeks ago was oddly subdued. There were no accusatory shouts from the dozens of strikers, nor were there any of the fiery union slogans one might expect from a group of disgruntled employees.
Instead, most of the protesters -- deliverymen for supermarkets around the city -- stood in front of the Food Emporium at 68th Street and Broadway tentatively displaying placards that advertised their grief: low wages, long hours, no benefits. "We are slaves," the boldest of their signs proclaimed. "Please help set us free." 
 In planning the strike, the protesters showed their lack of organizing experience. They did not seek union help and enlisted only about 100 of what they estimate are the city's 500 deliverymen. When their employers threatened to dismiss them, the strike fizzled after only two days.
Their apparent naivete and their reluctance to make a scene suggested that these were not your usual labor demonstrators. Most are immigrants from West Africa, educated and courtly men who came to New York expecting blessed excess and found themselves lugging sacks of groceries up five-story walkups for a dollar, and sometimes less.
"We thought life in America was going to be easier," said Jacques Le Grand NGouri, 22, who came from Gabon with plans to study filmmaking. "Maybe we watched too much 'Dynasty.' "
The African deliveryman is one of the lowest-paid workers in New York's service economy, filling a niche that pampered city dwellers have come to depend on for their daily bread. The deliverymen, known in the business as walkers, and their grocery-laden carts, are an everyday sight in well-to-do Manhattan neighborhoods.
Lacking the legal status and fluent English that might ease their entry into better-paying employment, the deliverymen have, until now, put up with jobs that pay less than $2.50 an hour and require 12-hour days, six days a week. Because most of the city's largest supermarket chains contract out the service to delivery companies, they can distance themselves from what labor organizers say are blatantly exploitive work conditions and what may be illegal hiring practices.
A spokesman for the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, which owns A&P, Waldbaum's and Food Emporium, did not respond to questions regarding their delivery service. John Catsimatidis, whose company operates Sloan's and Gristede's supermarkets, said the arrangement saved him money and that his main concern was that the walkers be reliable and well groomed. "The last thing I need is to get mixed up in labor troubles," he said.
The delivery companies that dominate the business dismissed the Africans' complaints. "They make plenty of money," said Scott Weinstein, president of Hudson Delivery, which handles deliveries for hundreds of supermarkets and drug stores in the metropolitan area. "This strike is ridiculous."
Many of those who took a leading role in the walkout found that they had no jobs to return to. Mamadou Camara, the main organizer, acknowledges that the strike was poorly planned. "I guess we were naive," said Mr. Camara, 30, a former bank teller from Mali who, like most, found his delivery job through a compatriot. "We thought people would be outraged by how exploited we are and things would change."
Ultimately, though, their efforts may pay off. The strike has drawn the attention of a union, which has offered to take on their cause, and federal labor officials are investigating whether the men were illegally fired for their actions.
It has also opened a small window onto an insular group of immigrants who, until the police shooting of Amadou Diallo in February, lived in relative obscurity. Census figures, now a decade old, do not reveal their true numbers. But Andrew Beveridge, a professor of sociology at Queens College who specializes in New York City demographics, said that from 1990 to 1996, the number of sub-Saharan Africans, most of them West African, nearly doubled to about 84,000 from 44,000.
Africans here say they are daunted by racism and the usual obstacles faced by new immigrants who do not speak English. As illegal aliens, they are often too fearful to protest low wages, long hours and dismal work. And they have a fear of failure that is compounded by a popular fallacy at home, one they are partly responsible for spreading, that America dumps wealth in the lap of every arrival. In many cases, there is also an extended family in Africa that depends on their meager paychecks.
"If we come back empty handed, it will be a great shame for us and for our family," said Issa Traore, 28, a deliveryman from Mali who lost his job after the strike.
Mr. Traore pulled out a recent payroll stub, for $107, an amount he said represented a 72-hour week. With tips, he said, his average weekly income was $180, or about $2.50 an hour. "We can barely live on that," he said in French. "It's absurd."
To make that equation work, the men keep their expenses as low as possible. They share cramped apartments, cook at home and do without. "I haven't seen a movie in four years," said Mr. Camara.
On a quiet side street in the Fordham section of the Bronx, about two dozen Africans, most of them deliverymen, share a sagging white house. Steel bars now cover the windows and the Shingle-style house has been divided into a dozen one-room apartments. One man sleeps in a closet, his feet poking through the curtain that separates him from the hall.
In more jovial moments, the men call it their "White House," but sitting on a grimy, cushionless sofa, sipping from cans of 7-Up, they quietly speak of their shame and frustration. "Money is good, but humanity is more important," said Mr. Traore, who shares his $400-a-month room with three others, two to a bed.
Mr. Camara shares a small apartment in Harlem with his wife and several others. Because of his income, he says, he has no choice but to send his wife back to Mali after she gives birth to their first child in two months.
Unlike other immigrants, he said, he frequently tells his family back home about the realities of life in America, lest others be misled into coming. Still, he will stay and probably try to find work with another delivery company, he said apologetically.
To New Yorkers who are harried or too infirm to carry their own groceries, the delivery service that most supermarkets offer is a bargain. At Food Emporium, for example, delivery costs $2.25, no matter how many bags are lugged, no matter how many flights of stairs are climbed.
The two companies that control most of New York's delivery service, City Express Delivery and Hudson Delivery, list only post office boxes as addresses. The owner of City Express, Charlie Bauer, did not return several messages left with a woman at his office who claimed she did not know the company's location. Those who work for Mr. Bauer said he pays the lowest wages in the business, about 50 to 70 cents a delivery.
Mr. Weinstein, the president of Hudson Delivery, said his employees make $200 to $300 for 40-hour weeks. "My guys make a good living and they love their jobs," he said, adding that the strike was an elaborate ruse by Mr. Camara to steal away his 26-year-old business. Mr. Camara denied that he was trying to start his own delivery business.
Both companies employ the men as independent contractors; they receive no health benefits, no paid vacations and are not covered by most labor laws. But after meeting with the strikers last week, officials with UNITE, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, said the men were full-time employees, not independent contractors. "It's a typical ploy employers use to skirt the law," said Mike Donovan, an organizer.
Randy Wilson, a spokesman for the United States Department of Labor, said it seemed unlikely that the deliverymen could be considered independent contractors, who determine their own hours and work conditions. And the National Labor Relations Board is investigating whether the men were illegally fired because of their organizing activities.
Even if the men were to be considered independent contractors, federal law requires employers to verify their residency status. Hiring an undocumented worker carries fines as high as $2,500, said Mark Thorn, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. In 1995, a delivery company owned by Mr. Weinstein was cited by the agency for hiring 12 illegal African workers.
While most supermarket shoppers were sympathetic to the deliverymen's plight, they said it would not change their shopping habits. After checking out, Lillian Winston left the Food Emporium on Madison Avenue and 87th Street one recent evening with Gasel Lii, a towering man from Congo who carried two plastic shopping bags in each hand.
Mr. Lii, 32, who supports a wife and two children back home, wore a crisp white shirt, buffed black shoes and a tie -- the uniform required by his employer, City Express. "Most of the time, we deliver to doormen or housekeepers, and they give us no tip," Mr. Lii said softly in French as his customer walked a few paces behind.
When told about the deliverymen's low pay, Ms. Winston, who is in her 80's, said that was unacceptable. "My father always told me to fight for the little guy," she said as she approached her stately building opposite the Guggenheim Museum. When asked if she might offer Mr. Lii more than her usual $1 tip, she sighed.
"I'm already paying $2.25 for this," she said. "Why should I pay more?"

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Longtime I.M.F. Director Resigns in Midterm

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Michel Camdessus resigned today in the middle of his third term as managing director of the International Monetary Fund, setting off a behind-the-scenes struggle involving the Clinton administration and European nations over who will head the agency that is in effect dictating national economic policy from Russia to Indonesia and Africa.
Mr. Camdessus, who has steered the I.M.F. for nearly 13 years through a succession of economic crises, said today that "entirely personal reasons" had prompted his resignation two years before the end of his term. Colleagues said constant travel and a succession of international crises had exhausted him. 
 But in a half-hour conversation in his office here this afternoon, the 66-year-old former French central banker appeared vigorous, telling tales of political intrigue, responding to attacks from conservatives in the United States Congress who had accused him of wasting billions in bailing out Russia, and arguing that his much-attacked prescriptions saved Asia from a far worse economic fate.
And in discussing the fund's growing political impact throughout the world, he acknowledged for the first time that its actions in Indonesia served as a catalyst in forcing out the man who led the nation, the world's fourth most populous.
"We created the conditions that obliged President Suharto to leave his job," Mr. Camdessus said. "That was not our intention," he said, but quickly added that soon after Mr. Suharto's resignation he traveled to Moscow to warn President Boris N. Yeltsin that the same forces could end his control of Russia unless he acted.
Because the I.M.F. has become such a far-reaching political force, the struggle over who will occupy Mr. Camdessus' spacious office, situated halfway between the White House and Federal Reserve headquarters, is likely to be a fierce one. Traditionally, the fund has been run by a European, and for 30 of its 51 years the top job has gone to a Frenchman. Washington has usually had only a bit role in selecting the monetary fund's director because it has sole discretion in choosing the head of the I.M.F.'s much-larger sister institution, the World Bank. The bank focuses on alleviating poverty and promoting development, while the I.M.F.'s mission is economic stabilization, particularly in times of crisis.
All that may change. Europeans appear divided on the question of who should succeed Mr. Camdessus when he steps down in February, and the Clinton administration has signaled that it intends to play a much bigger role in the selection.
"This is a very important decision for the fund at a very important time," a senior Treasury official said tonight. "The stakes are higher now because the fund's profile is so much higher." The official said the United States was looking for a candidate "who will have strong credibility in the markets," and was not necessarily ready to back a European.
Among the top candidates for the job are Caio Koch-Weser, a state secretary of finance in Germany and former managing director of the World Bank, and Andrew Crockett of Britain, who heads the Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland. Other possible successors include the current governor of the Bank of France, Jean-Claude Trichet, who is scheduled to be the next head of the European Central Bank; Mervyn King, deputy governor of the Bank of England; Nigel Wicks, a top official in the British Treasury, and Horst Koehler, head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
In his nearly 13 years at the fund, Mr. Camdessus earned praise, particularly from American officials, as a knowledgeable political operator who could cajole, wheedle and threaten foreign leaders who were reluctant to enact economic changes.
"Damn right he can be tough," former Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen once said of him, though he added, "Sometimes you have to lean on him real hard to get things done."
But when Washington appealed for help, Mr. Camdessus was almost always there -- particularly in 1995, when an early-morning telephone call from Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin with the news that Congress would not back a bailout of Mexico led him to take extraordinary action on his own.
He committed $18 billion without the usual round of negotiations with the board that directs the fund. He later told them, "Gentlemen, I don't ask your permission because you would have to speak with your ministers or governors, and you have no time for that." The bailout worked.
Mr. Camdessus' critics, and they were legion, had many complaints. They viewed him as arrogant -- "I am French," he once said in an interview during the Asian crisis, "and what Frenchmen is not accused of that" -- and far too quick to urge the devaluation of currencies and fiscal austerity. In fact, that is what the I.M.F. did when the Asian crisis started in Thailand and Indonesia, but within months it backed away, restoring subsidies for fuel and rice to contain widening street protests.
In Congress, conservatives complained that the fund wasted billions, particularly with a $17 billion bailout of Russia last year that collapsed in months -- and which has led to continuing investigations into where I.M.F. money went.
Mr. Camdessus repeated today that "the charges are completely unsubstantiated," and said "we must not loose sight of the fact that Russia is now a democracy and a market economy, even if it is blurred by corruption and cronyism, and mistakes in Chechnya."
What undercut some of Mr. Camdessus' credibility on Capitol Hill, where financing for the I.M.F. seems always under attack, was his tendency to act as a public cheerleader for countries in trouble. Speaking of the capital flight from Russia in the spring of 1998, for example, he said: "Contrary to what markets and commentators are imagining, this is not a crisis. This is not a major development." It became one quickly, leading to one of the fund's biggest and least successful stabilization efforts.
Today, Mr. Camdessus said he had become resigned to the idea that Europeans and Asians viewed him as a lackey for the United States -- "they call me a damn U.S. neo-liberal in Europe," he remarked -- while in Congress he is viewed as not doing enough to advance the United States agenda.
"The fact is that the American influence in the I.M.F. is strong, very strong, and for good reason," he said. "America has a systemic vision of the world. The problem is that America does not always put its money where its mouth is. When my countrymen in Europe complain about that, I say that if you had the guts to stand united, you would have more power than the U.S."
And then he ushered a visitor past his collection of sculptures, including one of an Indian goddess who "dances on ignorance and is the force of creative destruction," to a favorite painting. It shows a blur of hands reaching into the pockets of a pinstriped suit. The painting is titled "Sorry, no funds."

HEADLINE: Trump Proposes Clearing Nation's Debt at Expense of the Rich

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Preparing to embark on his first trip as a prospective candidate for president, Donald J. Trump yesterday presented a plan that he said would pay off the national debt, bolster Social Security and slash taxes by billions of dollars. Mr. Trump promised to accomplish all this at no cost to ordinary Americans, by forcing the rich to pay for it.
Mr. Trump, describing the first proposal of his exploratory presidential campaign, said the government should impose a one-time 14.25 percent tax on the net worth of individuals and trusts worth $10 million or more. That would raise $5.7 trillion, he said, enough to pay off the national debt in a single year. And eliminating the debt, Mr. Trump explained, would save the nation $200 billion in annual interest payments, money that he said could be used for tax cuts and ensuring the stability of the Social Security system. 
 The New York developer chose an unusual forum to unveil what he described as a policy cornerstone of his prospective campaign: a rolling series of radio and television interviews. The proposal comes a week before Mr. Trump is to fly to Florida for a series of campaign-style events in Miami, the first of three such trips planned for the next month.
"The phones are going off the hook," Mr. Trump reported, as he combined a discussion of his economic ideas with a description of what he called the public's giddy reaction to his foray into economic policy-making. "I've never seen anything like this. Do you make Page 1 with this one?"
As a matter of politics, Mr. Trump's proposal -- simple in its concept and framed in populist terms -- seems aimed directly at the people who have supported the Reform Party since Ross Perot first called it to arms with, among other things, a call to wipe out the national debt. Mr. Trump, should he run, said he would seek to become the Reform Party's candidate for president.
It also had the advantage of lessening any liability Mr. Trump might believe he could suffer because of his own reputation as a man of wealth. The developer put his own net worth at $5 billion, and said that under his plan, he would owe $750 million in taxes (though his estate would ultimately profit if another part of Mr. Trump's plan were enacted: the repeal of the estate tax, which can be as high as 55 percent).
Mr. Trump's plan met a response that ranged from incredulity to ridicule from a number of economists yesterday. They suggested that a 14.25 percent tax would be impossible to get through a Republican-controlled Congress that championed a $792 billion tax cut this year. Beyond that, they said that even if it passed it would be problematic to measure net worth and then to tax it.
"I don't think the plan makes much economic sense," said Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. "The fact is that most people's wealth that has been built up over 10, 20 or 50 years is wealth that has already been taxed."
Mr. Trump's main opponent for the Reform Party nomination, Patrick J. Buchanan, offered a harsher assessment of Mr. Trump's plan. "This is serious wacko stuff," Mr. Buchanan said by telephone from Albany.
Mr. Buchanan predicted that Mr. Trump's plan would cause the wealthy to move their holdings beyond the reach of the Internal Revenue Service. "I can't think of a better idea to cause capital flight out of the United States," Mr. Buchanan said.
Mr. Trump said he had come up with the idea on his own and worked out its details with private economists. He declined to name them.
He rejected criticism of his idea, demanding: "Where is Gore's plan? Where is Bradley's plan? Where is Bush's plan? They don't exist."
Still, it was clear that some parts of Mr. Trump's proposal remained unformed. For example, of the $200 billion in interest costs that would be saved, he said he would apply half to the Social Security system and the rest to tax reduction.
Mr. Trump said that $20 billion of that would pay for eliminating the inheritance tax. Asked how he would allocate the rest, he responded: "All different taxes across the board. That would be determined and worked out."

HEADLINE: Investigation of State Development Agency Focuses on L.I. Land Deal

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Nearly two dozen developers eagerly set their sights on the old Pilgrim State Psychiatric Center in 1997 when the state offered to sell the property -- the largest tract of undeveloped land on Long Island.
Companies from as close as Brentwood and as far as Montreal thought the tree-lined 560-acre parcel, which straddles the Long Island Expressway and the Sagtikos Parkway in Islip, was a potential gold mine, ideally suited for housing, retail space and office buildings. 
 In one instance, Miromar Development spent $1 million and more than two years developing a proposal. Jerry Wolkoff, who owns an industrial park adjacent to Pilgrim, worked for about a year on his proposal, while Mentmore Development put in a month on its bid.
But it was only 10 days before the bids were due last November that another, final entrant into the competition for the valuable chunk of land surfaced. Reckson Associates Realty, a large, publicly traded real estate investment trust based in Melville, joined the fray with an 11th-hour offer.
Barely a month later, Reckson was declared the winner, its $32 million package deemed the worthiest by the Empire State Development Corporation, the state agency handling the sale.
The announcement, however, did not end the process so much as it began another: the losing bidders began to complain that Reckson had prevailed unfairly, and in recent months they have made their complaints to the Manhattan district attorney.
One losing participant has told the authorities that he believed that Reckson had obtained inside information about the rival offers, which enabled the company to produce a winning bid and suggested that the improper assistance resulted from Reckson's partner, Louis R. Cappelli, and his political ties and contributions to state Republicans.
Another prospective buyer, Miromar, has told prosecutors that the company found it unusual, given the state agency's wide latitude to reopen the bid process, that the economic development corporation had rejected its final $35 million offer because it had been submitted three days late.
Officials with Reckson, who maintained that their proposal won on its merits, said they were mystified by the complaints.
"It doesn't make any sense," Donald Rechler, the chairman of Reckson, said of the complaints. "We're not political animals."
For months, the Manhattan district attorney's office has been trying to determine whether political favoritism has played a role in the Empire State Development Corporation's awarding of a handful of economic incentive packages, and the sale of the Pilgrim hospital land is one of those deals.
Bidders and state officials have been interviewed; documents have been subpoenaed. The travel and business dealings of the agency's chairman, Charles A. Gargano, have also been examined as part of the broad investigation.
The state agency has refused to discuss the sale publicly other than to say it was entirely justified. And in an effort to close the deal with Reckson by the end of the year, two state officials said that the agency recently took the unusual step of hiring an outside law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, to review the bidding process.
Ordinarily, concerns about wrongdoing by state employees are referred to the state inspector general. But the inspector general, according to the state officials, has been working with the district attorney on his investigation of the economic development agency.
So far, both the inspector general and the district attorney have refused to discuss the inquiry in any detail.
"The privatization of Pilgrim State Psychiatric Center was right and proper in every way," Maura Gallucci, a spokeswoman for the state agency, said in a written statement, "and as a demonstration of our confidence, we have hired Skadden Arps to complete a thorough, objective and independent review of the transaction."
Neither Mr. Gargano, who oversaw the Pilgrim sale, nor John Buttarazzi, a senior vice president directly responsible for the bidding process, returned calls requesting comment.
But at least two other bidders say that the Pilgrim tract should be put up for sale again.
"They should just reopen the process and have open bidding," said Mr. Wolkoff, a Long Island developer and a finalist in the bidding.
Pilgrim State was not only the largest, but also the most valuable of the 12 former psychiatric centers that the state put up for sale. Unlike many of the other properties, Pilgrim State has good highway access and sits near several desirable communities in Suffolk County, where housing prices are high.
Built in 1930, Pilgrim State was part of a network of sprawling state psychiatric centers that Gov. George E. Pataki has sought to sell now that they are considered obsolete. About 84 dilapidated buildings would be demolished, although a small psychiatric center would continue to operate on a separate parcel.
But attempts to sell or redevelop the property over the last 20 years as a state prison, juvenile detention center or regional incinerator have met with fierce local resistance. This time, the state set up a task force, which eventually recommended a variety of sports and entertainment-related uses, as well as housing for the elderly and a small amount of light industry.
The recommendations were in no way binding on a potential buyer, although any developer would have to obtain zoning and environmental approval from the local towns.
"It's a very valuable parcel because it lends itself to multi-use development," said David Pannetta, a vice president with Oxford & Simpson, a real estate broker based on Long Island.
The state agency formally issued invitations to bid in July 1998 and required prospective buyers to submit their offers by Nov. 16. The bidding documents did not require the state to accept the highest bid, a condition that would allow the state to sell the property to a developer who offered a plan favored by local towns, but not necessarily the highest price. It did require that all proposals be cash-only bids.
Long aware of the pending sale, Margaret Miller, the president of Miromar, which is based in Montreal, said the company had spent nearly three years devising a proposal for the Pilgrim site and meeting with civic leaders and local and state officials, including Mr. Gargano. Miromar envisioned a combination of museums, hotels, a sports complex, golf course and an amusement park.
That is not to say that Miromar's plans had met with universal acceptance.
"It was way out of proportion, which would not have sat well with the communities," said Laura Mansi, a local civic leader and chairwoman of the Zoning Board of Appeals in Huntington.
But in contrast with Miromar's protracted approach, Mr. Rechler said Reckson did not decide to bid on Pilgrim until Nov. 6. Since Reckson specializes in industrial and commercial buildings, he said he sought out a partner who was active in residential development. He ultimately turned to Mr. Cappelli, a developer and prominent Republican contributor who had sold his office portfolio in Westchester to Reckson last year for $183 million.
Mr. Rechler said he signed a two-page agreement with Mr. Cappelli, but it was Reckson that submitted the formal proposal to build a combination of housing, office and industrial projects. The plan has not been released by the state, but Reckson has promised to work with local communities.
"This all happened within a 10-day period," Mr. Rechler said. "We went to a number of residential and retail guys. Cappelli was the only one who stepped up and sent a deposit check."
Mr. Cappelli, whose companies and relatives have contributed more than $85,000 to Republicans since early 1995, is also involved in a state-subsidized project to redevelop downtown New Rochelle, a project that is also being scrutinized by the district attorney. Mr. Cappelli did not return calls requesting comment.
About 20 developers submitted bids in November and, according to the bidders, four of them -- Miromar, Reckson, Mr. Wolkoff and Mentmore Holdings in New York -- were selected as finalists and asked to make second, presumably higher, offers on Dec. 3.
One bidder has told investigators that he concluded the sale was being conducted improperly after he learned from another person involved in the bidding that Reckson knew the amount of his offer before the final deadline and while the offers were supposedly secret. He complained that Mr. Cappelli had secured the deal because of his political contributions to Republicans.
"Another bidder knew what I was offering," said the developer, who spoke only on the condition that he not be named. "It was disheartening."
Mr. Rechler insisted that his company did nothing wrong and was cooperating with investigators.
In the end, Mentmore, which had bid $52 million and proposed a combination of housing for the elderly, a regional shopping center, a golf course and entertainment complex, was disqualified because its offer contained a number of contingencies that did not conform to the state's bidding guidelines.
The company also submitted a $35 million offer, but it, too, had a number of contingencies.
Mr. Wolkoff, who proposed to build warehouses, office buildings and housing for the elderly, pushed his offer up to $25 million. That left Miromar, which raised its bid, to $28.1 million from $21.5 million, and Reckson, which came in at $32 million.
According to a person who has reviewed the bidding, Reckson offered to put up $16 million in cash, while Mr. Cappelli offered a $16 million letter of credit.
Three days after the December deadline, Ms. Miller said she sent a letter to the development corporation increasing her offer to $35.5 million, after reviewing her projected demolition costs, but still unaware of the opposing bids. Ms. Miller, who met with investigators in New York in July, said she had since given her letter and other documents to the district attorney.
Executives at the state agency told investigators that the new offer from Miromar ignited a debate among Mr. Gargano, Mr. Buttarazzi and others within the agency. Some executives said that it would be unfair to the other bidders to accept an offer that came in after the deadline, while others argued that it would be a mistake to leave the extra $3 million from Miromar on the auction block.
Ms. Miller contends that the agency had reopened the bidding in December, after initially setting a single deadline, Nov. 16. Indeed, the state's bidding documents specified only one round of bidding, but preserved the state's right to do just about anything in the disposition of the property.
"They could've reopened the bidding 10 times to get it right," Ms. Miller said. "There was no limit."
Mr. Rechler is as confident as the agency that the deal for Pilgrim will go forward. He said the state was finishing up several details relating to the sale, which he expects to complete soon. "It's all pretty much cleared up now," Mr. Rechler said.
Skadden Arps's review of the deal is expected to last four weeks.
David R. Binswanger, the president of Chesterton Blumenauer Binswanger, the Philadelphia real estate company hired by the state to market the Pilgrim property and 11 other parcels, said the state was merely being diligent.
"It's the largest parcel, and the one that people are squawking about the most," Mr. Binswanger said. "I think this is a very clean deal."

HEADLINE: Web Search Group Loses Grant

BYLINE: By GEORGE ROBINSON 

 BODY:
THE SCOUT REPORT, a highly regarded publication that monitors the Internet for new and useful research resources, is facing a loss of financing when its three-year grant from the National Science Foundation runs out next spring.
Not that the foundation is displeased with the report; it is "quite pleased," said George Strawn, acting executive officer of the foundation's directorate of computer and information sciences and engineering. "We typically fund a project for two to three years and, when it concludes, it is not extended," Dr. Strawn said. 
 Operating as a part of the computer science department at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, The Scout Report, which comes out weekly on Friday afternoons, highlights about 20 Web sites of interest to the research and education communities. In addition, the report also publishes editions twice a month for science and engineering, social sciences, business and economics, and sites for schoolchildren in kindergarten through 12th grade.
Unlike search engines, The Scout Report is highly selective in its choice of Internet resources, checking each for currentness, reliability and ease of access.
"There are currently 30,000 direct subscribers to the list," Susan Calcari, the report's creator and director, wrote in an e-mail. "But we know it is forwarded on many times and that some of the subscriptions are actually 'exploder' lists which include many individuals in various departments or organizations."
The subject-specific reports have a total of about 45,000 subscribers. And the Web site (scout.cs.wisc.edu), which archives all the reports and includes an easy-to-use database of all the covered Web sites (www .signpost.org/signpost), records more than 45,000 hits daily.
The loss of the science foundation money will result in an annual shortfall of about $400,000. To make up for the loss, The Scout Report editors and staff will pursue grants from nongovernment sources. They are also considering working with commercial organizations that may want to be sponsors in return for recognition in the reports.
On Oct. 6, the report sent a survey to subscribers, asking for suggestions on new sources of financing. Ms. Calcari said that there were 3,000 responses "filled with examples of how the filtered content of the Scout reports allow users of all ages and all walks of life to enjoy the best of the Internet."
Joseph J. Mattie, a library development specialist in the New York State Department of Education, forwards the report to 45 directors of school library systems. "We don't have the staff to spend the hours it takes to analyze Web sites and make recommendations," he said. "This material comes from a higher-education environment, so it's reliable."
The Scout Report has also proved helpful for a user with a more narrowly defined objective. Rita Jo Jordan edits and publishes Analytical Consumer, a monthly newsletter that evaluates instruments used by analytical chemistry laboratories. "I find the items on the environment, waterways and wetlands extremely useful," Dr. Jordan said. "With a search engine I have something specific in mind. The Scout Report tells me about things I wouldn't have thought to look for."
Ms. Calcari is concerned that the Report continue to be free.
"The focus of our project," she said, "has always been to improve resource discovery on the Internet and to reach as many educators, students, librarians and lifelong learners as possible. Attempting to charge for the publications would be counter to these goals."

HEADLINE: Getting Personal in Prime Time;
Creators of TV Shows Tap Their Lives

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Two years ago Betsy Thomas, a television writer, checked into the Chateau Marmont hotel in West Hollywood in the aftermath of a divorce. On her first evening there she called room service for a bottle of wine when friends visited. The waiter, an unemployed actor, arrived with the tray.
One thing led to another. Ms. Thomas not only married the actor, Adrian Wenner, but also turned the experience into a television comedy series, "Then Came You," creating it with Jeff Strauss. The show is scheduled to make its debut on ABC early next year. 
 "Writing about your own life keeps you honest," said Ms. Thomas. "And let's face it, truth is often stranger than fiction."
With the network television audience shrinking and network executives acknowledging that no one is quite sure anymore what viewers want, television writers have turned inward to create a surprising number of shows that reflect their personal lives, most of them funny, but some painful too.
At least 10 new shows that either began this fall or are set to be shown next year are based on the writers' experiences. The dramatic fodder includes being abandoned as a child by a father who returns years later; entering the dating game after a divorce; coping with a strong-willed mother; life as a high-school geek, and being a gay man living in a Brooklyn apartment with straight roommates.
And then there's Ms. Thomas, who is fully tapping into her often embarrassing experiences while dating Mr. Wenner. (The two were married in May.)
"He's seven years younger, and he looks really young," said Ms. Thomas, who is 33. "I've been asked if he's my son, my nephew, my little brother. And I don't look old! When we got our marriage license in Chicago, the woman asked our date of births. I told her mine, and he told her his -- which is 1973 and terrifying. She just stopped and raised an eyebrow at me and went back to her writing. My first reaction was, 'I'm not a cradle robber.' My second reaction was anger."
For years writers and creators have used television to mirror their lives. Two of television's most successful series, "I Love Lucy" and "Seinfeld," were based to some degree on the lives and idiosyncrasies of their creators. On the other hand, Steven Bochco ("N.Y.P.D. Blue") and Dick Wolf ("Law and Order") have never worked as police officers or prosecutors, and Norman Lear ("All in the Family") is hardly a working-class family man from Queens.
Yet this year shows based on personal experience are unusually abundant, and no one seems fully sure why, though many note that networks are searching for something -- anything -- to distract audiences from cable or the Internet.
"When writers are able to draw on their own life experiences and find comedy within those experiences, and the comedy rings true, that often creates a very compelling program," said Lloyd Braun, co-chairman of the ABC Entertainment Television Group.
Networks sometimes go out of their way to find writers whose lives reflect the ones they are creating, especially for shows about families. "An office show is one thing," said Garth Ancier, president of NBC Entertainment. "We've all worked in offices and you can observe the human dynamics, but it's difficult to do stories about parenting if you don't have kids."
Similarly, Alan Ball, the creator of "Oh Grow Up," a comedy series on ABC about a gay man and his straight roommates in Brooklyn, said writers have more empathy and passion for a show that springs from personal experience.
"What you're ultimately doing is creating a stylized version of life," said Mr. Ball, who also wrote the screenplay for the film "American Beauty." "We're definitely looking to base the arc of the show on very real things, some of which I've experienced," said Mr. Ball, who is gay and shared an apartment in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn from 1986 to 1994. "But the gay guy does not fully represent me; I don't look like him, I didn't get married like him, I'm not a lawyer like him and he's much more conservative than I am."
In "Sammy," an animated show with a serious spin, which is to have its premiere early next year on NBC, the comedian David Spade deals with "your textbook deadbeat dad," the character Sammy, who abandons his wife and three young sons and later moves back into the life of one of the sons, who has become a successful comedian.
"The core of the show is pretty true," said Mr. Spade, who also stars in the NBC comedy "Just Shoot Me." "It gets touchy for me. It's close to home. I keep thinking, 'Do I really want people to know about this?' It's a fine line."
One reason for doing "Sammy," Mr. Spade said, was that he wanted to create something semiserious about growing up without a father and about a mother burdened with two jobs and caring for three boys. The network and Mr. Spade are convinced that because divorce affects almost half of American children, the show could touch a large audience.
But Mr. Spade also made clear that he wants to exorcise some personal demons. At one point in the show Sammy is tossing a football with his grown son. "You got your arm from me," says Sammy. His son replies, "All I got from you is alcoholism and a fear of commitment."
There is NBC's "Freaks and Geeks," about two cliques of high school outcasts in the 1980's, created by Paul Feig, 37, and Judd Apatow. "I fell squarely in the geek category," said Mr. Feig, a longtime television comedy writer who attended Chippewa Valley High School in Mount Clemens, Mich. "I was a big, lanky, awkward kid. All my extremities developed before the rest of me. I was the kid who knew how to fix the movie projectors and get things in focus. I think I had one date in high school."
Mr. Feig said: "The only way I can make something 100 percent honest is taking from my own life. It's also more fun to write that way, more cathartic."
Other sitcoms and dramas based on personal lives include an ABC series about the aftermath of divorce, "Once and Again," which reflects the experiences of one of its creators, Marshall Herskovitz, and CBS's highly successful "Judging Amy," in which the actress Amy Brenneman plays a newly appointed judge in Hartford who tangles with her forceful mother, played by Tyne Daly.
Ms. Brenneman's mother, Frederica S. Brenneman, has been a judge for 30 years in courts in Connecticut and is a technical adviser to the show. "The relationship between my character and Tyne Daly was very much mirrored on my relationship to my mother," Ms. Brenneman said. "Sometimes it gets complicated. At the end of the day we're making a fictional piece, but there are moments that are tricky for both of us."
She said with a laugh, "I don't think any secrets have been told."
Ms. Brenneman, who was formerly on "N.Y.P.D. Blue," said that she grew up listening to her mother's stories about court cases. "When you write from your own story it's so much more quirky than any fiction can be," she said. "You have an endless supply from which to draw. It's so specific. It's just better stuff."
Another highly promoted show, NBC's "Third Watch," about police officers, paramedics and firefighters, is based on the experiences of Edward Allen Bernero, a former Chicago policeman who worked on the police show "Brooklyn South" and is the co-creator and co-producer of the new series with John Wells.
"The characters on the show are me and the people I know," Mr. Bernero said. "We haven't had to invent a lot. It's natural."
He said viewers no longer accept traditional police dramas on television because of the influence of reality-based shows like "Cops" and Mr. Bochco's shows like "N.Y.P.D. Blue." "If you tried to do a 'Starsky and Hutch' today people wouldn't accept it," said Mr. Bernero. "They've been on the inside too much."
The personal approach is hardly restricted to network television. There is also the successful half-hour series "Oh Baby" on the Lifetime cable network, which is about a single working woman who has a child through artificial insemination. The comedy is based on the experiences of Susan Beavers, its creator and executive producer. Ms. Beavers, a veteran television writer, said that after taking 18 months off to spend with her baby, returning to work was difficult.
"I knew that in order to get back to work I'd have to write something," she said. "I tried to deal with what I knew -- how to tell a boyfriend that you're artificially inseminated, the logistics of it, hiring a nanny, going back to work for the first time with the baby at home, getting a kid into a prenursery, which meant for me joining a church and getting baptized, which I did."
Ms. Beavers, whose son is 4, said that writing about what she knew was far more honest and artistically truthful than creating scripts involving issues about which she knew little. "I wrote a show for Tony Danza where he was a police officer in Hoboken," she said. "I don't know anything about Hoboken or police officers. Why was I on that show?"

HEADLINE: GUY DECOR;
. . . And Committing to His Decorator

BYLINE: By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI 

 BODY:
ON the day that Jerry Seinfeld was announcing his engagement to Jessica Sklar, a Tommy Hilfiger publicist, her former husband, Eric Nederlander, was closing on his new Lafayette Street loft and contemplating his future -- with a decorator.
For Mr. Nederlander (whose friends are eager to fix him up with a woman to help him forget that Ms. Sklar left him for Mr. Seinfeld three weeks after their honeymoon in 1998), it's design first, dating later. 
 And that means at a safe geographic distance from his recent Upper West Side past. "I have to feel comfortable in my surroundings," said Mr. Nederlander, 34, a Broadway producer, whose 3,000-square-foot home boasts a giant wrap terrace and David Bowie as a neighbor. He wants a serious television system with surround sound. He wants artwork that's "nice," but beyond that? So he's talking to William Sofield, the designer of the SoHo Grand Hotel.
"I want to hire someone I trust," he said wistfully. "And let them do whatever they want."
That may be why someone like Todd Romano, a decorator on the Upper East Side, said: "I'm seeing younger and younger men decorating. They are not waiting to get married to do this stuff."
Mr. Romano has been decorating homes for more than seven years, from New York to Texas. In that time, as the economy soared and the pleasures of home design began to be touted in upstart magazines like Wallpaper, the tastes of the young men requesting his services became more sophisticated.
"Men want to have the best-looking girlfriends, the best-tailored duds, the shiniest cars," he said. "They may not say, 'I want a Louis XV period room,' but they know they want to live well."
Which means out with the futons and college sports trophies and in with what Mr. Romano called the "James Bond meets the Rat Pack lounge look." At the turn of the century, the ultimate arm candy is not a supermodel; it's a bachelor pad that is masculine but says, "I have style and taste."
So what do single men want? Gadgets like flat screen televisions, big pulsating shower heads, terraces full of greenery so their dogs will be comfortable. What they don't want is a girlfriend involved in the designing. "If you let girls buy sheets and towels or pick out furniture, that's letting them get their tentacles into you," said Andrew Feldman, 43, a sports doctor with a freshly decorated apartment.
So altar-shy men go for the vow-free alternative: a decorator. All the comforts of home (tasteful, too) without your girlfriend telling you what to do (or moving in). "Look, you never know if the girl will last through the 14-week delivery date on the couch," one bachelor said. "So why bring her?"
Though Dr. Feldman's apartment at the Eldorado was ill equipped, and furnished "with some of my grandmother's furniture and one towel," he shied from girlfriends' offers to upgrade his surroundings. That seemed too much involvement. Instead, he committed to a decorator, though he worried about things like "boopy" curtains. He ended with exactly what he wanted: sofas long enough to lounge on, a steam shower and a spot for a six-foot statue he dug up in Tanzania. It's in the entrance hall, warding off evil spirits (and perhaps girlfriends interested in improving his surroundings). If a woman buys sheets for a man, she may want to sleep between them, Heaven forbid, forever.
Single men decorating an apartment seem to come equipped with a built-in Tanzanian statue that wards off blithe spirits bearing copies of Elle Decor and visions of connubial bliss. Decorators and designers in New York are reaping the benefits of the male fear of commitment in an age of haut decor.
Pamela Sicher, a New York psychiatrist, blames the rise in divorce figures for a growing fear of commitment among her male patients. "The majority of today's 20-year-olds and 30-year-olds are coming out of families where at least one divorce took place, and there is not as much confidence in home and hearth," she said, adding that while some of her patients marry young or "prematurely nest," others "avoid dependence of any kind by seeking to acquire homes by paying for them."
Other men say they are waiting as long as possible before making a commitment, to assure themselves that something better won't come along, said Dr. Robert Welber, a couples therapist in Manhattan.
A single man will gladly hire a woman as a decorator, however, as long as her taste is nothing like his mother's. Brad Miller, 36, the chief operating officer of an entertainment and technology company, wanted his new 1,700-square-foot loft on Thompson Street to be comfortable. Friends suggested that he consider Nancy Pearson, a decorator he met last summer in a Hamptons share house.
"I never thought I'd be the type of guy to hire a decorator," Mr. Miller said. "I'm someone who likes to roll around in the mud playing rugby. Hiring a decorator sounds slighty pretentious and even a little feminine." (He equated it with men who watch polo.)
Ms. Pearson asked him, "What's your taste?" He looked around the share house, filled with English country furniture, and said, "This, I guess."
He was a dream client, she said. At least at first, because he didn't care. Then, warming to the design possibilities, he insisted on the emblem of swinging Manhattan bachelorhood, a black leather sofa, but "she had the clout to steer me in a different direction and let me see the light," he said, adding, "It's not like I had a taste."
Eventually, she persuaded him to embrace a white chenille sofa. Still, he did want functional furniture, so she got an old laundry table for a dining room table, wooden chairs and a bench. It is all very English country in effect, though Mr. Miller usually keeps the bench stuffed with in-line skates, instead of cricket bats. Emboldened, Mr. Miller went to an antiques fair, bought two French Art Deco chairs "and put them in my English country living room," Ms. Pearson fumed. "I was sick over it," she said.
Despite the intrusion, the apartment, which cost Mr. Miller more than $75,000 to finish, is surviving. "I've done a lot of single guys' apartments," Ms. Pearson said, plainly wary of leaving guys to their own devices. Men, it seems, do not know when to let well enough alone. Soon after finishing the job, Ms. Pearson stopped by to discover that Mr. Miller had installed an exercise area, complete with a Bowflex machine with power rods, next to the kitchen.
"Oh, nice," she said. "It reminds me of a torture chamber."
At least the exercise area was Mr. Miller's idea, not the result of an inamorata's meddling. Mary Meehan, an Upper East Side decorator, will not even take a job from a single man. She is certain that behind every seemingly independent guy is a girlfriend, serious or not. "See, if there is a woman involved, she should be involved, because you're going to be working against her without even knowing it," she said.
Consider one of her recent clients, a 40-something divorced doctor who hired Ms. Meehan to decorate a 4,000-square-foot house in Westchester County. Ms. Meehan, an Architectural Digest alumna whose average job costs about $500,000, shopped for comfortable furniture and picked bright colors for the walls.
Six months into the job, she asked the painter why the colors she had chosen were not being put on the walls. The painter said the doctor's girlfriend (that was the first Ms. Meehan had heard about a girlfriend) wanted different colors. A week later, the decorator was fired.
"Girls, you can't question their taste," said Jeff Burroughs, 33, the vice president of BadBoy Entertainment, a company founded by Sean (Puffy) Combs. "They take it personally." So Mr. Burroughs hired Shawna Chow to make his 2,000-square-foot loft on Nassau Street into "a sexy space." A spiritual one, too, with candles everywhere. ("She took my love for candles to another level," he said.) And a social place, where he could "have cool little dinner parties," befitting someone who made Manhattan File magazine's "100 Most-Wanted Bachelors" list. Mr. Burroughs said he had very strong feelings about one room in particular. "The bed was very important," he said.
A woman who was his house guest last weekend said of his four-poster: "It will change when you get married. Look, no woman wants to sleep where other women have been."
Mr. Burroughs quickly changed the subject to toys, specifically one he still didn't have in his arsenal of special effects: the remote control that Mr. Combs has, which will turn down the lights and fire up the CD player simultaneously. "I can't have everything that Puffy has," he said. "But I have to get that."
One young man on the Upper West Side who has hired a male decorator but asked not to be identified, spoke of the relationship nuances that can occur in bringing a date on decorating excursions. Not so much nuances, mind you, as potential threats.
"You wouldn't want a date you're taking out to see you buy a $20,000 rug," he said. "They'll think if you spend $20,000 on a rug you walk all over and will last you five years max, then you'll easily spend $100,000 on a ring she'll wear the rest of the life."

Iron John Is Buying Throw Pillows . . .

BYLINE: By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
IF you accept the rule of thumb that anything three inches above the floor constitutes furniture, then Charlie Himmelberg, who is single and lives in a four-room apartment on the Upper West Side, owns six pieces: a futon, a bookshelf, a television stand with a television, a coffee table, a folding canvas patio chair and a pressed-wood kitchen table that a girlfriend gave him.
"Does my electric keyboard count?" asked Mr. Himmelberg, 36, a professor of finance and economics at Columbia University. The keyboard has the dining room to itself. His mother sent him the patio chair after she visited the apartment, where he has lived for five years, because there was no place to sit. 
 Mr. Himmelberg is letting nature run its course.
"I'm still single," he said. "I could spend a ton of money, then get married to someone who doesn't like the stuff."
Until he married, had a baby and bought a six-bedroom house in New Jersey, Kevin Smith, 29, whose 1994 film "Clerks" chronicled the adulthood dilemmas of two single young men and whose new film, "Dogma," opens tomorrow, lived a similar life.
"The television was the most important piece of furniture in the house," Mr. Smith said.
But there are indications that men, notoriously resistant to the idea of buying furniture for themselves, are losing their fear of furnishing. And no, they're not buying it with beer-cap coupons.
New furniture shopping formats like the Internet, retail stores friendly to both sexes, like Pottery Barn and Restoration Hardware, and a changing social attitude are helping men get in touch with their furnishing side.
"The received wisdom has always been that women are the major purchasers," said Lee Brown, an analyst with Rosenthal & George, a market research company in Atlanta. Industry sources have put the figure as high as 95 percent. "We have discovered that this may be a thought that's 10 years old," she said.
In a September report, the company found that men have become an almost equal buying force. Single men accounted for 19 percent of the purchases, single women, 28 percent and couples making joint purchases, 53 percent. "Though 81 percent of the furniture purchases involved women, 72 percent involved men," Ms. Brown said. "It's now almost neck and neck." She explained that the men making the greatest impact were 25 to 34.
"They have opinions about style, they're marrying later and they're often at a higher discretionary income level at a younger age," Ms. Brown said. "So they have to feather the nest themselves."
The Internet, with a population of 97 million and a projected $92 million in furniture and housewares sales this year, may be the big icebreaker between men and furnishing. Edmund Wise, a design consultant available by an "800" number for Furniture.com, the Internet's most heavily visited furniture site, said of men who call, "They talk about how embarrassed they are about the way they live."
Roughly half of Furniture.com's 722,000 visitors in September were men; half of Mr. Wise's callers were also men.
"Single men used to be the rarest category in furniture retail," he said, speaking of seven years' experience as a furniture-store salesman. "On the Internet, they're typical."
Besides the convenience of shopping online, "men are saying, 'Help me,' " Mr. Wise said.
"I worked in a high-traffic store," he continued. "Two thousand people came through in a month. I never had one guy talk to me about color in seven years. Now, on the phone, they all want to talk about color." It's refreshing, he said: "It's like people who start painting in their 50's."
Ben Hansen, design service manager for Living.com, another large furniture site, said that half of its sales were to men. "They're going for the higher tickets, too," he said.
According to a September report published by NetSmartAmerica .com, which analyzes the e-commerce market, men represent 49 percent of the visitors to furniture sites. Eleven percent are single.
And retailers are playing to the figure, online and off.
"George, tell us about your first time," says the voice-over in a Furniture.com television advertisement. George, a single male, is also a cat. "I'll never forget it," he replies. "So inexpensive. So easy." Sounds like "a good date," the voice says, with male approval. No, George answers, he was shopping for furniture.
In Restoration Hardware's holiday catalog, the Morgan leather sofa sits with a glass of beer balanced on an open book, a Dagwood sandwich on the ottoman and a wall of sports trophies behind. Deconstructing the sales pitch wouldn't require Roland Barthes. Furniture now accounts for 30 percent of the baby-boomer hardware store's sales.
Men's Journal is introducing a monthly furnishings page with the intention of helping men find their "inner guy" at home. The September issue, which was devoted to design, was its best-selling newstand issue.
"Design is a tool for them, like suits," said Terry McDonell, the editor. "They now think where they live has to measure up."
Jay Tarrant, 32, an editor at Fortune Small Business magazine, bought his first apartment last year on West 57th Street, and suddenly found himself house proud.
In a month, Mr. Tarrant purchased a club chair and sofa at ABC Carpet and Home, a torchere floor lamp at Caldor and simple cotton drapes at Urban Outfitters. "Big warning for single men: window treatments," he said. "What the hell is a window treatment?"
Mr. Tarrant said he enjoyed the process: "For 10 years, I took whatever people gave me. I'm not going to put anything in this apartment I don't want." That includes a framed picture of dogs playing poker. "Can't get rid of that," he said.
Last Sunday at Crate & Barrel in New York, the furniture floor was crowded with young couples with babies strapped to their chests. The people shopping by themselves were an equal mix of men and women.
"About 40 percent of my customers are single men," said Robert Hedstrom, a salesman, who has noted an increase during five years at the store. "You get a lot who are a clean slate. They've got the style in mind. They start with the sofa and buy up around it, from the store display: end tables, chairs."
Do they kick the tires? "The construction question doesn't come up," Mr. Hedstrom said.
At Pottery Barn, single men are a benchmark for product introductions, said Celia Tejada, vice president of product design and development.
"If it works with this guy, it will work with couples and women," she added.
Both Mr. Hedstrom and Ms. Tejada said that price was not a priority for single men buying furniture. But sticker shock is very real.
"I was blown away at couches that cost $2,000, $3,000," said Mr. Tarrant, who picked a sofa he liked at ABC Carpet & Home in the sale-item room. He also bought his club chair without its $700 ottoman; he found one at an antiques store upstate.
Are men furnishing to impress women? In part, yes. But the motivations may be changing, from seduction to security.
"My men friends are pretty impressed," Mr. Tarrant said. "They see the stuff I've bought, and that it's nice, and it's like, 'Wow, it's a grown-up apartment.' Women are more impressed. They find out I did it myself, and they like that."
Michael Kimmel, a professor of sociology at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and the author of "The Gendered Society" (Oxford University Press), to be published in March, said that changing mores were changing how men live at home. Learning to have a life of their own, at home, which could include comforts like furniture, is, if not a rite of manhood, at least a passage into adulthood.
"Decorating your home, and nicely, is a positive image, that you're capable of taking care of a home," Mr. Kimmel said. "A woman walks in, and sees: 'Oh, I don't have to feed him. I'm going to have room for myself as well.' "
Then, what's taking so long? Why is the furnishing reflex frozen in many single men, like an attack of stage fright?
"They want to be the guy they knew and loved in college," said Stephen Gordon, the chief executive of Restoration Hardware. "They slowly become guys they don't know, and don't recognize. Furnishing reinforces it -- 'Who am I in the furniture realm?' "
Mr. Smith, the filmmaker, has survived the transition from condominium male to suburban husband. His Batman cel art collection is intact. The television is 40 inches wide.
Much else is as new as tomorrow.
"The transition is piece by piece, room by room," Mr. Smith said. "Wallpaper takes over. It starts in a small bathroom downstairs. Then it creeps into every bathroom in the house. Certain rooms get surrendered -- the bedroom." Mr. Smith said he suffered no resentment toward his wife, Jennifer Schwalbach-Smith. "I find it quite comforting that she thinks about stuff like that," he said. When single, Mr. Smith based his aethestic choices on where he had a department store credit card. "No style whatsoever," he explained. "That's the thing you learn quickly when you get a wife.
"You have no style whatsoever."

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The reuse of medical devices (front page, Nov. 10) is potentially wonderful news, despite the warning tone of your article. Industrial ecology teaches us to analyze what industry takes, what it makes and what it wastes. Routinely disposing of serviceable equipment, manufactured at high economic and environmental cost, is wasteful. 
 Moreover, incineration releases mercury, dioxins and other toxins into the environment, threatening public health. Once we have evidence of safety, we should promote the reuse of medical equipment for sound health, environmental and economic reasons.

HEADLINE: In America;
Dismantling Medicaid

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Ambivalence.
Bill Bradley is being praised for proposing a bold new plan to make health insurance available to nearly all Americans, and for putting the health care issue back on the national agenda in a major way. 
 But some of the strongest advocates of health care reform, especially those concerned about the health of poor children, are worried that Mr. Bradley's proposal is financially unrealistic and, in some ways, could do more harm than good.
Causing the most worry is Mr. Bradley's plan to do away with Medicaid, the federal and state program that provides health care for the poor. It would be replaced by a system of vouchers and tax credits designed to "mainstream" low-income people into the private insurance market.
Medicaid has been like a safe house for the poor. The thought of moving the poor out of Medicaid and into the health care marketplace with only a voucher for protection fills many advocates with dread.
The vouchers to purchase health insurance are, in fact, capped subsidies, and the caps have been set quite low. So poor people in many parts of the country may go into the private market only to find that their vouchers will not cover the full cost of health insurance. A big fear is that people now enrolled in Medicaid could end up with no coverage at all.
"I'm thrilled that health care is back on the agenda," said Dr. Irwin Redlener, president of the Children's Health Fund, which is based in New York and has become a national model for providing health care to poor children.
"I never expected to see this issue front and center like it is now, and that's a good thing. But I think Senator Bradley's proposal that Medicaid be eliminated is incredibly ill advised. Medicaid to me is a 30-year-old bedrock safety net program for children and poor pregnant women. For the life of me, I can't understand how that can be replaced by what amounts to a voucher program, which would both undermine the health care access that children have gotten under Medicaid and, second of all, put a new set of bureaucratic burdens on poor families that I think is just unreasonable."
Judy Feder, the dean of policy studies at Georgetown University, said there were aspects of Mr. Bradley's plan that she admired. But she, too, is concerned about the elimination of Medicaid, which provides not only health care but a range of related services to the very poor. Those services can include personal assistance and non-emergency transportation, as well as supplying beneficiaries with eyeglasses, hearing aids, wheelchairs and other medical equipment.
"It is important," said Ms. Feder, "to understand the special role of Medicaid. It treats a very disadvantaged population and provides a broad array of services that private health insurance has never touched."
There are other potential problems. Medicaid provides nursing home care for the elderly, which is a significant benefit for both low- and middle-class families. Under Mr. Bradley's plan, the responsibility for long-term care would be turned over to the states. What happens to long-term benefits and nursing home standards under that scenario is, at the moment, anybody's guess.
I asked David Cutler, a professor of economics at Harvard and a health care adviser to the Bradley campaign, about the financial hurdles faced by the plan. He said he expected the caps to be raised, that the proposed $1,800-a-year ceiling on the health insurance vouchers to be given to poor people would be increased to better reflect the market.
"The subsidy is not up to the most generous plan, not even the median plan, but a decent plan," said Mr. Cutler. His understanding, he said, is that it "is not fixed in stone."
Mr. Bradley proposes to pay for his initiative with money from the federal budget's non-Social Security surplus. Vice President Al Gore, who is touting his own, more modest health care proposal -- and who also plans to pay for it with the surplus -- has said Mr. Bradley's plan will devour the entire surplus.
"It doesn't eat up all of it," Mr. Cutler said, adding, "To me, the bigger issue is, before this gets enacted, or anything gets enacted, will Congress have already spent the money, either on silly tax cuts or something else."

HEADLINE: Share the Wealth

 BODY:

To the Editor:
You report (Week in Review, Nov. 7) that Americans are wondering if there is more to life than prosperity and that politicians are listening to the wondering. 
 For those who want to do more, here are a few ideas for fighting the poverty that persists despite the long economic boom: Overtip -- chronically and lavishly. Give your housekeeper a big raise. Instead of exchanging presents with well-heeled friends, each of you make a donation to a group serving the needy.
Take part in your shareholders' proxy statement vote. Proxies often present opportunities to vote on diversity, labor practices and other issues. It's rarely necessary to capture a majority of the votes to bring about a change.

HEADLINE: 2 Retailers Post Increases In Earnings

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Kmart and Federated Department Stores said yesterday that third-quarter profits rose as high consumer confidence and low unemployment helped increase sales, led by clothing and housewares.
Net income at Kmart, the No. 2 discount chain behind Wal-Mart Stores, rose 13 percent, meeting estimates. Federated, the owner of Bloomingdale's, Macy's and other chains, said net income gained 12 percent, beating forecasts. 
 Kmart's net income rose to $43 million, or 9 cents a diluted share, compared with $38 million, or 8 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales in the quarter ended Oct. 27 rose 5.4 percent, to $8.06 billion from $7.64 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 3.2 percent.
The results for Kmart, based in Troy, Mich., met analysts' expectations, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company earnings.
Federated's net income rose to $123 million, or 56 cents a share, compared with profit from operations of $110 million, or 50 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales in the quarter ended Oct. 30 rose 16 percent, to $4.24 billion from $3.65 billion, while same-store sales rose 3.9 percent. A year earlier, a charge of $23 million, or 10 cents a share, for the early retirement of debt resulted in net income of $87 million, or 40 cents a share.
Analysts had expected Federated, based in Cincinnati, to earn 53 cents a share, according to First Call/ Thomson Financial.
Most retailers have had their strongest stretch of sales gains in at least a decade amid a robust economy. Consumer spending may ease as the holiday season nears, which would separate the industry leaders like Federated that sell popular brand names and keep inventory costs low from the laggards like Kmart.
"It's going to be very competitive," said Sally Wallick, an analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker. "There's going to be a lot of promotional activity and a tremendous amount of advertising."
Shares of Kmart rose 18.75 cents, to $9.75, while Federated rose $1.4375, to $43.625.

HEADLINE: Clinton Optimistic About Year 2000

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
In his first detailed remarks on the subject since late last year, President Clinton predicted today that the Year 2000 computer problem would not disrupt the federal government or critical companies in the private sector, including those providing most of the nation's financial services, power, phones and transportation.
"America is well on its way to being Y2K ready," Mr. Clinton said at the White House, summarizing a progress report released later today by his Council on Year 2000 Conversion. 
 Advocates for Year 2000 preparedness said Mr. Clinton's assessment was too rosy and undercut his own council's recommendations that people prepare for possible disruptions as they would for a winter storm.
"This is an overly optimistic view," said Norman L. Dean, executive director of the Center for Y2K and Society, a nonprofit group based in Washington that is promoting local preparedness.
The disagreements turn on how to assess the risks suggested by the ever-changing preparedness data like that in the council's report. For instance, the council reported that several important services appeared to be far from ready, like 911 emergency phone centers. Just 50 percent have fully prepared their computers for the change to 2000 as of Oct. 1, according to the report.
But 911 experts say the centers will be able to receive and process all calls even without such enhancements as automatically pinpointing the origin of the calls. They argue that the problems with wireless phones were a bigger threat than Year 2000 glitches to such systems. Most major cities, including New York, have announced that their 911 systems are ready.
The council also noted that Year 2000 preparedness had been moving too slowly in schools, local governments, small businesses and developing countries, but in every case there are questions about how complete a picture can be derived from its data. Most of it comes from surveys in which data sources are unidentified and the responses are combined before the council sees them.
Mr. Clinton said he was confident that computer problems "will not put the savings or the safety of the American people at risk" and that government functions "from air traffic control systems to Social Security payment systems will continue to work exactly as they should."
But preparedness advocates complained that Mr. Clinton, who in his Internet chat on Monday told a questioner he saw no need to prepare for the millennium by bunkering down, should nonetheless have advised Americans to at least stockpile enough food, water and other vital supplies for several days of possible disruption.
At a news conference, John Koskinen, chairman of the Council on Year 2000 Conversion, took a more cautious stance than Mr. Clinton. While endorsing the bright national picture, Mr. Koskinen repeated the council's longstanding advice that each community had to look at its owns risks and that individuals should have the supplies on hand they would want if they were facing a natural disaster.
"We are urging people not only to prepare but to prepare early," Mr. Koskinen said.
The report was the fourth in a series of quarterly reviews the council began publishing in January. It is a compendium of data provided to the council through groups created to represent various sectors of the economy. But, Mr. Koskinen noted, such surveys have produced results consistent with federal regulators' reviews of some sectors like banks, energy and the drug industry.
Important information in the report, like data showing lagging preparations in small business and local governments, was gathered in the spring and is undoubtedly out of date. But Mr. Koskinen said anyone still taking a wait-and-see approach to the computer challenge is "asking for trouble."
The Year 2000 problem stems from the widespread use of just two digits to represent the year in electronic dates, like 99 for 1999. Some computers and other electronic equipment with embedded computers do not recognize 00 as 2000. As a result, they may shut down or generate faulty data.
Mr. Koskinen said that it might not seem irrational to a small business with little reliance on computers to count on fixing failures when they occur but that Year 2000 faults might also affect building security systems, office telephones and relationships with customers and suppliers in ways they might not expect. Moreover, repair support that would normally be quickly available might be delayed for weeks or months if problems are widespread.
Mr. Koskinen said there were continuing risks even for big computer users who thoughts their preparations were done, because computer vendors continue to discover flaws in their equipment and software.
Another concern, which Mr. Koskinen said he was briefed about on Tuesday at an Office of Management and Budget meeting with computer specialists, is that some computer systems that do not appear to track the date may nonetheless have date-sensitive microchips in them. Those systems also have to be tested, and plans must be made to handle breakdowns, Mr. Koskinen said.
Contingency plans have become a focus because it is widely recognized that some malfunctions are inevitable. Mr. Clinton noted that there were several glitches during the federal government's transition to its fiscal year 2000 on Oct. 1 and said the "overriding lesson of that experience was that alert organizations armed with good contingency plans can fix Y2K disruptions in short order."
Mr. Koskinen cautioned, however, that the experience with computers embedded in other equipment might not follow the fiscal year precedent. Such embedded system problems are expected to hit hardest in the first 10 days of next year. In some cases, they might not knock out a complex structure like a power grid but slowly degrade its performance, he said.
The lagging work on 911 systems raises similar concerns. In towns where 911 systems are plagued with Year 2000 problems, calls will still reach switchboards but it may take longer to handle them. Mr. Koskinen said the survey data provided no information on which communities had such problems.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "51 DAYS TO GO -- Turn-of-the-Century Concerns"
The report on Year 2000 computer readiness issued yesterday by a White House council cited these areas of continuing concern:
 
911 SERVICES -- Only 50 percent of 911 call centers had computers repaired and ready by Oct. 1.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- As of the most recent survey, last spring, 45 percent of small county governments told the National Association of Counties that they had no plans for dealing with Year 2000 issues.
HEALTH CARE -- Only 40 percent of health care providers reported readiness as of August in a private survey, and data were especially scarce on small providers.
EDUCATION -- One-third of schools were not ready as of this fall, and 4 percent will enter next year with faulty systems, according to Department of Education data.
SMALL BUSINESSES -- Of those that saw themselves at risk, 28 percent had no plans to prepare for disruptions, according to an April survey by the National Federation of Independent Businesses.
INTERNATIONAL -- Significant failures were expected in Asia and Eastern Europe, especially in the former Soviet Union; power might be interrupted in many countries.

HEADLINE: A French Paradox at Work;
35-Hour Week May Turn Out to Be Best for Employers

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: PFASTATT, France

 BODY:
Last year, the Beyer family, which owns a small jam and fruit preserves plant here near the Swiss border, made a proposal to their 18 employees: Would they like a 35-hour workweek and continue to be paid for working 39 hours?
To no one's great surprise, the employees said yes. "An hour more for yourself is an hour more," said Christiane Grimm, whose job includes slapping labels on jars, sorting through crates of fruit and watching over bubbling vats of jam. "There's lots you can do with it." 
 Surprisingly, the Beyers ended up happy, too. The company, one of thousands of French enterprises that have reorganized their businesses because of a 16-month-old law creating one of the shortest workweeks in the world, believes that it is far better off than before.
In the reshuffle, Philippe Beyer split his 18 employees into two teams and staggered their shifts. His factory here in the Alsace region now operates 12 hours a day, up from 8. And it produces 30 percent more than it did last year with only two extra employees.
The promise of 39 hours of pay for 35 hours of work was a campaign plank that helped catapult Lionel Jospin's leftist coalition to power in the 1997 Parliament elections. And it remains the glue that keeps Socialists, Communists and Greens together. It was aimed at creating as many as a million jobs in a country that has struggled with a double-digit rate of unemployment for years.
But many experts think that this bold experiment -- which business leaders had warned would cripple France's economy -- is not going to be a cure-all for the nearly three million unemployed.
Instead, it could accomplish something the leftist governing coalition never aimed for: a kind of housecleaning in the French workplace that will tear the cobwebs from French industry and lead to a more productive and flexible work force, as it did at Beyer.
"The primary goal of this policy is very unlikely," said Emanuel Ferry, an economist at Banque National de Paris, who is studying the policy. "But it seems to be having a backdoor effect. It is providing a very good opportunity to renovate the workplace. And it is introducing these elements -- productivity, flexibility -- quietly without triggering social unrest. So even if the direct goal of job creation is not achieved, it may still not necessarily be a bad thing for the economy."
That may be, but there is hardly a policy that has caused as much argument in France as the 35-hour week. While labor was an early advocate of the idea, many unions have recently demonstrated against it, fearing that the way it is being carried out will freeze salary levels and reverse hard-fought gains in employee rights. Businesses have protested, too. Last month, some 30,000 industrialists and executives gathered in an empty Paris conference center to wave placards and chant slogans deploring the policy. They say it will cost too much and destroy France's competitiveness.
Average citizens also seem to be losing their appetite for it. Surveys show that the idea was very popular when first proposed, but resistance grew the more the French considered it. A recent poll found that less than 10 percent of France's citizens now believe that they are going to benefit from shorter workweeks. Most people suspect that one way or another, they will be inconvenienced. Either way, it is a subject almost sure to start a fight.
"People feel very strongly about it," Mr. Beyer said. "In this country we are a little retrograde, we live the way we lived 30 years ago, and this is forcing change and so people are uneasy with it."
So far, there is little proof that the 35-hour week has created many jobs. Labor Ministry officials said in Parliament recently that the plan had created or saved 120,000 jobs. But one legislator called the figures "thin air," and most economists say a more realistic number would probably be half that. Opponents also point out that the government has been subsidizing the transition with business tax cuts and other incentives.
France's economy grew at a healthy rate of 3.2 percent in 1998, and is expected to do nearly as well this year. The unemployment rate has dropped to 11.1 in August from a high of 12.6 percent in June 1997. But few see much connection between the new jobs and the 35-hour policy.
"The 35 hours was a political decision," a Finance Ministry official said, "but it may become a really positive thing. Nothing was moving before. Now suddenly everyone has to go back and look at the way we have been doing business. People are talking and thinking and being creative."
The process of carrying out this complicated law, passed in June 1998, is still in its early stages. This month, Parliament passed a tangle of more than 100 amendments spelling out exactly how and when the policy should be instituted. One rule: All companies with 20 employees or more must operate with a 35-hour workweek by the year 2002. So far, only a little more than 1 percent of eligible French employers have formally made plans for the conversion.
Economists say the brunt of the law will be felt unevenly. Some businesses like the Beyer factory will benefit. Others, including service industries, are likely to have a much harder time.
George Jallerat, who owns Le Grand Monarque Hotel and Restaurant in Chartres, says he cannot figure out how to reduce his employees' hours, pay them the same wages and not lose money. "In the end, we will have to raise prices," he said. "There is no other way."
Some entrepreneurs are already taking steps to protect themselves. Dr. Thierry Sandre employs 19 people in his medical lab on the outskirts of Paris. He says he will do all that he can to avoid hiring a 20th person and bring the 35-hour workweek into his business.
But he does not trust the government to leave him alone. So he has not raised the pay of any of his employees in two years, as a way of saving money for the day he has to give them a 35-hour workweek for 39 hours of pay. He says he is not alone.
While the 35-hour workweek was being debated, government officials began trying to enforce the 39-hour limit that now exists, even among managers. Agents prowled garages to see what time people were actually leaving. Thousands of fines were issued, and in one case, the director of a electronics factory owned by Thomson-RCM was hauled into court for working too hard and allowing his engineers and other managers to put in an average of 46 hours a week. In June, he received an $18,000 fine. The action prompted some businesses to install time clocks even for managers and made the government the butt of jokes.
Those who have jumped at the shortened workweek are often those who were already planning to expand their businesses. For instance, the Packard Bell factory in the western town of Angers, which makes computers, went to the 35-hour week this year precisely because it wanted to increase production by 30 percent. To do that, it needed to reorganize its 1,200 employees into more teams and more shifts. Offering a 35-hour week was a way of opening negotiations with its unions.
Jean-Luc Bayel, the director of human resources, said the plan had worked out even better than anyone expected. "We have far less absenteeism," Mr. Bayel said. "And we are seeing a better product. People have to stand to do the job, and standing for eight hours is hard. Now they stand for only seven and we are seeing a 5 percent reduction in problem computers. We are very happy with the changes."
Packard Bell did not take advantage of government subsidies because it did not want to follow government rules. But others like Mr. Beyer also saw in the new law a way of getting government aid to pay for expansion plans.
At Beyer, for instance, the government aid package will pay nearly 90 percent of the salary for the two employees he added this year. Next year, it will pay about 70 percent and 50 percent the year after that. But Mr. Beyer, who took over the business from his father two years ago, wanted to expand anyway. He says he might have gone ahead with his plans anyhow, but the law gave him a push.
Not far from Mr. Beyer's factory, Didier Thuet, who owns a small heating-installation business, adopted the 35-hour week for just the same reason. "It was an opportunity to try something," he said.
Mr. Thuet's business is seasonal. There is little work at all from March to May. So he offered his employees a shorter workweek during those months in exchange for a longer one during peak business periods. They also got an additional six to eight days off. All six of the employees agreed to a salary freeze until the year was over and the company could see how much money it made.
But both Mr. Thuet and Mr. Beyer have their doubts about whether the law will work everywhere.
And there are complaints from the supposed beneficiaries of the new jobs. At Beyer, Sarah Charro, who at 26 had a series of temporary jobs, was hired because of the reorganization, but she has little good to say about it, regarding the atmosphere in the factory as tense.
"I feel in some ways like we went backward," Ms. Charro said. "We are working only 35 hours, but they are trying to push a lot into those hours -- push, push, push. We are all stressed out."
Mr. Thuet's new employee, Christoffe Foulon, says the 35-hour week is great if he does not lose any money. But in truth, he would rather work more and earn more. He says few of his friends seem to envy him. Instead, most give him a hard time. "They treat me like I'm lazy," he said.

"The Cost of an Employee"
For an employer, the cost of social insurance as a percentage of salary is higher in France than in some other places. The hourly cost of a production worker in manufacturing is made up from the salary paid directly to the worker before deductions and what an employer pays in social insurance and labor taxes.
 
France
Hourly cost of a production worker in manufacturing -- $17.97

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Clinton Cites Harley-Davidson in Pushing His Trade Policy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: YORK, Pa., Nov. 10

 BODY:
President Clinton today saluted a much-exported American icon, the Harley-Davidson motorcycle, in an effort to prepare the political ground for two high-stakes trade negotiations that are already touching off raucous debate in Washington and around the country.
As Mr. Clinton donned a leather Harley-Davidson jacket at the company's factory in York and mused about the possibility of becoming a biker at the end of his presidency, half of his economic team was in Beijing in a last-ditch effort to strike a deal with China that could vastly open the market for American producers. 
 While Mr. Clinton said nothing about the tense talks, Harley-Davidson was a fitting backdrop: It has had huge sales success in Japan, home ground for its archrival Honda, but it remains barred from the Chinese market.
In a small meeting with workers here, and then a campaign-style speech in front of the factory's 2,700 workers, Mr. Clinton spent much of the day trying to build support for America's position at the round of global trade negotiations that start in Seattle at the end of this month.
Already the administration is reeling from criticism that it has mismanaged the agenda, and that the streets will be dominated by environmentalists, economic nationalists and union members who all have their complaints about the World Trade Organization.
"I want y'all to watch Seattle when it rolls around," he said of the talks, which start Nov. 30 and will probably take years to complete. "I'll have more demonstrators against me than I've had in the whole seven years I've been president. I'm kind of looking forward to it."
He may be the only one who is. Mr. Clinton's aides fear that the global talks that they proposed are now out of hand. The United States wants to focus on agriculture and issues like keeping the Internet free of tariffs.
In a nod to labor and environmental groups, the United States has also proposed setting up a "working group on trade and labor" within the W.T.O. and to conduct an environmental review of the impact of trade talks. But that is not likely to satisfy opponents who fear that the trade group now has the power to override national environmental safety laws, or labor groups that want worldwide standards on minimum wages and employment conditions.
Developing nations oppose many of those proposals. Meanwhile, Japan and Europe want to use the talks to attack American antidumping laws, which they say are used as an American trade barrier to keep out foreign steel and other goods.
But Mr. Clinton went into none of that detail in his visit today. Instead, he offered a series of arguments about why trade helps American workers and consumers, and he cited Harley-Davidson, which exports 66,000 cycles a year. "In spite of all those numbers," Mr. Clinton said, "there's more debate on whether trade is good for us now than there was in 1992."
Mr. Clinton's critics on trade policy say that events like today's are too late, and that the president -- fearful of alienating Democrats and his traditional supporters -- has been too timid on trade issues.
"It's true we are in worse trouble on trade now than we were in '92," said Representative Jim Kolbe, an Arizona Republican who has often sided with Mr. Clinton on trade issues. "But I put a lot of blame for this at the feet of the President himself. Since NAFTA and the GATT agreementthere has been no leadership on this from the White House."
Mr. Clinton's response has mixed new arguments and old. He has made the case that few politicians dare to utter: That rising imports are a sign of the health of the American economy, and help keep inflation low and competition keen. But his conversation today with workers about the administration's effort to eliminate trade barriers could have taken place in the 1980's -- he even used the example of a Japanese restriction on imported skis that hurt American ski manufacturers. In fact, that problem was largely solved before he took office.

A Swinger, a Miss And an Injury
JERRY SEINFELD was a no-show at an auction on Tuesday that raised money for an assisted-living wing for Alzheimer's patients at the Cobble Hill Health Center in Brooklyn. KEITH HERNANDEZ, the former first baseman for the Mets whose mother died of Alzheimer's disease in 1989, had invited Mr. Seinfeld, as well as a benchful of ballplayers who did attend: BUD HARRELSON, LEE MAZZILLI and RUSTY STAUB all former Mets, as well as DAVID CONE, who is now a free agent.
As for Mr. Seinfeld, "He was supposed to come, at least for the cocktail hour," said Mr. Hernandez, who appeared on the "Seinfeld" show and whose photograph occupied a place of honor on Mr. Seinfeld's living room wall on the set. "But he called me and said he couldn't make it." 
 With an incredulous look, as if he had swung and missed a hanging curveball during his playing days, Mr. Hernandez added: "He told me he had a stress fracture in his leg."
Could the stress involved have had anything to do with the torrent of publicity about his engagement to JESSICA SKLAR, who had been Mrs. Eric Nederlander for only three weeks when they met?
No, said Mr. Seinfeld's spokeswoman, ELIZABETH CLARK. "He's had it for a couple of weeks," she said. "He's been wearing a soft cast. What people have been asking is how he did it, but there wasn't one specific accident." Getting around was painful, she said, "and it turned out he had a broken foot."
 
Magazine Chief To TV Moderator
Suddenly, it is not enough for magazine types to have jobs on magazines. They seem to want to break into broadcasting, too.
Consider HAROLD EVANS, who is stepping down as the vice chairman and editorial director of U.S. News and World Report magazine at the end of the year but will remain a contributing editor and consultant. He will be the moderator of the magazine's new public-television panel discussion program, "World At Large." (And by the way, Mr. Evans noted during an interview arranged by U.S. News, "I'd much rather you said I was the author of 'The American Century.' That gives me the kind of authority to range over these profound issues." ("The American Century" was his 710-page book, published last year by Knopf.)
Mr. Evans said that the guests for the first episode would include ROBERT E. RUBIN, the former treasury secretary, who is now one of Citigroup's leaders; EUGENE MCCARTHY, whose dovish presidential campaign in 1968 helped end Lyndon B. Johnson's hopes of a second full term, and the author JOHN EDGAR WIDEMAN.
"World at Large" will be videotaped not in a television studio but at the Four Seasons restaurant, where Mr. Evans said the pool -- the bubbly centerpiece of Philip Johnson's smooth-surface design -- will be turned off and covered over for the day. "We're not in our bathing suits," he said. "It's a U.S. News special. U.S. News is heavily concentrated on politics and economic news. We don't go for show business."
Nor should "World at Large" be confused with the breakfast-time discussions that Mr. Evans moderated at Barneys when he was president and publisher of Random House.
"The difference, first of all, is that was held in a clothing store," he said. "Second, it was all literary. The last one, I think I did on James Joyce, and Frank McCourt and Malachy McCourt burst into song."
And then there is KURT ANDERSEN, who writes for The New Yorker magazine, was editor in chief of New York magazine and was a co-founder and editor of Spy magazine.
Now he has signed on as the host of a public-radio program, "Hot Ticket." Which is why he has also signed on with a voice coach.
"I'm spending a few hours with a woman who tells me how not to sound so Omahan, a person who trains actors and voice-over people in how to sound persuasive and warm, I guess," he said.
"You think, having been in the interviewee's seat on lots of radio and TV shows, that you know how to do it, but it's a different set of skills." JAMES BARRON with Joe Brescia

Treasuries Fall After Release of Price Report

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell yesterday for the second consecutive day after a report showed that the core rate of producer prices in October rose more than expected. The strong data raised speculation again that the Federal Reserve would increase short-term interest rates to keep inflation from accelerating.
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell 8/32, to 100 16/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.09 percent from 6.07 percent on Tuesday. 
 The government completed its quarterly refunding yesterday, with the sale of $10 billion of 10-year notes. It followed Tuesday's $15 billion sale of five-year notes. The 10-year notes, which were a reopening of an issue sold in August, had good demand and helped to buttress the market, which got off to a shaky start after the report that producer prices outside of food and energy rose three-tenths of a percent in October.
Some market participants are speculating that the Fed will raise short-term interest rates on Tuesday when the Federal Open Market Committee meets, but others are less certain. But most agree that the Fed's bias will have an equally important effect on the market.
While the producer prices report might have surprised the market a little, some economists, like Phil Hill of Briefing.com, a market analysis firm in Burlingame, Calif., still say rates will remain unchanged.
"Even though core prices, which exclude food and energy, came in larger than expected, it was still another benign month for producer prices," Mr. Hill said.
Kathleen M. Camilli, director of economic research at Tucker Anthony Inc., said Treasuries recovered from early losses after the producer prices report on the strength of market participants closing short positions. "It appears," she said, "that some people went into today's 10-year note auction expecting to buy notes at cheaper prices but instead wound up scrambling to cover short positions after the auction went better than expected."
The notes were awarded at a yield of 6.007 percent, with the bid-to-cover ratio a healthy 2.48 to 1 as traders were quick to remind people that the auction had been reduced to $10 billion from $12 billion. The result helped Treasuries close above their daily lows.
Market participants think the Fed's decision could hinge on productivity and retail sales data to be released tomorrow. Worries about the Fed, however, are expected to keep the market vulnerable.
Ms. Camilli said her firm was expecting a quarter-point increase in short-term rates. "The bond market is awaiting further confirming evidence that the economy is returning to a more sustainable rate of inflationary G.D.P. growth around 3 to 3.5 percent," she said.
Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns Securities, said: "Today's report is disappointing. The higher-than-expected core finished goods result, the surge in prices further down the production chain, and the recent recovery in oil prices all fuel the view that inflation pressures will continue to build, a negative for financial markets."
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 10-year notes and sale of 66-day cash-management bills:

Technology Shares Resume Surge as Demand for New Issues Offsets Inflation Report

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Stocks resumed a mostly upward course yesterday as enthusiasm for technology issues overcame some early nervousness about the government's latest figures on inflation.
The Nasdaq composite index, its streak of seven straight records broken on Tuesday, scaled a new peak yesterday, gaining 30.92 points, or nearly 1 percent, to 3,155.96. 
 A surprisingly strong profit report from Cisco Systems set the tone, analysts said, helping to lift three initial offerings of Internet companies to huge gains. United Parcel Service, the biggest initial offering ever, also moved to a handsome premium. Cisco rose 5 1/4, to 79 7/16.
"Momentum still rules," said Byron R. Wien, chief United States strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "The technology stocks are dominant, but a lot of other things are not participating."
More stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was almost exactly balanced between winners and losers. The index advanced 8.18 points, or six-tenths of a percent, to 1,373.46.
Among the 30 components of the Dow Jones industrial average, which rebounded from an 81-point decline to finish with a loss of 19.58 points, or two-tenths of a percent, at 10,597.74, 18 stocks fell while 11 rose and one was unchanged.
The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks climbed for the 11th consecutive session, gaining 2.44 points, or 0.55 percent, to 448.72.
The Labor Department's report that core producer prices rose three-tenths of a percent in October, more than expected, weighed on stocks and contributed to a modest upturn in long-term interest rates, analysts said.
The report's impact, however, was diminished because much of the increase was in motor vehicles, an area of statistical difficulty because of varying introduction dates of new models.
"It doesn't really change the basic balance of the evidence" for the Federal Reserve when its policy committee meets on Tuesday, said Richard B. Hoey, chief economist at the Dreyfus Corporation. Whether the central bank decides to raise short-term interest rates to slow the economy remains, he said, "a very close call."
Another analyst, Calvin Schnure of Chase Securities and until recently a Fed staff economist, called the inflation data "not friendly" but not a big negative, either.
Still, investors swarmed to the day's new issues, bidding up shares of Expedia, the online travel agent owned by Microsoft, to 53 1/2 from 14 after trading as high as 65 7/8. Next Level Communications, a maker of software for telephone companies that is majority-owned by General Instrument, soared to 51 from 20 after trading as high as 66. And iBasis, which operates a network for international phone calls, surged to 40 1/4 from 16. All three companies are currently losing money.
In the biggest initial offering on record, United Parcel jumped to 68 1/8 from 50, with 80.8 million shares changing hands, nearly twice as many as the day's second-most-active issue, Charter Communications, up 2 1/4, at 25.
Drug stocks, paced by 2-point gains for Warner-Lambert and American Home Products, were one of the strongest nontechnology sectors.
On the New York Stock Exchange, 1,644 issues fell while 1,420 rose and 118 hit new 52-week lows compared with 71 new highs. Volume swelled to 984.8 million shares.

HEADLINE: China and U.S. Resume Talks On Trade in a Hopeful Spirit

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 10

 BODY:
With both sides expressing cautious hope, senior American and Chinese trade officials met today in renewed negotiations over China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
After a year of on-and-off negotiations, including a near-miss in April, there is a wide sense that this week's talks may answer the key question: is China ready to make the major market-opening concessions demanded by the United States and Europe? 
 The United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, along with the presidential economic adviser Gene Sperling and other officials, arrived last night for what is supposed to be two days of talks. Mr. Sperling said this morning that President Clinton had sent him along "to make clear his belief that we have a historical opportunity."
The Chinese were represented by Shi Guangsheng, the foreign trade minister, and officials from the central bank and affected ministries. Opening the session this morning, Mr. Shi said China was "positive and earnest."
Other countries are closely watching the Beijing talks, and not only because of the potentially huge economic effects if China is admitted to the organization that sets international trade rules and works for less fettered commerce.
China's willingness open up cherished industries to global competition will also signal its commitment to far-reaching domestic economic and social changes, economists say, and may also reveal the power of reformers in the government, especially Prime Minister Zhu Rongji.
Mr. Zhu was embarrassed in Washington in April when President Clinton rejected as inadequate what the Chinese felt were major concessions.
Since then, Chinese industries that would be threatened by a rapid market opening, like telecommunications and automobile production, have fought to preserve more protections. The leadership has become increasingly worried about a threat to social stability if unemployment worsens in the short term because of reductions in tariffs and investment barriers.
President Jiang Zemin badly wants the increased foreign investment that would follow membership in the trade organization. But he must also placate conservatives and threatened industries and workers, and it is unclear if the leadership has the political will to proceed with painful concessions right now.
The United States, for its part, will have to relax controls on textile imports from China for an agreement to be possible.
Mr. Clinton is said to regret his failure to reach agreement in April. He now sees securing China's admission to the World Trade Organization as an important foreign policy goal, but he cannot relent on the commercial terms, because he needs the support of business interests and Congress.
In the last year, American officials repeatedly said it was vital for China to join the trade group before Nov. 30, when a new round of global talks to revise trading rules will begin in Seattle.
Trade experts said that even if China and the United States reached substantial agreement this week, it appeared unlikely that China could cross all hurdles, including agreement with the European Union and other countries, in time for the start of the Seattle talks. But if it becomes apparent that China will succeed, the experts said, it will be easier to take its concerns into account in the global round.

HEADLINE: More Colombia Aid Urged

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that he will ask Congress early next year to increase economic and anti-narcotics aid to Colombia, but officials said he would not seek money to fight leftist guerrillas.
"More funding is needed if we are to gain the upper hand in the fight against drugs and help Colombia on the path to stable democracy," Mr. Clinton said in a written statement on Colombia, which supplies an estimated 80 percent of the world's cocaine. 
 Separately, the Pentagon said Colombia wanted to buy outright 14 United States Black Hawk military helicopters for $221 million, but officials said no final decision had been made on whether to approve the sale.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
A EuropeanTrade Compromise Is Rejected

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
The European Union proposed a compromise today aimed at altering the trade bloc's banana import policy to end a long-running trade dispute with the United States and Latin American producers, but the proposal was quickly rejected.
"There are certain elements in this proposal that would cause problems," a United States trade official said. "It's difficult to see how this is going to resolve the dispute." 
 Francisco de Soto, vice minister of trade for Panama, a leading banana producer, also rejected the basis of the European Union proposal, saying in a telephone interview that "none of the ideas that the Latin American producers presented have been taken into consideration."
The European Union's proposed compromise was intended to bring its banana-import policy into line with World Trade Organization rules and lead to the lifting of almost $200 million in sanctions imposed by the United States this year.
A W.T.O. dispute panel has said that the European Union's policy is illegal because it favors banana producers in former European colonies. Growers in Latin America and big American multinational growers like Dole Food and Chiquita Brands have said the policy denies them fair access to Europe's market.
The proposed compromise called for the European Union to phase out the preferential system by Jan. 1, 2006, after a transition involving a complex tariff rate quota system.
But the United States said that the proposals were not acceptable and that the sanctions would continue to be applied. "It's very likely to end up being W.T.O.-inconsistent," the United States trade official said. "The main point that we've made is it's likely to end up being discriminatory in its application."
The banana dispute is one of several marring American-European trade relations in the weeks before W.T.O. members gather in Seattle on Nov. 30 for a new round of global trade talks.

HEADLINE: Microsoft Shareholders, Mostly, SupportTheir Chairman

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: BELLEVUE, Wash., Nov. 10

 BODY:
He got a prolonged standing ovation on the way to the podium, and he was mobbed by autograph seekers on the way out.
But in between, William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, fielded some questions from his shareholders at the company's annual meeting today that he might not have faced a week ago, questions about whether his legal team had failed him and whether the company might even be broken up in the wake of its antitrust fight with the federal government. 
 In the main, the 44-year-old co-founder of the company was speaking to a friendly audience, composed of about 2,500 shareholders, and he reiterated his stance that Microsoft's "innovations and behavior were completely fair and brought tremendous benefits to millions of consumers." The meeting came five days after a federal judge issued a harsh denunciation of the company in the antitrust case, saying it had abused its monopoly power to bully and thwart the competition.
But during questions and answers with the shareholders, Mr. Gates did hear from one man who urged the company to "try your damnedest to see that this here suit is settled out of court." And another man spoke of "the feelings of disappointment at best that I have and humiliation at worst that I have at how the case against Microsoft was handled by our counsel."
With the company's general counsel and chief legal strategist, William H. Neukom, seated on the dais with Mr. Gates, the shareholder asked whether Mr. Gates might hire a new legal team so that "we are not outrun and outmaneuvered by the government," putting such a sarcastic emphasis on the word "government" that several in the audience laughed or applauded.
But Mr. Gates went into a defense of the company's legal approach and, by implication, of Mr. Neukom, who sat silently through the exchange.
"It's pretty important in a case like this not to look in a very superficial way for someone to blame," said Mr. Gates. "When the government decides they're going to block innovation, your own government decides they're going to take you to court and say you should not make those kinds of advances, it's not going to be a pleasant experience. It's not going to be something that anyone should have to go through."
And, he said: "The way we've put forth the story through our internal and external counsel about why our work is good for the economy, good for consumers, I'm quite proud of what's been done there. I'm really quite supportive of what's been done there. We're going to continue to tell that story." His remarks drew applause from the audience, and many shareholders said afterwards that they were fully behind Mr. Gates and his defense of the company.
"Of course they should fight this," said Don Benusa, a retired papermaker from Everett, Wash., who described himself as a "small shareholder" of the company. "Just because the company's a huge success, the government comes after them. I don't like government poking its nose into business."
Other Microsoft stockholders said they remained high on Mr. Gates, but agreed with the man who criticized the company's legal strategy.
"I'm appalled at the whole way the case has been mishandled," said Leonard Samuels, who owns a small printing business in Woodland Hills, Calif., and said he owned 4,200 shares of Microsoft stock. "They've made a mess of it. It should never have gotten to this point."
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's findings, while not a final verdict, have already had a financial impact. Shares in Microsoft, the world's most highly valued company, fell for the third day today, to $87.0625, down $1.75 for the day and almost 5 percent below Friday's close. Still, even with the case pending, the company has continued to enrich its investors, with its stock rising more than 60 percent in the last year.
At today's meeting Mr. Gates and other company officials for the most part maintained a calm and often smiling demeanor, even when a loud fire alarm went off for a few moments in the convention hall. (A security official quickly cut in over the loudspeakers to announce that it was a false alarm.) But the company chairman did show a small flash of pique when he offered an acerbic characterization of the government's case against his company.
"Under this lawsuit," he said, "a software developer would end up having to focus on questions like: Is there anyone else doing something similar? If so, we can't improve this product in that way.
"Is our innovation going to force competitors to work harder?" he continued. "If so, we can't improve the product in that way. Someone might file a lawsuit! Are we providing any features at too low of a price? Are they too good? Then someone might complain. The net effect would be a chilling impact on innovation."
Again, his pledge not to compromise with the government on the company's "freedom to innovate" was met with widespread cheers from the audience at the Meydenbauer Center in Bellevue, just a few miles from the company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash.
Specifically, Mr. Gates and other company officials pledged not to agree to any settlement that would force the giant software maker to "unbundle" its Internet browser from its Windows operating system, which currently powers the vast majority of computers across the world.
"We're willing to go a long way to address the government's concerns," Mr. Gates said. "But if we can't get Internet support, we can't add any new features. No company should accept these kinds of limitations on their ability to innovate."
And, he said: "One of the most defensible things we've ever done is to support the Internet in our operating system. We cannot back off on that."
A question from another shareholder about whether the company was making any contingency plans for a breakup, along the lines of what was done in 1984 to the AT&T Corporation, was parried by Microsoft's chief operating officer, Bob Herbold. He said company officials firmly believed there was no justification for such an extreme step.

Nigerian Fraud Syndicates Set Up Shop in South Africa

BYLINE: By HENRI E. CAUVIN 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Nov. 9

 BODY:
The unsolved killing of one foreign businessman here and the mysterious disappearance of another has local and international law enforcement agents warning overseas executives and entrepreneurs to be wary of West African criminal syndicates that in recent years have made this, the continent's financial capital, their second home.
"Don't Be Fooled! Many Have Lost Money!" read a recent advertisement run by the Nigerian government in The International Herald Tribune. The ad describes one of the most common variations of a "4-1-9" fraud, so called for its statute number in the penal code of Nigeria, the birthplace of the scam. 
 Purporting to be Nigerian civil servants conspiring to inflate a government contract and pocket the difference, the schemers send letters to thousands of foreign businesspeople, seeking access to a clean, overseas bank account where embezzled money can be transferred.
Prospective accomplices are promised a cut of the multimillion-dollar sum. Once lured to Africa, they are often shown the supposed money, most or all of it actually fake.
Entangled in the ruse, the accomplices are duped into handing over money, usually when the scheme is said to encounter unforeseen problems that can be resolved only with five- or six-figure fees. Desperate to exploit what they perceive as a fleeting opportunity, the victims usually pay. By the time they realize the deception, they are out many thousands of dollars. In one case to come to light this year, a syndicate bilked a Japanese businessman of $7 million, according to South African police.
Simple as the scheme is, it results in tens of millions of dollars in losses each year, according to the United States Secret Service, which opened an office in South Africa several weeks ago to coordinate the agency's fight against commercial fraud in Africa.
"It continues to be a problem here in the United States and around the world," John Tomlinson, a spokesman for the Secret Service, said in a phone interview from Washington.
Indeed, even after a decade or so, the ruse continues to be a reliable moneymaker for the maturing network of organized crime that emanates from Nigeria.
The rise of Nigerian syndicates dates to the late 1970's and early 1980's when the West African country was hit hard by the global collapse in oil prices. Thousands of enterprising and well-educated Nigerian oil industry employees were left to look for jobs. Some took their acquired skills in trade and communications into organized crime, said Peter Gastrow, a researcher at the Institute for Security Studies in South Africa.
In the last two decades, the criminal networks have grown in number and sophistication. From their beginnings in credit card scams, they have widened their repertory of frauds.
It is no surprise, then, that the F.B.I. and the Secret Service have been in Lagos, Nigeria's biggest city, for years. The Secret Service has a crime-monitoring initiative known as Operation 4-1-9. With the West Africans' move into South Africa, it became clear to the Secret Service that it should be here, too, alongside the F.B.I., which already has an office in Pretoria.
"We recognized there was a need for a presence here," said Mitch Price, the special agent who heads the new office. "The bad guys know this is the economic hub of the region, and they have come here to operate."
Fighting this sort of fraud is made more difficult by the fact that victims are often too embarrassed or too scared to approach authorities; when they do come forward, what little information they have about their contacts is usually bogus.
Jean Pierre Tin Nok Il Shing Tat, a 42-year-old businessman from Mauritius, never had the chance to come forward. On June 4, he was kidnapped from an area hotel. Twelve days later, his body was found near an old mine along a highway in Heidelberg, southeast of here. He had been shot in the head.
Investigators are certain he was caught in a 4-1-9 scam. They now believe Kjetil Moe, an industrialist from Norway who was ensnared in a similar scam, is dead, too, Lawrence van der Westhuizen, a South African police superintendent, said.
Mr. Moe, a 65-year-old mechanical engineer, arrived here Sept. 24 and disappeared three days later, after contacting Nigerians who instructed him to hand over $5,000 to what turned out to be a fictitious company, said Mr. van der Westhuizen, who leads the Johannesburg commercial crimes unit.
Even before Mr. Moe disappeared, the unit had amassed considerable evidence of the criminal network's expanding influence in South Africa. At least three other foreign businessmen involved in the syndicate scams have been kidnapped this year. Unlike Mr. Tat, and apparently Mr. Moe, each escaped or was rescued.
"A year ago, this wasn't a big problem here," Mr. van der Westhuizen said. "Now it's an enormous problem."
Since the end of apartheid eased restrictions on immigration to South Africa, criminal operatives from Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, have migrated to Johannesburg, and the impact has begun to be felt, law enforcement agents here say.
With increasing frequency, the letters about 4-1-9 bear Johannesburg postmarks when they arrive in Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, the United States and other nations.
Home to Africa's biggest stock exchange, its biggest banks and many of its biggest companies, Johannesburg offers confidence men what Lagos cannot: a cloak of respectability and credibility. A businessman scared off by a letter from Nigeria and fearful of traveling there might not be as wary of a solicitation sent from South Africa.
But authorities here worry that South Africa's image will not remain untainted for long.
"If you receive a letter or a contract from South Africa, you will think twice about it," Mr. van der Westhuizen said. "Is this a real deal or is it a bogus one? People will be asking, 'Why should we go to South Africa? It's not safe to do business there.' "

HEADLINE: Judge Halts Drug Tests of Welfare Applicants

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 10

 BODY:
A federal judge today temporarily halted Michigan's unusual program to test welfare applicants for drug use.
Under a pilot program that started last month, Michigan had been requiring welfare applicants at three sites, including one in Detroit, to pass a drug test or be denied benefits. Michigan is the first state with such a program. 
 The American Civil Liberties Union sued the state to stop the drug tests, arguing that they violated the privacy of welfare applicants and the constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure.
Today, Judge Victoria A. Roberts of Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Northern Division, granted a temporary restraining order that stops the tests until at least Dec. 14, when another hearing has been scheduled. The judge said she granted the order because the drug tests were probably unconstitutional.
Kary L. Moss, executive director of the Michigan office of the A.C.L.U., said the ruling means "that for the time being, welfare applicants will not be forced to choose between their constitutional rights and providing for their families."
The state said it would comply with the court order but believes it will ultimately prevail.
"We look forward to returning to this program, which was allowed by federal legislation, enacted by the Michigan Legislature and supported by our customers and the general public," Douglas E. Howard, director of Michigan's welfare agency, the Family Independence Agency, said. "The drug testing pilot is an opportunity to help individuals find employment and to strengthen families. We believe it is the right thing to do."
Karen Smith, a spokeswoman for the agency, said 8.1 percent of the applicants tested positive for drug use. No one refused the test, Ms. Smith said. Of the 258 tests analyzed, 237 tested negative while 21 tested positive. Of the positive results, three were for cocaine, and the rest were for marijuana.
While the state had results for only 258 tests, a total of 379 applicants had been tested at the three sites. Tests were required in Alpena and Presque Isle Counties in northeastern Michigan, in Berrien County in southwestern Michigan and in one urban area, a part of western Detroit.
Michigan has been one of the early leaders in the effort to end traditional welfare, initiating programs intended to put recipients into the work force. The state's caseload has dropped about 60 percent since October 1992, when changes in welfare rules and the booming economy lowered the unemployment rate.
Michigan's caseload stands at slightly more 80,000, down from about 240,000 in the mid-1990's, said John Truscott, a spokesman for Gov. John Engler, a Republican who has championed the welfare changes.
"We know that drug abuse is a barrier to employment," Mr. Truscott said. "Our whole approach to welfare is helping people find a job and keep a job."
Those who tested positive under the pilot program were required to get drug treatment in order to receive a welfare check. Anyone who refused treatment would have been denied benefits. In the first month, none of those who tested positive refused treatment, Mr. Truscott said.
Other states have considered requiring drug tests but have backed away. Both Florida and Louisiana require applicants to answer questions about drug use and then use the answers to determine whether to administer a test. New York and Maryland had planned to require tests but found that other types of screening, like questionnaires, were cheaper. New Jersey, South Carolina, Wisconsin and Minnesota randomly test welfare recipients with felony drug convictions.

Drama At 301 Congress

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
Every dramatist knows that before the plot can thicken, a mix of characters must be stirred in. In the roman a clef to be written about the Bush campaign, if it wins, here are the real people on whom to base the cast:
The cunning strategist: Karl Rove, professional pol, strives to be grandmaster of the political chessboard, honing themes, anticipating opponents' thrusts. 
 Will Steve Forbes ever launch a TV campaign to brand the Texas governor a heavy taxer? If he does, Rove's counter would measure increases in Texas against Ronald Reagan's record in California. No Bush litmus test on abortion for Supreme Court nominees? The answer that turneth away pro-life wrath: Such a prejudgment would have to be reported to the Senate at confirmation, and the nominee would then have to recuse himself when the issue comes before the court.
Campaign durability is the strategist's mantra; rather than "a thousand points of light," he thinks of a $5 million TV buy as "a thousand points of penetration" in California, ensuring that a viewer sees a Bush ad 10 times in the critical state.
The tough, take-charge campaign manager next bestrides the stage of "301 Congress Avenue," the address of the headquarters and likely title of the insiders' drama.
He is big, burly, bombastic Joe Allbaugh, with a Haldeman crew cut and an overpowering presence. The former Oklahoma farmer ran Bush's victory over Ann Richards in 1994 and enforces the candidate's will with Frank Nitti-like discipline.
In command of the Bush calendar, he gives the candidate weekends off; in December, Allbaugh schedules one joint TV appearance a week and has Bush at home nearly half the days before Christmas. Not overly taxing. If the nomination is decided by April, he'll send Bush overseas before the convention to gain gravitas.
The resident intellectual is the youthful but graying policy adviser and outside-advice conduit Joshua Bolten. He's the slot man, turning to a capable triumvirate of Stephen Goldsmith, Condoleezza Rice and Larry Lindsey for domestic, foreign and economic positions. (Espousing competition in education may augur resistance to monopoly in the marketplace.)
He doesn't run a "murder board" -- the panel of tough questioners that usually prepares candidates for debates and penetrating interviews. That's because Bush is not receptive to the scripting of quips, ripostes and zingers. This could be a mistake in a head-to-head with John McCain, gaining every day; an unrehearsed Bush failed to dominate a weak opponent in an El Paso debate last year.
The strong woman alter ego, now an indispensable public role, is played by Karen Hughes, his longtime spokeswoman. This dedicated, savvy media aide knows how he thinks and what he should say but also what he's likely to say, and is on a hair trigger to counter charges of lightweightedness. She brooks no interference with her access; nobody on the inside crosses her.
The idealistic speechwriter, an appealing stock character in political novels, is played by Michael Gerson, laboring behind a closed door and a pile of books and papers at 301 Congress. A theology student at Wheaton College, he wrote for Chuck Colson in the Prison Fellowship, was one of Bob Dole's junior writers in 1996, and had turned to journalism at U.S. News before his recruitment by Bush.
Gerson has adopted his principal's style, remembered from a Yale rhetoric course: three points and a peroration, elevated rather than homey, with declarative sentences, no oratorical run-ups, with topical organizers like "prosperity with a purpose," "responsibility society" and "empowering faith-based institutions."
He knows his boss is reading Pat Tyler's "The Great Wall" for China policy, just as the strategic guru Rove is rereading William Roepke's "The Humane Economy." But Gerson no longer has time to read; he must turn out a draft of a foreign policy address to be given next week at the Reagan Library. He's looking for Reagan quotes to advocate advancing freedom but husbanding military power -- without appearing to straddle.
In all, the cast at 301 Congress reflects well on Bush's organizing ability, but it has not yet taken a body blow. Lest overconfidence show, gruffs Allbaugh, the manager, "There'll be no measuring for White House drapes." But that's what the entire Bush cast must be secretly doing. Even pols are human.

HEADLINE: Clinton Plans a Kosovo Visit, And the Serbs Are Surprised

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
President Clinton may add a brief stop in Kosovo to his trip this month through southern Europe to highlight the importance of the peacekeeping mission there and to address tensions between Serbs and Albanians, administration officials said today.
The stopover would also be a new slap at President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, since under the agreement that brought an end to the NATO bombing, Kosovo is administered by the United Nations but formally remains part of Serbia. 
 An official at the Yugoslav mission to the United Nations in New York said she had heard nothing about the president's plans but expected official notification from Washington. "Kosovo is not an independent state that anybody can just jump in," the official said, declining to give her name.
But that appeared to be what the president intended to do. "He's going into a U.N.-controlled and patrolled area," a State Department official said. "The authority in Kosovo is in the U.N."
Aides involved in planning the trip say the president will very likely visit the United States military base in south-central Kosovo known as Camp Bondsteel, a 775-acre site surrounded by barbed wire, concrete barriers and guard towers.
The aides said that security concerns remain about visiting the province, which just months ago was being pelted by NATO bombs and where incidents of ethnic violence continue. White House aides said it was premature to announce the trip officially.
Officials said the visit would include a face-to-face meeting between Serbs and Albanians during which Mr. Clinton would urge them to put violence and hatred aside.
The president will likely call for more financial support from foreign governments for reconstruction in Kosovo, officials said. "I think it's an important trip to show the American commitment to the progress in Kosovo," an administration official said.
A State Department official said the government of Mr. Milosevic is expected to object to the trip.
But international law experts said the agreement that ended the war left some ambiguity about Kosovo's status.
"It's true that there is still Serbian sovereignty over Kosovo," said Allan Gerson, a former counsel to the United States mission to the United Nations and now a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. "In a formal way, that's true. But it's in contradiction with other provisions that call for an economically and politically self-sufficient entity."
The schedule of Mr. Clinton's coming trip has already been juggled because of safety fears. The White House announced today that Mr. Clinton would delay and shorten his state visit to Greece, which was to begin on Monday, because of the prospect of violent anti-American protests there.

HEADLINE: Deal Is Struck On Restoring Medicare Aid

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Congressional negotiators and Clinton administration officials announced tonight that they had reached a tentative agreement on legislation to restore some of the money cut from Medicare in 1997.
The cuts provoked howls of protest from the health care industry, which sent dozens of lobbyists to Capitol Hill to campaign for more money. 
 Representative Bill Thomas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, and Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White House, said the deal would increase Medicare payments to most hospitals, nursing homes, health maintenance organizations and home health care agencies.
Mr. Thomas, Republican of California, said the agreement would increase Medicare spending by $12 billion over the next five years. That represents 7 percent to 10 percent of the amount cut by the 1997 law.
The agreement would gradually reduce huge disparities in what Medicare pays to train doctors in different parts of the country. As a result, many teaching hospitals in New York City would lose money, though the losses would be smaller than under earlier proposals.
Emerging from negotiations tonight, Mr. Thomas said: "We and the administration were partners in the Balanced Budget Act two years ago. Now we are partners in knocking the rough edges off that law."
Mr. Jennings said: "This is an honorable compromise. It lays a foundation for more significant Medicare reforms next year."
Even as lawmakers reached agreement on Medicare, they found themselves stymied on another health care measure. A bill to provide health insurance to hundreds of thousands of disabled people, passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in the House and the Senate, became snarled today in a tangle of partisan disagreements, raising doubts about whether it would become law before Congress adjourns for the year.
Different versions of this bill sailed through the Senate, 99 to 0, and the House, 412 to 9, earlier this year. But negotiations bogged down on the question of how to pay the comparatively modest cost, less than $1 billion over five years.
Democrats complained today that Republicans would offset the cost of aid for the disabled by cutting housing and other programs for people with low and moderate incomes.
People with disabilities have strongly supported the bill, which would allow them to keep Medicaid and Medicare coverage after they return to work. Under current law, they often lose such coverage if they earn a significant amount of money.
Advocates for the disabled and Democratic senators, including Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, said they might oppose the bill if Republicans financed it by cutting other social programs. "We cannot support any legislation that would advance the lives of people with disabilities on the backs of poor and middle-class Americans," said Pat Wright, a lawyer at the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund.
Republicans said that President Clinton was free to suggest other ways of covering the cost, but that he had not done so.
In talks on Medicare, two powerful New Yorkers -- Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, and Representative Charles B. Rangel, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee -- tried to protect the Medicare payments that New York hospitals receive for training doctors. Hospitals like Beth Israel in Manhattan and Montefiore in the Bronx get three or four times as much for each trainee as hospitals in Los Angeles and Cleveland.
But ultimately Mr. Thomas prevailed in his insistence that such disparities must be reduced. Under the agreement reached tonight, Medicare will move toward a standard national payment to teaching hospitals for each doctor in training.
Medicare now pays a different amount for each hospital, based on its historic costs. Under tonight's agreement, the highest-paid hospitals -- those with payments more than 40 percent above the national average for each hospital resident -- will not get any allowance for inflation in 2001 or 2002. And in the next three years, their payments will rise two percentage points less than the Consumer Price Index, while other teaching hospitals get a full allowance for inflation.
Mr. Thomas praised Mr. Moynihan and Mr. Rangel, saying the two men had persuaded New York hospitals that they needed to be "part of the solution" this year. "In the past," Mr. Thomas said, "there had been a degree of stonewalling," as New Yorkers resisted any cuts in Medicare payments to teaching hospitals.
The issue is colored by the politics surrounding Hillary Rodham Clinton's expected run for the Senate next year. Republicans said they did not want to be too generous to New York hospitals because they feared that she might get political credit for securing such largess.
Mr. Thomas said that the likely Republican candidate for senator, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City, had "zeroed in on this issue to make sure New York hospitals would be protected."
Much as she might like to fight for New York hospitals, Mrs. Clinton could not openly do so on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers of both parties said she would have alienated Republicans if she had tried to intervene.
In an interview, Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York, said he believed Republicans wanted to "embarrass Mrs. Clinton by getting the White House to go along with legislation that would be devastating" to New York hospitals.

HEADLINE: New State Park of 153 Acres Is Created on L.I.

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: KINGS PARK, N.Y., Nov. 10

 BODY:
In a major victory for environmentalists, Gov. George E. Pataki announced today that more than 80 percent of a former psychiatric center near Long Island Sound would be preserved as a wooded nature sanctuary and a new state park.
The Empire State Development Corporation, the state's economic development arm, had been preparing to seek bids on nearly all 567 acres of the Kings Park Psychiatric Center, the largest piece of undeveloped property on the North Shore of Long Island. The sale, however, was opposed by environmentalists and local officials. 
 Their efforts bore fruit today when Mr. Pataki unveiled a large sign here declaring that nearly 153 acres, including 4 miles of waterfront, had become the latest addition to the state park system and would be called Nissequogue River State Park.
Old stands of oak and other mature woodland that surround most of the remaining acreage are to be preserved under a plan in which only 95 acres will be available for private housing development. Altogether, Governor Pataki said, the plan will protect 472 acres of what was once the largest psychiatric care center in the country.
"By protecting this valuable property, we are providing New Yorkers with more open space for their enjoyment and ensuring that the most important and environmentally sensitive lands will be preserved for generations to come," Mr. Pataki said.
The new park, which is expected to open to the public next spring, will include the waterfront where the Nissequogue River enters Long Island Sound. The park will have two marinas, wildlife habitats, tidal pools and estuaries for migratory birds, and a green strip connected to existing trails. Mr. Pataki noted that the park would also include "a very important freshwater wetland that contains an egret rookery."
The new park will be across the water from both Sunken Meadow State Park and a Smithtown park on Smithtown Bay.
The development corporation will be responsible for selling the property under rules requiring three open acres for every acre that is built on. The governor said the rules would also guarantee the preservation of mature-growth forests and the conservation of an existing green strip along the eastern edge.
Mr. Pataki said questions raised in an article in Wednesday's New York Times about the fairness of bidding for development rights at another former center for the mentally ill on Long Island, Pilgrim State Psychiatric Center in Brentwood, would have no effect on the Kings Park project. Mr. Pataki said the state had hired a law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, to review the Pilgrim State bidding process, which some of the losing bidders said was skewed by insider information and political favoritism.
Environmentalists who attended today's announcement were jubilant about the new park and the promises that private development of the remaining property would be limited.
"This is sensational," said Richard L. Amper Jr., executive director of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society, which fought for the creation of the 100,000-acre pine barrens preserve in eastern Suffolk County in 1993. "Only a few months ago there was a threat that most of this was going to get paved over. Now most of it's going to be preserved."

HEADLINE: Treason Charge For Pakistan's Ousted Premier

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Thursday, Nov. 11

 BODY:
Almost a month after he was ousted from power in a swift bloodless coup, Pakistan's deposed prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, has been accused of hijacking and kidnapping for what military officials say was his treasonous refusal to allow a plane carrying the army chief to land at an airport in the port city of Karachi.
If convicted, Mr. Sharif and other officials accuse in the case could face the death penalty. 
 The charges against Mr. Sharif, which became known this morning, are at the heart of the armed forces' justification for the Oct. 12 coup and revolve around the still murky events that precipitated the military takeover. The charges were leveled by the military in a formal complaint to the police, who will now undertake an investigation.
In the weeks since the coup, the army chief, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, and other military officials, have maintained that Mr. Sharif endangered the life of the general and about 200 passengers on his commercial flight by refusing the jet aircraft permission to land.
That afternoon, the prime minister had announced through the state news agency that he had fired the army chief while General Musharraf was in the air returning from an official visit to Sri Lanka.
But Mr. Sharif's action immediately set off an apparently well-oiled coup. As the general's commercial flight approached the Karachi airport, military officials say that his commercial Pakistan International Airlines flight was denied permission to land. They have said the Pakistan International Airlines plane had only seven minutes of fuel left by the time the military seized control of the airport and allowed it to land.
Mr. Sharif has been under house arrest since the coup and has not been allowed to speak to reporters or visiting international dignitaries. The military has yet to offer its proof of the prime minister's personal involvement in the air traffic control decisions about the plane's landing.
The United States on Wednesday appealed to the new military rulers of Pakistan to guarantee Mr. Sharif's legal rights. "We have continued to raise our concerns with Pakistani authorities about former Prime Minister Sharif's well-being and our concern he be accorded due process," said a State Department spokesman, James B. Foley.
American officials have also called for a return to democracy in Pakistan, but General Musharraf has adamantly refused to give any timetable for new elections. And the general said in a recent news conference that Mr. Sharif would have his chance to defend himself when he went on trial, suggesting that he may not be allowed to speak beforehand.
In a major televised address to the nation on Oct. 17, General Musharraf, who declared himself Pakistan's chief executive, described himself as having taken over in highly unusual circumstances "not of my making" and thanked the armed forces for intervening to ensure the flight's safe arrival.
"Who would believe that the chief of the army staff, having represented Pakistan in Sri Lanka, upon his return was denied landing in his own country and instead circumstances were created which would have forced our plane either to land in India or crash?" he said.
Other officials were accused of conspiring with Mr. Sharif. They include G. Ali Shah, a former government adviser, Shahid Abbasi, former director of Pakistan's national airline; Rana Maqbool, former police official in Sind, and A. Chaudhry, former director general of the Civil Aviation Authority.
Just hours after the midair drama, Gen. Musharraf declared a state of emergency, suspended the constitution and the Parliament and assumed sweeping authority to run the country.
While there are no reliable polls to gauge public sentiment, there has been no outpouring of public support for the ousted prime minister, who had been tarnished by accusations of corruption and autocratic rule.
Gen. Musharraf has promised that he will go after all the high-level officials and business people who have stolen public money -- and has said the real crackdown will begin next week. And he has set an extraordinarily ambitious domestic agenda for himself, saying he will revive the country's ailing economy, restore harmony among the rivalrous provinces and clean up the pervasive corruption and incompetence in the bureaucracy.
Until he achieves his goals, he has said, he will not be ready to return the country to call new elections.
In Washington, the Clinton administration appealed to Pakistan's military leaders to observe Mr. Sharif's legal rights.
Mr. Sharif was a protege of the late Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq. The prime minister the general deposed, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was charged with a political murder and hanged in 1979.

HEADLINE: Picking the Right Data Superhighway

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
THE key to happiness in the Internet age is bandwidth. Bandwidth, bandwidth, bandwidth. Fat pipes, capable of sucking down Web pages, music files, video clips, e-mail and other forms of digital information and entertainment from the Internet in the blink of an eye. A data spigot that is always open, without busy signals and without the kinds of delays and service interruptions that drive most computer users mad.
Bandwidth -- a measure of the flow of information, in bits, that moves over a given distance in a period of time -- is the most important factor in the development of new types of services on the Internet, more so than increases in personal computer processing power or new types of Internet communications devices. 
 Until recently, high-bandwidth connections to the Internet were available mainly to businesses and certain lucky people willing and able to pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars a month for so-called broadband Internet access. But with the development of cable modems, digital subscriber line (D.S.L.) modems and satellite data services, several million Americans now have access to high-speed, broadband data services.
You can tell who they are by the smug looks on their faces. I know, because I see the face of a bandwidth glutton in the mirror each morning. I am rich in bandwidth, wallowing in a broadband trough.
In recent months I have had the luxury of using not just one broadband connection in my home office but three: a cable modem, a D.S.L. modem and a satellite modem. I've been testing them to see which one to keep, a decision that sooner or later a lot of Net surfers are going to make.
Now, only a small percentage of Americans live in the right geographic or service area to get any one of these services, and even fewer -- perhaps 1 percent, according to market reseachers -- have a choice of two. But by the grace of whatever digital deities watch over the Internet, my house in Austin is in a rare sweet spot, where cable, D.S.L. and satellite coverage overlap. I also had I.S.D.N. (integrated services digital network, which essentially combines the capacity of two phones lines), but I had it ripped from my house when its cost and complexity far outstripped the modest speed improvements it offered over regular dial-up phone service.
My files are downloaded in a snap. Web pages pop onto my screen. I do not think twice about downloading video clips or MP3 music files. Multiplayer network games and home videoconferences suddenly become practical. But the thing that changes everything is the fact that the Internet is always on, whenever I want it.
My biggest nightmare is that I will wake up someday and have to connect to the Internet using -- the horror, the horror -- an old-fashioned 56K modem on a dial-up telephone line.
Here is an example: Earlier this year, the movie trailer for "Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace" was made available for downloading from the Internet, but it was a 25-megabyte file. The fastest conventional modems available today, at 56K, can download nearly 56,000 bits per second. There are 8 bits in a byte, and, because of way binary numbers are counted, 1,048,576 bytes, or 8,388,608 bits, in a megabyte and roughly 200 million bits in a 25-megabyte file.
In the time it takes to do the calculation of how long it would take a regular modem to download the file, it would already be done via a cable or D.S.L. modem.
Alas, I cannot put all three broadband services on my expense account indefinitely, so I have to choose. Following is a discussion of the three broadband options, and what went into my decision.
 
Cable
The black coaxial cable that carries cable television signals to tens of millions of households can also handle high-bandwidth data connections. Analysts expect cable to become the dominant method for high-speed Internet connections at home, in part because cable already passes by the majority of houses in the country. But older cable systems were designed to be only one-way, sending video to the home, so cable providers have to upgrade their systems to give them the two-way capabilities needed for Internet access.
The top speed of a cable modem, at least in theory, is about 30 million bits per second (30 mbps), but a more realistic expectation is around 1 mbps. It can be a bit faster, but considering that most of us connect a cable modem to a 10-mbps Ethernet card, 30 mbps is a pipe dream. Uploading is somewhat slower, but that is usually not a problem for most home users.
More important is that cable downloading can be even slower, depending on how many of your neighbors are also using the neighborhood cable pipe at the same time. It is a shared service.
If you have the local cable line all to yourself, you can easily top 1 mbps. But if all of your neighbors have cable modems, things can slow down so much that you might actually yearn to have your dial-up modem back. If one of your cable-using neighbors starts running a Web server out of the home, you can imagine neighbors marching with torches and pitchforks. The two leading cable data services, Time Warner's Roadrunner and AT&T Cable's @Home, forbid residential customers to run Web server computers on the network.
Remember, however, that the practical speed of any broadband network, no matter what its theoretical speed, is limited by the slowest link on the network. If you link to a popular site that is congested, or to an obscure site that may be attached to the Internet through the equivalent of a hand-cranked computer, your multimegabit broadband connection will slow down accordingly.
My monthly cable data fee is $44.95 because I also subscribe to the cable company's standard (as opposed to basic) television services. If I were not already a cable television customer, I would have to become one to get the data services, taking my monthly cost to a minimum of about $65 a month. With my extra television channels, I'm now paying Time Warner $85 a month, which includes the rental of the cable modem. Adding e-mail addresses for family members costs $5 a month each. If I want to have a home page on the Web, it is $5 extra per month.
There was a setup and installation charge of $130, but periodic promotional deals cut that price in half. It took several frustrating exchanges with the local company before technicians finally came to my house. Over all, the installation process was about what I had come to expect from my cable company: a logistical nightmare.
Besides the Jekyll and Hyde speed issues that affect cable modems, a big drawback is that cable customers have no choice of Internet service providers. America Online and other popular I.S.P.'s are challenging the cable companies in court to open cable services to competition, but for now, it's either Roadrunner or @Home. Time Warner is my local cable company, and Roadrunner is the only choice I have for cable I.S.P. service.
Another concern is data security. Because it is a shared network, any of your devious neighbors with the technical expertise to run a network sniffer can intercept data packets from your computer. That is highly unlikely, but it is a risk.
Try this: Lie to your neighbors, telling them that hackers came in over your cable modem and wiped out your bank accounts. Mention that you have heard that D.S.L. service is more secure. Then you will have the cable network all to yourself.
 
D.S.L.
D.S.L., which stands for digital subscriber line, enables high-speed Internet connections to houses and small businesses over the same copper telephone lines that handle voice and fax calls. It does not interfere with voice traffic on the line, however, so one person can make or receive calls while another is using the same line to connect to the Internet. A big advantage, therefore, is that D.S.L. does not require the installation of a second phone line or cable service.
Its big drawback is that the service degrades quickly as a function of distance, so customers are limited to a geographic radius of about 3 miles from a telephone company's central office (technically, about 17,500 feet). The phone company first checks to see if your nearest central office offers digital service, then checks to see if you live close enough to it and finally checks the actual line to see if it can handle D.S.L. bandwidth.
If everything checks out, the phone company will send out a crew to install a splitter, which splits voice and data traffic on the line. A splitterless form of the service is also in the works.
There are many kinds of D.S.L. The most common for residential service is the asynchronous kind, A.D.S.L., or A.D.S.L Lite, which offers slightly lower data speeds. On an A.D.S.L. line, information is uploaded to the Internet at one speed, typically 128 kilobits per second, but downloaded at much higher speeds, typically 384 kilobits per second (kbps) to 1.544 megabits per second (mbps).
The downloading speed is most important for most people, so it is fair to say that downloading with D.S.L. is anywhere from 7 to 25 times as fast as with the fastest dial-up analog modems.
Unlike cable modem users, who share a line, each D.S.L. subscriber has a dedicated line to the central office. Therefore, the speed is more constant and predictable.
The top speed of a D.S.L. modem is basically determined by how much money you are willing to spend and how close you live to the central telephone office. I live 200 yards from a central office, and my basic D.S.L. service regularly achieves more than the minimum speed of 384 kbps downstream and often hovers near the 1.5 mbps maximum; it is 128 kbps upstream.
It costs about $70 a month, which includes the telephone company line charge of $39 a month, the fee of the Internet service provider, three e-mail addresses and other services for which the cable company charges extra.
I also paid $212 for a cable modem and a network adapter card. I leased the modem instead of buying one outright because I wanted to make sure it worked with the D.S.L. equipment at the phone company.
My monthly fee is high compared with other D.S.L. offerings around the country. In general, you can expect to pay $30 to $50 a month for basic service.
While D.S.L. cannot compete with cable in terms of speed during the day, when most of my neighbors are at their offices and I have the cable line mostly to myself, it is routinely faster than cable in the evenings, when my neighbors are sharing my cable pipe.
I can increase my guaranteed D.S.L. performance to a minimum of 384 kbps upstream and 1.544 mbps downstream by paying $170 or more a month.
The performance at this level is almost comparable with the speeds of T-1 lines, which many companies use to operate Web-based businesses. T-1 service typically costs $1,000 a month or more. Other forms of D.S.L. service can promise speeds up to 50 mbps, but at monthly prices that would probably exceed your mortgage payment.
As with cable, my D.S.L. connection is always on.
 
Satellite
Satellite data service has so much promise, especially for people in areas not served by D.S.L. or cable. But satellite also has many challenges. The Web is an interactive medium, while satellite is intrinsically a one-way medium (most of us do not routinely communicate with satellites). To send mouse clicks and typed commands to the Internet, you have to have an open telephone line in addition to the satellite connection.
Satellite service requires the installation of a receiver dish antenna, which is about the size of a garbage can lid and costs $200 to $400. The dish has to have a clear line of sight to the satellite, which in the New York City area is typically in the southwestern sky.
The installation and alignment of the dish is not for technological sissies, and I highly recommend paying the extra $200 to $300 for professional installation. Once installed, moreover, the data signal can be knocked out of whack by high winds or other bad weather conditions.
I signed up for Hughes DirecPC satellite data services as part of a package with Compaq Computer. Compaq, like many other PC makers, is trying to make it as easy as possible for its customers to be ready for broadband access. Besides the dish and installation cost, monthly satellite data service costs $30 to $130 a month, depending on how many hours you spend on line.
The $30 plan is good for a measly 25 hours a month. The $130 plan allows up to 200 hours a month (versus unlimited time with cable or D.S.L. service).
Satellite data services may someday be ubiquitous and reach speeds of 45 mbps, but for now the maximum speed is a relatively pokey 400 kbps. More users can mean slower speeds and, occasionally, busy signals when you're trying to connect with the local satellite I.S.P.
So far, so bad. The guys who wired my satellite system were apparently receiving their orders directly from deep space. Despite my request that they mount the dish on the side of the house and not drill holes in my roof, I now have a dish bolted through my roof.
Satellite is a swell choice for people who cannot get cable or D.S.L. service, especially people who live in remote areas. But a satellite broadband connection requires a phone line, and that can be a major problem if you live in Whitefish, Mont., and the nearest satellite I.S.P. is a long-distance call away in Bozeman.
 
Decisions
If you spend only a few minutes on line every day, switching to a broadband modem may not make much financial sense. But if you find yourself spending more time connected to the Internet each day and becoming more impatient with busy signals and the time spent waiting for pages to load, a broadband connection may be the solution.
Satellite was scratched off my list first. If I lived in an area where satellite was my only choice, I could live with it. But since I have a choice, satellite isn't it.
I'm still going to use an analog modem because it is impossible to take my cable modem and D.S.L. modem with me on trips.
The choice, then, comes down to two contenders, cable and D.S.L. Either is vastly more satisfactory than a regular modem, and if I had no choice and had to take one or the other, I would still consider myself very fortunate, no matter which one I had.
The speed is nice, but more than that, I have come to rely on the always-on connection. There are no busy signals, no delays in getting online, no screeching, beep-boop modem sounds and no interruptions if I stay idle longer than the service provider thinks is necessary.
Despite cable's theoretical speed advantage, the actual performances of cable and D.S.L. are comparable. Therefore, the determinants come down to price and, to a lesser extent, to security, the choice of I.S.P. and reliability.
If I had to choose -- and economics dictate that I must -- I would keep D.S.L. Performance is steady and reliable. From the start, the phone company has been easier to deal with than my cable company, although both could improve their customer service skills.
Naturally, many people have drawn exactly the opposite conclusion. They found their local phone company impossible to deal with and had no trouble with cable. It all depends on the skills and temperament of the local service providers. The best tactic, as always, is to ask neighbors and friends who have local broadband access about their experiences.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 17, 1999, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Circuits on Thursday about services that offer fast Internet connections misstated the translation of A.D.S.L. It is an abbreviation for asymmetric digital subscriber line, not asynchronous.
The article also referred incompletely to the ownership of the @Home cable Internet service. AT&T is the largest shareholder, not the only one.

"Waiting for the Phantom"
Earlier this year the movie trailer for "Star Wars: Episode One -- The Phantom Menace" was released on the Web for downloading. The downloading times for this 25-megabyte file -- at the speeds you are most likely to achieve -- give an idea of how fast various high-bandwidth connections can be. The speeds below are neither advertised maximums nor averages, but the best speeds I could get with my connections. PETER H. LEWIS
 
INTERNET CONNECTION
 
CABLE MODEM
Speed depends on how many people are using the connection. I found one to two million bits per second was what I was able to achieve. The best download time: just under two minutes. 1 min. 40 sec.
 
D.S.L.
The guaranteed download rate was 384,000 bits per second, but it can be faster. I found I was able to get speeds of just over one million bits per second, making it comparable to cable. 3 min. 20 sec.
 
SATELLITE
The best is 400,000 bits per second and it can be a lot slower. 8 min. 20 sec.
 
56K MODEM
Top speed is 53,000 bits per second. Typical speed is slower. Download is bound to take at least an hour. 1 hour

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on page 9.
 
Now Playing
 
* "AMERICAN BEAUTY," starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan Ball. Directed by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes). With heavenly finesse, Mr. Spacey plays a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a teenage cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director Sam Mendes brings terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing, especially Ms. Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces for a devastating finale (Janet Maslin). 

* "AMERICAN MOVIE," featuring Mark Borchardt and friends. Directed by Chris Smith (R, 104 minutes). An insightful, funny, not-to-be-missed documentary about a no-budget Wisconsin filmmaker who makes a horror film as if his life depended on it. And as Mr. Smith so affectingly reveals, Mr. Borchardt's hopes really do hang in the balance. This knowing and often hilarious look at try-anything indie filmmaking becomes a moving portrait of one man's uphill struggle and finds Mr. Borchardt often describing success and prosperity as his goals. Meanwhile, his own life is eloquently presented as a very different, no less authentic kind of American Dream (Maslin).
 
* "BEING JOHN MALKOVICH," starring John Cusack, Catherine Keener, Cameron Diaz and (of course) John Malkovich. Written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Spike Jonze (R, 112 minutes). Welcome to the fun house: in this exhilaratingly quirky first feature by a stellar video director, the reigning fears and obsessions of a technology-crazed, voyeuristic culture are given an even wilder workout than they got from "The Truman Show." Mr. Cusack plays a discouraged puppeteer who accidentally finds a way into Mr. Malkovich's mind. While the ordinary science-fiction plot might go downhill after revealing its gimmick, this one's inspired craziness goes on and on. Originality and cleverness abound (Maslin).
 
"THE BACHELOR," starring Chris O'Donnell and Renee Zellweger. Directed by Gary Sinyor (PG-13, 90 minutes). This crude, frantic yuppie farce stars Mr. O'Donnell as a selfish, marriage-shy bachelor who botches his proposal to his sweetheart (Ms. Zellweger) days before his grandfather dies, leaving him $100 million on condition he marry before his 30th birthday. That gives him 27 hours either to win back his true love or find another wife. After running through his ex-girlfriends, he finds himself besieged by a horde of prospective brides chasing him through the streets of San Francisco. Based on a 1925 Buster Keaton classic, the movie lands a few satiric thrusts at the money-mad workaholic 90's (Stephen Holden).
 
"THE BONE COLLECTOR," starring Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie. Directed by Phillip Noyce (R, 118 minutes). One of the year's most gruesome movies, the ingenious but preposterous whodunit stars Mr. Washington as a quadriplegic forensic detective tracking down a serial killer who plays cat and mouse with him by leaving elaborate clues at the crime scenes. Ms. Jolie is the police officer (and former model) whom he instructs by cell phone on how to gather evidence. Crammed with the usual manipulative jolts, this urban creepshow at least succeeds in sustaining an atmosphere of menace, and Mr. Washington's and Ms. Jolie's star chemistry smolders without the two exchanging so much as a kiss (Holden).
 
* "BOYS DON'T CRY," starring Hillary Swank and Chloe Sevigny. Directed by Kimberley Pierce (R, 114 minutes). This stunning debut feature tells the strange and resonant story of Brandon Teena, who despite being born Teena Brandon went on to create a charismatic identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's idea of American tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make it work. One of the year's best (Maslin).
 
"BRINGING OUT THE DEAD," starring Nicolas Cage and Patricia Arquette. Written by Paul Schrader from a novel by Joe Connelly. Directed by Martin Scorsese (R, 115 minutes). An intense, volatile film full of sorrow and wild, mordant humor. This time it took prop garbage on the streets of Hell's Kitchen to create a sufficiently hellish ambience for another nighttime tour of Manhattan. But Mr. Scorsese has mellowed significantly since his "Taxi Driver" days, and his uneven but impassioned, visually inventive new film is more contemplative than it looks. Mr. Cage gives a fine, soulful performance as a New York ambulance driver haunted by ghosts. Ving Rhames is a major scene-stealer as one of his partners (Maslin).
 
* "EARTH," starring Aamir Khan, Nandita Das, Rahul Khanna and Maia Sethna. Directed by Deepa Mehta (not rated, 99 minutes). It is 1947 and India is about to explode into ethnic violence as British colonial rule ends and the country is partitioned into two nations, mostly Hindu India and mostly Muslim Pakistan. These momentous changes are observed by Lenny (Ms. Sethna), the 8-year-old daughter of a well-to-do Parsi family in Lahore. As Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs slaughter one another in the streets, old friends become deadly enemies. Caught in the middle is Shanta (Ms. Das), Lenny's beautiful Hindu nanny, who has two Muslim suitors. The movie's child's-eye view somewhat mutes its dramatic sweep (Holden).
 
"HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL," starring Geoffrey Rush, Taye Diggs and Peter Gallagher. Directed by William Malone (R, 115 minutes). If the ever vigilant Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, is truly determined to snuff out inflation aborning, then he can do no better than to take sharpened pencil in hand, make his way to the nearest theater showing this film and strike fearlessly until its feeble pulse beats no more. This is a sorry reincarnation of the 1950's William Castle horror film in which an eccentric millionaire, played by Vincent Price, offered five strangers $10,000 each to spend the night in a spooky old mansion. In the new version, the ante for survival has been raised to $1 million apiece. Even allowing for inflation in the 40 years since the original opened, the reward in 1999 should come to only $57,113.47, according to the Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis. But some things have not become devalued over the years -- words like junk, for example. "Hill" was pronounced junk in these pages in 1959. And it is still junk (Lawrence Van Gelder).
 
* "THE INSIDER," starring Al Pacino, Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer. Directed by Michael Mann (R, 155 minutes). Mr. Mann directs this taut thriller, about the tobacco industry whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand, with pulse-quickening panache. And he illustrates why, in the corporate climate of the 90's, truth-telling is a riskier business than it was circa "All the President's Men." While Mr. Pacino delivers galvanizing moral outrage as a producer for "60 Minutes," and Mr. Plummer wickedly mimics Mike Wallace, Mr. Crowe movingly captures the complexity of Mr. Wigand's situation. Shaky docudrama ethics cloud the film's take on "60 Minutes." But this is an inordinately well-played thriller, with Mr. Mann's stylistic brio at its best (Maslin).
 
* "THE LIMEY," starring Terence Stamp and Peter Fonda. Directed by Steven Soderbergh (R, 89 minutes). From a director for whom the quirky stylistic exercise is standard style, this is a handsome throwback to the salad days of its two iconic stars. Mr. Stamp, in a stony, magnetic performance punctuated by flashbacks to his early career, plays an ex-con seeking revenge for the death of his daughter. He becomes the nemesis of Mr. Fonda's slick Hollywood hipster, in another role that's piquantly tailor-made. Mr. Soderbergh resurrects the lean, hard-boiled look of John Boorman's "Point Blank" as he dissects and considers these two tough customers from every conceivable perspective (Maslin).
 
"MUSIC OF THE HEART," starring Meryl Streep, Aidan Quinn, Angela Bassett and Gloria Estefan. Directed by Wes Craven (PG, 110 minutes). Not many of us enjoy being lectured by dressed-down Hollywood stars in gritty classroom situations. But the true story of Roberta Guaspari, a music teacher in East Harlem and a single mother surviving a nasty divorce, has been given a blunt, no-nonsense tone that works. Ms. Streep gives a down-to-earth performance that is sheer award bait. The story is inspirational enough to take Ms. Guaspari from no job prospects to watching her proud students play alongside Itzhak Perlman, Isaac Stern and other violin stars. Not a bad reason for Mr. Craven to have sidelined the claws and hatchets for a while (Maslin).
 
* "PRINCESS MONONOKE," with the voices of Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thornton and Minnie Driver. Directed by Hayao Miyazaki (PG-13, 133 minutes). A landmark feat of Japanese animation from the acknowledged master of the genre. This complicated, exotically beautiful epic features gods and demons locked in battle for the future of the forest, and its visions are breathtakingly rendered. But it is the film's stirring use of nature, myth and Japanese history that makes it so special. Worth seeing just for its Forest Spirit, which takes animal form by day and roams the night as a diaphanous, Godzilla-like divinity. The image of plants and flowers springing to life beneath his hooves is ravishingly presented. Despite a superb blend of hand-drawn cels and fluid, computer-generated animation, the film's look is gratifyingly understated (Maslin).
 
"THE STORY OF US," starring Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer. Directed by Rob Reiner (R, 90 minutes). The first unofficial Jack Lemmon comedy for the baby boom generation. As an ode to the ups and downs of middle-aged marriage, this arthritic suburban story is enough to make single people want to file for divorce. Mr. Willis makes iffy casting in the role of a sensitive father and husband, while Ms. Pfeiffer is not well served by a role that makes her scream so hard that her neck turns red. Together, with the help of noisy friends and acquaintances, these two run through the long history of a marriage with the help of a criminal set of wigs and hairpieces. Small talk turns to matters like home repair jobs and prostate trouble (Maslin).
 
* "THE STRAIGHT STORY," starring Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek. Directed by David Lynch (G, 110 minutes). As the least likely filmmaker on the planet to pull off a G-rated miracle, Mr. Lynch rises to the challenge with exhilarating vigor. It may not sound like much, but this account of an old man making a long trip on a riding lawn mower turns out to be a slow-moving, folksy-looking, deeply spiritual film with the power to hold audiences in thrall. And as Oscar may well note next spring, it would not have been possible without Mr. Farnsworth's terse, no-nonsense honesty at its heart. Mr. Lynch's famously unwholesome imagination crosses a new frontier to explore simple virtues and natural beauty. The result: a supremely improbable triumph (Maslin).
 
"THREE KINGS," starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube. Written and directed by David O. Russell (R, 105 minutes). The prodigiously talented writer-director of "Spanking the Monkey" and "Flirting With Disaster" has made a much more ambitious film, with mixed results. His gimlet-eyed Persian Gulf war film has a "Catch-22" absurdist edge, but it also has an oversupply of visual affectations. Vertiginous music-video camera tricks jazz up the otherwise straightforward story of American soldiers who have larcenous designs on Saddam Hussein's captured gold and then develop conscience pangs about their own roles in Iraq. There are many clever touches, but there's something tamely conventional at the film's core (Maslin).
 
Film Series
 
MARGARET MEAD FILM AND VIDEO FESTIVAL. Religious movements, persecution of ethnic minorities, cinema verite and body marks are the four principal themes that will be explored in more than 60 films in the 23rd annual Margaret Mead festival, beginning today at the American Museum of Natural History. The opening attraction, presented at 7 p.m. in the museum's main auditorium, is "A Married Couple," Allan King's 1969 cinema-verite examination of the complexity and fragility of modern marriage. In connection with "Body Art: Marks of Identity," a coming museum exhibition, five festival programs will investigate how people and communities use the human body as an expression of aesthetic, political and social practices. Admission to the festival, through Nov. 20 at the museum, Central Park West at 79th Street, is $8 a program: $28 for 4 programs or $65 for 10; for museum members, students and people 62 or older, the price is $7; $24 for 4 programs or $55 for 10. Admission to opening- night screening and reception: $35. Information: (212) 769-5305; tickets, (212) 769-5200 (Van Gelder).

George W., Helmsman

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS 

 BODY:
George W. Bush must be feeling at least a tiny bit of heat from John McCain, since he's felt compelled to come up with a reason that he would make a better president than the senator from Arizona.
And the winner is . . . 
 "I've had chief executive experience," says Mr. Bush. "I know how to set goals. I know how to make decisions. I know how to rally people."
Now a truly cynical person might say that Mr. Bush's background would prove useful only if Congress decides to start behaving like the Texas legislature and meet every other year. But hey, you work with what you have.
"The next president of the United States must have executive experience; we don't need people learning on the job," said Carroll Campbell, the former governor of South Carolina, driving the message home at a Bush rally in Seneca, S.C., this week.
People there had been standing packed in a hot American Legion hall for two hours while a local state representative periodically shrieked out false alarms. ("He's right outside! Trust me!") They were almost all committed Bush supporters, who said they had decided to support the governor over Mr. McCain and the other Republicans because:
"His mother was one of the best first ladies."
"I liked his father."
"He's a people person."
"He's got a lot of the same beliefs as his father had."
"Family values."
"I just like him."
Nobody mentioned executive experience.
It's pretty apparent that Mr. Bush became the odds-on favorite to get the Republican nomination because he was born with a famous political name. He happened to start running for president at a time when the campaign began so early that asking voters to name their favorite candidate was like asking them for their favorite poet. Mr. Bush, the Robert Frost of political name recognition, won the first polls easily, and after that things just started snowballing. He got more and more support because, in the words of a woman in a diner in Easley, S.C., "he's popular."
Naturally, the campaign needs a more impressive story arc. Mr. Bush and his surrogates would like to attribute his success as a presidential candidate to his record as governor, which includes making Texas one of 49 states to lower taxes over the last five years and one of 50 that slashed welfare rolls.
Texas has prospered under the current governor, but it's hard to tell how much of that has to do with a national economy so stupendous it would have required a herculean effort to fail. Last year the number of crimes in the state dropped 5.2 percent. But South Dakota's crime rate went down 19 percent, and you don't see a presidential boom for Gov. William Janklow. The welfare caseload in Texas dropped about 30 percent during the first several years of George Bush's watch, but it dropped 44 percent in Alabama under Fob James, who spent most of his administration obsessing about putting prayer back in the schools.
Mr. Bush's best assets -- an energetic campaign style and great timing -- will take you a lot further politically than a genius for management. (Just ask the other governors.) At the rally in Seneca, one of the most well-informed voters in the audience seemed to be Haynie Floyd, who is in the pest control business. Mr. Floyd said he was disappointed that Mr. Bush hadn't talked more about the environment, but he felt he had the best character for the job.
"McCain is sometime down the road going to show his temper," the exterminator said. "Now when Bush couldn't answer that question about the world leaders on TV, he didn't lose his temper. I don't know what McCain would have done."
Now imagine what would have happened to Al Gore if he'd gotten caught on TV drawing a blank on the name of the prime minister of India and calling the head of Pakistan "General . . . general." How many people think it would have been taken as a sign of presidential temperament that he didn't slug the interviewer?
The polls in New Hampshire show Senator McCain making substantial progress in the race for the presidential nomination. But he's still way, way behind Mr. Bush in the Luck Sweepstakes.

Nasdaq Continues Its Run Of Record-Setting Sessions

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Nasdaq composite index rose to its ninth record in 10 sessions amid optimism that Dell Computer would beat forecasts when it reported profits after exchanges closed.
"The big companies in technology are moving the market," said David Sowerby, who helps manage $10 billion for Loomis, Sayles & Company in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. "Even beyond Dell, tech stocks are being driven by investors who are willing to pay higher prices for 20-30 percent earnings momentum." 
 The Nasdaq rose 41.33 points, or 1.3 percent, to 3,197.29. Cisco Systems, Qualcomm and Microsoft led the index's advance. The technology-heavy Nasdaq has risen 14 percent since Oct. 27.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 8.00 points, or six-tenths of a percent, to 1,381.46, led by Cisco, Microsoft and Nortel Networks.
The Dow Jones industrial average was little changed at 10,595.30, down 2.44 points, paring a 53-point loss as American Express and J. P. Morgan advanced. Seventeen stocks fell for every 13 that rose on the New York Stock Exchange.
Trading was lighter than usual because the bond market was closed in observance of Veterans Day. Some 891 million shares changed hands on the Big Board, down from 970 million a week ago.
Some money managers said they were staying away from the market before Federal Reserve policy makers meet on Tuesday to decide whether to raise short-term interest rates.
The Nasdaq has held up much better than the Dow or S.& P. 500 since interest rates started climbing. The Nasdaq has gained 19 percent since the Fed made the first of two interest-rate increases on June 30, while the Dow has fallen 3.4 percent and the S.& P. 500 has gained six-tenths of a percent.
Computer makers have not done so well this year because of concerns that rising chip prices would cut into profits and that sales would slow as companies put off purchases to prepare for the transition to the new millennium.
Dell, the most-active United States stock, rose 2 1/16, to 43 1/2, in regular trading. The company reported third-quarter profit that matched expectations, but revenue growth fell slightly short of forecasts, climbing 41 percent, compared with expectations of 45 percent. Dell remains 20 percent below its Feb. 2 high. The Nasdaq has risen 30 percent since then.
Cisco climbed 4 5/16, to 83 3/4. The company said on Tuesday that first-quarter sales rose 29 percent. Qualcomm, which developed the second-most popular cell-phone technology, climbed 25 11/32, to 345 15/32.
Microsoft rose 2 9/16, to 89 5/8. The software giant said it would invest $100 million in Tandy's Radio Shack. Tandy gained 6 1/4, to 71 7/16. Investors also speculated that the company could take a stake in Loral Space and Communications Ltd. Loral rose 1 11/16, to 18 3/16.
Circuit City Group and Best Buy surged. Peter Caruso, a Merrill Lynch analyst, said in a report that America Online might seek to form an alliance with one of the two big consumer-electronics retailers if Tandy chose to link with Microsoft instead of AOL.
Circuit City jumped 7 1/4, to 45 1/2, and Best Buy climbed 51 5/16, to 54 7/16. AOL fell 3 1/8, to 143 1/8.

HEADLINE: Novartis Plans No Bid for American Home$ %

BYLINE: By DAVID J. MORROW 

DATELINE: BASEL, Switzerland, Nov. 11

 BODY:
The chairman of Novartis A.G. of Switzerland said today that he now had no intention of making a hostile bid for American Home Products, but added that the fate of the New Jersey company was far from decided despite its pending agreement to merge with Warner-Lambert.
Many drug analysts and executives thought that Novartis might try to take over American Home Products after Pfizer made a hostile bid for Warner-Lambert last week. But Dr. Daniel Vasella, the chairman and chief executive of Novartis, dismissed that theory in an interview here today. 
 "I have no intention currently of making a hostile bid for any company," Dr. Vasella said. "Novartis does not exclude making corporate transactions as a way to achieve growth, but to make any merger in haste would be crazy."
Like the chief executives of the British drug giants Glaxo Wellcome and AstraZeneca, Dr. Vasella said he thought that Pfizer would succeed in its bid to take over Warner-Lambert. But when it came to commenting on the future of American Home Products, the Novartis chief seemed oddly vague.
"The shareholders of American Home Products have choices," he said. "And with this merger with Warner-Lambert, they will have to make that choice in April."
Asked if he would leak the details of a merger with American Home Products to a reporter, should his company try one if the Warner-Lambert deal fell through, he smiled broadly.
"When American Home Products is bought, there will be many phone calls," Dr. Vasella said. "It will not be a secret. It will be open; you will certainly know it."
In the last few weeks, Novartis has been linked by analysts and some news reports as a possible merger partner with several companies, including Monsanto.
One analyst said today that Novartis might seek to trade its agricultural division for Searle, Monsanto's drug division, but other industry executives dismissed that as unlikely because of the antitrust issues raised in combining two large agricultural businesses.
Dr. Vasella declined to say anything about Monsanto.
"I am starting a policy now of saying no comment when journalists call and ask if we are merging with this company or that company," he said.
Most drug companies are considering acquisitions to bolster their drug development pipelines, but Dr. Vasella said Novartis was not in that situation. The company has several blockbuster drugs for which it is about to seek approval from the Food and Drug Administration, including Zelmac for irritable bowel syndrome and Starlix, a treatment for adult-onset diabetes.
Analysts have chided Novartis for being a poor marketer in the United States, where Novartis -- the world's second-largest drug company -- ranks ninth in prescription drug sales, according to I.M.S. Health, an industry consultant.
"When you talk about the companies that are the best at sales and marketing in the United States, Novartis is not among them, I agree," Dr. Vasella said. "But I don't have to do a merger for research and development. I want to increase the company's marketing capabilities in the United States and step up our sales there."
Some analysts have been skeptical that Novartis would make an American acquisition because the company's shares are not listed on the New York Stock Exchange and its American depository receipts are thinly traded.
"We plan to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange by the end of next year," Dr. Vasella said. "But that wouldn't stop us from making a merger. I'm sure there are plenty of banks that would be willing to help us."
Like many other chief executives, Dr. Vasella said he planned to watch the fight for Warner-Lambert closely, but in the meantime, would concentrate on bringing his new drugs to market.
The company faces competition with Glaxo Wellcome, which is expected to introduce Lotronex, its irritable-bowel drug, in the next several months.

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Gore Commercial on His Health Care Plans for Children

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

 BODY:

This 30-second commercial is the fourth from Vice President Al Gore. It discusses health care for children and is being broadcast in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.
 
PRODUCER -- Century-Media. 

ON THE SCREEN -- Mr. Gore, who is being interviewed by his aides, is in shirt sleeves, addressing the camera directly. The scenes shift to children, including a child with a doctor and the words: "Affordable high-quality health care." The commercial closes with a homey scene of a family on a couch.
 
THE SCRIPT -- "I think it's just unconscionable at a time when we have the strongest economy in history, we're the wealthiest nation on earth, to have millions and millions of children who have no health care coverage at all. We ought to change that.
"And we ought to start by making a commitment to have affordable high-quality health care for every child in America before the end of the next president's term. And we can do that within a balanced budget. Then we can go down the road toward coverage for every single American."
 
ACCURACY -- Like Mr. Gore's previous commercials, this one makes almost no factual claims. There are about 44 million Americans without health insurance, 11 million of whom are children.
 
SCORECARD -- Mr. Gore's health care proposal is under stinging attack from former Senator Bill Bradley, his only rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, as unambitious and incremental. The commercial gives the impression that Mr. Gore wants a sweeping proposal that would lead to coverage for everyone -- and the Bradley campaign has taken Mr. Gore to task for virtually lifting its language. The Bradley camp also noted that 11 million uninsured children is 7 million more than in 1993, and blamed the Clinton-Gore administration.
The Gore campaign is trying to fight the impression that Mr. Gore is overly scripted. With its conversational style, soft piano music and images of children, the commercial is intended to humanize Mr. Gore as well as speak to the issue of health care. KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

HEADLINE: Clintons Seek To Delay Suit Over Mortgage

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 11

 BODY:
Using an argument that failed in the Paula Jones case, President Clinton's lawyers are seeking to delay a lawsuit involving the Clintons' house purchase in Chappaqua, N.Y., until after the president leaves office.
A Clinton lawyer, David E. Kendall, filed a motion this week asking that the suit filed by the conservative group Judicial Watch be blocked until the president's departure from the White House, if a federal judge does not dismiss the case. 
 Last month the Clintons dropped a loan arrangement involving a prominent Democratic Party fund-raiser and obtained a 30-year mortgage of $1.36 million from PNC Mortgage, a subsidiary of the PNC Bank Corporation of Pittsburgh.
Judicial Watch wants to have the new mortgage rescinded, asserting that its terms are an illegal gratuity from the mortgage lender.
"The burden of defending against a lawsuit such as this," Mr. Kendall said in court papers, "compels the president to raise anew and preserve the argument that civil suits against him should be stayed for the duration of his term in office."
The Supreme Court ruled in 1997 that the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against Mr. Clinton should proceed because witnesses might be lost because of the passage of time and memories might fade.
Mr. Kendall noted that the Supreme Court ruled that while presidents are not immune from civil suits while in office, a federal district court judge has "broad discretion" to delay such suits.
The Clintons have bought a $1.7 million house using a 20 percent down payment in a market that housing industry experts say typically demands at least 30 percent for this kind of loan. They are not paying points, or add-on fees which ordinarily are paid in deals with a lower interest rate. The loan carries a rate of 7.5 percent for three years before converting to an adjustable rate.

HEADLINE: Hesitating Beside A Shallow Labor Pool;
Will Fed Take Plunge and Raise Rates?

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 11

 BODY:
Frank Ciotola, a restaurant owner in Columbus, Ohio, is paying dishwashers $8 an hour nowadays, up from $6 two years ago. And he is spending more money placing help-wanted ads than he is promoting the restaurant itself.
The proportion of his total costs accounted for by labor has crept up to 29 percent from 24 percent during the last few years, and though he has clamped down on other expenses as much as possible, Mr. Ciotola said he has reached the point where customers at his restaurant, Da Vinci, will have to pick up some of the tab if wages keep rising rapidly. 
 "It's just about as tight as it's going to get," Mr. Ciotola said. "Any additional increases we face, we'll just have to pass along in terms of menu prices or I'm not going to make any money."
The nation's low and still declining unemployment rate -- it fell to 4.1 percent in October, the lowest in almost 30 years -- has been great news for Mr. Ciotola's 75 employees and workers in most industries all over the country.
But the shrinking pool of available labor, and the possibility that upward pressure on wages could spur inflation, seem to be the biggest issues on the minds of Federal Reserve officials as they debate whether to raise interest rates a third time this year when they meet on Tuesday.
So far, employment cost increases have remained restrained despite the drop in unemployment. Moreover, to the degree that those costs have surged, from such hot industries as computer software and telecommunications to more traditional sectors like retailing, businesses have proved remarkably successful in absorbing them without sacrificing profits or raising prices.
The reasons range from new trends in compensation, like the rising use of stock options in the place of salary increases, to an upturn in the growth rate of productivity, or each worker's output each hour. The question is how long such forces can keep a lid on the pressures that might force up wages and prices.
Productivity improvements can continue, one Fed official said recently, "but it defies all logic to assume you won't get increases in prices and wages at some point."
Nobody knows precisely when that point will be reached, though, making the decision about whether to raise rates next week a particularly close call for the central bank, which pushed its benchmark Federal funds target rate up by a quarter of a percentage point in August, to 5.25 percent, after an earlier quarter-point increase in June.
There is clearly a case for the Fed to take no action next week. By most measures, inflation remains reasonably well contained. The economy is showing some signs of slowing in response to earlier interest rate increases. Many stocks are down from their highs this summer. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and other Fed officials are increasingly convinced that the improvement in productivity growth reflects structural changes in the way businesses operate, not just a brief cyclical upturn.
"If they do raise rates, I'd really like to know why," said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm in Valhalla, N.Y. "The only rationale is that growth is strong, and I think the Fed has moved beyond the idea that growth by itself is something to be afraid of."
The case in favor of another rate increase next week is built largely on the idea that the nation is running out of workers, and that at some point a simple supply-and-demand situation will lead to a surge in wages and then, perhaps, prices. In this view, the Fed should stay ahead of the trend by slowing the economy a bit more to keep the labor market from getting even tighter.
"Even in the absence of a rise in core inflation, developments in the labor market are likely to result in the Fed instituting more pre-emptive rate hikes," said Ian Morris, an economist at HSBC Securities in New York.
In a report last month, John Youngdahl, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, took an in-depth look at the strains in the labor market. He said that even the broadest measure of available labor -- including not just people who are officially unemployed but some part-time workers and others who might be tempted back into the labor market -- had declined steeply, to 7 percent in September from 7.6 percent a year earlier.
Joblessness among adults, 3.5 percent in October, is near a three-decade low. Overall labor force participation is stagnant or down, and the growth of the labor force is slowing somewhat.
Mr. Youngdahl concluded that there appeared to be growing sentiment at the Fed that it is "not only the small size but the inflexibility of the margin in labor supply that creates potential for an appreciable upward shift in labor expense growth."
In his public appearances, Mr. Greenspan has alluded repeatedly to tight labor markets. Speaking to a group of business executives last month, Mr. Greenspan said that the number of people being drawn into the work force beyond those due to normal population trends -- in other words, people who had previously chosen not to work -- was accounting for roughly half a percentage point of economic growth.
Eventually, Mr. Greenspan said, the economy would have to revert back to a growth rate reflecting normal labor force growth and the long-term rate of productivity gains.
"Clearly, the growth in gross domestic product cannot exceed the sum of growth in structural productivity and in the working-age population indefinitely," Mr. Greenspan said. "Market pressures must eventually emerge that work to contain such unsustainable growth."
There is plenty of anecdotal evidence of mounting pressures in the labor markets. Sears, Roebuck & Company said that in some cities it had to pay cash bonuses to attract and even retain employees in its stores and that regional managers had discretion to raise wages if needed.
James H. Keyes, chairman of Johnson Controls, a manufacturer based in Milwaukee, said his company now often drew new employees from lower-paying, less-skilled jobs in the service sector, and must spend money and time training them. Moreover, Johnson's customers in industries like automobiles demand decreasing prices on some of its products, putting additional pressure on the company to offset rising labor costs with productivity improvements.
And at the loftiest reaches of the employment scale, experienced executives going into senior jobs at technology start-ups are able to demand and get richer packages of stock and options in addition to cash compensation.
"We're living in the middle of an unprecedented supply-and-demand imbalance," said David B. Kixmiller, a partner in the Silicon Valley office of Heidrick & Struggles, the executive search firm.
To hold down labor costs in that kind of environment, companies have become more imaginative. Some use one-time cash bonuses to reward workers without permanently raising wage rates. Others are offering more equity-based pay programs like stock options that do not show up in traditional measures of wage and salary growth. Others are offering expensive gifts, extra time off and other benefits in an effort to lure new employees and hold onto the ones they have.
Some analysts also think that workers themselves are less aggressive in pushing for pay increases than they were in previous business cycles when unemployment dipped to low levels. The reason, they speculate, is that the combination of global competition and the relentless corporate push to cut costs hasleft workers somewhat insecure about their jobs -- even if they are relatively confident that they could find another if they did become unemployed.
The pressure on labor costs could well ease if the economy is indeed slowing. But the economy has repeatedly defied projections of a slowdown, and at this point continued strong growth could send unemployment down to levels the nation has not seen since 1969.
Mr. Morris of HSBC calculated recently that if labor force growth remains at its current annual rate of roughly 1 percent, labor force participation remains steady at around 67 percent and the economy creates an average of 250,000 nonfarm jobs a month, the unemployment rate will decline to as low as 3.5 percent by the middle of next year.
If job growth averages 200,000 a month -- it has been running at an average of 192,000 a month this year -- it would push the unemployment rate down to as low as 3.9 percent by mid-2000, Mr. Morris said.
Fed officials will no doubt scrutinize new reports on retail sales and productivity that are to be released on Friday, the last major economic indicators before their meeting next Tuesday. And while they have given few clues in the last few weeks as to their thinking about the arguments for and against a rate increase, they have made clear that they are very much on alert.
"One should not assume that the business cycle is dead," William McDonough, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, told reporters in Vienna today after delivering a speech there. "One should not assume that the American economy can keep growing faster without inflation."

HEADLINE: Rubin Is Named to Ford's Board

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Nov. 11

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company appointed Robert E. Rubin, the former treasury secretary, to its board as the automaker tries to improve its credibility with investors.
Mr. Rubin will join the board of Ford on Jan. 1. Two weeks ago, he joined Citigroup Inc., the financial-services company, as chairman of its executive committee. 
 The 61-year-old one-time co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company joined the Clinton administration in 1993 as chairman of the National Economic Council. He was treasury secretary from 1995 until last July.
"He's probably the most prestigious, respected and intelligent business mind in corporate America," said Nick Lobaccaro, a Lehman Brothers analyst. "Investors have put Ford in the penalty box because they fear the company might squander some of the cash they've been generating. Robert Rubin will be seen as a strong advocate of shareholder value."
Ford had $25.7 billion in cash and securities at the end of the third quarter. Analysts have suggested Ford spend some of that to buy back shares, which have fallen 9.2 percent this year even though the nine-month profit was a best-ever $5.43 billion.
Mr. Rubin's "global perspective, knowledge and credibility with international leaders are a perfect fit with the vision we have for Ford," William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman of Ford, said in a company statement.
Mr. Rubin is the first addition to the Ford board since the chairman joined it on Jan. 1, 1999.
At Citigroup, Mr. Rubin joined Sanford I. Weill and John S. Reed, the chairmen and chief executives, in what Mr. Reed described as a "three-person office of the chairman."

HEADLINE: Biotech Companies Take On Critics of Gene-Altered Food

SERIES: REDESIGNING NATURE -- The Battle for Public Opinion

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 11

 BODY:
Worried about growing resistance to genetically modified foods, some of the world's biggest biotechnology companies are mounting a huge lobbying and marketing campaign to counter their critics and combat what they call a rising wave of anti-biotech hysteria.
Makers of genetically modified seeds have taken a beating this year in Europe, where critics have sabotaged test plots of altered crops and have fostered widespread distrust of what they call Frankenstein foods. 
 Now that concern is beginning to grow in the United States. Environmental groups are stoking opposition through lobbying and full-page advertisements; federal lawmakers on Wednesday introduced legislation that would require labeling of food made with genetically modified crops, and regulators are re-evaluating everything from food safety to the effects bioengineered crops may have on the monarch butterfly.
At stake in this contest for American public opinion are billions of dollars in investments by the biotechnology industry and American farmers who have rapidly adopted products like corn, potatoes and soybeans that have been engineered to resist pests or producer higher yields.
Until recently, the leading biotechnology companies were reluctant to respond to criticism in this country for fear of making the novel foods an issue. But some biotech executives now say that there is a sense that the tide may be turning against genetically modified foods and that urgent action is needed.
And so in recent months, the Monsanto Company, Du Pont, Novartis A.G. and other biotech companies have formed a series of industrywide alliances and have set aside tens of millions of dollars to fight what they view as an ugly campaign that has vilified the companies -- calling Monsanto, for example, "Monsatan" and "Mutanto," -- and has misrepresented their products.
"The protest industry has gone too far," Edward Shonsey, chief executive at Novartis Seeds Inc., said in an interview. "They've crossed the boundaries of reasonableness, and now it's up to us to protect and defend biotechnology. As a result there's a combined effort to get the facts out there."
Members of the alliances are financing scientific research, organizing educational forums, lobbying legislators, regulators and farm organizations, and using their own Web sites to promote the benefits of genetically modified, or G.M., products. The members have also retained three major public relations concerns in recent weeks. And many are pooling their resources and preparing a global advertising and public relations campaign.
"All these forces are coming to bear where we're going to have a really big battle," said Todd Duvick, a food industry analyst at Bank of America. "We already have huge quantities of G.M. foods and there are companies that want labeling and companies that don't want them; it's creating a logistical nightmare. Meanwhile, all the biotechnology companies are trying to protect themselves."
The debate centers on a technology that can borrow a genetic code from plants or animals and transfer it to a plant to give it a desired trait. This year, 20 percent to 45 percent of American corn and soybeans were grown from seed engineered to produce its own insecticidal toxin, and those crops have found their way into many processed foods. Backers say biotechnology may eventually lead to crops that have extra nutrition or can thrive in adverse weather.
But some consumer advocates and scientists, particularly in Europe, say that not enough research has been done to prove that food made from genetically altered crops is safe to eat. In response, federal regulators say that no studies have proven that food made from genetically modified products is harmful to eat, and that all biotech products now on the market have been deemed safe.
Another concern is the possible effect such crops might have on the environment. An increasing number of studies suggest that genetically modified plants could interact with the environment in hazardous ways, like creating a hard-to-eradicate super weed, and that regulators are not demanding the proper studies to assess the risks.
With critics gaining ground in the United States, the biotechnology companies feel they need to act. But their campaign is not unified. Monsanto, whose aggressive efforts to gain acceptance for its genetically modified products backfired in Europe, recently retained Burson-Marsteller, a global public relations firm, at an annual cost of millions of dollars, according to people who reviewed the deal.
Monsanto, whose stock price has suffered over the past year because of growing concern about the viability and profitability of its biotechnology division, is now trying a two-pronged effort to educate consumers and reach out to its critics.
"We look at this as a much more positive, pro-active dialogue with the public, which has the right to know more about the benefits of biotechnology," said Nick Rosa, a senior vice president at Monsanto in St. Louis. "We are not interested in a guerrilla response. There are many coalitions interested in communicating on biotech and in many instances we are working with them. We believe that the benefits of biotechnology need to be told."
Monsanto is even meeting with some of its most vocal opponents. A month ago, the company's chief executive, Robert B. Shapiro, addressed a gathering of the environmental group Greenpeace. And top executives at Monsanto, including Mr. Shapiro, are planning to meet soon with Jeremy Rifkin, an influential commentator on science and technology to whom biotechnology is a "Faustian bargain." The meeting was arranged by Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate. Du Pont is taking a conciliatory approach.
"Public concern has been aggravated by the perception that we in industry have often acted as though public fears are not legitimate and are the result of ignorance," Charles O. Holliday Jr, the chief executive at Du Pont, said in a speech last September. "Unfortunately, many in the industry have been reluctant to address concerns about the risks of biotechnology. But we have to listen to the people who are now raising alarms. We don't have all the answers and to pretend we do, or to brush off concern as unfounded, is to be arrogant and reckless."
Du Pont recently released a series of television commercials about the future, featuring the company's "to do list," which included research to "find food that helps prevent breast cancer."
Novartis Seeds U.S.A., however, is publicly acknowledging a spirited campaign to balance the flow of public information about biotechnology.
"I'm in four or five different working groups on this issue," said Mr. Shonsey, the chief executive at Novartis Seeds. "We're holding in-depth sessions with members of Congress, with universities and trade associations, the grocery manufacturers and food associations. Strategy is taking place to do that, you may even see TV and radio ads, even scientific conferences. We want a consistent message out there. We want a more balanced discussion."
Food industry trade groups are also rallying and recently formed the Alliance for Better Foods, whose Web site, betterfoods.org, is devoted to promoting the benefits of biotech foods.
The organization, which is supported by groups like the Grocery Manufacturers of America, says it wants consumers to know not only that bioengineered crops resist pests and increase crop yields, but that the technology holds out the promise of creating more nutritious foods and perhaps even foods that could serve to prevent or treat medical ailments.
"You've seen the shrill statements and outrageous tactics by people who are attacking biotech foods," said Gene Grabowski, a spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers of America and the Alliance for Better Foods. "Our site is intended to be based on fact; it's decidely pro-biotech but it's not intended to be strident."
The companies have reviewed their stunning public relations loss in Europe and now acknowledge that there were a number of missteps. "I think there was a certain naivete in our initial approaches to the European market," Mr. Shapiro said in an interview. "We had been operating on a model that had been used in the U.S. If the question is have we learned anything in recent months in the sociology, the media orientation, yes, we have learned something."
In many cases, the trade groups and other coalitions are expected to take the visible lead in the months to come. "There's a feeling that some of the companies have been vilified, and so it's more credible if scientists and academics and farmers stand up on the issue," said Carl Feldbaum, president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization in Washington, which is lobbying on behalf of Monsanto and others. "If it's the company, people say, 'Well, it's got a commercial interest.' So it's better this way."
Some of the leading environmental groups, however, say they believe the new campaign will backfire because it will raise even more questions about biotech foods.
"They are under the misguided assumption that the more information they put out the more light at the end of the tunnel," said Mr. Rifkin, who is president of the Foundation on Economic Trends, an environmental group. "But the more information they put out the more questions people have about G.M. foods." He asserted that the products were dangerous and said, "They think it's public relations disaster but it's more than that."
Environmental groups in the United States pounced on the issue last May, when a Cornell University study showed that pollen from corn producing the insecticidal toxin Bt could stunt the development of monarch caterpillars in the laboratory. Since then there has been growing coverage by the news media of the concerns about the safety of genetically modified crops.
On Wednesday in Washington, a bipartisan group of 20 members of Congress introduced legislation that would require labeling of genetically engineered food products because of concerns about food safety.
In the coming weeks, the F.D.A. is planning to hold a series of forums on biotechnology, largely to solicit public opinion, and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman is expected to name a panel of experts to advise him on biotechnology issues; the Environmental Protection Agency is also expected to announce in the coming weeks how biotech corn can be planted, a decision that may be influenced by the recent restudies on the monarch butterfly.
In the scramble to influence this debate, a group of public relations officials apparently jumped the gun last week at a scientific conference here.
The conference, which was financed by the large biotechnology companies, invited representatives of the news media. Yet before the deliberations began, conference staff members issued a news release announcing that the meeting was expected to show that genetically engineered corn did not harm monarch butterflies, even though no scientists later polled by a reporter said they could draw such a conclusion and most of them acknowledged that their research was far from complete.
The conference and about half the studies presented were financed by the biotechnology industry. But the public relations officials insisted the meeting was strictly scientific.
"You can quibble with it but I think it was a low-key press release," said Libby Mikesell, a spokeswoman for the Agricultural Biotechnology Stewardship Working Group, a trade group financed by big biotechnology companies. "This just said: 'This is what we expect them to say, please tune in. There wasn't any interest in trying to spin it.' "
Several scientists, however, say they were told the conference could help influence the decision by the E.P.A. on biotech corn. "It's my understanding that they wanted to give some partial data to the E.P.A. by this date," said John Foster, a professor of entomology at the University of Nebraska.
The scientists say part of the reason they chose to release preliminary data, some of the studies with as little as 10 percent of the work complete, was pressure from farmers seeking more information.
Indeed, much of the debate about biotechnology is coalescing around seed sales to farmers. The nation's leading seed and biotechnology companies are trying to convince farmers of the viability of their products.
"They're doing a lot more hand holding," said John Hawkins, a spokesman for the Illinois Farm Bureau. "Farmers are upset with low prices and now you have this technology with potential to lower their costs but foreign countries are saying 'we're not going to buy it or we'll have to label it.' "
And if farmers turn against them, the big biotechnology companies could face huge losses.
"Clearly everyone in the biotech industry is concerned," said Frank Mitsch, an industry analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, a brokerage firm. "To some extent the year 2000 is going to be a lost year for them, and we're trying to see the order of magnitude."

HEADLINE: ONE EUROPE, 10 YEARS: Surprising Strengths;
In East German Soil, Some Companies Thrive

SERIES: This article is part of a series on Europe a decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Previous articles have looked at key players and at the aftermath for Germany and neighboring countries, and at the lives of Germans who fled and those who stayed behind.

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: JENA, Germany

 BODY:
When the Berlin Wall collapsed 10 years ago, Stephan Schambach was 18 and had never set foot in a capitalist country.
Karsten Schneider, then 29, worked listlessly at the bloated Kombinat, a huge Communist-era electronics factory in this small city south of Leipzig. 
 Today, about their only link to Communism is the name of their software company: Intershop Communications, a name they mischievously lifted from East Germany's old hard-currency stores for foreign tourists.
"No one remembers who first thought of it," Mr. Schneider recalled recently. "But it seemed perfect."
Intershop sales doubled this year to $40 million, and the company employs 500 people worldwide. Its stock, now publicly traded in Germany, has a value of about $2 billion.
Ten years after the Berlin Wall came down, such buoyancy seems wildly at odds with eastern Germany's enduring image of shuttered factories and stagnant growth. Eastern joblessness is still 18 percent, twice as high as in the west.
But in the midst of this despair something else has happened. Parts of the east have become magnets for entrepreneurs and high-technology start-up companies. In Saxony, eastern Germany's most populous state, industrial production is climbing at double-digit rates, faster than all of western Germany.
In Jena the renaissance is striking. The old Kombinat is dead. But the city has been a seedbed for nearly a thousand new ventures in the last few years. Many fizzled, but just as many have taken off, and unemployment, about 20 percent two years ago, is now about 14 percent.
"I tell my west German friends that we have gone through what they still need to go through," said Kurt Biedenkopf, the pro-business premier of Saxony and a westerner himself.
"East Germany, by reason of its peaceful revolution against an all-powerful state, has unleashed tremendous development," he said. "People here are more adaptable, more elastic. It has been painful and they didn't want it, but it was a consequence of their desire for freedom."
The wave of new companies has yet to offset the loss of old industry. Nor has it solved what may be eastern Germany's most intractable problem: high wages. Partly as a result of efforts to equalize pay in the east and the west, hundreds of thousands of low-skilled jobs that might have been ideal for eastern Germany have been lost to lower-cost rivals in the Czech Republic, Poland and elsewhere in Central Europe.
Indeed, eastern Germany's textile work force of 320,000 before the wall fell now amounts to just 20,000.
Business leaders here also note that there are big differences between fast-growing southeastern states like Saxony and Thuringia and much poorer rural states in the northeast.
"We still have hard work ahead of us for the next 15 years or so," said Lothar Spath, chairman of Jenoptik A.G., a technology company here that is one of eastern Germany's biggest success stories. "But the process is fundamentally on track."
 
The Success
Company Rose From Nothing
Jena's turnaround is also the story of Mr. Spath, a wily former politician from western Germany who is now this town's biggest employer. He is chairman of Jenoptik A.G., which he carved from the unwanted leftovers of the Communist-era conglomerate. When he arrived here in 1991, Jenoptik was nothing more than a jumble of old real estate and 30,000 workers.
"We had no products, none at all, when we started," he said. "All we had was some good technology and a lot of people." This year, Jenoptik will earn about $20 million on sales of $1.5 billion. Its biggest business is making "clean room" equipment for computer-chip manufacturers around the world.
At first glance, Mr. Spath hardly seemed like an obvious savior. East Germany is full of tales of west Germans who took over companies in the east only to strip the assets and shut them down. West German supermarkets overwhelmed fledgling eastern retailers, as did west German publishers, banks and consumer products from beer to clothing.
Mr. Spath, a man whom German newspapers have nicknamed "the clever one" because of his political skills, had abruptly resigned in 1991 as premier of the west German state of Baden-Wurttemberg after accusations that he had accepted favors from industry cronies.
With huge subsidies from the German government, about half of the Jena's old Kombinat had been reunited with Carl Zeiss A.G., the west German company that had abandoned its Jena factory when the nation was divided after World War II.
Mr. Spath, who arrived here first as a consultant, was left with the debris: acres of real estate, about 30,000 workers and no customers. There was no business plan either.
"No one could tell us what the strategy was or what it should be," recalled Petra Lorenz, one of many mid-level Kombinat managers who found herself scrambling in chaos.
The whole project would have been hopeless had Mr. Spath not been able to extract huge financial help from the German government. Pledging to save at least a third of the 30,000 jobs here, he won about $2 billion.
In his first year, Mr. Spath laid off 16,000 people, and Jenoptik executives say about $1.3 billion of the public money went simply went to cover pensions and unemployment benefits.
To raise more cash, he fixed up Zeiss's old properties into new industrial parks and sold off as much as he could. He used the cash from real estate sales to buy west German companies that would help him crack western markets.
Then he scoured the old research centers for ideas and bused in potential investors from the west.
Over the last few years, Jenoptik dabbled in scores of businesses -- security systems, automation technology, engineering services and telecommunications equipment, to name just a few.
Many of the ventures floundered. Between 1995 and 1997, Jenoptik sold or spun off businesses with combined sales of about $470 million.
He has also infuriated Germany's biggest labor union, I.G. Metall, because Jenoptik refused to negotiate with it and instead struck a deal with a tiny rival named the Christian Metalworkers Union. Under that contract, workers can be asked to work up to 44 hours a week before earning overtime pay. Christmas bonuses and extra pay for vacations, a time-honored entitlement for west German companies, are contingent on workers' performance.
I.G. Metall asked a court to throw out the deal with the other union, saying it was little more than a front for management. But a court rejected the complaint in March, and Mr. Spath has had no disruptions.
For all the criticism, Jenoptic is profitable and has spawned many other start-ups that now pack the industrial parks outside of town. Although only 1,500 of Jenoptic's 8,500 employees are actually in Jena, Jenoptik has also spawned several dozen companies that are estimated to employ more than 14,000 people here.
One of those companies is CyBio A.G., which makes automated systems for analyzing chemicals for pharmaceutical research. The company's sales have climbed to about $12 million this year, and more than half of its sales come from exports.
Petra Strumper, a west German biologist recruited to help build the fledgling business, is now one of two executives who took over the company last summer through a management buy-out.
"A lot of my friends kept saying, how can you do something like that?" Dr. Strumper said here. "But I was sure this would be successful. Besides, I liked the idea of being a pioneer."
Over the last decade, many east Germans have seethed quietly as west Germans took over companies in the east only to sell off real estate and then shut down.
Resentment has been particularly high among older workers, hundreds of thousands of whom lost their jobs and could not find new work. The sense of sullen resentment against "Besserwessis," an east German phrase for "western know-it-alls," was evident in a recent survey by the Hans Bockler Stiftung, a nonprofit research institute in Dusseldorf.
The survey found that only 9 percent of easterners wanted to return to the old regime, but that a solid majority could not identify with west Germany either.
There is still plenty of resentment against west Germans. But it is hard to find much evidence of it in cities like Jena that are growing rapidly.
"Many people can tell bad stories about things that Wessis have done, but when you have Wessis who are skillfull, efficient and are honest, you don't find that hostility," said Werner Patzelt, professor of political economy at the Dresden Technology University and a Wessi himself.
 
The Money
Advertising For Investors
The German government has poured tens of billions of dollars into bailing out Communist-era conglomerates, but there was no help for Mr. Schambach and Mr. Schneider, when they needed funds to start Intershop Communications.
The reason was simple: Computer software was not on the official list of industries eligible for subsidies.
Yet today, Intershop is one of east Germany's most striking home-grown successes. Its offices here are packed with young software developers, almost all of whom graduated from east German universities.
"We didn't know anything about how a market economy worked when we started," Mr. Schneider recalled. "In East German schools, it was all ideology. Everyone who was rich was capitalist, and capitalism was bad."
Mr. Schambach was a 19-year-old technophile when he started out in 1991. Mr. Schneider was unemployed, having quit his job as an electronics engineer at the Carl Zeiss conglomerate almost as soon as the Berlin Wall came down.
After a few false starts, they discovered the Internet and began setting up a rudimentary on-line store for computer parts in 1995. But Mr. Schambach decided the real money was in selling software to set up retail web sites.
Since they could not tap money from Bonn and did not know any venture capitalists, they did the only other thing they could think of: advertise for investors in the newspaper.
Amazingly, they succeeded: a west German company invested $800,000 in exchange for 30 percent of their company.
Intershop has yet to turn its first profit, mainly because it has plowed huge sums of money into marketing and additional software development. But its customers include Hewlett-Packard, International Business Machines, Sun Microsystems and Deutsche Telekom.
 
The Future
Long Way to Go For East Germany
Looking ahead, even the most dedicated optimists acknowledge that eastern Germany's economy has a long way to go. Rural and comparatively poorer states like Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-West Pomerania are recovering much more slowly than fast-growing industrial states like Saxony and Thuringia.
And experts say there simply is no quick solution to the problem of eastern Germany's high costs and wages. Wages in east German factories are higher on average than those in the United States.
Mr. Biedenkopf, Saxony's premier, argues that the worst shocks have been largely absorbed and that prospects are healthier than they seem.
For one thing, the obliteration of eastern Germany's old industry and government is over. Also, the boom in real estate construction in east Germany has receded. Now, after a deep recession, eastern construction is slowly coming back to life.
"Everybody looks at unemployment figures," Mr. Biedenkopf said of the east in a recent interview at his office in Dresden, which overlooks the Elbe River. "But success is measured by employment figures, and in 1998 we had 414 people employed out of 1,000. That is better than most states in the west."
But even people like Mr. Biedenkopf and Mr. Spath say it will be another 10 or 15 years before eastern Germany weans itself from its dependence on money from the west.
Though the German government has pruned back subsidies, western taxpayers still pay a hefty "solidarity surcharge" to help finance eastern reconstruction, pensions and unemployment costs. There no signs the surcharge will be eliminated any time soon.
Eastern Germany remains almost totally dependent on outside investment capital. While west Germans have accumulated enormous savings and real estate, east Germans have almost no money for investment.
"That is the one big difference that remains between east and west Germany, and it will continue to have a major impact here for years to come," Mr. Biedenkopf said.

HEADLINE: Experts Say Microsoft Has Some Points for Appeal

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Although mostly solid, the findings of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in the Microsoft antitrust trial may have been so sweeping as to leave the company room to chip away at them on appeal, some leading antitrust experts say.
The experts say the judge's document is striking in its eloquence in concluding that the big software maker is a monopolist whose anticompetitive tactics have harmed consumers and stifled innovation. 
 But in relentlessly upholding the government and 19 states on point after point, rejecting volumes of the company's written evidence, his findings do appear vulnerable to appellate scrutiny in a couple of areas, they say.
Those points suggest the likely road for Microsoft's legal team and a possible path toward avoiding the harshest sanctions being considered by the government -- like breaking up the company or forcing it to auction off or give away its technology.
Microsoft will not discuss its legal strategy or what it might offer as an olive branch, if any, when its legal team meets with government lawyers in Judge Jackson's chambers in Washington next week.
Yet Microsoft says it believes that Judge Jackson's findings, as damaging as they appear, leave the company some legal openings. On Saturday, in a conference call to worried Wall Street analysts and institutional investors, Microsoft's general counsel, William H. Neukom, was asked repeatedly about an antitrust scholar's comment that the judge's findings "poured a lot of concrete" in the case, analysts who took part said.
"Findings of fact are not bulletproof," insisted Mr. Neukom, according to the analysts.
In fact, an appeals court can toss out portions of Judge Jackson's findings only if it finds them to be "clearly erroneous" -- the legal standard embodied in the federal rules for court procedure. A final opinion, by contrast, is far more subject to being overruled based on differing interpretations of how the antitrust laws apply to the facts of the case.
But one leg of the judge's findings open to challenge, the antitrust experts say, is his conclusion that there is no real consumer benefit or technical efficiency from Microsoft's decision to meld its Internet browsing software with its industry-standard Windows operating system. Microsoft did so, the judge found, only to thwart competition from Internet software.
The government's contention that Microsoft illegally tied its browser to Windows appeared to suffer a severe blow when a federal appeals court ruled in a related case last year that Microsoft should be free to blend its browser into Windows as long as it can make a "plausible claim" of business efficiency or consumer benefit from doing so.
"To say there is no pro-competitive effect of integrating the browser and the operating system is an extreme position because of the appeals court's earlier decision," said Andrew Gavil, a Howard University law professor. "That finding is a live target on appeal."
Another part of the findings of fact that may well be open to challenge, antitrust experts say, is Judge Jackson's rather sweeping assessment of the consumer harm from Microsoft's practices. They point, for example, to the judge's conclusion that "the ultimate result" of Microsoft's practices are that "some future innovations that would truly benefit consumers never occur."
William Kovacic, a professor at the George Washington University law school, observed that Judge Jackson's writing on the harm Microsoft has caused consumers includes "phrases of elegance reminiscent of Learned Hand," referring to the often quoted federal judge. "But the issue for review will be whether those elegant statements are made more by way of assertion than being grounded in the evidence," he said. "I do think that is open to question."
The potential soft spots in Judge Jackson's findings of fact could be significant in any out-of-court settlement talks between Microsoft and the government. The public statements by both Microsoft and the Justice Department and the states suggest a level of acrimony that may make a settlement difficult.
"But if the government recognizes that these findings are not bomb-proof, there could well be a settlement," said George L. Priest, a Yale University law professor.
If there is no settlement, the vulnerable parts of the findings of fact could be important on appeal, mainly to curb the kinds of sanctions that the courts may impose. Antitrust experts do not expect Microsoft to win the case, even on appeal.
"Clearly, what Microsoft is going to try to do is whittle down the mountain," said Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division who is now at the Brookings Institution. But even if Microsoft succeeds in convincing an appeals court that bundling its browser with Windows is not illegal, he added, "there is still an awful lot left."
The antitrust experts say that Judge Jackson's finding of monopoly power -- a crucial first step to winning an antitrust case, but not a violation on its own -- seems unshakable. They also say that the findings do seem to establish that some of Microsoft's contracts with computer makers like Compaq and with Internet service providers like America Online were exclusionary, by unfairly limiting the distribution, promotion and use of competing software.
Microsoft's legal liability, if any, will be determined in the next stage of the case when Judge Jackson issues his conclusions of law, unless there is a settlement. Before the judge rules, Microsoft will offer its view of what legal precedents should apply to his findings of fact, as will the government. Microsoft will argue that some of its actions may look bad, but they did not actually cross the threshold to illegal conduct.
Still, if Microsoft can get parts of the findings set aside, it will face a milder ruling eventually and improve its chances of milder remedies. By shedding the bundling issue and reducing its liability for consumer harm, antitrust experts say, Microsoft may avoid the drastic steps of being broken up or being forced to auction off or license the crown jewel of its intellectual property, Windows.
More moderate sanctions would require significant changes in Microsoft's behavior. But the company has shown some willingness to discuss them in earlier rounds of settlement discussions, according to people close to those talks. One recommendation, they say, is what is known as the "clean Windows license."
This would involve opening up Microsoft's secret contracts with personal computer makers. Microsoft, they say, would have to publish its price lists so that all comparable PC makers pay the same price to license Windows. Volume discounts, as in any business, would be available. But Microsoft's "market development agreements" -- sometimes running over 100 pages -- would have to offer the same terms to all. A key part of the government's case is that PC makers that favored Microsoft software were rewarded with a lower Windows price than those who promoted or distributed the products of Microsoft's rivals.
"It may be regarded as a mild remedy at the moment, but if you look at the judge's findings, so many of Microsoft's transgressions and so much of its ability to abuse its market power goes away with a clean Windows license," said Robert E. Hall, an economist at Stanford University.
The other instrument of Microsoft's control of the industry, according to the government, has been how it has used its technology: giving preferred access to friendly companies and denying access to rivals.
Indeed, the narrative of the government's case begins with Netscape trying to obtain access to the links that enable other companies' programs to run smoothly on the Windows operating system, known as application programming interfaces. Microsoft maintains that it already publishes these and says the notion of "hidden A.P.I.'s" is an industry myth largely created by its rivals.
But one possible sanction mentioned by antitrust experts would be to force Microsoft to publish these technology interfaces to Windows and appoint an independent body to monitor that disclosure. Microsoft has never offered to take such a step in settlement discussions with the government, according to people close to the talks.
Yet antitrust experts say that after Judge Jackson's powerful findings against Microsoft, the company has to put something new on the table, if it has any chance of interesting the government in engaging in serious settlement talks.
"If it's an important part of the political process, a well-administered technology disclosure requirement could make a lot of sense and would not run the risk of doing a lot of economic harm, as the most drastic sanctions would," Mr. Hall of Stanford said.
Microsoft is not saying what it might be willing to do, but providing assured access to its technology would be preferable to being forced to auction it off or give it away. It would still own its own intellectual property, but the terms of access for the rest of the industry would be open and clear cut.

HEADLINE: Paid Parental Leave: Who Gains?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Jerry Jasinowski (Op-Ed, Nov. 10) argues that it is unfair for unemployment insurance money to be used to pay those who take off work to have a baby. He says businesses are already helping parents balance work and family.
Yet a University of Michigan study shows that only 32 percent of businesses not covered by the the Family and Medical Leave Act offer parental leave on similar terms. And many people who are eligible for leave under the law don't take it -- because they can't afford to. 
 Society pays in many ways when parents can't afford to take time off to care for a child. Using surplus unemployment funds to provide income during leave, as Canada has done for years, is a smart way to help parents remain employed.

HEADLINE: Paid Parental Leave: Who Gains?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
There are many arguments against using unemployment insurance to subsidize parental leave (front page, Nov. 8), but one is sufficient: It gives a special privilege to one class of American citizen -- parents -- while denying the same privilege to others. 
 Advocates of paid parental leave say it "would benefit the economy by reducing absenteeism and the need for new parents to go on welfare." Perhaps. But what if I want leave from my job to attend school full time? The same societal benefits could be ascribed to a better educated me. Why am I not also entitled to a cut of the unemployment insurance pie?
I wish all parents well. But having a child is a personal choice -- one that is no more worthy of a special subsidy than a number of other aspirations.

HEADLINE: Talks on China Trade Deal In Peril, the U.S. Side Says

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Friday, Nov. 12

 BODY:
American officials expressed a sudden pessimism today about the prospects for a long-sought deal to get China into the World Trade Organization.
In a curt statement issued to reporters this morning, Charlene Barshefsky, the chief trade negotiator for the United States, said: "We came hoping to make progress. We are discouraged that progress has not been made at this point. The clock has nearly run out." 
 The turn came the morning after Chinese officials had asked President Clinton's negotiators to remain in Beijing at least one more day to continue talks on how far China must open its markets to qualify for membership in the trade organization.
Only hours before they issued the statement, American officials had sounded upbeat about the previous two days of talks here. It was not immediately clear whether Ms. Barshefsky issued the severe statement as a last-minute pressure tactic or whether the talks were collapsing.
During the talks this week, which included detailed discussions of specific trade issues in working groups, the United States presented China with an overall package of proposals.
"So far, the Chinese haven't shown any willingness to make a deal," an American official said late this morning, describing the growing frustration of American negotiators here. "It's across the board."
Ms. Barshefsky's public statement came after the Chinese postponed a meeting scheduled for 9 a.m. today. The Americans now plan to leave on Saturday, they say, after a final effort to learn whether the Chinese will come around at the last minute, or whether their position has seriously slipped from where it was last April, when Prime Minister Zhu Rongji visited Washington.
The Chinese are reluctant to open markets as fast as the United States and other Western countries demand, fearing the short-term unemployment and dislocations that outside competition could bring.
In an interview on Thursday, a senior government economist, Ji Chongwei, said: "If the United States can lower its demands this time, then there is likely to be an agreement. I hope the United States can be patient and understand the reality in China."
But President Clinton is under pressure from Congress and American companies to hold China to stringent requirements for opening its markets, as well as to protect American textile producers from sudden increases in imports from China.
President Clinton, speaking at the White House on Thursday, said, "When I know we have got an agreement or whether we haven't, I'll let you know." Mr. Clinton was described by aides as deeply involved in the talks, which are being held here by Ms. Barshefsky and the director of the National Economic Council, Gene Sperling.
After years of fumbling efforts, China and the United States, for political as well as economic reasons, want to achieve China's entry into the W.T.O., which sets trade rules and adjudicates trade disputes among countries. A breakdown would cast a sour note in bilateral relations, as China accuses the United States of holding it to punitive standards.
A deal was nearly struck in April, but President Clinton decided that China's concessions were insufficient to pass Congressional scrutiny.
Now the negotiations appear to be centered on a handful of major issues, including the rights of American companies to take majority stakes in Chinese companies, American restrictions on the import of Chinese textiles and whether the United States could unilaterally ban some Chinese products if it concludes that China is violating its commitments.
On Wednesday, working groups met here on specific topics, such as the right of foreign businesses to invest in -- and take control of -- Chinese banking, telecommunications and other companies. Prime Minister Zhu offered such openings in April, but the Chinese government has been under pressure to back off on some of the concessions to protect local industries and workers.
China hopes to gain entry soon into the trade organization, which now has 134 members, so it can participate in a new round of global trade talks that begin Nov. 30 in Seattle. It must first reach bilateral accords with major trading partners.
At the time of the April negotiations, the American trade office released a description of Mr. Zhu's concessions, apparently hoping to build support among American businesses. The release did elicit such support, but in China it caused a firestorm, in part because some affected ministries had not signed off on Mr. Zhu's concessions.

HEADLINE: EX-INDONESIA CHIEF GETS PARDON VOW

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 11

 BODY:
The new president of Indonesia said here tonight that he had decided to pardon the nation's former leader, President Suharto, if Mr. Suharto is convicted of crimes as a result of an investigation into whether he and his family stole billions of dollars from the government.
President Abdurrahman Wahid insisted, however, that the corruption investigation would go forward, that Mr. Suharto would be pardoned only after a trial, and that the former leader's children and his friends would not be treated with similar leniency. 
 "Once he is found guilty in a court, then we will pardon him, because he was our president," President Wahid told a group of American business leaders and diplomats. "But not the rest of his family. This is very important. Not the family and not the cronies."
Mr. Wahid, a respected Islamic cleric who was elected last month after the freest balloting in decades in the world's fourth most populous nation, said he would also pardon his immediate predecessor, B. J. Habibie, should Mr. Habibie be accused of any crime.
Mr. Wahid's comments came on the eve of a White House meeting with President Clinton.
Mr. Suharto, 78, ruled Indonesia for 32 years. He and his children have been accused of stashing billions of dollars overseas, a charge that Mr. Suharto has denied. Still, corruption by the Suharto family and its friends is widely believed to have distorted the Indonesian economy, and allegations of such large-scale diversions of riches contributed to a wave of public fury that drove him from office in May 1998.
While the decision to pardon Mr. Suharto seems almost certain to be criticized by human rights advocates and others who have urged that the former president be brought to justice, it could short-circuit threats posed to Mr. Wahid's democratically elected government by Mr. Suharto's remaining allies within the powerful military.
In characteristically blunt comments, President Wahid acknowledged that his relationship with the military was problematic. "The idea of the supremacy of the civilians -- this is very important," he said. "But please remember, we are in a difficult position."
President Wahid said he believed that Mr. Suharto had indeed hidden vast amounts of money abroad. "He is richer than the state even," Mr. Wahid said at a meeting organized by the U.S.-Indonesia Society and the U.S.-Asean Business Council.
But he said President Suharto had been clever to hide his assets abroad under the names of his children and his friends, suggesting that it might be difficult to convict him of corruption. "The problem is that he stashed all the money abroad in the names of his cronies, his family -- not himself," President Wahid said.
Mr. Wahid's government announced late last month that it would reopen the Suharto inquiry that had been dropped as one of the final acts of Mr. Habibie's government.
The assignment was given to the new Attorney General, Marzuki Darusman, a former human rights commissioner who was an opponent of Mr. Suharto. The investigation is expected to focus on a complex of purportedly charitable foundations controlled by the Suharto family. Critics of the former president have long charged that the foundations were used to launder billions of dollars in bribes and other money stolen from the treasury.
In an apparent slip of the tongue, Mr. Wahid said, "I have instructed the attorney general to convict him," but then amended that to say, "to determine whether he's guilty or not."
Mr. Wahid is one of the few prominent political figures in Indonesia who are not tainted by allegations of corruption.
While he did not say so explicitly, the new president seemed to suggest that he still hoped to recover much of the money that may have been stolen -- if not from Mr. Suharto directly, then through his many wealthy children.
"His children are so rich they can pay the budget," Mr. Wahid said.
During the meeting tonight with senior American diplomats and executives of prominent American companies doing business in Indonesia, Mr. Wahid said the Indonesian economy was in "shambles" as a result of the Asian economic crisis.
He said he would ask President Clinton for continuing economic assistance and for help in establishing the rule of law in Indonesia, a nation that has known corrupt authoritarianism for most of its modern history.
"We were controlled by a government that looked after its own interests, not the interests of the people," he said. "We want to say to the American people, please help us in obtaining a good government -- an open one, an honest one."

HEADLINE: City Unions Shift Strategy On Bargaining

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Unhappy with their current contracts, leaders of New York City's municipal unions said yesterday that they would use new bargaining tactics that they hoped would help them overcome the Giuliani administration's past success in holding down wage increases.
The unions hope to negotiate their contracts one by one, starting with the teachers and the police officers, two powerful unions that are expected to make the strongest cases for large pay increases. The strategy would break a practice known as pattern bargaining, under which each of the city's municipal unions have for the last quarter century agreed to accept the same annual wage increases. 
 In theory, the new approach -- developed by the Municipal Labor Committee, a coalition of 75 unions representing nearly 300,000 city workers -- would improve the bargaining position of both large and small unions. The teachers and the police would be able to argue that big wage increases were needed to stem a debilitating flight of their members to the suburbs, while the weaker unions would try to piggyback on the stronger unions' success.
In past years, the city often maneuvered to begin talks with a weak union or a political ally in the hope of granting only a low wage increase that then set the pattern for all other unions.
"The problem with pattern bargaining," said Norman Seabrook, president of the Correction Officers' Benevolent Association, "is if the city grabs one union leader and that leader folds under pressure, it can possibly ruin it for hundreds of thousands of hard-working union people in this city."
City Hall officials said yesterday that they would reject the union's new approach, insisting that the traditional practice of pattern bargaining was fairest for the city and its unions.
Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine, who is the mayor's chief labor negotiator, asserted that a piecemeal approach could make it extremely difficult for the city to reach agreements with every union and could enrage unions that end up with smaller pay increases than their counterparts.
"We're going to engage in pattern bargaining -- that's the only way that makes sense," Mr. Levine said. "It's more fair."
The municipal unions are calling their new approach "coordinated bargaining." Under this strategy, while unions negotiate individually, they would keep in close touch with other union leaders, who would advise them on what is an acceptable wage increase.
"This coordinated approach is different from everybody going it alone and it's different from coalition bargaining," said Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers and chairwoman of the Municipal Labor Committee. "The city's unions need to represent their members in different ways. Their members have different needs. The teachers have competitiveness issues with the suburbs. The police have competitiveness issues with the suburbs."
Representatives of all 75 municipal unions are scheduled to hold a conference in Princeton, N.J., this weekend to flesh out the negotiating strategy and sketch out specific demands. One proposal on the agenda is levying a special assessment on union members to finance an advertising campaign that would seek to line up public support for the municipal workers.
In an unusual move, 20 municipal union leaders have signed what they are calling a compact in which they pledge that when negotiating individually, they will not accept certain unsatisfactory terms. Probably the most important pledge in the compact is to accept only contracts that contain a substantial increase in base pay, which would not be linked to any increase in productivity.
"Our people have suffered long enough, and their sacrifices helped create the city's budget surplus," said Lee Saunders, chief administrator of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which represents 125,000 city workers. "The city is flush with money right now. What we're trying to do is get a fair piece of the economic pot. And we want to do that without having to tie an increase in base pay to productivity."
But Mr. Levine said the mayor would demand, as he has in the past, that any wage increases be accompanied by union pledges to increase productivity. "The mayor," Mr. Levine said, "has said over and over again that our position going into these negotiations is raises will be funded by labor productivity."
The unions embraced the new strategy after many members felt widespread disgust with the last round of contract negotiations, which were led by Stanley Hill, a close ally of the mayor who was executive director of District Council 37.
Other unions criticized Mr. Hill for accepting a contract that contained an unpopular two-year wage freeze and for not having stopped widespread vote-rigging that clinched the ratification of the contract and set a pattern for other unions. Mr. Hill, who was ousted by his parent union, has denied participation in or knowledge of the vote fraud, to which two of his top aides have pleaded guilty.
The current five-year contract, which expires next year for most city workers, contains the two-year wage freeze initially and a 13 percent raise over the last three years.
Unlike New York, most American cities do not have pattern bargaining. Normally the teachers negotiate one contract, another is negotiated by the uniformed unions, including the police and firefighters, and the union representing nonuniformed workers, like social workers, negotiates still another.
While the unions might look to what the others get, the raises in their contracts are not in lock step with each other.
Union officials said the lack of pattern bargaining in other cities has not created major union frictions or political problems because unions there do not expect carbon-copy wage increases.
Ms. Weingarten said the new approach was intended to make sure that City Hall did not dictate how bargaining was conducted. It also aims, she said, to accommodate weaker unions while giving flexibility to larger unions that have fallen behind their suburban counterparts. "In the past," she said, "lock step rigidity has hurt recruitment and retention not just with teachers, but with police and librarians."
Several union leaders said they would not be surprised if the new strategy were to turn into pattern bargaining, especially if the first union to secure a contract obtained a hefty wage increase.
One question that leaders of several smaller unions had was what would happen if the city awarded the police a 16 percent raise over four years to help them catch up with salaries for officers in the suburbs while insisting on only an 8 percent increase over four years for weaker, smaller unions.
Arthur Cheliotes, president of a Communications Workers Local 1180, which represents city middle managers, said, "Then we'd say, 'You've established a pattern. You always said you wanted pattern bargaining, so why are you now wanting to break pattern bargaining?' We'd say, 'If you don't match it, let's take it to arbitration.' Historically, arbitrators have usually followed what other unions obtained."
But, several unions leaders acknowledged, if the first union to negotiate received a small wage increase, other city unions would reject pattern bargaining.

HEADLINE: While Mrs. Clinton Looks On, Palestinian Officials Criticize Israel

BYLINE: By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr. 

DATELINE: RAMALLAH, West Bank, Nov. 11

 BODY:
In a return visit to Palestinian territory today, Hillary Rodham Clinton was acclaimed anew as a champion of Palestinian nationhood, and then listened with visible discomfort as her hosts at a health care function here excoriated Israel for its alleged toxic contamination of Palestinian air and water.
Going furthest of all was the other first lady in the room: Suha Arafat, the wife of the Palestinian Authority president, who in a rare public address contended that the Israeli military had routinely used carcinogenic crowd-control gases in Gaza and the West Bank, creating a severe public health problem. 
 "Our people have been subjected to the daily intensive use of poisonous gas by the Israeli forces, which have led to an increase in cancer cases among women and children," Mrs. Arafat asserted.
Her comment sparked an immediate uproar in Israel, with opposition legislators demanding a retaliatory halt to planned West Bank troop withdrawals. Prime Minister Ehud Barak issued his own swift denunciation.
"These comments have no connection to reality, and it would have been better if they would have never been said," the prime minister's office said.
"Poisoning the public atmosphere does not help in bringing about success in these negotiations," the statement added.
On the second day of her tour in the Middle East, Mrs. Clinton, the first lady and presumptive senatorial candidate, who has tried hard to avoid such controversy in her regional tour, was unavoidably in the middle of it all.
The day began peaceably enough, with a Jerusalem hotel breakfast with Nava Barak, the prime minister's wife, and Reuma Weizman, the Israeli president's wife. With her daughter, Chelsea, and the Baraks' daughter Michal, Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Barak spent 90 minutes viewing new exhibits and laying a wreath at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial and museum.
And after her two-hour foray into Palestinian territory, she returned to a cordial but uneventful celebrity's welcome at the Western Wall in the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem's Old City. Chaim and Libby Friedman, a vacationing Orthodox couple from Rockland County, watched as Mrs. Clinton headed toward the segregated women's section of the wall with Mrs. Barak, their daughters and a sunglassed phalanx of Secret Service and Shin Bet bodyguards.
"I don't know what her politics are," mused Mr. Friedman as the entourage passed. Commenting on Mrs. Clinton's likely opponent in the Senate race, he said, "Giuliani is tough. You know what he stands for." But Mrs. Friedman followed Mrs. Clinton to the wall, chatted with the her and returned to pronounce her "a nice person." Mr. Friedman did not disagree: "She comes across very well," he said.
As Mrs. Clinton frequently noted during her 30-hour tour here, this was her fifth visit to Israel, and the fourth since she moved into the White House. But her intimate knowledge of Israeli and Palestinian politics did not make it any easier to bridge the short but sharp divide between Ramallah and Jerusalem.
Stopping in Ramallah to announce a $3.8 million U.S.-financed maternal care program, Mrs. Clinton was greeted with a consistent message: It takes an independent state to raise a healthy child, Palestinian officials insisted. Calling "the legacy of three decades of Israeli occupation" one of environmental despoliation and rampant disease, they argued that only sovereignty and Israeli withdrawal would allow Palestinians to remedy their medical problems.
Mrs. Clinton, in remarks at the opening of the program here, had herself stressed the acute health care needs in the West Bank and Gaza. Fewer than half of the area's expectant mothers receive any prenatal care, she said.
But she devoted most of her brief address to the peace negotiations that were renewed here in Ramallah this morning. "This visit is particularly meaningful to me because today the Palestinian and Israeli people are at a crossroads, ready to take the hard decisions necessary for a just and lasting peace," she said.
Then, in what turned into a hard-edged West Bank version of the "listening tours" she conducted as a prospective Senate candidate in New York, Mrs. Clinton sat mute as public health professionals alternated attacks on Israel with effusive praise for her 1998 remark favoring an eventual Palestinian state.
"I would like to remind you of the words that you said to Israeli and Palestinian children," said Jihad Mashal, the Palestinian health minister. "Words that are inscribed in the hearts of all Palestinians, when you told them that the path to a just and real peace is the establishment of a Palestinian state."
What Mrs. Clinton actually said regarding Palestinian statehood last year -- in a spontaneous comment she never retracted -- was a more nuanced call for Palestinians to assume responsibility for their destiny.
Speaking to an international gathering of teenagers in Europe, Mrs. Clinton had stated in response to a question that it was "in the longterm interests of the Middle East for Palestine to be a state and for it to be a state that is responsible for its citizens' well-being, a state that has responsibility for providing education and health care and economic opportunity to its citizens, a state that has to accept the responsibility of governing."
In Israel itself, most cabinet ministers acknowledge that they see Palestinian independence as an inevitability. The real statehood issues are ones of terms and timing.
But Mrs. Clinton's statement has been viewed as a political problem in New York. And it created a sensation among Palestinians.
The remarks made by Palestinian officials today touched off even more criticism hours later, with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's aides in New York chiding Mrs. Clinton for not confronting Mrs. Arafat. The fallout prompted Mrs. Clinton's office to offer a written statement by the first lady: "What was said today in Ramallah is an example of why the president at Oslo urged the parties to refrain from making inflammatory charges or engaging in excessive rhetoric and to deal with any issues at the negotiating table."
Mrs. Clinton's other recent statement on local sovereignty controversies seemed unfamiliar to Palestinian officials in Ramallah today: her letter to Orthodox leaders in New York in July supporting Jerusalem's status as Israel's "eternal and indivisible" capital. Yet they pointedly reiterated the longstanding Palestinian demand for a state incorporating Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem, including all of the Old City. 
"The next time I hope we will host you in our homeland in our capital, Jerusalem," said Mr. Mashal.
Minutes later, Mrs. Clinton kissed Mrs. Arafat goodbye and departed for Jerusalem.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about a visit by Hillary Rodham Clinton to the West Bank misidentified the Palestinian health minister, who said to Mrs. Clinton at a gathering of public health officials: "I would like to remind you of the words that you said to Israeli and Palestinian children. Words that are inscribed in the hearts of all Palestinians, when you told them that the path to a just and real peace is the establishment of a Palestinian state." The minister is Dr. Riad Zanoun. (Jihad Mashal, who also spoke, is an official of a nongovernmental Palestinian health care organization.)

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Financial Companies Lead in a Broad Advance of Prices

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday, led by financial shares including American Express and Citigroup, after a government report on productivity eased investors' concerns that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates for a third time this year when policy makers meet on Tuesday.
The Nasdaq composite index rose to its 10th record in 11 sessions. 
 "It's another bit of evidence that the Fed won't raise interest rates, and it's good for equities," said Guy Truicko, who helps manage $1 billion for Unity Management in Garden City, N.Y. "The financials are ready to make another move. It's happening today, and I suspect it will continue after the Fed gets out of the way."
The Nasdaq index, rebounding from a 72-point loss, rose 23.86 points, or seven-tenths of a percent, to close at 3,221.15, as Qualcomm soared on a favorable report from a J. P. Morgan Securities analyst.
The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 174.02 points, or 1.6 percent, to 10,769.32, its biggest gain in two weeks. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 14.60 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,396.06. Seventeen stocks rose for every 13 that fell on the New York Stock Exchange.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 26/32, to 101 10/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.03 percent from 6.09 percent on Thursday.
Financial companies rose after the Labor Department reported that worker productivity was up more than expected in the third quarter and labor costs grew at a slower rate. The report may persuade the Fed to keep interest rates steady at the meeting on Tuesday. Stable or falling interest rates increase the value of financial companies' bond portfolios and can increase business for lenders.
The central bank raised its target rate for overnight loans between banks by a quarter of a point in both June and August. The federal funds target is now 5.25 percent.
American Express climbed 8 1/2 yesterday, to 154 1/4. J. P. Morgan gained 6 9/16, to 139 5/16, and General Electric, whose GE Capital is the largest nonbank finance company, advanced 1 3/8, to 135 3/8. Citigroup, the largest financial services company, led the S.& P. 500 higher, rising 2 3/4, to 54 7/8.
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company jumped 7 11/16, to 120. The big underwriter for initial stock sales advised United Parcel Service Inc. on its $5.47 billion stock sale on Wednesday. U.P.S. fell 3 7/8, to 70 1/8, retreating from the 50 percent gain it had in the first two days of trading.
Merrill Lynch, the biggest United States brokerage firm, jumped 7 11/16, to 83 3/16.
The Finisar Corporation, which makes fiber optic systems that permit high-speed data communications over computer networks, more than quadrupled in its first day of trading after an initial stock sale. Shares of the company rose 67 7/8, to 86 7/8. The shares opened at 95, giving the company a market value of $4.76 billion.
Qualcomm, a developer of cellular-phone technology, jumped 32 13/32 to 377 7/8, after an analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities, Gregory Geiling, raised his forecast on the stock price.
Mr. Geiling said in a report that he expected Qualcomm to reach $460 in the next 12 months, an increase from his previous prediction of $315, because the future sale of Qualcomm's phone business will help the company increase profits from its cellular-phone technology.
The Nasdaq was lower for much of the day, depressed by Intel, the computer-chip maker. The stock fell 3 3/16, to 76 3/16, after a Merrill Lynch analyst, Joseph Osha, cut his rating on concern that Intel faces stiffer competition from Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
Mr. Osha lowered his near-term rating on Intel to "accumulate" from "buy" and said the stock could reach $90 in 12 months, down from his previous estimate of $100. Advanced Micro said yesterday that it might break even in the fourth quarter on increased demand for its new Athlon chip, which competes with Intel's Pentium III processor. Advanced Micro shares closed down 1 5/8, at 26 9/16, after jumping 5 1/4.
Other semiconductor makers fell with Intel. Texas Instruments lost 11/16, to 100 3/4, and Micron Technology dropped 2, to 73 1/2.
Dell Computer, the direct seller of personal computers, fell 1 11/16, to 41 13/16, after reporting revenue growth that fell short of analysts' expectations.

HEADLINE: Year 2000 Insurance Is Hot on Wall St., but Not as a Sign of Fear

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Year 2000 insurance has been the hottest-selling item on Wall Street recently. And its popularity is one reason investors are less concerned than they were a few months ago about possible disruptions in business and trading when computers make the internal change to the new year.
To help ensure that cash will be readily available even if the changeover disrupts the financial system, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has been holding weekly auctions of options that will guarantee the availability of billions of dollars from Dec. 23 to Jan 12. 
 In just four weeks, the Fed has sold $306 billion of the options and has at least three more auctions planned. The amount paid for the insurance so far is just $4.9 million, a small price in markets where trillions are traded.
Other barometers also indicate that institutional and individual investors have been somewhat reassured leading up to the Century Date Change -- the Federal Reserve's preferred nomenclature for what is commonly referred to as the Y2K problem. Because of a design problem that may render computers unable to recognize "00" as 2000 when the new year rolls in, patchwork efforts have been made across all types of business and government, but the real test will come on Jan. 1.
Many Fed analysts had suggested this summer that central bank policy makers would not even consider raising short-term interest rates in November because higher rates could intensify any problems at the end of the year. But that view has changed. "Fears have subsided," said Bruce Steinberg, the chief economist of Merrill Lynch, who is now expecting a rate increase when the Fed meets on Tuesday.
Though risky securities usually command a higher yield than Treasury securities, which are backed by the government, the differences in those yields grew earlier this year. Recently, however, those spreads have narrowed, indicating that investors are willing to take on more risk even as the year draws to a close.
Stock prices, meanwhile, have continued to rise. Consumers are still buying big-ticket items, like automobiles. Mutual fund flows hint of no significant Year 2000 concern. And the fund company T. Rowe Price found in a recent survey that only one in 10 of its fund customers expected to alter investment strategy because of such concerns.
There was a rush this summer to buy the first six-month Treasury bills that mature in January 2000, so that proceeds could be invested after Jan. 1, but no rush this fall when the first three-month Treasury bills maturing in 2000 became available.
Investors have also taken advantage of opportunities created by the heightened concern earlier this year. Paul DeRosa, a partner at Mount Lucas Management, an asset management company in Princeton, N.J., bought mortgage-backed securities in early August when the spread between these securities and Treasuries was abnormally wide. The wide spread reflected, in part, a preference for Treasury securities, which would be much easier to buy and sell than mortgage-backed securities in a crisis. The spread has since narrowed, bringing Mr. DeRosa a profit.
Even Edward J. Yardeni, the chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities who has long warned of a Year 2000 recession because of the date change, is moderating his view.
"It doesn't look as though Y2K will slow down consumer demand as much as I thought," Mr. Yardeni said, adding that he would have to revise upward his fourth-quarter United States growth forecast, which has been just one-half percent.
"I probably will be one of the happiest people on the planet if nothing happens, since I'm worrying so much about it," he said. Still, he added that he had been "quite surprised by the increasing complacency."
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, says that intense preparations for the Year 2000 are paying off. "The good news," he said in a speech last month, "is that evidence is becoming more persuasive that our electronic infrastructure will be ready for the Century Date Change. The public's understanding of the degree of our Y2K readiness also has grown, and fears of widespread disruptions around the C.D.C. appear to be waning, though we are not as yet home free."
Whether the additional money is needed or not, the Fed's insurance program, which was announced in October, is doing at least part of its job. "It adds a level of comfort to the environment," said Paul Scheufele, managing director for liability management at Credit Suisse First Boston.
The insurance, sold through primary dealers in the Treasury market, is intended to assure that cash is available to keep fixed-income markets working smoothly, even in case of computer problems.
Primary dealers are the center of the repo market, where securities, like Treasuries, are traded for cash to meet the short-term needs of Wall Street firms, banks, mutual funds, hedge funds and corporations. The cash can be borrowed for as short a period as overnight and is a major means of financing the bets made in the fixed-income market. If Year 2000 problems send repo interest rates soaring, this market could dry up, with damaging ripples through the entire fixed-income market.
Primary dealers say the option insurance costs $15,000 to $30,000 per billion dollars, depending on the week covered. The most expensive is for the week beginning Thursday, Dec. 30, which includes the turn of the year. Options are also available for the week before and the week after. An option gives the dealer access to its face value in cash in exchange for securities as collateral. The interest rate is 1.5 percentage points over the target rate then for federal funds, now 5.25 percent.
The insurance would help if mutual funds or corporations suddenly had trouble borrowing. A mutual fund might need money to cover withdrawals at the end of the year, while a corporation might need money to cover a dividend payment.
"It insures that if we need cash, we would have the ability to get it," said David Sylvester, who runs the Stagecoach and Norwest Advantage money market funds for Wells Capital Management, a unit of Wells Fargo.
If a settlement problem arose in the repo market, making it more difficult for cash to move through the system, Mr. Scheufele said, the insurance options could be exercised to provide the funds.
Fear of the unknown could also make primary dealers reluctant to lend at the end of the year. But with this insurance, primary dealers know their maximum cost of borrowing -- 1.5 percentage points over the federal funds rate target.
"I am more comfortable lending out over the year end to my customers," Mr. Scheufele said.
Most important, primary dealers, who borrow heavily themselves to make their bets, will have the cash they need. Without this source of cash they might be forced to sell holdings, from Treasuries to mortgage-backed securities, to meet their obligations. Such dumping could prompt a marketwide selloff, cause panic among many investors and lead to gridlock in the fixed-income markets. It happened in 1998 after Russia defaulted on its debt and a major hedge fund nearly collapsed. The Federal Reserve ultimately cut its short-term interest rate three-quarters of a percentage point to ease the strain on the virtually frozen bond market.
The idea of the program, said Joe Blauvelt, the managing director responsible for the finance desk at J. P. Morgan Securities, is for the Fed to "gauge what kind of trading volatility people expect and then alleviate some of that pressure by offering more of the insurance options to the dealers." This is why the Fed has expanded the program from five auctions to seven and why the amount offered has increased with each auction.
But the stampede for the options is not a sign of pervasive fear, just another relatively inexpensive precaution.
"This is a no-brainer," Mr. Blauvelt said. "We are buying insurance in case the repo market goes away."
It is also good for job security, added Paul Thomas, head of government securities sales and trading at Merrill Lynch. "Knowing that this insurance was available, an individual cannot afford to walk into his boss's office at the end of the year and say we can't get cash," he said.
Among the signs of continued concern is a buildup in business inventories. Manufacturing inventories shot up in October, according to the National Association of Purchasing Management, indicating that executives are worried about getting deliveries of products early in the new year. At 51.1, the index reading in October was the first over 50 since November 1988.
And while some Year 2000 fears from last summer are easing, some new ones are turning up.
Money market fund managers were worried last summer about having enough cash to meet withdrawals near the end of the year. Now, they may have too much cash.
Mr. Sylvester, the fund manager, said it was now possible that money would pour into the bigger funds in December from midsize companies and local governments with cash on hand. So he will need places to invest his extra cash. And he has already made arrangements with primary dealers, who are willing to do so because they expect the Fed insurance program to help keep the repo market working smoothly.

HEADLINE: Is the Dollar Leaving Canada Feeling Drained?;
Capital Is Fleeing to the South As U.S. Companies Look North

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
Twenty years ago, when an outside company tried to buy MacMillan Bloedel, British Columbia's largest timber company, the provincial premier reacted angrily, saying: "B.C. is not for sale."
But on Nov. 1, MacMillan, an 80-year-old Canadian company, disappeared into the corporate maw of Weyerhaeuser in a deal worth $2.4 billion. Approval of the takeover came this summer from the Provincial Forestry Minister, David Zirnhelt, who said, "Icons don't make jobs." 
 Taking advantage of a neighboring economy newly open to foreign investment and a Canadian dollar trading near historic lows, Americans are vacuuming up Canadian companies at a record pace. In the first nine months of this year, American companies bought 181 companies for $24 billion, double the amount spent during the corresponding period last year, according to a survey by KPMG Corporate Finance.
"Canada has a 'for sale' sign on the lawn, courtesy of a very cheap exchange rate," said David Rosenberg, a senior economist at Nesbitt Burns, a major securities firm in Toronto. Although the Canadian dollar has strengthened slightly this year to 68 American cents, Canadian companies still seem cheap to American executives who remember the days in the 1960's when North America's two dollars were equal in value.
Today, American investors are also plunging into Canadian stocks. In the first seven months of this year, Americans increased their Canadian stockholdings by $6.5 billion, a sevenfold increase over the corresponding period two years ago. More American investment is on the way, according to 23 American portfolio managers surveyed in October about the Canadian markets by Broadgate Consultants, a capital markets communications firm.
"All of the investors surveyed said they would increase or maintain their Canadian positions over the next 12 months," John Silver, a Broadgate managing director, said from New York. "What caught my eye was the incredible amount of good will that American portfolio managers had toward Canadian companies."
Oddly, while Americans are investing heavily in Canadian stocks and companies, Canadians are funneling their money across the border in volumes evocative of capital flight from Latin America.
As of August, Canadians had, for the first time on record, more money invested in foreign stock markets than in Canadian markets, according to data compiled by Statistics Canada, a government agency.
Investing largely in American shares, Canadians now own at least $57 billion of foreign stocks -- almost $2,000 for each Canadian citizen. This drain has taken place despite tax credits for owning local stocks and a government-mandated 20 percent cap on foreign investments for registered retirement plans.
And while Canada's economy is only 7 percent the size of its southern neighbor, Canada has become the fourth-largest direct foreign investor in the United States. Last year, Canada, with 30 million inhabitants, had $87 billion invested in real assets in the United States. The United States, with nine times Canada's population, had $99.3 billion invested directly in Canada. During much of the 1990's, Canadian investment abroad increased at twice the rate as foreign investment here.
"It's fair to call it capital flight," Mr. Rosenberg said. "The irony is that while Canadians have become net sellers of Canadian-based mutual funds, foreigners have been dramatically lifting their investments in Canada."
And now, with oil and gasoline prices rising sharply this year and an Asian recovery fueling demand for minerals and wood products, those bets are starting to pay off as prospects improve for Canada's economy, which is heavily dependent on natural resources. Compared with last year, when the Toronto Stock Exchange 300, the market's main index, dropped 3 percent, the index has outperformed the equivalent in the United States, the Standard & Poor's 500, so far this year, rising 16.04 percent, compared with 13.57 percent.
"Everyone is looking for undiscovered stocks, which the rest of the marketplace has not discovered," Mr. Silver said of American interest in Canadian companies.
Yet after watching the Canadian dollar shrink by a third in value, Canadians are leery of investing in their own country.
Canadians tend to dwell on their economic negatives, especially the $50 billion a year in taxes that goes every year to service federal and provincial debts. Largely because of these interest payments, Canada's tax revenue equals 37 percent of its gross domestic product, compared with 32 percent for federal, state and local taxes in the United States.
Partly because of this higher tax burden, Canada's unemployment rate is 7.2 percent, well above the 4.1 percent rate in the United States. And Canada, in contrast to the United States, has not registered growth in real personal income during the 1990's. As the "brain drain" becomes a national conversation topic, half of 1,850 senior Canadian executives agreed in a recent survey with the statement: "Talented people are leaving the country due to high income taxes."
But, after budget cutting, the federal government here recorded a $2 billion surplus last year, which is expected to rise to nearly $4 billion this year. After lagging behind the United States during much of the 1990's, Canada is expected to equal the forecast of a 4 percent American growth rate this year. With budget surpluses expected to grow in coming years, businesspeople are lobbying heavily to use them to cut taxes and to pay down the $392 billion national debt.
Although Canada increased its total take in personal and corporate income taxes by 39 percent over the last five years, Paul Martin, the Finance Minister, vowed in a policy speech earlier this month to cut taxes in coming years.
Meanwhile, to American investors, a growing economy, an undervalued market, and a currency that appears to have stabilized are signals to buy.
AT&T and Ameritech this year bought up to the 20 percent limit on foreign ownership of Canadian telecommunications companies.
"There is more and more U.S. investment," said Bruce McWilliam, a lawyer here specializing in foreign investment in such companies. Referring to the 20 percent limits on foreign investment in banking, telecommunications and transport, he said, "They always want to try to come up to the limits of what is allowed under foreign investment rules."
In the finance sector, the CIT Group, a Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank unit based in Livingston, N.J., agreed in late October to pay $2.7 billion for the Newcourt Credit Group, a growing commercial finance company based in Toronto.
In western Canada's oil patch, two Houston companies are making big purchases. Burlington Resources is paying $1.9 billion for Poco Petroleums of Calgary, and Apache is paying $531 million for most of Shell Canada Ltd.'s oil producing properties. Shell is a unit of Royal Dutch/ Shell.
As some see it, in the oil and gas business -- and many other industries as well -- the border between the United States and Canada is being erased.
"The 49th parallel is gone -- just look at the deals," said Rick Roberge, a petroleum analyst with PricewaterhouseCoopers. Mr. Roberge, an Albertan who now works in mergers and acquisitions in Houston, also noted that Canadian energy companies had made purchases of American companies.
Fueling the activity, he said, was a 50 percent jump in natural gas prices since spring and the expected opening next year of a gas pipeline from western Canada to Chicago.
Interest in Canada has extended to the aviation industry. AMR, the parent of American Airlines, and UAL, parent of United Airlines, marshaled rival bids of about half a billion dollars each in an effort help Canadian allies wrest control of Canada's two major airlines. United and its partner, Air Canada, emerged as the winners this month after an American-backed bid was disbanded.
All these American investments in Canada, like those Canadians are making in the United States, reflect North America's rapid economic integration.
In the biggest deal on the part of Canadians in the United States, Canadian National Railway paid $2.4 billion this summer for Illinois Central. Building on an explosion in north-south trade after a free trade pact was signed a decade ago, the expanded railroad will carry freight from Canada to Chicago and on to New Orleans. In another major deal, Nortel Networks of Toronto, a unit of Northern Telecom and Canada's largest supplier of telephone equipment, agreed in mid-October to pay $2.1 billion for Clarify, an e-commerce software company based in San Jose, Calif.
And in a deal that makes Quebecor Printing the world's largest commercial printer, the Montreal-based company paid $1.4 billion for a major American rival, World Color Press, of Greenwich, Conn.
Despite this evidence of a two-way street, many people here focus on what they call the threatened loss of their sports icons -- professional hockey, basketball and baseball teams coveted by wealthy American investors. Bill Laurie, a St. Louis billionaire, for example, has been negotiating to buy the Vancouver Grizzlies basketball team.
Some commentators fear that Canadian National Hockey League teams are next.
"The Ottawa Senators will be first," Jeffrey Simpson, a columnist at The Globe and Mail newspaper in Toronto, predicted recently. "Within a year or two, or perhaps even sooner, the Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers and Vancouver Canucks will follow, leaving Canada with only the Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens."
Although the percentage of Canada's economy controlled by foreign companies is actually lower today than during the nationalist days of the 1970's, Canadian newspapers carry laments about some of the high-profile purchases.
"The great sucking sound from the south is creating a storm of troubles," Eric Reguly, a columnist, warned in a recent Globe and Mail article titled "The devouring of corporate Canada."
"The trend is depressingly familiar," he wrote. "A Canadian company grows, often with the tender loving care of the provincial and federal governments, gets big enough to attract attention on the international stage and -- zap! -- vanishes like a bug into a frog's mouth."
Fearing that Canada is losing corporate headquarters, he noted that Alcan Aluminium was merging with two rivals and setting up a head office in New York. The big American buyout was the topic of a speech delivered in September by David P. O'Brien, president of Canadian Pacific Ltd., before the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, the nation's largest business association.
"Canadian icons are falling like tenpins," said Mr. O'Brien, who is also chairman of the Business Council on National Issues, a private policy group. "The great Canadian fire sale is under way. Because of the low Canadian dollar, corporate Canada is easy pickings for countries with stronger currencies."
But few people predict a return to the restrictive investment policies of the 1970's.
"I don't necessarily like each and every one of those transactions, but this is part and parcel of the integration of North America," Raymond Chretien, Canada's ambassador to the United States, said in an interview in Washington. "It worries some people," the ambassador, a nephew of Prime Minister Jean Chretien, said, "but again if you look at the experience of the last 10 years, it usually balances out. We Canadians buy a lot in the U.S."

HEADLINE: Harlem's Pathmark Anchors a Commercial Revival on 125th Street

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
When a Pathmark store opened on 125th Street and Lexington Avenue in April, becoming the first full-service supermarket in Harlem in three decades, a few things needed to be adjusted. In response to feedback from customers, products from local bakeries were added, for example, and steps were taken to ease the delivery truck traffic that was clogging 124th Street.
But over all, the new supermarket has been a huge success, drawing 30,000 customers a week, said Harvey Gutman, a Pathmark spokesman. Only about 10 percent of the customers arrive by car, Mr. Gutman said, suggesting to the company that most come from Harlem or the Bronx. 
 Financed with private and public money, the Pathmark took years to build, in part because of the strong opposition from owners of independent supermarkets, who feared that they would be put out of business. And, in fact, some of the local stores have found it hard to compete. One of them, a Bravo market on 126th Street and Fifth Avenue, which was having a tough time even before the Pathmark opened, has closed.
Others are remodeling or adjusting. Juana Marte, the owner of the Park Avenue Supermarket on 126th Street and Park, said her sales were down to $5,000 a week from $18,000, forcing her to close off half of her store in the hope of finding a subtenant and to dismiss four of her six employees.
But while some grocers may be struggling, the Pathmark's popularity is having a big impact on the neighborhood. Not only has it altered the fortunes of the unsightly intersection where it is located, it is also helping to spur development across 125th Street.
Karen A. Phillips, the chief executive of the Abyssinian Development Corporation, the nonprofit organization that developed the Pathmark, said the store is expected to become the eastern anchor of a shopping strip extending along 125th Street.
The Pathmark has "done what it was supposed to do -- inspire new commercial development," Ms. Phillips said.
The western anchor will be Harlem U.S.A., a shopping center with a nine-screen multiplex between St. Nicholas Avenue and Frederick Douglass Boulevard that is nearing completion. (The first tenant, an Old Navy store, is expected to open on Feb. 2.) On Nov. 3, plans were announced for the Harlem Center, an $85 million retail, office and hotel complex on state-owned land two blocks east of the new shopping center. The Abyssinian Development Corporation will develop the Harlem Center with Forest City Ratner, a private real estate development company.
Nearby, a new Metropolitan Life Insurance Financial Services Center with a high-tech meeting room opened in September on the site of Copeland's, a restaurant that went out of business a couple of years ago. In March, European American Bank, known as E.A.B., plans to open its first Harlem branch next to the new Met Life center, on the corner of Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard.
On the opposite end of the shopping strip, on 125th Street east of Lexington, just across from the Pathmark, there are plans to build a smaller shopping center with 10-screen multiplex.
Originally, the multiplex was a joint venture of the Blumenfeld Development Group, of Syosset, N.Y., and United Artists Cinema Theater. But David Blumenfeld, a vice president of the development company, said he was talking to other theater operators because United Artists was having financial problems. According to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, United Artists recently defaulted on a loan payment.
In August, the company, which has been closing unprofitable theaters, won a reprieve and more time to repay its lender. Officials of United Artists in Englewood, Colo., failed to return several telephone call seeking information about the company's plans.
"If U.A. hits financial trouble, we'll find a replacement," Mr. Blumenfeld said.
Cater-corner to the Pathmark, on the northwest corner of 125th Street and Lexington, plans are under way to replace a city-owned parking lot with an $8.8 million, two-story retail building with a Duane Reade and a Seaman Furniture store. The development team includes DDM Development and Services, a company with extensive experience in residential and commercial rehabilitation in East Harlem.
Last month, the New York Empowerment Zone Corporation, which administers a federal, state and city program aimed at stimulating economic development in Harlem, awarded the developers a $2.5 million loan for some of the construction costs, which will be higher than usual because the site is above a two-story subway station, said Nina De Martini-Day, one of the principals of DDM.
So far, the developers have not been able to make a deal with George Tsolekas, the owner of the Bus Stop Luncheonette, which is housed in a one-story building that is standing in the way of their project. Mr. Tsolekas, who has run the luncheonette for nearly three decades, said he had no plans to budge. Ms. De Martini-Day said she would prefer to build a new luncheonette for Mr. Tsolekas in her new building, but that she assumed she would have to build around him.
Anthony J. Cuti, the chairman and chief executive of Duane Reade, said he was drawn to the East Harlem location because of the success of Pathmark. It would be the chain's second store along 125th Street. "We're always influenced by the fact that a retail area is being elevated by recognized trademarks," he said. "Every time that happens, it brings a crowd."
The Harlem Center is expected to house a CVS store, bringing the neighborhood a taste of the drugstore wars that are occurring throughout the city. The Pathmark store also has a pharmacy.
As development increases, rents are also going up, making it hard for some smaller businesses to survive. Barbara Askins, the president of the 125th Street Business Improvement District, estimated that about a half-dozen stores would go out of business this year. Ideally, she said, some sort of a balance would be struck so that small stores on 125th Street, like those offering African-inspired products, would be able to co-exist with the national chain stores.
"It shouldn't become a commercial strip that looks like every other place," she said.
Despite all the new projects, however, there is little chance that 125th Street will soon be mistaken for a gentrified shopping strip. In June, the city auctioned off the Corn Exchange Building, a 19th-century landmark on the corner of Park Avenue, to Elie Hirschfeld, the son of Abe Hirschfeld, the real estate developer. When he bought the property, Mr. Hirschfeld said his group had not decided what to do with it. The building has been abandoned for so long that small trees are growing out its cornices.
Farther west, between Madison and Fifth Avenues, developers had hoped to demolish several buildings and replace them with a three-story retail and office building. But the proposal was abandoned after the principal developer, Nikos Kefalidis, died in last year's crash of Swissair Flight 111 off Nova Scotia.
One real estate broker who follows Harlem closely but did not want to be quoted by name said it was important to keep the neighborhood's revival in perspective, remembering that deals made there must still get government subsidies.
"We've got to be careful that we don't make of this market more than it is," he said.

HEADLINE: BELIEFS;
Three men, with three styles, in three venues, deliver three messages. Just perhaps, there is one very important common thread.

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
On the surface, the three events were completely different -- and even more so the three individuals at the center of them. A small lunch, a private interview, a public lecture. An Italian Roman Catholic cardinal steeped in years of Vatican diplomacy; a Jordanian prince claiming direct descent, over 42 generations, from the prophet Muhammad; a Canadian philosopher known for his explorations of liberalism, ethics and the nature of modernity.
But jammed up one after another a few days back, the three encounters left the sense that beyond all the differences, some common thread wove them into a larger pattern. 
 The lunch was with Cardinal Achille Silvestrini. For many years he was papal under secretary of state, the Vatican's equivalent of foreign minister. Now he heads the Vatican's office for Eastern churches -- that is, for the churches originating in the Middle East and Eastern Europe that recognize the pope's authority but follow ancient, non-Western rites and practices.
Cardinal Silvestrini has just edited a collection of excerpts from talks that John Paul II has given in the course of 85 journeys all over the world. So strictly speaking, it was a publisher's lunch, a small gathering of journalists and churchmen to greet "A Pilgrim Pope" (K. S. Giniger/Andrews McMeel Universal).
But Cardinal Silvestrini was not in the United States to publicize a book. He was here to meet with the bishops from the Western Hemisphere who oversee non-Latin-rite Catholic churches founded by immigrants from Ukraine, Hungary, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and other countries.
One lunchtime topic, therefore, became the strained relations between the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Christianity, strains that leave many of these Eastern-rite Catholics caught in the middle. Are they part of the solution, a bridge between divided parts of Christianity? Or are they part of the problem, a papal bridgehead that threatens Eastern Orthodoxy?
The other topic was the plight of Arab Christians, whose presence in the Middle East has fallen victim to the region's religious rivalries and economic disruption.
At the center of the conversation was, of course, the cardinal himself, always a diplomat in the best sense. His evenhanded assessments of the fears, fault lines and failures of different religious groups radiated sympathy and not blame. One could understand why a few years ago he was often listed among possible successors to John Paul II.
By now, his age, 76, might tell against him as a papal candidate. But one could imagine him still a "great elector," a man so respected by other cardinals that his support for a candidate would be extremely persuasive.
From His Eminence to His Royal Highness was a jolt. Prince El Hassan bin Talal of Jordan, the younger brother of the late King Hussein, is a compact, thickset man who bristles with energy, physical and intellectual. He is a veteran of international commissions and a serious patron of interfaith dialogue, but it is not surprising to learn he is also a black belt in martial arts.
On Monday, he had come from a meeting at the Council on Foreign Relations to the offices of the World Conference on Religion and Peace near the United Nations. In two weeks he will preside as chairman ofthe conference's Seventh World Assembly, which will bring more than 600 senior religious leaders together in Amman, Jordan, to discuss ways of resolving violent conflicts and building peaceful institutions.
Tossed a standard query about religion and violence, Prince Hassan was off and running. He quoted Pascal and Kierkegaard, Yehudi Menuhin, Vaclav Havel and the archbishop of Canterbury. He mentioned personal encounters in Bosnia, Prague, Ulster, Albania, Geneva, at the Wiesenthal Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles. No words recurred more than "universal," "pluralism," "code of ethics." World leaders and institutions had to pursue a "spiritual agenda" alongside the political and economic ones; humankind needed a universal morality developed on the basis of a genuine pluralism.
Charles Taylor was yet another contrast. On Monday evening, this Canadian scholar of Hegel and exacting analyst of modern identity in the magisterial work "Sources of the Self" (Harvard University Press, 1989) was lecturing on "Democracy and Exclusion" to a crowded auditorium at the New School for Social Research.
Where Prince Hassan had spilled his ideas out in a cascade, Professor Taylor unwrapped his carefully, step by step. Why, he asked, had the last two centuries of expanding democracy also been an era of unprecedented ethnic cleansing?
He cautioned against the complacent assumption that such conduct was merely atavistic "tribalism," destined to disappear with the progress of modernity. Exclusion, in one form or another, is also the child of popular sovereignty, he said: democracy, no less than authoritarian regimes, poses the question, Who is this "we" of "we the people"? And modern conditions make it increasingly unlikely that minorities will even allow themselves to be assimilated into the "we" of the majority. The problem, he said, is not going away but has somehow to be accommodated.
Were these three events anything more than fascinating but unconnected moments in an overheated New York schedule? Was it fanciful to think that they had suddenly lit up a window into the global web of people and projects, thinking, talking, organizing, that keep a deeply divided humanity from tearing itself apart, that might even, someday, stitch by stitch, bind it together?

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Speech on Security Concerns in Asia

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the prepared text of a speech that Steve Forbes made yesterday on United States policy toward China. The address was given at the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda, Calif.
It is time to set a new course for American foreign policy in Asia. We need a principled president who will deal with China from a position of strength. We need a president willing to say to Beijing in no uncertain terms: No more business as usual. 
 No more shutting our ears to the cries of Christians, Buddhists and others suffering religious persecution in Chinese gulags. No more turning a blind eye to Chinese spies in our nuclear labs. No more keeping silent about Chinese slave labor camps, forced abortions and death-factory orphanages. No more doing business with Chinese military-owned companies trafficking in weapons of mass destruction. No more leaving our children and our allies vulnerable to Chinese nuclear missiles. And no more sweetheart trade deals.
I share the American people's sense of frustration that our security and our values are constantly being trampled by Beijing, and the Clinton-Gore administration does nothing. It is weak. It is reactive. It is rudderless -- and it is wrong. . . .
Some believe the right course of action is to immediately revoke most-favored-nation trade status -- a form of "shock therapy" -- to force China to stop its egregious military and human rights abuses.
And that is an entirely understandable point of view, especially given the White House's approach of "hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil" towards Beijing. Indeed, we may very well need to revoke M.F.N.
But first we need a real China policy, a tough China policy. We need Beijing to understand the rules of engagement.
And we need to begin using the economic and diplomatic tools at our disposal to effect real change in China: tough sanctions on Chinese military-owned companies; tough sanctions on Chinese companies using slave labor; tough sanctions on Chinese companies trafficking in weapons of mass destruction, and continuous, high-profile condemnations of Chinese human rights abuses in every international forum possible. . . .
The Forbes administration will rebuild -- not run down -- our national defenses. We will strengthen our alliances with key countries in the region to counterbalance the Chinese threat.
We will make it clear that we will defend Taiwan from a Chinese attack. As president, I will sign the bipartisan "Taiwan Security Enhancement Act" offered by Senator Jesse Helms and Senator Robert Torricelli. This will lift restrictions on the sale of defensive weapons to Taiwan, including missile defense systems.
We will also deploy state-of-the-art missile defense systems, such as the sea-based Aegis system, to protect our allies and ourselves. Indeed, we must dramatically step up our research and development to reopen the technology gap and pull away from our adversaries.
When a Chinese general made a not-so-veiled threat to "nuke" Los Angeles over the Taiwan crisis several years ago, he made one thing abundantly clear: We must not allow China's growing nuclear arsenal to continue to threaten American cities and decouple the United States from our allies. . . .

HEADLINE: Big Increases In Productivity By Workers

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The most debated economics issue in America today is whether workers are becoming ever more efficient, thanks to computers and the Internet. And the Labor Department, in the most comprehensive review of the data to date, says there has indeed been an improvement in this decade, mainly in the last four years.
The review, stretching back to 1959, came attached to the department's announcement yesterday that productivity -- the key measure of labor efficiency -- had shot up in the third quarter at an annual rate of 4.2 percent. Workers manufactured that much more on average for each hour on the job, or sold that much more or increased a huge variety of services. It was the biggest quarterly jump in nearly two years. 
 But quarterly productivity numbers bounce around. The third-quarter jump, for example, followed a rise of only six-tenths of a percent in the second quarter. What counts are long-term trends, and the Labor Department, using new information about the economy, revised its productivity data back 40 years. The new set of figures showed the 1990's to be unmistakably better than the 1970's and 1980's -- pulled up by four powerful years.
Four-year spurts occur from time to time. There was one in the 1980's, but it was not strong enough to raise the average for the whole decade as the last four years have done for the 1990's.
"There is no one point where we can say that we are on a new upward trend line," said Michael Harper, chief of the division of productivity research at the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Labor Department. "But in each of the last four years we have seen a little more evidence that we may be."
The latest productivity numbers seem likely to work against an increase in interest rates when the Federal Reserve's policy makers meet on Tuesday. More output per worker, at a moment of full employment in the United States, reduces the odds of shortages and rising prices, two big concerns of the Fed. Furthermore, retail sales leveled off in October, remaining unchanged from September, the Commerce Department said in a separate report yesterday.
Productivity gets much less public attention than inflation or economic growth or employment. The concept is more arcane. But no measure is more important. A nation's standard of living rises with productivity. Given limited population growth, a nation can acquire more goods and services only if the existing workers produce more in a given workday.
But the Labor Department's new numbers, for all the improvement they display, were not enough to settle a national debate over whether a "new economy" has really emerged.
They fail to answer these questions: Does the recent jump in productivity simply mean that companies and their workers are stretching themselves for a while to satisfy the strong demand of a booming economy, and when the economy cools so will their productivity? Or is there a permanent change in which computers and the Internet are generating the long-term efficiencies that in the past came with the spread of railroads, the invention of electricity and the proliferation of cars and trucks?
Optimists like Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, say the new economy has indeed arrived and if the revised numbers fail to capture the arrival, then they are still undermeasuring productivity. "We are on an accelerating productivity trend," he said.
But for the skeptics, the revisions leave too much unsaid. Productivity is calculated by adding up all the output of an economy, expressed in dollars, and then dividing by the number of labor hours spent to produce that output. The revisions increased the output side of the calculation, but failed to correct a mismeasurement of hours, says Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
"The Government has done a terrible job in uncovering the labor effort required to produce all the new output," he said, noting that in his own case, Morgan Stanley tells the Labor Department that he has a 40-hour-a-week schedule, which is true. But in fact Mr. Roach works 70 or 80 hours, common practice on Wall Street and in other industries, too.
With hours rising only slowly in the official data, unit labor costs -- the amount spent on wages and benefits to produce each piece of merchandise or each service -- rose a very mild six-tenths of a percent in the third quarter. The increases remained similarly low in the revised data. Economists cite these numbers in trying to explain the low inflation rate in recent years.
The productivity revisions announced yesterday resulted in changes only for the years after 1973. From 1959 until 1973, productivity rose at an annual rate of 2.9 percent, the same as the old, unrevised average. Between 1973 and 1995, however, the rate of growth was a fairly steady 1.4 percent to 1.6 percent a year, Mr. Harper said. That was slower, of course, than the pre-1973 number, but a considerable improvement over the unrevised average of about 1 percent a year for the 1973 to 1995 period.
And then in 1995 a boom kicked in. Economic growth soared and productivity jumped to an annual growth rate of 2.6 percent from the third quarter of 1995 through this year's third quarter, far better than the 1.9 percent figure before the revision. For the decade as a whole, the new productivity growth rate was 2 percent a year, much better than the unrevised 1.3 percent.
The productivity revisions reflect new ways of measuring the nation's output announced recently by the Commerce Department. One major change has been in the calculation of inflation, which has been revised downward for the years since 1978. That raises the dollar value of the nation's output of goods and services. The dollar total is adjusted for inflation.
Another big change involves computer software, a huge item, particularly in recent years. For the first time, software is being counted as a lasting investment and therefore must be listed separately in the national accounts, adding greatly to the nation's total output. Under the old system, the tens of billions of dollars spent on software were considered an expense, lost in the value of other items.
Software, in effect, has become a capital investment, and the rise in the productivity growth rate in the late 1990's reflects a sharp increase in capital spending, not only for software but for new machinery and equipment, particularly computers.
Capital spending has contributed in the past to temporary surges in productivity. "What is not clear," said Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist, "is what would happen if we pulled out the accelerating contribution of capital investment. How much would be left that reflects a fundamental change brought about by new technology analogous to the invention of the electric motor."

HEADLINE: In Expanding Platform, Forbes Attacks China

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: YORBA LINDA, Calif., Nov. 12

 BODY:
Steve Forbes, the wealthy magazine publisher and candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, came to the shrine dedicated to the president who opened modern diplomatic relations with China today and launched a bitter attack on the Chinese government, saying he would militarily contain the country and deny it trade relations if it did not moderate its behavior.
A day after delivering a speech on domestic issues at the Reagan Library north of Los Angeles, Mr. Forbes went to the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in this suburb of strip malls and tract homes 50 miles southeast of Los Angeles to offer what his staff had described as a major foreign policy address. But the speech included almost no mention of Europe or the rest of the globe and instead involved a series of angry denunciations of China, which he described as militarily and politically aggressive. 
The speech appeared to be part of Mr. Forbes's effort to transform himself from a candidate focused largely on one issue, tax reform, as had been the case in 1996, to the most conservative candidate in the presidential race on a range of issues, such as abortion, which he vigorously opposes, and military expansion, which he supports. Many conservatives criticize the Communist government of China as a major peril, and today Mr. Forbes embraced that position enthusiastically.
Mr. Forbes declared, in stark cold-war terms, "The rise of China as a new power is one of the greatest challenges we face as a nation as we enter the 21st century," and he compared the country to Germany and Japan in the years leading to World War II.
He insisted that if he were elected, there would be "no more leaving our children and our allies vulnerable to Chinese nuclear missiles."
"And no more sweetheart trade deals," he continued. He said he was opposed to China's entry into the World Trade Organization and said he would revoke China's most-favored-nation trade status if it did not open up politically and end its military threat to its neighbors, especially Taiwan.
In comments after his speech here, Mr. Forbes also attacked the International Monetary Fund, the body formed after World War II to foster financial stability, and another target of conservative ire.
"They have done enormous harm around the globe," he said of the fund, promising to close it down if elected. The speech today was in keeping with the overall tone of Mr. Forbes's campaign, in which he has generally described imminent threats he says America faces and the ways in which he would confront those threats. Mr. Forbes characterized China as America's greatest rival, and he suggested that even while the country was on the verge of what he described as a political implosion it was pursuing expansionist designs.
"In short, China is an immensely important yet intensely unstable country," Mr. Forbes said, and he quoted a Chinese dissident predicting that the Communist government would fall within 10 years.
He also said that he wanted to strengthen America's military involvement in Asia, where the country already maintains huge bases in Japan and South Korea. "America must be absolutely committed to remain the premier military power in the Pacific," he said.
Mr. Forbes was scornful of the Clinton administration's China policy, saying that in the president's first term it "had all the predictability of a drunk driving on the road." He added, "I call it a study in confusion and mixed signals, often degenerating into appeasement."
He said that he would put in place tough sanctions against any company owned by the Chinese military, companies that use prison labor and companies that traffic in weapons of mass destruction. If their behavior does not change, and if China does not halt its pattern of human rights abuses, particularly what he said is religious persecution, Mr. Forbes promised to cut back on China's access to American markets.
Mr. Forbes described the decade since the protests and killings at Tiananmen Square as a time "of drift, indecision and plain bad judgment" in which the country has been suffering increasing instability and a spiritual malaise.
But economists describe it as a time of unparalleled growth and increasing openness. Nicholas Lardy, a China scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., said that while China has made clear threats to Taiwan, "the economic reforms have continued after Tiananmen."
China's total trade with other countries has nearly tripled, to about $325 billion last year from $112 billion in 1989. In fact, China's trade surplus with the United States has ballooned to more than $50 billion this year, as American consumers have become increasingly dependent on the inexpensive products shipped here from China.
In addition, foreign investment in China, welcomed by the Chinese government, has shot up from about $3 billion a year in the late 1980's to close to $45 billion a year now. And the country's economic growth rate has averaged 8 percent to 10 percent over the past decade, Mr. Lardy said, bringing prosperity to millions of people in China.
Mr. Forbes said there was "a great spiritual awakening going on behind the Great Wall today," and that he would support those movements and battle the government's religious persecution by beefing up Radio Free Asia and attempting to create a Web site focused on China.
"Now is the time to intensify our efforts to communicate the good news of freedom and faith in God to a people living in great darkness," Mr. Forbes said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Signs Legislation Overhauling Banking Laws

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12

 BODY:
President Clinton signed into law today a sweeping overhaul of Depression-era banking laws. The measure lifts barriers in the industry and allows banks, securities firms and insurance companies to merge and to sell each other's products.
"This legislation is truly historic," President Clinton told a packed audience of lawmakers and top financial regulators. "We have done right by the American people." 
 The bill repeals parts of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act and the 1956 Bank Holding Company Act to level the domestic playing field for United States financial companies and allow them to compete better in the evolving global financial marketplace.
Analysts and industry leaders say the measure will probably fuel a wave of mergers as companies compete to build financial supermarkets offering all the services customers need under one roof.
Financial stocks were winners on Wall Street today, with J. P. Morgan & Company, Citigroup, American Express and Merrill Lynch all posting big gains. That helped the Dow Jones industrial average end up 174.02 points, at 10,769.32.
The Senate approved the final bill by 90 to 8 on Nov. 4 and the House followed suit by a vote of 362 to 57. Congress had previously made almost a dozen unsuccessful attempts over the last 25 years to revise the statutes, which had increasingly come to be viewed as anachronisms.
"The world changes, and Congress and the laws have to change with it," said Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, chairman of the Banking Committee and one of the bill's prime sponsors.
Supporters of the legislation say it will also benefit consumers, providing them with greater choice and convenience and spurring competition that will lead to lower prices.
"With this bill," Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said, "the American financial system takes a major step forward toward the 21st Century -- one that will benefit American consumers, business and the national economy." Opponents said it would have the opposite effect, creating behemoths that will raise fees, violate customers' privacy by sharing and selling their personal data, and put the stability of the financial system at risk.
The privacy issue was a key focus in the long and often heated negotiations that produced a compromise bill, and President Clinton made clear he still wanted to see more done to safeguard consumers' personal financial information.
President Clinton said the Treasury and White House would put together a legislative proposal to take to Congress next year that would extend the privacy provisions of the legislation.

Global Trade Harmony? Yeah, Right

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Nov. 13

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization was meant to usher in a glorious new era of global trade harmony, but in the five years since its creation, the trade body increasingly has become more of an international agreement to disagree.
That has been amply illustrated in the current gridlock on the agenda for negotiations at the rapidly approaching summit meeting of the organization, which makes the rules of global commerce and negotiates disputes among trading partners.
Despite more than two months of effort, countries have made little progress on figuring out a framework for negotiation. The ministers, due to meet in two weeks in Seattle, could be facing a big wish list from member countries that will be difficult, if not impossible, to tackle in the four-day meeting designed to help dismantle resilient barriers to international trade. 
 The seeds of the divisiveness were sown earlier this year with the bitter contest to select the first non-European head of the trade group. Emerging-market economies, which comprise most of the trade group's 135 members -- Estonia joined today -- flexed their numerical muscle and stuck to demands for a developing country choice.
The fissures that appeared during the selection fight continue to trouble the trade organization. In the run-up to Seattle, countries are dodging compromise and instead setting out their positions and refusing to budge to a degree that has imperiled a new round of global trade talks.
"There will be a meeting in Seattle, but I am seriously worried that there might not be a trade round," one trade envoy said. "The chances are getting slimmer every day," agreed Japan's trade diplomat, Yo ichi Suzuki.
Negotiators are meeting days and some nights to thrash out an agenda, which right now is a rambling 32-page document. Despite high-level efforts two weeks ago in Lausanne, Switzerland, to kick-start talks, not much has happened.
"Actually, we really haven't agreed on anything," one European envoy said. "Even on the motherhood paragraphs dealing with developing countries and technical cooperation, there are two or three points of divergence."
Despite two public warnings by Mike Moore, the director general of the organization, that the impasse threatens to torpedo the coming talks, countries continue "to lay out their positions and stick to them," according to one participant in the private negotiation meetings at the organization's Geneva headquarters.
"We're trying to work out what the playing field will be," said Australia's trade envoy, Geoffrey Raby. "But this is an extremely complex exercise that involves real national interests so, of course, countries want to try to tilt the playing field in their favor."
Mr. Moore has been convening small groups in his Green Room, a conference room near his office, in attempts to negotiate compromises. This week, some movement was apparently achieved in the thorniest area -- agriculture. Although the topic is part of the built-in agenda, meaning it has to be negotiated, delegates are laboring to figure just what the negotiations will encompass.
The European Union and Japan, which have strong farming sectors, are battling the United States, Australia and other agriculture exporting countries over the issue. The exporters want agricultural goods to be treated just like any other goods, with subsidies and other protections eliminated.
Earlier this week, several large farming groups said in Geneva that they opposed giving in to exporting countries on the issue. Australia's Trade Minister, Mark Vaile, accused the European Union and its allies of thwarting preparations for Seattle by refusing to give any concessions on the issue.
A few days ago, a new two-page text on agriculture emerged informally from Green Room discussions. It dropped the reference to multifunctionality -- allowing reasons such as farming's role in maintaining rural life -- to be used to justify agricultural support.
Japan, however, does not agree. "The issue is too politically sensitive to be decided here," Mr. Suzuki said.
Efforts to open to the public the trade organization's mostly closed proceedings also seem to have fallen flat, with most countries sticking to the idea that they belong to a government-to-government organization. Underlining this stubbornness is a failed attempt by Canada to introduce a new preamble to the agenda that explains in everyday English the mission and goals of the trade body. Canada's delegation had hoped such an approach would deflect criticism from labor and environmental organizations, which have protested that the trade group has enormous power and little accountability.
With a short time left before hundreds of officials gather, Mr. Moore has indicated he plans to come up with two more drafts in the hope of reducing the document to a manageable negotiating size. However, it is unclear that any new draft would look much different from the current version -- which is the second draft -- although basic editing would slim it down.
The key, diplomats agreed, is the political will to get it done. No one country is to blame, most said, but the enormous differences between the United States and the European Union have impeded progress.
 The accepted wisdom is that despite foot-dragging on agriculture, the Europeans want a wide-ranging set of trade talks to open markets and bolster the Continent's economies. The Clinton administration, enjoying a booming economy, wants a more limited agenda, especially on the verge of an election year when there is no point in antagonizing voting constituencies.
"There is no talk of boycotting Seattle, but there is talk of putting off the round for a couple of years," a European negotiator said. "But that would be dangerous indeed because a lot of momentum would go out of the trade liberalization process."

Nasdaq Sets Its 10th High In Last 11 Trading Sessions
Led by banks and financial companies, the stock market rose after a government report on productivity eased investors' worries that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for a third time this year when policy makers meet on Tuesday. The Nasdaq composite index closed at its 10th record high in the last 11 sessions, rising 23.86 points, or 0.75 of a percent, to 3,221.15.
The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 174.02 points, or 1.64 percent, to 10,769.32. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 14.60 points, or 1.06 percent, to 1,396.06. Page C3. 

The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond decreased to 6.03 percent from 6.09 percent on Thursday. C3.
 
Trade Negotiators Extend Talks
United States trade officials said they would extend their stay in Beijing to a fourth day for at least one more meeting in a last-ditch effort to salvage an agreement on China's entry into the World Trade Organization. The Americans announced on Friday that they were heading home after three days of fruitless talks. But after an exchange of messages during the night, the two sides agreed to meet again this morning to make another try. A5.
 
Christie's to Go It Alone on Internet
Christie's decided against joining forces with an online retailer like eBay or Walt Disney's Go.com to offer online auctions. Five months after its archrival Sotheby's allied itself with Amazon.com, Christie's said it had concluded that a link with an online retailer risked diluting the Christie's brand name. C14.
 
'Historic' Banking Measure Signed
President Clinton signed into law a sweeping financial modernization bill that will allow banks, insurance companies and brokerage firms to buy into each other's businesses without restrictions.

Trade Body Stalls on Agenda
Member countries of the World Trade Organization, are mired in gridlock over the agenda for negotiations. Trade ministers, who are scheduled to gather in Seattle in two weeks' time, could be facing a huge wish list from member countries that will difficult to tackle in the four-day meeting designed to kick off new market-opening negotiations. The trade body's director general, Mike Moore, has warned publicly that the impasse threatens to torpedo the talks. C2.
 
Environment Issues in Budget Fight
The most explosive issues remaining in the budget battle are legislative land mines pitting business interests against environmentalists. Even as the White House and Congress try to strike a final deal, new pro-business, anti-environmental measures are suddenly appearing, including one that seeks to block the government from collecting millions of dollars in fines from power companies it says are defying clean-air laws.

Burnham Pacific Exploring Options
Four months after rejecting a $1.2 billion buyout offer, Burnham Pacific Properties said it was exploring "a full range of strategic alternatives." The San Diego-based real estate investment trust, which is one of the largest developers of strip shopping centers on the West Coast, owns about 80 properties, with 13 million square feet of space.

HEADLINE: 'A Sand County Almanac' at 50

 BODY:
Fifty years ago, Aldo Leopold's ecological testament, "A Sand County Almanac," was published. It was a posthumous book, appearing a year and a half after Leopold died of a heart attack in April 1948 at the age of 61. A graduate of the Yale Forestry School and a 17-year veteran of the United States Forest Service, Leopold had his greatest influence, during his lifetime, as a professor of game management at the University of Wisconsin. But it is the "Almanac," his meditations on a Wisconsin River farm and an unequivocal statement of conscience, that will carry his influence and his good name down the generations.
Leopold's principal and extraordinary contribution to our world was to articulate the idea of a land ethic. The human relation to land, he wrote, "is still strictly economic, entailing privileges but not obligations." Leopold believed that the basis of successful conservation was to extend to nature the ethical sense of responsibility that humans extend to each other. This idea has acquired tremendous force since "A Sand County Almanac" first appeared. The fact that the idea now seems unexceptionable is a measure of its widespread influence. 
 Fifty years is both a very short and a very long time in the life of a good idea. The power of Leopold's argument -- buttressed as it is by his clear, vigorous prose -- has not been blunted in the least. In fact, his argument seems more urgently true now than ever. In the past 50 years Leopold's work has helped drive the environmental movement. Yet the tendencies he lamented, summed up in the phrase "despoliation of land," have accelerated almost out of control.
Leopold will last not because he captured a moment or a feeling, though he does both in the first sections of "A Sand County Almanac." He will last because we have scarcely begun to work out the implications of his ideas. He suggested an "ecological interpretation of history," which has only recently begun to be written. He recognized that the "ability to see the cultural value of wilderness boils down . . . to a question of intellectual humility." He described a dynamic that still threatens wildness: "the very scarcity of wild places, reacting with the mores of advertising and promotion, tends to defeat any deliberate effort to prevent their growing still more scarce."
These are formidable ideas. But none are more challenging than Leopold's land ethic. It requires a re-rooting in nature, a forsaking of the hope that we can save wild or even open land on the basis of its economic value. We are busy, Leopold says, "inventing subterfuges to give nature economic importance." They will not work. There is a risk involved in creating a truly ethical relation to the land. But Leopold believed in risk. "Too much safety," he wrote, "seems to yield only danger in the long run."

HEADLINE: Church Council Meets Amid Financial Crisis

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, Nov. 12

 BODY:
In the 49 years since its founding, the National Council of Churches has distinguished itself by strongly supporting civil rights legislation, helping resettle many thousands of refugees in the United States and sponsoring two influential Bible translations that have sold nearly 70 million copies.
But this week, with the organization's leaders meeting here to celebrate the upcoming golden anniversary, the council faced a financial crisis and the question of what role it should play in an ecumenical movement it once helped lead but which has moved far beyond it. 
 Signaling a desire to begin a new chapter, the council turned to new leadership, under two men as well known in the secular world as they are in religious life.
In the final session of its conference this morning, the council's governing General Assembly elected a new general secretary, or top officer, the Rev. Robert W. Edgar, 56, a United Methodist minister who served in Congress from 1975 to 1987 as a Democratic Representative from Pennsylvania's historically Republican Seventh District. Mr. Edgar, who was named to a four-year term, was selected by a search committee formed a year ago. Mr. Edgar, who spent the past decade as president of Claremont School of Theology in Claremont, Calif., will assume the job on Jan. 1, succeeding the Rev. Joan B. Campbell, who stepped down after two terms.
The previous evening, the council held a worship service to install Andrew Young, the former United States representative to the United Nations and an ordained United Church of Christ minister, as the council's new president. The service took place in Cleveland's Roman Catholic Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist, with the call to worship led by Bishop Anthony M. Pilla, and it offered a tantalizing vision of how broad the ecumenical movement might be in the United States.
The council represents only a partial vision of American Christianity, with 35 member denominations -- mainline Protestant, predominately African-American and Eastern Orthodox. It does not include Roman Catholics, among other churches.
In an interview, Mr. Edgar said the council had a "fairly clear vision" of itself in its first three decades, especially in the 1960's, when the struggle for civil rights for black Americans was at its height. Since then, he said, the council has "done good work, but has been invisible at the local level."
Mr. Edgar said he would like to help the council offer greater support and encouragement in cooperation to local councils of churches. He also said he wanted to ask the member denominations what they thought the ecumenical movement could be and "then shape the N.C.C. to meet that need."
Mr. Edgar arrived at Claremont in 1990, when he said the school's endowment had been reduced to less than $4 million, from more than $7 million. He will leave the school, he said, with the endowment at $22 million, several buildings renovated and the budget balanced.
Such experience would seem vital in taking charge of the council. The organization is facing a deficit estimated at $3.5 million in an annual budget of nearly $70 million, a shortage that officials say resulted largely from the expense of an examination by outside consultants and a recommended overhaul of the council's financial operations.
Concern among denominations over the council's financial management peaked this fall when the United Methodist Church, a major contributor, said it would withhold a payment of more than $300,000 until the council had its fiscal house in order. The money is still being withheld.
Council officials say the staff will be reduced through elimination of vacant positions, attrition through retirements and layoffs. It is a course that would echo cuts made earlier this decade by several major Protestant churches at their national headquarters, as they struggled with their own financial crises.
Ms. Campbell, general secretary since 1991, said she thought part of the council's problem, shared by many national denominations, resulted from a trend within organized religion, as Americans increasingly prefer to see their donations go to causes at a local level or to a specific need, such as help for victims of a natural disaster. "In our system, we have very modest -- and less and less -- unrestricted money" for general operations, she said.
The Rev. Wes Granberg-Michelson, general secretary of the Reformed Church in America and a chairman of a committee formed to help the council restructure itself financially, said that while no one should underestimate "the sense of crisis" within the organization, the council's leaders had nontheless reached a consensus this week on steps to turn this around. They should put the council on a sound financial basis, he said.
Part of the council's difficulties might also lie in the very success of promoting understanding and cooperation among the different faiths. Rather than a single, centralized organization like the council leading the movement, important ecumenical work is now being carried on by churches at the local level, and by denominations that forge formal ties with each other. There is also a wider cast of potential partners for ecumenical efforts than there was 50 years ago, particularly among Catholics, evangelical Protestants and Pentecostals.
Another ecumenical organization attempting a transition to a new era, the World Council of Churches, is further along in the process. It is also a half-century old and now represents nearly 340 denominations. Both the national and world councils were founded largely by Protestants in a bygone era when their churches were dominant religious forces in their societies.
The Rev. Konrad Raiser, the world council's general secretary, said in an interview this week that that organization had been trying to shift its center of gravity and adopt a broader vision, so that its member churches -- not the organization's own agencies -- set the agenda, while it reaches out to other Christians.
"What really matters is to look at the council as a fellowship of churches," he said, referring to the World Council. "Our earlier understanding was very much focused around the council as an advocate of issues, an initiator of programs that were in some ways seen as a challenge to the churches."

HEADLINE: South Carolina Argues Future of a Rebel Flag

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, S.C., Nov. 12

 BODY:
Carrying the battle flag of the Confederacy through this birthplace of the Civil War, the hundreds of men parading in their gray uniforms and the women in their black widow's weeds knew exactly what was at stake in their struggle over the memory of an earlier era.
Their immediate journey was to rebury the remains of 22 Confederate sailors and a 3-year-old boy whose first resting place had mistakenly been covered by the football stadium at the Citadel, the military college here. 
 More important, the marchers and the 2,500 others who joined them at Magnolia Cemetery today were there to invest the history and the symbols of the region with tangible meaning, which at that moment were under attack by many who see them in far less glorious terms.
Just a few hours earlier, the governor of South Carolina, Jim Hodges, had spent the morning asking business leaders to help him find an honorable way to remove the battle flag from atop the State Capitol. It has flown there, usually in the face of many offended people, since 1962. The Legislature, which has debated bills to remove the flag, has resisted efforts to take down the flag, even after South Carolina became the last state flying it.
The most serious of those efforts began this summer, when the national and local branches of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People gave up trying to negotiate the removal of the flag and announced an economic boycott of South Carolina.
Fearing the effects of the boycott and the growing damage to the state's reputation, an increasing number of organizations have called for the flag's removal, including the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce, the state Baptist Convention and Bob Jones University, a bastion of the religious right.
But even some legislators who might be inclined to compromise say they will not do so while an economic musket is pointed at their heads, and much of that traditional, prideful stubbornness was on display today at Magnolia Cemetery.
The crowd, entirely white, was hardly representative of the state, but many of those present said they had felt a twinge of resentment when a national organization tried to tell them what symbols their state was allowed to display.
"The people of South Carolina have the right to choose what flags they want to fly," said George Bragdon, a warehouse supervisor from Lancaster, S.C., who was dressed in the gray flannel of the 12th South Carolina Brigade, Company I, in which his great-grandfather had served. "No one from any other state can tell us what to do. I would remind the N.A.A.C.P. that the South was willing to go to war to protect its states rights, and we are still stubborn enough not to give in to this boycott."
Governor Hodges, though he is eager to have the flag removed, essentially had the same message in the speeches he has given all week, including one this morning to the state Chamber of Commerce.
"The N.A.A.C.P. boycott has drawn attention to the problem, which has been helpful in trying to move it towards closure," Governor Hodges said.
"But it is clear that in my discussions with legislators who hold the cards in whether or not this bill will pass, that the boycott now stands as an obstacle," he added. "Clearly the only way to show progress on this issue, I believe, is for the N.A.A.C.P. to suspend its boycott as the first step towards resolution."
If the N.A.A.C.P. agrees to do so, the governor said, he will not only press the Legislature to move the flag elsewhere on the statehouse grounds, but will work to enact a state holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr. and to build a museum in Columbia that would reflect the heritage of both blacks and whites in South Carolina.
But the N.A.A.C.P. has rejected the proposal and intends to continue its boycott.
Dwight C. James, executive director of the South Carolina Conference of Branches of the N.A.A.C.P., said today that it was ludicrous to try to appease blacks with the offer of a King holiday and questioned whether an end to the boycott would lead to negotiations.
"There were no discussions or negotiations before we called for these sanctions, and there wouldn't be any if we withdrew," Mr. James said. "We are committed to standing firm to the end, and it is up to the leadership of the state to change."
The N.A.A.C.P.'s effort is the latest attempt to remove the flag since it was put up in 1962 as a gesture of defiance to the civil rights movement. Most recently, then-Gov. David Beasley led a vocal campaign in 1997 but the Legislature rejected his proposal to take down the flag.
Mr. James and other proponents of removing the flag see it as a symbol of slavery, and say the flag's presence over the seat of government is indicative of the racial climate in the state. Many Southerners, while acknowledging that the flag has been appropriated by white hate groups, insist that it is not a racist symbol, but rather a banner under which many of their relatives fought and died.
"This was a soldier's flag, and that's why it's wrapped around those caskets right there," said Randy Burbage, president of the Confederate Heritage Trust, the group that dug up the sailors' remains from under the stadium and organized the reinterment. "This is our heritage, and if the flag comes down, then next the monuments will come down, and then the street names, and then we will forget our history. We can't forget that this was America's greatest tragedy."
Mr. Burbage wept as he helped lower the pine caskets into a long trench grave at Magnolia Cemetery, which was full of 135-year-old monuments to fallen rebels. The remains were discovered in June after the Heritage Trust, working with a state archaeologist, realized that a cemetery from the 1860's was beneath the stadium, which was built in 1948.
At today's ceremony, each of the flags over the coffins was carefully folded by re-enactors in Confederate uniforms, and each was handed to a woman dressed in the black hoop skirt and veil.
Then, the crowd sang "Dixie," the soldiers let loose a rebel yell, and there was a barrage of gunpowder salutes from rifles and artillery pieces.
One state official looking on let loose a barrage of his own, his mocking voice a reminder of the deep trench that still divides the state.
"The N.A.A.C.P. doesn't care about the flag, they're just doing this to raise money," said State Senator Arthur Ravenel, a Republican who represents the Charleston area.
"I would say that not only will the state not negotiate under threat of a boycott," Mr. Ravenel said, "but we'll never vote to take down that flag at all."

Food Labels Will List A Dangerous Form of Fat
The F.D.A. said it would require food manufacturers to include specific information about trans fatty acids, or just trans fats, on nutrition labels, in response to mounting evidence that this type of fat, which is often found in margarines and baked goods, raises the risk of heart disease. Nutrition experts say trans fats, which are liquid fats that have been turned into solids, are even more unhealthy than saturated fats.

HEADLINE: U.S. Negotiators Extend Trade Talks in Beijing for 4th Day

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Saturday, Nov. 13

 BODY:
In a last-ditch effort to reach an agreement on China's entry into the World Trade Organization, American negotiators decided overnight to stay here a fourth day for at least one more meeting.
On Friday night, the Americans, practicing high-stakes brinkmanship, had said that the talks so far had been fruitless and announced that they were heading home. 
 But after an exchange of messages during the night, the two sides agreed to meet again today to make another try.
So far, the Chinese have balked at demands for the thorough opening of domestic industries to foreign ownership, which the United States insists is a condition for China's entry into the global trade body.
Early today, Tom Tripp, the spokesman for the American team, said, "Although progress has been slow in the talks so far, because of the importance of the issues, both sides thought it would be useful to have an additional day of meetings."
During the night, Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, was for the first time this week asked to meet Prime Minister Zhu Rongji. They met this morning inside the government's leadership compound, Zhongnanhai.
In private, American officials expressed pessimism and disappointment that, up to now, the Chinese had been unable to match the market-opening concessions Mr. Zhu made in Washington last April.
One American official here said this morning, "There's been very little progress at all toward anything that could be considered a commercially satisfactory agreement in the United States."
While the Clinton administration desperately wants to secure China's entry into the trade body as a calming force in stormy Chinese-American relations, it is under pressure from Congress and American business interests to gain sweeping concessions.
The Chinese, while proceeding slowly toward a market economy, fear the short-term social dislocations of opening industries to outside competition and have pressed for more lenient terms of entry.
This week's talks, which follow more than a decade of fitful negotiations and a near-agreement in April, have been widely seen as make-or-break, and the administration is anxious to pursue all possibilities.
In Washington on Friday President Clinton said differences remained on a "finite and limited number of issues" and added, "I have not given up."
Bringing China soon into the world organization has been a prime goal of Mr. Clinton, and failure would be a setback for his strategy of engagement with the world's most populous country.
The Chinese have been publicly silent about this week's negotiations, and the Americans have not publicly described the remaining areas of disagreement. One American diplomat said major points of contention included the American demand that China allow majority foreign ownership in the telecommunications and financial services industries.
Other American officials said the negotiators had particularly pressed China, without success, to open its securities industry to outsiders. Securing a foothold in China for Wall Street companies, they said, could broaden the political support for a deal even if majority foreign ownership in telecommunications and other sensitive sectors was blocked.
In a visit to Washington in April, Prime Minister Zhu agreed to open up most industries to majority ownership by foreigners. But this week the Chinese delegation, led by Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng, has so far refused to match the April offer in important respects, American officials said.
China's backsliding may reflect not only Mr. Zhu's apparently diminished power but a broader shift in the political atmosphere here, toward a more conservative and nationalistic stance. This change gathered force during the Kosovo war last spring, when China vehemently opposed the NATO bombing campaign, and it accelerated after the bombing of its embassy in Belgrade, in which three Chinese were killed.
A failure to join the trade organization now would not mean that China's gradual opening to outside competition, and its efforts to overhaul hidebound state enterprises would come to a stop, economists here and abroad said.
China and the United States had both hoped that an agreement could be reached by Nov. 30, when a new round of global trade talks are to begin in Seattle. China needs to conclude bilateral accords with major partners before it can enter the global body.
In recent days, administration officials privately said an agreement would be possible if China could match the terms it offered in April.
But in the intervening months, Chinese industrial and bureaucratic interests began to lobby against such deep concessions. Even military officers joined the fray, describing control over the telecommunications sector, for example, as a national security issue, said Joseph Few smith, a Chinese politics specialist at Boston University.
Mr. Zhu, an impatient, straight-talking reformer who is popular abroad and with ordinary Chinese, came under attack from conservative politicians and ministers who want to preserve national control of key industries. According to many reports, he no longer has control over the trade talks or the overhaul of state enterprises.

LOURDES
 Body and Spirit in the Secular Age.
 By Ruth Harris.
 Illustrated. 474 pp. New York:
 Viking. $34.95. 
 Many Americans who are not Roman Catholics have only a vague idea of what happened at Lourdes. This ignorance is something like not knowing what happened at Mecca in a country whose biggest single religion is Islam. Bernadette Soubirous, a very poor 14-year-old, had a series of 18 visions at a riverside grotto from February to July 1858. Now about four million pilgrims go there every year. The nightly candlelight procession of tens of thousands of devotees constitutes one of the world's great religious spectacles, and the pilgrimages with the sick are remarkable for their caring and inclusiveness. For many Catholics the cures there have been a sign of the truth and the power of their faith. For others Lourdes is a troubling anomaly, a warm childhood memory but also a mark of difference. Lourdes became the matrix for subsequent apparitions, shrines and devotions. It changed the environment of world Catholicism. Yet this great spiritual center has been invisible for much of the general public and scholars alike, as if they had a blind spot for religious wonder and mystery when they occur in the Western world.
With her fascinating and sensitive book "Lourdes: Body and Spirit in the Secular Age," Ruth Harris, who teaches history at Oxford University, has made Lourdes visible, almost unavoidable. Harris, self-described as a secular Jew, herself overcame an initial aversion to the subject. On a pilgrimage she helped care for the sick, and at Lourdes she took the ritual bath. Male and female religious who opened their archives to her further kindled her sympathy. Her study, "neither a Catholic apology nor an anticlerical tirade," attempts "to provide an historical context for believers and give nonbelievers a sense of where the appeal of Lourdes lies."
It covers the polemical and formative period of the pilgrimage, from 1858 to 1914. First it places the apparitions in context, beginning with the religious culture of the Pyrenees and the economic crisis in its towns in 1858. After an account of Bernadette's visions, Harris describes those of other seers, children and adults, at the grotto. Some of them were at first credible competitors to Bernadette and even seemed to have the power to heal. But the clerical authorities stuck with Bernadette, and Lourdes swiftly became national news. Bernadette herself ("omnipresent in the story but astonishingly absent from the place") eventually entered a convent. Harris then takes us behind the scenes as the shrine prospers. We learn about the writer Henri Lasserre, whose melodramatic report of the visions was "probably the greatest best seller of the 19th century"; the organization of an annual national pilgrimage by dynamic Assumptionist priests and devoted female organizers, whose mutual relations were highly intense and productive; the accretion of the particular ritual prayers, baths and processions; the pilgrim experience of miraculous cures; and the effective defeat of critics like Zola and Charcot, who challenged these cures.
A number of themes run through the account. One is about a series of "tamings" by the authorities and by people's expectations. After her visions Bernadette, whom Harris obviously respects and admires, was constantly humiliated in public so she would not become proud and was taken from her home when there were complaints "she was running about with other children." The Virgin, whom Bernadette saw as a young girl, was recast as a woman. Originally in the wild, the grotto was girdled with masonry and capped with a basilica. Pilgrims were fenced out and ushered in. And reports of cures were made less subjective and more medical.
Harris follows the Lourdes story as an evolving narrative with a changing iconography. A chapter on the bitter struggle between the populist Lasserre and clerical historians points up the public's role in selecting the version it wanted. With a sophisticated eye, Harris examines photographs, engravings and cartoons, pointing out, for instance, the resonance between photos of Bernadette and Millet's paintings of devout peasants, or juxtaposing doctors at the Lourdes Medical Bureau questioning a cured woman and doctors in Paris observing a "hysteric."
A third theme follows "a story about France . . . the capacity of the Second Empire to adjust to, and even profit from, religious movements, and the inability of the Third Republic to suppress them." In 19th-century France, Harris finds not relentless progress toward a secular world, as is often assumed, but a coexistence, and eventually a kind of convergence, between positivism and a robust Catholic culture. She shows a France "normally hidden from view" that Lourdes made manifest. At the shrine the pilgrims of France's disparate regions recognized "the deep similarity of religious feeling that united them."
She pays special attention to women. Lourdes "valued and gave status to women, acknowledging many of the tasks that they did in private, as they consoled, fed and nursed." She identifies the emergence of active, engaged selves in the people healed and the female helpers. While forthright about the anti-Socialism, anti-Republicanism, anti-Masonism and the "hateful, racial anti-Semitism" of the Assumptionist organizers, she never loses sight of the compassionate and tender side of the pilgrimages, in which women became spiritual by helping and created community in the process. They dreamed of "a world in which personal connection was paramount" and "insisted on the organic links between men and women, between rich and poor." They were part of a trend; more than 100,000 women became active religious -- teachers, nurses, missionaries -- in 19th-century France.
The phenomenon of Lourdes has manifold ramifications, and Harris does not explore them all. One could write a history of Lourdes devotion from the point of view of a family, a community or a diocese. And while Catholic France was coming to know itself at Lourdes, so by 1900 was Catholic Europe, with Spanish, Italian, Belgian, Dutch, English and Irish Catholics converging there. The shrine's story was already going around the world, along with its water, images and replicas of its grotto. Lourdes's global impact is all the more reason to welcome this well-written, engaging and innovative history, open-ended and openhearted. Ruth Harris helps move religious history away from trench warfare to the shared exploration of fact and experience. Both those who love Lourdes and those curious at a distance will find deep pleasure in this book.

THE SOUL OF BATTLE
 From Ancient Times to the Present Day, How Three Great Liberators Vanquished Tyranny.
 By Victor Davis Hanson.
 Illustrated. 480 pp. New York:
 The Free Press. $30. 
 VICTOR DAVIS HansON is an ancient historian who teaches at California State University, Fresno. He is also a farmer, working a vineyard that has been in his family for generations. He has written groundbreaking, indispensable books on ancient Greek farmers ("The Other Greeks") who lived in the countryside, not the city, and on the legacy of the Greek insistence on the decisive battle, the clash of armored foot soldiers, embattled farmers whose dependence on their crops left them no time for long-range expeditions or protracted campaigns ("The Western Way of War"). In "The Soul of Battle" he widens the scope of his inquiry to discuss, in rich and fascinating detail, three campaigns in which idiosyncratic, uncompromising generals commanding soldiers of egalitarian societies led armies on what he calls "great marches" into the heart of enemy territory and, while avoiding pitched battles, destroyed the economic and political base of tyrannical and aggressive states. Their names are Epaminondas, Sherman and Patton.
To many readers of this brilliant and engrossing book the first name will be unfamiliar. He was a citizen of Thebes, which in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. was the leading partner of a confederation of city-states in Boeotia, the land northwest of Athens. Unlike much of the rest of Greece, it was fertile, well-watered farmland, a tempting target for aggressive neighbors, especially for the Spartans, who had become by the beginning of the fourth century the dominant power in Greece. For centuries Spartan infantry had been invincible in the head-on collision of lines of armored men, wielding spear and sword, that was the normal pattern of Greek battle. They were full-time professionals, living and eating together, training and fighting in the same formation from boyhood on -- a life that produced a discipline and cohesion without parallel. They were a ruling class, supported by the forced labor of a whole conquered Greek population, the neighboring Messenians, who had been reduced to serfdom in the eighth century B.C. The Spartans were flanked in the battle line by the troops of their so-called allies to the north of them, who were allies only because they had no choice in the matter.
When, in 370 B.C., an army led by one of Sparta's two kings invaded Theban territory, at the city of Leuctra, Epaminondas faced it at the head of the Boeotian army. The Thebans were on the left wing of the line facing the Spartan elite force, but Epaminondas had massed his men in much greater depth than usual, so that when he led them at a run against the Spartans, who were already extending their line in order to outflank him, the impact of his contact broke their ranks; their king was killed and the survivors eventually asked for a truce to bury their dead and withdraw.
It was the first time Spartan troops had admitted defeat in all their long history. But Epaminondas was not finished with them. Their allies had begun to assert their independence and in the late summer of the next year asked for Theban help. Epaminondas did something unprecedented in Greek warfare. He led his army of 70,000 men all the way into the heart of Spartan territory and, while avoiding the pitched battle that would have resulted from an attack on the city of Sparta itself, marched through the countryside leaving behind him a trail of destruction. He then helped the allies to the north to fortify their cities and, more important still, freed 200,000 land-bonded serfs, called Helots, and helped them build a base, the city of Messene, from which they could defend their newly won freedom. It was the end of Spartan military supremacy, achieved with only minor losses by a general who had far exceeded the terms of his original commission, and who was in fact impeached, unsuccessfully, on his return to Thebes. Hanson sums up his importance: "Epaminondas . . . was the real modern military thinker of the ancient world, the sole constitutional general who realized that a democratic nation in arms must make the entire society of the enemy pay for the aggression of its army, must convince his own democratic army that they are morally superior to the enemy."
Many of the salient features of Epaminondas' extraordinary campaign recur in Gen. William T. Sherman's march from Atlanta to the sea. Like Epaminondas, he took his dangerous decisions without the wholehearted support of his colleagues at home. "His venture," according to the British war historian B. H. Liddell Hart, "was to be made under the cloud of the dubious permission of his military superior, the anxious fears of his president and the positive objections of their advisers." Like Epaminondas, Sherman led an army that admired and trusted him, an army inspired by his sense of mission. Both men struck deep into the enemy's heartland, wrecking its economy and liberating the slaves on which that economy depended. Both avoided the head-on battle and its huge casualty list, preferring deceptive feints and outflanking marches. Both left a trail of destruction behind them, though there was much more to destroy in Georgia than in the region around Sparta; Atlanta was burned to the ground, and railroads were systematically ruined. Lastly, both generals were difficult men, mavericks who puzzled and dismayed their fellow generals and their political controllers.
Epaminondas was a Pythagorean, an adherent of a philosophical sect that advocated vegetarianism and believed in metempsychosis; he set a dismaying example of ascetic living and self-control. As for Sherman, who graduated from West Point sixth in his class of 233, his 148 demerits in conduct placed him 216th in "personal behavior." In 1861, while he was the general in charge of Union troops in Kentucky, his pessimistic (and exact) predictions of a long and costly war caused such a furor in the newspapers that he was temporarily relieved of command on the basis that he was insane. Yet later, at Shiloh, he won the admiration of Gen. U. S. Grant and, in the campaigns that preceded the great march, the confidence and affection of his army.
So did Gen. George Patton, but he too had trouble with higher headquarters. Like Sherman, he was widely and deeply learned in military history, but he expressed himself in public in a violent and flamboyant way that shocked much of the public and alienated or even enraged many of his superiors. Yet he was not only a soldier who had been wounded on the Western Front in 1918; he had also, in North Africa and especially in Sicily in 1943, shown what could be done with a mobile force led by a daring commander. Because he twice slapped battle-stressed soldiers in Sicily who, he thought, were merely malingering, he was denied a major command in the Normandy landings, even though the Germans recognized him as their most formidable opponent. When his Third Army was finally committed to battle, he took off, plunging eastward into France and also turning north to make contact with the Canadians and trap the retreating German Army. But he was ordered by Gen. Omar Bradley to stop at Argentan, and the Germans escaped to fight again.
Unlike Epaminondas and Sherman, he was not a free agent. Later, poised at Metz after a spectacular dash through France and ready to push on into Germany, he was denied the gasoline for his move; the supplies went instead to Field Marshal Montgomery for his ill-fated thrust into Germany from Belgium. But after his extraordinary feat of switching the direction of his army in 48 hours from east to north to hit the German bulge from below -- when he proposed it Eisenhower said, "Don't be fatuous, George" -- he finally, in March 1945, took off on his 1,000-mile dash that took him to the gates of Prague, leaving behind him German dead and other German soldiers who had surrendered and been told to walk westward, as well as prisoners freed from the camps and the factories in which thousands of foreign workers had slaved for the Nazi war.
Both Sherman and Patton spoke of the "soul" of their army, and the Pythagorean Epaminondas would surely have agreed. In the case of these three great armies there was, as Hanson puts it, "a real moral difference" between the invaders and their enemies. His book, he says, "is more an essay on the ethical nature of democracies at war than a purely military history of three epic marches for freedom, for it claims that on rare occasions throughout the ages there can be a soul, not merely a spirit, in the way men battle."

MONEY, GREED, AND RISK
 Why Financial Crises and Crashes Happen.
 By Charles R. Morris.
 297 pp. New York:
 Times Business/Random House. $25. 
 A CENTRAL question of economics concerns the relationship between what we call the "real economy" and financial markets. The real economy is production, wages, profits, incomes, employment and living standards. Financial markets run the gamut from stocks, bonds and banks to more obscure investment instruments like mortgage-backed securities and options. The two worlds intersect, but until recently the consensus among economists was that financial markets were a sideshow. We could explain economic cycles mainly through shifts in purchasing power, technology and management methods. Well, maybe not.
Almost everywhere you look, financial markets seem crucial to economic fortune and misfortune. Japan's economic stagnation in the 1990's is intertwined with a banking crisis that may involve up to $1 trillion in bad loans. Asia's banking and currency collapses -- beginning in mid-1997 -- plunged many of the region's countries into deep slumps from which they are just beginning to recover. On a cheerier note (so far), the United States' boom has drawn strength from a headstrong stock market that has left people feeling richer and consuming more.
"The financial sector," Charles R. Morris writes, "is the economy's plumbing system. A company's failure, even a big one like I.B.M.'s, is like a broken sink, but a failure in the financial sector threatens the entire water supply." Just so, and in "Money, Greed, and Risk" Morris seeks to demystify the murky relationship between finance and the real economy. To this task he brings rare qualifications. He's both a market player and a first-rate writer. In the 1980's, he advised several LBO funds (for "leveraged buyout," meaning the funds bought companies with borrowed money). His previous books have covered subjects as varied as American Catholicism and computers.
Finance's main contribution to economic progress, Morris shows, has been to permit specialization and investment. Money itself (usually precious metals like silver and gold) represented an enormous advance because it liberated people from barter. The creation of "bills of exchange" -- used by the 15th-century Italians and further perfected by the 18th-century Dutch -- did the same for trade, sparing merchants from carting scarce coin around the world. Trade flourished.
In time, finance underwrote investments -- roads, canals, railroads, ships and factories -- that could presumably repay the original sums and then some. Accumulated wealth could be employed, not hoarded. At its best, this process confers huge social benefits. Thirty years ago, for example, most home mortgage loans were made by local savings associations and banks. Since then, mortgages have been widely "securitized," meaning they're bundled together in bonds and sold to institutional investors (pension funds, insurance companies, investment houses). The investors receive homeowners' principal and interest payments, a development that has cut interest rates on home loans relative to other investments and saved homeowners billions in monthly payments.
The rub, of course, is that the process doesn't always work well. Financial markets traffic in risk. Dutch banking houses that issued bills of exchange had to know whether merchants could cover the credits. If too many bills were issued, they might finance a shaky boom that would collapse. Not surprisingly, this happened. Similarly, savings channeled into unproductive investments can create losses for individual investors, and -- if the amounts are great enough -- destabilize entire economies. The crises in Japan and Asia exemplify this. Banks overlent for unneeded projects, from office buildings to factories. As more borrowers couldn't repay, lending (and the associated spending and jobs) imploded.
The paradox of finance is that a usually farsighted and constructive process routinely descends into frenzied, shortsighted and self-destructive binges. Greed, fear, hope and ignorance reign. Almost everyone plays for a quick killing -- or aims to escape a slaughter. To explain the paradox, Morris argues that finance regularly follows a cycle of "innovation, crisis and consolidation." Greater trade required paper credits; expanding railroads needed to sell more public stocks and bonds. The financial innovation meets the need, but its novelty also "triggers a period of greatly increased risk and instability, until institutions catch up."
Up to a point, this is convincing. Financial innovations initially involve huge profits that attract imitators until too many investors are chasing too few good opportunities. Crashes and losses ensue. Sooner or later, institutions adapt. Governments impose regulations, markets evaluate risk better -- or both. Morris provides much evidence for his theory, from British bond investments in American railroads in the 19th century to junk bonds in the 1980's. But in the end, the theory is not completely satisfying. Many financial crises stem from plain old excess. Markets go to extremes. Investors and traders get caught in fits of excitement or gloom. Morris ignores episodes that don't fit his theory. Except for passing references, for instance, he doesn't discuss Japan's banking crisis. After banks overlent, government regulators turned a blind eye to weak loans in the (vain) hope that prosperity would transform bad credits into good.
And while the financial breakdowns that he does explore -- from the collapse of the Bank of the United States in the 1830's to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980's -- are well told, the whole is less than the sum of the parts. What really concerns us is the world's financial plumbing. Are we dealing only with some leaky faucets? Or is the whole system in jeopardy? Some big crises -- take the savings and loan debacle -- haven't derailed prosperity. But there are ominous trends. Financial markets increasingly deal in instruments -- options, derivatives -- that can confuse even professionals. Moreover, financial markets have gone global. Morris argues that regulation can provide safeguards. Financial institutions can have ample capital to protect against losses; disclosure requirements may prevent some stupid investments. All this is true. But bad regulation also worsened some crises -- the S.&L. and Japanese banking meltdowns, for instance.
So, is the plumbing safe? Morris never says. Perhaps no one can.

 BODY:
With the streets of New York as our laboratory, we decided to conduct an experiment. We assembled six experts: Jane Rinzler Buckingham, president of Youth Intelligence, a trend-spotting firm; Ginny Hilfiger, a senior vice president of Tommy Hilfiger; Kal Ruttenstein, a senior vice president of Bloomingdale's; Valerie Steele, chief curator at the Fashion Institute of Technology; Cathy Horyn, a fashion reporter for The Times; and Bill Blass, the designer. Then we asked them to decipher 15 human Rorschach blots: people photographed in whatever they happened to be wearing. Finally, we provide the real answers. The results begin here.
 
The Experts' Guesses
 
Buckingham: He is just Mr. Dapper. He strikes me as a student.
Hilfiger: He's definitely a student from the books and umbrella. He looks as if he's very holy and goes to church a lot. He probably would shop at Brooks Brothers if he was going to buy a suit.
Ruttenstein: He teaches at Columbia, in the English department.
Horyn: He's a junior-high or high-school teacher or a librarian. He doesn't take a lot of guff from his students.
Blass: He's probably a preacher's son.
Buckingham: She looks good. What she wears and being up on trends is definitely important to her. It's that casual "I don't care about trends, but I have them all" look. She's single.
Hilfiger: She lives on the Upper East Side. Whatever the trend is, she's able to go out and buy it because her parents have money. She's too young to have a lot of money on her own.
Ruttenstein: This girl is very hip. She has the pony-skin bag, which is the look of the season. She has the Adidas running pants. She lives downtown, and I think she's an actress or a dancer.
Steele: It's not an Upper East Side look, but it's not like a SoHo look, either. It looks more trendy than arty.
Horyn: She's on the go. She's kind of the bohemian hip mom. She lives in New Jersey and her husband works in Manhattan.
Blass: She is going to be successful. I like everything about her.
Buckingham: She probably volunteers at the museum. She's very practical; she's got everything she needs in her bag.
Hilfiger: She seems like the type of grandmother who has constantly tried to stay up with the trends. That outfit is probably something she bought not too long ago. She probably has grandkids and kids and a house out on Long Island.
Ruttenstein: She lives on the Upper West Side. She's retired. She's very active in city politics, like she would go to meetings.
Steele: She looks as if she has set out on her day and is prepared for everything. She's probably retired, but with this lady it doesn't mean she doesn't have a lot of things to do.
Horyn: Something tells me she did something during the Second World War. She was a nurse and she married her husband then.

Who Am I?
The Experts' Guesses
Buckingham: She's creative. She's maybe in the music business, maybe a writer for Nylon or Surface, a downtowny magazine, not like a Glamour or Cosmo. I'd say she's either single or newly married. She's definitely dressing to get attention -- but not sexy attention, just "look at me, I'm worth paying attention to" attention.
Hilfiger: I love her. She's a diva. She might be a salesperson at a clothing store or work in the music business. She probably buys clothes at full price at Barneys or in SoHo.
Ruttenstein: I think that she lives in SoHo or wishes that she did. I think she works for a modeling agency as a booker, or she could be a hostess at a restaurant like Fressen. I love the way she matches her outfit to the Dunkin' Donuts bag.
Horyn: She works in a store selling clothes or jewelry. I don't know who designed this. I'm not even sure it's a well-known designer. It could be someone young or interesting or funky, or someone she has picked up whom she likes. She strikes me as adventuresome in that way. She's not wildly informed about mainstream fashion.
Blass: She's far out in her dress, but she probably has a very conservative librarian job.
Buckingham: He's like a film critic or a restaurant critic. He could be a SoHo living-in-a-loft guy.
Hilfiger: He's like an interior designer or works in art. The glasses definitely make him seem as if he's a little bit of an artist. And how many men think of wearing an ivory trench coat with all navy? He's probably single. He has a little dog, a Yorkie or a dachshund or something.
Ruttenstein: He lives on the Upper East Side and is married with children. Let's say he's a lawyer.
Steele: There's a hint of spending money on the overcoat. He looks casual without the tie, but there's something about the coat that makes it look as if he has money to spend.
Horyn: He's a successful writer of smut literature -- I emphasize successful -- and he's not guilty about it. He's a tough guy, but friendly. He's successful. He's a New Yorker.
Buckingham: He's a D.J. He's got some attitude. His attitude is, "I just threw this on." But he didn't. He thought about it. Those aren't easy colors to pull off.
Hilfiger: He looks like a messenger. Messengers always wear so many layers of clothing.
Ruttenstein: This guy is cool. A wonderful mix of colors. Casual colors layered on top of each other. I think he's inspired by Spike Lee and may be a filmmaker himself.
Steele: It looks very New York, kind of Brooklyn. It's definitely a black urban style. Traditionally, if you wear stuff like that you'd be sort of working class. But the coloring is very good. He could be anything from unemployed to a record executive.
Horyn: He drives a taxi. He actually might have a more complicated life than that, or he might have a more intellectual job, but the appearance is of somebody who drives a taxi.

Who Am I?
The Experts' Guesses
Buckingham: She's really pretty. She's got a nice leather jacket, and the shoes are nice. She's got a cute figure, and she could do a lot better on her jeans. Maybe she's a bartender.
Hilfiger: At first, I thought she has to look really sexy because she works around men all day -- maybe in a plumbing office as an accountant. But then I realized she has Miu Miu shoes on, so I had to re-evaluate. I think maybe she's some Montauk woman who smokes a lot of cigarettes, or she's visiting the city from Texas.
Ruttenstein: She's an actress. She lives in Chelsea. I think she goes to casting calls a lot and takes acting lessons.
Steele: She's a little bit kind of 80's. But there's so much 80's retro flickering into fashion this season that you can't tell if it's an 80's look from New Jersey or an 80's look sort of coming from Milan.
Blass: She looks like everybody's daughter. Or granddaughter.
Buckingham: What's going on with this guy? He's been doing this look for a while. It works for him. He loves it. He's always got a new idea that's going to make him rich. Maybe he lives in Spanish Harlem. He's a ladies man -- oh, wait a minute, he's wearing a wedding band. So maybe he's married to a woman from the 70's and they are just happily married in another decade.
Hilfiger: I like this guy. He owns a car service and maybe has one of those air-freshener trees hanging from the rear-view mirror. He likes 70's soul music: Barry White and Earth, Wind and Fire. He's got a lot of girlfriends.
Steele: He's very extroverted. The glasses look quite flamboyant, and the big watch and the ring and everything else. You get the impression he's not single, but he wouldn't be averse to looking for other lady friends.
Blass: He ain't no preacher's son.
Hilfiger: She's definitely got money. She's an executive at a fashion house or newspaper. She probably drives in from Scarsdale.
Buckingham: She's a travel agent who runs her own business. She's worked hard and she wants you to know it. She's single and living in Queens. She doesn't strike me as an Upper East Side lady. It's just slightly one label too many. There's something about the way she wears it that says, "I've earned this."
Ruttenstein: She's wearing a Chanel jacket from previous seasons with an Herm<heart>s belt and a status scarf. She lives on the Upper East Side.
Horyn: She's from the northern New Jersey suburbs. She's married to somebody who's done reasonably well. She may have worked in the garment district as a model or for a photographer -- something where she had to look attractive. She obviously knows something about fashion.

HEADLINE: The Axis Of Austerity

BYLINE: By Ginia Bellafante; Ginia Bellafante is a fashion reporter for The Times. This is her first article for the magazine.

 BODY:
In 1899, the economist Thorstein Veblen proffered a theory about high fashion that would hold true for most of the next century. In fact, it would provide an answer to the question so often asked by ordinary people when they come into contact with clothes that cost more than sofas: "Why would anyone ever buy that?" The point of stylish outfits, Veblen maintained, was not simply to show the world that you were rich but to prove, in the most envy-making sense, that you had little to do but get dressed. A neat, expensive garment carries with it "an exemption from personal contact with industrial processes of any kind," he wrote. It argues that the person wearing it "consumes without producing."
When the Italian label Prada came to the world's attention in the early 1990's, it explored the notion that the taint of industry could actually be quite desirable. Prada trafficked in darkly colored clothes with clean lines and sedate hemlines -- not stuff for languishing about on yachts in Portofino. Early on, much of the Prada uniform -- including the all-important knapsack big enough to contain a Filofax and other vitals of urban life -- was forged out of seemingly stainproof black nylon. Today Prada Sport, ostensibly the company's leisure line, is so steeped in the language of technology that women and men wearing it can look as if they spend all their time in clean rooms assembling microchips. Here are expensive clothes that make you appear productive. 
 The virtue of productivity, as it turns out, is something that Miuccia Prada, the label's head designer, and her husband, Patrizio Bertelli, its C.E.O., understand a bit about. In less than two decades they have turned an ailing luggage enterprise into not only the ultimate signifier of urbane good taste but also a $1 billion business.
In recent months, the company has grown from a fashion house into a budding luxury-goods empire along the lines of Bernard Arnault's giant Louis Vuitton Mot Hennessy (LVMH). This year, Bertelli purchased majority stakes in the design houses of Helmut Lang and Jil Sander. Like Prada, Lang, an Austrian based in New York, and Sander, a German based in Hamburg, have built reputations as purveyors of an austere elegance. Their clothes are pricey and simply cut, and with the exception of truck shows or Mob weddings, there are few occasions at which you'd seem out of place wearing them. When Jil Sander sent a cotton skirt with a muted floral motif down the runway in Milan last month, it caused a buzz because she'd actually done something in a print.
Last month, Bertelli purchased nearly 83 percent of the British shoe company Church, known for its traditional men's footwear. At the same time, he announced that the Prada Group had formed a partnership with LVMH to purchase a 51 percent interest in the rival Milanese house of Fendi. Known for decades for its furs, Fendi has revived its accessories business with a series of small shoulder bags -- Baguettes" -- which cost, on average, $1,500 apiece.
By associating itself with other luxury brands, particularly those that share the Prada aesthetic, the company has managed to grow without reverting to licensing deals -- the sale of a designer name to manufacturers of hose, underwear and the like -- which can demystify and dilute a brand's image. Prada makes its own underwear -- a bra can cost $180. Even the company's youth-oriented Miu Miu line for women, meant to cost less than its collection, doesn't cost that much less at all. Go to a Miu Miu shop and you will find yourself stumbling across shoes for $350, a mere $50 saving over an actual pair of Pradas.
Although Miuccia Prada took over her family's luggage business in 1978, much of Prada's growth has come about in the past few years. In the 70's, Prada had a single shop in Milan, which sold about $400,000 worth of merchandise each year. In 1980, Prada, who had completed a doctorate in political science, formed an alliance with Bertelli, a leather manufacturer she'd met at a trade show. "He has a lot of energy, and she is more tranquil," explains Christina Ortiz, who ran the women's wear division until 1997. "She is always looking for something strange and eccentric to do, and he is always looking toward the commercial. He is earth, she is air." Bertelli began distributing a line of leather goods she designed, and in 1988 Prada started her clothing line for women. Miu Miu, Prada Sport and a men's wear line followed. By 1994, the company had a well-established store on East 57th Street in Manhattan and 12 in Japan. (The Japanese stores were franchises that the company took control of three years later.) Prada now has 132 stores around the world.
Building the department-store business, though, initially proved difficult. In 1993, the earth-minded Bertelli dispatched Patrizio di Marco, who had been working for Prada in Asia, to expand the company's business in the United States. While scouting locations for Prada stores, di Marco also worked to get Prada knapsacks and handbags the kind of attention -- that is, the same prime real estate -- other expensive accessories received in big department stores. "Everyone laughed at me," says di Marco, now the acting president of Celine. "I sounded like a nut case. Prominent people working in department stores told me Prada was too avant-garde."
Barneys New York, with its tradition of embracing the avant-garde, had actually been stocking Prada bags since the late 1980's, but it wasn't until 1992, as Marin Hopper of Elle magazine recalls, that they wound up on the wish lists of influential fashion editors like herself, without whose unabashed enthusiasm few up-market trends would ever gain momentum. Soon the lust spread. Judy Collinson, the store's general merchandise manager for women, remembers witnessing a fight outside Barneys' defunct downtown location, confirming for her the bags' fetish appeal. A man was challenging his mate to explain the purchase of a $200-plus knapsack.
Prada was bursting onto the scene in the midst of a recession, which led fashion observers to determine that the label appealed because it stood in stark opposition to status. In 1992, no one anticipated that this decade would turn out as wealth-obsessed as the mocked, maligned decade before it. People were searching for a quiet antidote to the excesses of the loud, Lacroix 1980's, the thinking went. But of course no one spends hundreds of dollars on a skirt or a tote in order to feel penitent and go unnoticed.
What came to be thought of as the functional Prada look -- quickly knocked off at J. Crew, at department stores, at Club Monaco -- wasn't anti-status; it was simply tapping into what status would ultimately become: work, so much cooler in the Palm Pilot, high-tech, I.P.O. 90's than in the Charlie Sheen "Wall Street" era before. If fashion takes its cues from idleness and fantasy, then Prada speaks to the chic dream of putting in 100-hour weeks at a new-media start-up.
But Prada has also pulled off a brilliant sleight of hand, selling itself as fashion's antithesis while at the same time achieving what fashion at its core must: the creation of a relentless desire for something new. Prada derived nearly 70 percent of its sales in 1998 -- and maintains its brand identity as the embodiment of the utilitarian -- from its unfussy accessories. Its high-end women's line, however, the one lusted after by fashion editors, is constantly being reconceived, sometimes in ways that have little to do with the public's image of Prada.
While Prada's clothes are always wearable, her ready-to-wear collections may allude to vastly different things from one season to the next. Since her early and influential "techno" collection, Miuccia Prada has made reference to Mongolian outerwear, military dress and all things ladylike, only to follow up with collections that reinterpreted the work-is-good ethos. In 1996, Prada turned out prints inspired by the workaday imagery of 60's Formica kitchen tops and polyester suits that looked like stewardess uniforms -- which served to remind the world, with a wink, what the brand was about.
In Milan last month, Prada shifted gears again, delighting buyers and press people with a feminine spring collection of skirts, silk blouses and cardigans that bore little resemblance to the gypsyish mustard woolens she had unveiled for this fall. The clothes were shown with practical handbags of black and white. No more than a dozen hours after the presentation, they could be seen on the arms of fashion editors all over the city. The hype mechanism was at work. Prada's accessories are so closely linked with the colors and patterns of its collections that its bags and shoes often seem glaringly out of date the minute new clothes are sent down the runway. It is safe to assume that Prada devotees will queue up for those purses, cavalierly tossing into the closet last year's must-haves.
Speaking on the subject of her evolution, Prada says simply: "I always believe in doing new things and using new materials that I have never used or that I didn't like for a long time. Black nylon is part of my passion for industrial things. However, right from the start I tried to combine industrial materials with completely opposite materials, such as trimmings and embroidery."
To understand Prada's design philosophy, you must understand a few things about Prada herself, explains Franca Sozzani, the editor in chief of Italian Vogue. "She was dressed in Saint Laurent since she was 20 years old," says Sozzani. "She's from a very wealthy family, but she's not bourgeois in her head. She's always found a way to get out of the predictable idea of the moment. She becomes bored with an idea almost immediately. She never wants to repeat herself." Repeat she doesn't, but reinvent she does, exploiting the possibilities of fashion under the aegis of a seemingly indomitable brand.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Spring Collection 2000: Jil Sander; Helmut Lang; Miu Miu (Corina Lecca); Mary Tyler Moore: "I felt strongly about wearing pants on 'The Dick Van Dyke Show' because that's the kind of thing real housewives wore. Until that point, I had always seen Marjorie Lord in a chiffon frock and high heels vacuuming, and I thought, 'This is just not real.' But the sponsors thought pants were too suggestive and asked if I would stop wearing them; I said I'd rather not. A lot of women through the years have said I was their inspiration to take that dangerous step and sometimes even wear jeans while cleaning the house!" (Photofest)

HEADLINE: HOLIDAY FILMS: CITYSCAPES;
When the Charisma of the City Steals the Limelight

BYLINE: By GRAHAM FULLER; Graham Fuller is the executive editor of Interview magazine and editor of "Loach on Loach," about the director Ken Loach.

 BODY:
IT'S home sweet home this movie season for some, but not all, directors who have their eyes fixed on city life. In "Bringing Out the Dead," Martin Scorsese depicts Manhattan as an update on Pandaemonium -- the capital of hell in Milton's "Paradise Lost" -- as he did in "Taxi Driver." In one bravura nighttime shot, filmed from the perspective of an ambulance driver (Nicolas Cage) losing his grip on reality, Mr. Scorsese turned the camera over to give the impression of what it's like to career sideways down Ninth Avenue, "unbalanced" being the requisite point of view.
In "Liberty Heights," Barry Levinson peers back with bittersweet nostalgia at the Baltimore of the 1950's, as he did in his first feature, "Diner." Even as it says good riddance to racial segregation, the new film laments the passing of a world in which burlesque shows were havens for lonely men and a Jewish paterfamilias might slip out of the synagogue on Rosh Hashana for a private showing of the latest Cadillac. 
 These directors are on safe territory, even if Mr. Scorsese's Manhattan is more luridly dystopic than ever. Woody Allen, until recently that least movable of Manhattanites, has meanwhile taken a road trip. Having allowed himself to be filmed touring Europe with his jazz combo in the 1998 documentary "Wild Man Blues," Mr. Allen has now made the shaggy-dog story "Sweet and Lowdown," which gads about America in the company of a self-deluding jazz guitarist (Sean Penn). The movie visits New York briefly, but the city is not the centripetal force it has been in a majority of Mr. Allen's pictures since "Annie Hall" (1977).
The directorial profession is wide enough to encompass wanderers and regionalists, pastoralists and city rats. "We're all gypsies," the nomadic David Lean said in a 1985 interview, but some directors repeatedly gravitate toward their old metropolitan haunts, even if most eventually range beyond them. Spike Lee, Hal Hartley and Abel Ferrara are other directors proffering radically opposed visions of New York. John Waters presents a camp alternative to Mr. Levinson's Baltimore and Gus Van Sant a poetic Portland, Ore., Further afield, there is Pedro Almodovar's melodramatic Madrid, Terence Davies's working-class Liverpool and Wong-kar Wai's kinetic Hong Kong. In the past, there was Rene Clair's studio-rendered Paris; Marcel Pagnol's Marseilles of boule, pastis and the waterfront; Federico Fellini's circuslike Rome and Yasujiro Ozu's middle-class Tokyo.
Some film cities are best represented by one or two indelible visions: Carol Reed's labyrinthine postwar Vienna in "The Third Man"; Alfred Hitchcock's dreamy, deceptively manicured San Francisco in "Vertigo"; Francis Ford Coppola's illusory Las Vegas in "One From the Heart" and Mike Figgis's Stygian equivalent in "Leaving Las Vegas"; Volker Schlondorff's Beirut of political and sexual treachery in "Circle of Deceit" and Ziad Doueri's version of the same wartorn city in the recent "West Beirut"; Goran Paskaljevic's necropolitan Belgrade in "The Powder Keg," and Wim Wenders's celestially perceived Berlin in "Wings of Desire."
Mr. Wenders is modern cinema's ultimate global citizen, as promiscuously cosmopolitan as Woody Allen is supposedly a one-city guy. Defying the conventional wisdom that a film should be set in a single arena, Mr. Wenders originally planned to shoot his 1991 science-fiction road movie "Until the End of the World" in 28 cities in 17 countries. (He eventually settled for seven cities and the Australian outback.) His films consistently grapple with how the here-and-now of cities like Berlin, Tokyo, Lisbon and Los Angeles interact with their pasts, and how that confluence affects their denizens. "In many respects, cities have their own character," he said in 1989, "so for me they become like having another star actor in a film."
"Wings of Desire" (1988), which represented a spiritual homecoming for Mr. Wenders after seven years of voluntary exile in America, is his quest for the soul of Berlin and, by extension, what remained of the German soul four decades after the war. It follows the fortunes of two unemployed guardian angels as they glide down to Berlin's autobahns and subways, its apartments and the wastelands by the wall, where they tune in to the innermost anxieties of the city's fretting populace.
As bound up as we are in the angels' desire to become mortal, they are primarily conduits for a metaphysical meditation on the film's mutating central character: Berlin itself. There is the sense that the city is itself telling the story and, as Mr. Wenders has suggested, that the citizens observed by the angels do not live in Berlin as much as Berlin lives in them. By the end of this remarkable film and its weaker 1993 sequel, "Faraway, So Close," even the angels have been absorbed into the city.
Mr. Wenders has spoken tenderly of the several stretches of wasteland he showed in "Wings of Desire," some of which the film memorialized before they were turned into formal gardens. He was acknowledging that a city's history is told as much by the gaps between buildings as by its architecture.
Mike Leigh has also made significant use of forgotten tracts of land, as well as the gaps between buildings, to staggering effect. Although Mr. Leigh is celebrated for his anthropologically based satires with their acid and compassionate observations of British manners, the visual fabric of his films is frequently neglected. Yet no one else has done as much to put contemporary London and its class divisions on the screen in the last 20 years, and certainly not with his deep understanding of how its physical and emotional topography are one and the same.
A grandchild of Jules Dassin's "Night and the City" (1950), Mr. Leigh's "Naked" follows the rake's progress of Johnny (David Thewlis), an overly articulate 30-ish Northerner burdened with existential angst, who rambles nocturnally through London's labyrinths in a doomed attempt to penetrate his own addled psyche. Like film noir heroes, he is guided by women, the usual crop of deadly Circes and benevolent Beatrices. He treats them cruelly or kindly, according to his whim. He buys one of them, a homeless Scottish lass separated from her boyfriend, a consoling cup of tea. But then the boyfriend turns up and begins kicking her. Instead of protecting her, Johnny wheels away in a single forlorn movement on the piece of empty ground on which he is standing. Where is he? Surely there are no bomb sites left in London. The empty space Johnny is occupying is, of course, the void between people, their failure to connect.
In Mr. Leigh's latest film, "Topsy- Turvy," set in London in 1884 and shot mostly in interiors, the librettist W. S. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) leaves the theater where his and Arthur Sullivan's "Mikado" is about to open. Lurching down an alley, he is clawed at and propositioned by several wretched women. Whatever this nightmarish interlude tells us about Gilbert's inner turmoil, this dab of Dickens puts into a social context the rarefied world of theatrical artifice in which the film is unfolding; it is Mr. Leigh's reminder to the audience that there is a grim reality beyond the world of make-believe.
The sequence mirrors the opening of "Naked," in which Johnny angrily copulates with a woman in a Manchester alleyway. But the film remains there only for the time it takes him to abandon her and set off for London. Mr. Leigh, who has not made an entire film outside London since he went to Belfast, Northern Ireland, for "Four Days in July" (1984), exults in London's places -- dark and light -- and its people, and he relishes probing (and sometimes filling) the gaps between them. It is hard to imagine London, dour and sluggish though it is beyond its center, getting to him in the same way Manhattan's supercaffeinated energy appears to have done recently -- superficially, at least -- to its cinematic champion.
Woody Allen has been escaping New York a lot lately. "Mighty Aphrodite" took flights of fancy to ancient Greece and "Everyone Says I Love You" to Venice and Paris. "Deconstructing Harry" culminated in a desperate flight upstate, making a quick detour to hell en route. Mr. Allen's "Celebrity" sent its main character on a humiliating side trip to Atlantic City, and the Manhattan it showed was a treacherous black-and-white film noir city, its slick, shimmering streets redolent of those in Alexander Mackendrick's "Sweet Smell of Success," the most baleful image of Manhattan on film.
Eighteen years before "Celebrity," Mr. Allen filmed "Manhattan," in black and white. Its evocative opening sequence is a montage of lambently photographed vistas, galvanizingly scored to "Rhapsody in Blue" with Mr. Allen contributing a voice-over paean to the city. Although that film, like "Celebrity," was the story of a self-deceiving writer led astray by the wrong woman , it revealed Mr. Allen's inviolable love of New York at that time.
Now, we're not sure what the artist in him thinks of the city. But New York is a habit he can't break. Not one scene of "Sweet and Lowdown" was shot more than an hour outside Manhattan. And when he learned I was writing this article, he passed on the message that he one day hopes to shoot an out-and-out Western without leaving Manhattan at all.
It's almost a relief to find Mr. Allen exploring what passes for Chicago, Los Angeles and the American hinterland in "Sweet and Lowdown," which has delightful scenes in provincial speak-easies, at a rural gas station, on a Hollywood set, and on a New Jersey boardwalk where you can feel the breeze. The film is more relaxed than anything else Mr. Allen has made in the 90's. He should get out of New York more often -- maybe go on a safari to Pennsylvania.
Mr. Scorsese exhibits a less ambiguous relationship with New York. Ever since he recreated Lower East Side street life in "Who's That Knocking at My Door?" (1968), he has reveled in depicting the most depraved, squalid and dehumanizing aspects of the city. Mr. Scorsese's city of earthly degradations embraces the infested 42nd Street of "Taxi Driver," the fetid animal pen that is the Bronx of "Raging Bull," the claustrophobic SoHo loft world of "After Hours," the nouveau riche Mafia enclaves of East Brooklyn in "Goodfellas," the mansions of malice in the 19th-century Upper East Side of "The Age of Innocence" and now Hell's Kitchen in "Bringing Out the Dead."
This is a New York that throbs with physical and emotional violence yet is never less than beautiful -- in the same way that nightmares can be beautiful, and Goya's paintings and Edgar Allan Poe's short stories. In the most startling image in "Bringing Out the Dead," a drug dealer impaled on a railing hangs off a balcony hundreds of feet above the city. It's an atrocity, but we cannot help admiring the view, a field of black velvet studded with jewels. The shot grows intrinsically out of the story being told, just one image in a phantasmagoria that provokes Mr. Cage's character to rescue a comatose patient's daughter as he travels through the bloody, garbage-heaped canyons.
The Manhattan of "Eyes Wide Shut," that other recent fable of a medical man seeking women to save or seduce on the island of lost souls, was, by contrast, passive. Stanley Kubrick's direction never transcended the distinct Old Europeanness of the source novella, as was evident in the film's sets of a Greenwich Village that resembles the real place but lacks its Eurotrashy bohemianism. Irrespective of its flora and fauna, the dramatic milieu Kubrick created was tangential to the film's forward action.
In all these movies, the city is more than mere backdrop; it is the hero's adversary, of which the siren, the damsel in distress, the opponent (pimp, crime lord, drug dealer, socialite), even the mother who appears as a hectoring giantess on the Manhattan skyline in Woody Allen's segment of "New York Stories," are mere operatives. They -- the people, whether flesh or fantasy -- embody the cities that issue them like genies. And perhaps the most authentic film city of all is the most genielike: the mirage of Las Vegas in "One From the Heart," which in its sublime studio artifice replicates the real Vegas better than any documentary could.
In the end, though, all film cities, made not of concrete and steel and blood and bone but of moments of time that have already passed, are phantoms -- projections of those fears and desires that each of us carries onto the real mean streets every day.

It Happened With One Movie: A Studio Transformed

BYLINE: By LEAH ROZEN; Leah Rozen is an associate editor and movie critic at People magazine.

 BODY:
"IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT" almost didn't. Only days before shooting was to begin, this 1934 screwball comedy, now a classic, lacked a leading lady. Established draws like Myrna Loy, Margaret Sullavan, Miriam Hopkins and Constance Bennett had all passed on playing the role of the runaway heiress who falls for a newspaperman during a cross-country bus trip. Hopkins reportedly sniffed, "Not if I never play another part."
Fortunately for both moviegoers and Columbia Pictures, "It Happened One Night" did happen. The movie, directed by Frank Capra and written by Robert Riskin, played a pivotal role in elevating Columbia from Hollywood's minor leagues to the majors. How fitting, then, that it is one of 75 movies unspooling at the Film Forum in Manhattan during the theater's wide-ranging eight-week celebration of Columbia's 75th anniversary, Friday to Jan. 13. 
 "Columbia was the scrappy little studio that could," said Michael Schlesinger, the studio's vice president for repertory sales, who sifted through 3,000 titles in its film library with Bruce Goldstein, Film Forum's director for repertory programming.
Part of the problem in lining up a top female star for "It Happened One Night" was Columbia itself. Because it specialized in cranking out low-budget films, the studio barely registered on Hollywood's prestige meters in the early 1930's. Big-name stars toiled at Columbia before they became big or when their careers were headed down. For stars still in their prime, doing a picture there often meant they were being lent to scruffy Columbia as punishment by their home studios.
That was the case with Clark Gable, who was lent to Columbia for the male lead in "It Happened One Night" by Louis B. Mayer, his boss at MGM, after a minor infraction. Gable considered going to Columbia akin to being banished to Siberia. According to Capra's 1971 autobiography, "The Name Above the Title," Gable showed up drunk for their first meeting, slurringly shared his Columbia-as-Siberia theory with Capra, then bellowed at workers in Columbia's courtyard, "Why ain't you wearing parkas?"
It was Harry Cohn, the penny-pinching, plain-speaking head of production at Columbia, who solved the leading lady problem. "I gotta brainstorm -- Claudette Colbert," he told Capra. The director, who had clashed with the feisty Colbert while steering her movie debut back in 1927, a flop called "For the Love of Mike," protested that she was already under contract to Paramount Pictures.
"Yeah, yeah, but she's taking a four-week vacation," Cohn said."And I heard the French broad likes money." (Colbert was born in Paris but immigrated to the United States as a child.) "Why don't you and Riskin go see her personal?"
Capra dropped by Colbert's house on Nov. 21, 1933, and found her packing for a holiday trip to Sun Valley, Idaho. Colbert told Capra that she would make his movie only if Columbia doubled her usual pay -- $50,000 instead of $25,000 -- and if Capra promised that she would finish shooting by Dec. 23 so she could celebrate Christmas with pals in Sun Valley. Deal, Capra said.
Working with a budget of $325,000 (high by Columbia standards, but puny when one considers that glitzy MGM was routinely lavishing $1 million on its A pictures) and a four-week shooting schedule, Capra and his cast had to scramble. "We slammed through the film clowning, laughing, ad-libbing," Capra wrote. Colbert made it to Sun Valley for the holidays, where, Capra said, she told friends, "I just finished the worst picture in the world."
QUITE the opposite. Viewing "It Happened One Night" today, one reacts the same way audiences did in 1934, guffawing loudly throughout and sighing with contentment at the happy ending. The Depression-era movie is funny and full of hope. And the justly famous hitchhiking scene, in which Colbert proves to Gable that a shapely gam is mightier than a north-pointing thumb, is still a model of comic economy and character development. Colbert's uptight heiress learns to loosen up, and Gable's know-it-all newspaper man realizes that he can still learn a few tricks.
The movie made tubs of money for Columbia, and at the Academy Awards ceremony in 1935, "It Happened One Night" become the first film to nab the top five Oscars, for best picture, director, actor, actress and screenplay. (Its quintuple sweep went unmatched for more than 40 years, duplicated only in 1976 by "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and in 1992 by "The Silence of the Lambs.") For Columbia, winning that clutch of Oscars was as if the lady with a torch in the studio's familiar logo had gone from holding aloft a single wooden match to a klieg light. The studio was now in the big time.
Which is just where Harry Cohn had always thought he and his studio belonged. The son of an immigrant tailor, Cohn grew up in the Yorkville section of Manhattan, quit school at 14 and worked as a singer, a streetcar conductor and a song peddler before going into the movie business. With his older brother Jack and a buddy named Joel Brandt, Harry founded Cohn-Brandt-Cohn Film Sales, the forerunner to Columbia Pictures, in 1919.
While his brother and Brandt minded business in New York, Cohn moved to Los Angeles, where he set up shop alongside other fly-by-night film companies on Gower Street, a shabby stretch dismissed as Poverty Row by the movie industry's power elite. The same elite soon dubbed ragged C.B.C. Corned Beef and Cabbage, which may explain why C.B.C. incorporated itself as the classier-sounding Columbia Pictures in 1924. Hence this year's celebration of its 75th anniversary.
As Columbia grew, cheap remained its byword. "Cohn was willing to pay money where it counted: for scripts and directors, sometimes even stars, but not elsewhere," Mr. Schlesinger said. Cohn especially scrimped on sets and costumes, which explains why the studio turned out comparatively few epics, costume dramas (except westerns) and elaborate musicals, and why it excelled at contemporary comedies and hard-edged film noir, genres that rarely required large casts or massive, specially constructed sets.
Cohn's parsimony meant Columbia had few superstars to call its own. Whereas MGM, whose official slogan boasted that it had "more stars than there are in heaven," could claim Gable, Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Spencer Tracy, Judy Garland and dozens more, Cohn's biggest stars were Jean Arthur, Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak. Each was queen of the Columbia lot during her era: Arthur in the 1930's, Hayworth in the 40's and Ms. Novak in the 50's. Those three actresses account for 13 of the movies on the Film Forum's Columbia salute, offering fans ample opportunity to compare and contrast their varying styles and talent.
If you have never seen (or heard) Arthur, don't miss this chance. A piquant blond, she possessed a voice like gurgling water spiked with a splash of whiskey. Although she had appeared in films since the 20's, Arthur did not become popular until Cohn cast her opposite Edward G. Robinson in John Ford's delightful comedy "The Whole Town's Talking" (1935). At Columbia, Arthur excelled at playing smart, wisecracking big-city career women, often newspaper reporters, who started out cynical but turned meltingly gooey once they fell for the hero. Off screen, the reticent Arthur chafed at Cohn's blowhard style and dictatorial ways; boss and star were constantly involved in fractious disputes. When Arthur finally won release from her contract in 1944, she ran through the streets of Columbia's lot howling: "I'm free! I'm free!"
THE Brooklyn-born Hayworth (originally Margarita Carmen Cansino) began dancing professionally when she was 12. In 1937, after Hayworth had spent two years doing bit parts at other studios, Cohn signed her to a long-term contract and dyed her naturally black hair auburn. But not until Life magazine ran its famous pinup photo of Hayworth kneeling on a bed in 1941 did Cohn fully realize her worth to Columbia. He stopped lending Hayworth out to other studios and instead put the radiant actress into a series of mindless but successful musicals, including "Cover Girl" (1944), with Gene Kelly. Hayworth became a full-fledged Love Goddess when she peeled off her gloves while purring "Put the Blame on Mame" in "Gilda" (1946). Her steamy turn is double-billed at the Film Forum with her other most significant performance, as a femme fatale in "The Lady From Shanghai" (1948), a quirky thriller directed by and co-starring Orson Welles, who was married to her at the time.
Ms. Novak supplanted Hayworth at Columbia. With show-business training that consisted of traveling the country as Miss Deepfreeze and demonstrating refrigerators, she got her first break in Hollywood in 1954 as an extra in "French Line," a musical most notable for showcasing in 3-D Jane Russell's hefty chest. Cohn decided he could transform Ms. Novak into Columbia's own version of Marilyn Monroe after inexplicably letting the real Marilyn slip through his grasp. (In 1949, he had opted against picking up Columbia's option on Monroe's six-month contract after casting her in a single cheapie musical, "Ladies of the Chorus." He told associates, "The girl can't act.") Cohn gave the inexperienced Ms. Novak, whose pale blonde beauty and shapely figure always outshone her acting, a big publicity buildup and succeeded in turning her into a major star for a few years in such heavy-breathing pictures as "Picnic" (1955) and "Bell, Book and Candle" (1958).
If Arthur, Hayworth and Novak were Columbia's three leading ladies, their male counterparts were Moe, Curly and Larry. The Three Stooges wreaked their special brand of violent comic havoc at Columbia from 1934 to 1958, turning out a steady stream of shorts. "They should be the studio logo, if you ask me," joked Mr. Goldstein of Film Forum, who selected two of the Stooges' best two-reelers for the series. "Men in Black" (1934) is the Stooges' antic, Oscar-nominated short -- yes, you read that right -- spoof of "Men in White," a somber doctor drama MGM had released earlier that year, and "In the Sweet Pie and Pie" (1941) is a comic confection that Stooges aficionados consider the trio's "Citizen Kane."
Other gems from Columbia to be seen during the series include "His Girl Friday" (1940), "Born Yesterday" (1950), "Dr. Strangelove" (1964), "Cat Ballou" (1965) and "Taxi Driver" (1977), as well as such overlooked but worthy titles as "3:10 to Yuma" (1957), a western based on a story by Elmore Leonard, and "Fail-Safe" (1965), Sidney Lumet's cold-war thriller. "We came up with a lot of oddball choices, movies that aren't seen too often but are good," Mr. Goldstein said. "I really can't wait to see a lot of this stuff."

Precision Marks Show of Mostly Black and White Drawings

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ZIMMER 

DATELINE: IRVINGTON

 BODY:
IN these days of ever-splashier exhibitions, an austere one is sure to stand out. At the Gallery on the Hudson here, a show of mostly black and white drawings with some purposeful hints of color is absorbing because it has layers. A wealth of possible visual experiences emerges if the viewer spends time with the drawings.
The show is "A Fine Line Between . . . " a reference to the precision that is the hallmark of most of the work. Nine artists are represented. Most of them live in New York City, but Kumi Korf lives in Ithaca, Creighton Michael in Mount Kisco and Patricia Wright in Irvington. In selecting works for the exhibition, Leslie Scheiblberg, the gallery director, and Carol Edelson, an artist who is on the gallery's board of advisers, visited a number of studios, and Ms. Scheiblberg said they they found themselves drifting toward work where line itself carries the day; this means going away from representation and toward abstraction, but the real world, especially nature, is implied everywhere. 
 Ms. Korf's drawings are inspired by a tree outside a window in Vermont. She uses mainly charcoal and oil stick, and one of her two works here, "MM XI" (the title probably comes from her method of cataloguing her work) is presented like a painting. Although the marks are made on paper, the paper is fixed to canvas. An area of light ocher imparts a feeling of autumn. Her second all-charcoal drawing, presented under glass, is hazier overall, and more specifically, describes the tree, a willow, which is her model.
Jimbo Blachly is primarily a sculptor, and Ms. Scheiblberg notes that artists who invest heavily in drawing are more likely to be sculptors than painters. Drawing is how sculptors work out their big ideas. Mr. Blachly's untitled drawings, however, give little hint of coming from a sculptor. One of them, on what is listed as a Chinese paper, is full of little ink marks organized roughly in rows; they plunge the viewer into what seems to be an environment like a Chinese landscape, but it is landscape seen especially close-up.
Objects from the real, mundane world make an appearance in Stephen Antonson's drawings, which are based on apartment house facades. He eliminates the structure of the facade though, and concentrates only on the rows of windows. Patricia Wright's works are essentially contours filled in and has the most hedonistic drift in the show. She presents two flowers in exuberant beginning stages of life, "First Bud and "Hollow Bud," and the buds have almost the heft of boulders. Her third, more intensely black drawing is called "Fallen Tulip" and of course it evokes the end of life. But reassuringly, this downcast shape is close to the shapes of the buds.
James Bohary's drawings are organizations of rather thick, bar-like charcoal lines. The placement of the lines and their relationship to one another is done to give the drawing maximum energy, and the one called "Orchid," evokes something similar in feeling yet very different from Ms. Wright's whole flowers.
The way in which the elements in a thicket of lines relate to one another is also a concern of Katherin Hilten, who works in graphite of different types applied with different pressures. The contrast of dominating bold lines and softer, lighter ones is essential. It works to make ideas of surface and recession in depth as central to her concerns as the lines play across the paper. Her compositions are thickets of such lines, and if a viewer pays close attention to this massing, the marks seem to dance. This sensation is redoubled in Ms. Hilten's largest piece done on heavier paper. Here a third kind of line is introduced in addition to the bold and light ones: she makes slashes in the paper with a sharp knife.
Mr. Michael and Elise D'Arrigo have strong reputations as abstract sculptors and their drawings here, though they do not look very much like their three-dimensional works, recall their effects. Mr. Michael works primarily in steel but has incorporated other disparate elements like plywood and fiberglass in his sculptures. That sense of disparateness characterizes his drawings here. The series is titled "Split" and the paper is divided in two horizontally. The upper half, coated with shellac, is strewn with thick graphite spirals, while the untreated bottom half contains fine, elegant pencil lines that make streamlined shapes. The two halves work together to produce a rare, but purposely choreographed harmony.
Ms. D'Arrigo's two drawings are both called "Chiaroscuro," the traditional name for a bold contrast of light and dark. She effects this contrast, which implies volume, carefully, by building a shape out of pieces of Japanese rice paper and then drawing on it with ink. The shapes in the two drawings here, essentially a cascade and a vessel, have a certain sculptural-relief quality because of the collaged paper, and Ms. D'Arrigo creates a haunting sensation by drawing numerous circles on her shapes, some of which are like wheels but others are riveting, like eyes.
Exhibitions that create sensations are, of course, very in right now, and this show has a couple of incidents of discreet disturbance. Ms. D'Arrigo's probing circles are one instance and Charles Spurrier's choice of materials is another. One of his untitled drawings is a grid of tangled lines, but the lines are reddish human hair, affixed to tape which is then applied to paper. His other work, which conjures up a brick wall, is composed of his red-tinted fingerprints applied to strips of tape.
"A Fine Line Between . . . " is at the Gallery on the Hudson through Nov. 28. For information, the number to call is 591-1378.

Y2K Concerns Help Slow Year-End Office Sales

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
THESE are roller-coaster times for the sale of office buildings in New Jersey. After six months of steady rises, sales eased in October and are expected to continue to slow in the waning weeks of 1999, then rebound in the new year.
Industry professionals said several factors took much of the zip out of year-end office sales in New Jersey. Interest rates crept up last month, as did fears that lenders would not originate loans amid worries they would be unable to sell them on Wall Street because of Y2K computer date-related concerns, which, in turn, caused many sellers not to market their buildings. So far, the retreat of lenders has been less significant than expected. 
 Still, Michael Tepedino, a senior managing director at the Manhattan office of Holliday Fenoglio Fowler, a commercial mortgage banking company, said there were fewer than usual lenders making loans through the end of the year. Moreover, he said, many intend to stop lending from Dec. 15 to Jan. 15 as a defense against possible computer glitches, making it difficult for investors to consummate deals. And those buyers looking to do last-minute deals may end up paying 5 to 10 percent higher interest rates, he said.
As a result of those possible rate increases, said Gary Gabriel, associate director of the Financial Services Group at Cushman & Wakefield, the national commercial brokerage, investors either will try to renegotiate a lower purchase price or settle for a lower return on their investment.
Brokers say some buyers will delay closings. Charles Kushner, president of the Kushner Companies, a developer in Florham Park, said that while he was committed to buying a 100,000-square-foot secondary office building for $40 million he would not close the deal until January. "The overriding sentiment from lenders is to wait," he said, adding, however, that if a solid year-end deal came along "we will close despite the higher rates."
But other developers who locked in financing early say they intend to close by the end of the year. Among them is Denholtz Associates of Rahway, which will close on two buildings, in Middlesex and Bergen Counties, with a total of 400,000 square feet and valued at $40 million. Another is the Advance Group of Bedminster, which will also close on two buildings, in Somerset and Ocean Counties, valued at $30 million with a total of over 500,000 square feet.
This is the second year in a row in which fourth-quarter sales have slowed. The 1998 slump was due to difficulties in the capital markets last fall and winter set off by the financial crises in Asia and Russia. This year it is the perceived risk in the market because of Y2K worries.
The worries are "more perception than reality," said Robert Entin, president of Integrated Business Systems, a software company in Fairfield that provides accounting systems to real estate owners and developers. "The problem is simple to fix," he said. "It's the volume of programs that have to be changed that's the concern." He added that the computer failures that might happen would be "spotty, not massive."
Steve Kohn, managing director of the capital markets group at Sonnenblick-Goldman, a real estate investment banking company in Manhattan, added: "Most of the Y2K jitters occurred in the third quarter and the panic has waned." There will be an impact, but it will be temporary, he said.
In the fourth quarter 12 buildings with a total of 6 million square feet have been or will be sold in the 11-county northern and central New Jersey office market, for a total value of $799 million, reported Cushman & Wakefield. Though those figures are greater than the 12 buildings that sold for $600 million in the last quarter of 1998, the two final-quarter tallies do not equal the 22 buildings that sold for $1.5 billion in the last quarter of 1997.
DESPITE sluggish fourth-quarter sales the state will probably end 1999 on an even keel, said Mr. Gabriel. And since many deals are being held off the market until January the pace will pick up again in the first quarter of the new year, he said.
Moreover, he said, capital for purchases will again be flowing as concerns over Y2K and interest rates lessen. The fundamentals of the office market remain strong as tenants continue to lease space, causing vacancy rates to remain stable and rents to creep up.
The overall vacancy rate in the third quarter was 12.4 percent, which while slightly higher than the 11.3 percent recorded in 1998 is expected to drop by year's end as available space is absorbed. At the same time average asking rents rose to an annual rate of $22.62 a square foot from $20.85.
The state's strong economy and job market are also expected to help. New Jersey is expected to add 60,000 to 65,000 more jobs by year's end, according to state figures.
But the dynamics of the investment market next year will be different, said Jonathan B. Schultz, president of the Schultz Organization, a commercial brokerage and advisory firm in Woodbridge. "Investors will not be able to obtain the same fast and high returns they have in the past," Mr. Schultz said. "They will have to hold properties, which have stabilized, for the long term, which is how real estate has traditionally been transacted."
The quick returns, he said, will not be as available as in the past because rents have increased in most submarkets to a high enough level to support new construction. Moreover, the price to acquire an existing building is at or close to the cost of constructing a new one, he added, noting that while financing for new construction is tougher to secure, it is available for projects in good locations with substantial preleasing. There are also fewer buyers. Real estate investment trusts, with their appetite for large deals, have diminished as a force in the market, replaced by pension funds, foreign buyers and private entrepreneurs, among others.
Mr. Gabriel of Cushman & Wakefield said that in 2000 his brokerage projects an increase in stabilized properties coming on the market, most of them Class B buildings.
Investors who in the past bought on the theory that rents could be improved say they recognize that much of the upside has been taken out of buildings. Still, they say, they will continue to search out deals.
Denholtz Associates, for instance, purchased 16 buildings, with a total of 600,000 square feet of mostly industrial space, with some office space, off Route 46 in Fairfield at a total cost of $28 million from the GE Credit Corporation, which provided the financing. The company's partner in the deal is the Zaro Group, an investment group in Ocean City.
Denholtz is investing $3 million to upgrade the buildings, renamed Fairfield 46 Business Center, has increased their occupancy from 75 to 90 percent and has raised rents by an average of 10 percent. The office space rents for $15.50 to $20 a square foot annually, while the industrial space rents for $4.75 to $7.75 a square foot.
"It's our typical value-added play," said Steven J. Denholtz, the company's managing partner, noting that such opportunities were becoming more difficult to find. "We know we can no longer make a killing and need to be more careful in selecting properties," he said, "because you just can't assume there will be the same rent increases of the past."
He said his company also had turned its attention to development. On a 127-acre former industrial site off Route 35 in Holmdel Denholtz is seeking approvals to develop a mixed-use complex that will contain 300,000 square feet of office and retail space and 150 assisted-living residences.
The same strategy is being pursued by the Advance Group and the Kushner Companies, each of which has office projects under way or planned. On Columbia Turnpike in Florham Park, Kushner has started construction on a 135,000-square-foot speculative office building that is to be completed by late next year.
And the Advance Group is developing three speculative buildings -- each with 44,000 to 88,000 square feet in Somerset and Hunterdon counties -- that it expects to complete by the middle of next year. It also plans to start a 100,000-square-foot building next year once 30 percent of the space has been preleased, said Gregory N. Senkevitch, the company's chief financial officer.
"The opportunities to buy buildings next year will not be as great as in the recent past and they will have a less dramatic upside," he said, but added: "We still think it will be a decent year for acquisitions."

HEADLINE: Riders Sitting High in the Saddle

BYLINE: By SYDNEY LADENSOHN STERN 

 BODY:
SOME of Westchester County's finest riders and horses jumped to the head of their classes last weekend when they joined the country's top equestrian competitors at Madison Square Garden for the 116th National Horse Show. Even to qualify for the premier equestrian event in the United States is an honor -- the show includes Olympic and world championship competitors -- and Westchester riders and horses not only participated. In many cases they also won.
Madison Square Garden was transformed for the occasion. At a cost of more than $60,000, the arena floor was covered with specially blended dirt instead of wood or ice, and where tall young men frequently leap to stuff balls through baskets, large horses, often ridden by small teenage girls, strained to surmount high hurdles. Horse shows may not draw the same numbers as the Knicks but, according to National Horse Show representatives, 27 million people older than 12 ride every year, 14.6 million of them regularly. The female to male ratio is 2.5 to 1. 
 The ratio among the top riders is not quite as lopsided. Eric Hasbrouck, a Bedford resident and one of the country's top Grand Prix jumping competitors, placed second in a $10,000 jumper event Nov. 4 and first in another last Sunday. On Monday he boarded a plane for Europe to shop for horses.
Besides riding competitively, Mr. Hasbrouck, 39, works as a professional trainer, a job that goes far beyond giving riding lessons. Trainers are paid to find horses for their students, to ride and school horses as well as riders, to accompany students to horse shows, to coach them there, to oversee the horses' well being (grooms usually do the actual caretaking) and to decide when their riders should move on to another horse. Mr. Hasbrouck, who hopes to make the Olympic 2000 team, said he loves his work as a trainer. "What gives me the most enjoyment is training young horses and kids and bringing them along," he said. "And the victories are not always in the ribbons."
Georgina Bloomberg, 16, whom the judges chose as best child rider in this year's show, has been riding since she was 3 1/2 and entered her first show at 6. Georgina lives in Manhattan but rides at Old Salem Farm in North Salem two or three days a week after school, plus any weekend that she is not away at shows. Her hunter Diplomacy was the top winning junior hunter of the year last year, although when she rode him in the 1998 show he performed disappointingly. This year they worked so well together that Diplomacy was the show's champion large junior hunter (meaning a large hunter ridden by a junior rider). Furthermore, the grand champion hunter of the show was Dialog L, another horse Georgina owns.
Although she rides him at the stable, Georgina is not allowed to ride Dialog L competitively until he is gelded -- he is a stallion and juniors are not allowed to compete on them. He was ridden by Georgina's trainer, Scott Stewart, who trains all the horses and students at Old Salem.
The difference between hunters and jumpers is like the difference between figure skaters and speed skaters. Both jump difficult courses, but the hunters are judged on the elegance of their performance while jumpers compete on speed.
Like Mr. Hasbrouck, Kate Levy, 19, of Katonah, prefers jumping events. "Hunter classes are judged on the horse and are completely subjective, versus the jumpers, which are 100 percent objective," Ms. Levy explained. "It is based on time against the clock, versus the judges' opinions. Jumpers have to jump high, fast and clear, and the courses ask a lot of the riders."
Ms. Levy, a 1999 John Jay High School graduate, postponed entering Georgetown University for a year to work at Heritage Farm in Somers and compete as an adult with her horse Opus in the amateur-owner jumper classes. This was Ms. Levy's third year to qualify for the show, but her first as an adult.
Actually, Ms. Levy did not qualify this year; Opus did. In hunter and jumper events, the horses, not the riders, are judged; the horses qualify for the national show and anyone can ride them. In equitation events (which also include jumping) the riders rather than the horses are judged and the qualifying riders can ride any horse.
Before she became an adult rider Ms. Levy rode in the Garden for two years in the Maclay Championship finals , the most prestigious contest for junior riders in the country (qualifying junior riders are younger than 18 on the previous Dec. 1). This year Cullen Latimer, 18, of Pound Ridge, and Beth Honig, 17, of Bronxville, rode in the Maclay; Ms. Latimer for the fourth year and Beth for the second. Ms. Latimer did not know until a week before the show what horse she would ride -- the horse she had planned to use had become lame. Her trainer arranged to borrow the same horse Ms. Latimer also had to borrow to ride in the previous year's competition. Such last minute arrangements are not unusual -- horses get sick or injured and people help one another out.
Even so, in borrowing her mount, Ms. Latimer was in the minority. Most of the riders who qualify for the National Horse Show not only own their own horses, but many of them also own several. Mr. Stewart, the trainer, said many of the riders at this show own both a hunter and a jumper. Show-quality horses start at $20,000 and more, and most of the horses in the national show cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Grand Prix jumpers, which take part in the most demanding courses and compete for the largest purses, may cost more than $1 million or $2 million.
Mr. Hasbrouck said, "There are more good riders than good horses," which means the competition for the good ones pushes the prices up. Furthermore, buying a horse is only the beginning. Simply boarding a horse in Westchester typically costs at least $1,500 a month, and that must be supplemented by veterinary bills, shoeing fees, riding lessons, show entry fees, transportation fees to shows, grooming expenses, mane and tail braiding for hunter events, and more.
At a cost of tens of thousands of dollars a year, showing horses at this level is clearly not for the impecunious, but several longtime riders insisted that the sport was not completely elitist. Mr. Hasbrouck bought his first horse for $100 and worked his way up by training horses and riders, as have many of the professional riders. Ms. Latimer's mother, Brooke, also contended that while money is an important factor, "You don't need to be incredibly wealthy -- you can ride other people's horses and pay lease fees.
"If someone wants to sell a horse and wants to showcase it, they may lend it, for example."
Ms. Latimer had an advantage some riders do not have. "I had ridden as a child and knew the horse world," Brooke Latimer said, "so I could guide her through it and do things in the most economical way -- I could find horses that weren't outrageously expensive."
As Brooke Hodgson, Cullen's mother was the 1968 Maclay champion, making her a member of a very select group, and horses would not be lent for showcasing were not Cullen such an outstanding rider and the Maclay such a prestigious showcase.
The top level in the horse show world is a contrast-filled universe, and perhaps it is those very contrasts that give it such individuality. There is affluence but there is also danger -- even the best rounds can be one stumble away from disaster. The actor Christopher Reeve was a skilled and safety-conscious rider, but when he severed his spinal cord he was jumping a much lower hurdle than the junior riders routinely surmount. There is world-class competition but there are also touches of adolescence.
Georgina rides some of the top horses in the world but her fingernails are covered with frosted lavender nail polish. And always, there are the horses. "The horses are humbling," Brooke Latimer said. "Even the best horses can have a bad day. You never know what they'll do."

HEADLINE: Putting Tax-Delinquent Properties Into New Hands

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
AT some point in the not too distant future 47 tax-delinquent properties in the Bronx, 20 of them parcels of vacant land, will complete a transfer to new ownership that has been initiated by city government -- even though city government itself will never take title.
The technique goes by the name of third-party transfers, and it is the most inventive of all the anti-abandonment strategies that the Giuliani administration has devised. Avoiding owner abandonment and ultimate city takeover of distressed property has been one of the administration's principal housing themes from the start. 
 Third-party transfers are intended as a way to get properties that owners have shown no interest in retaining efficiently into the hands of capable nonprofit or for-profit owner-managers, without intervening city ownership or management. It is being done via a newly formed nonprofit intermediary entity that is to hold title during a transitional period.
This procedure is bringing a fundamental change to the historic "in rem" foreclosure process for real estate under which the city itself has owned and in most cases managed thousands of units of housing, usually for a period of many years, after a court proceeding. After costly and not always effective management, the buildings are rehabilitated and transferred to private or some form of nonprofit ownership.
To this day, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development holds 28,600 units of housing in 3,100 buildings in its portfolio of tax-foreclosed properties, even though there has been no new taking of tax-delinquent residential property since 1995.
That was the year the Giuliani administration suspended the takings while its new policies emerged. An early step was the enactment of Local Law 37 by the City Council in 1996. Under the law, once multifamily properties have been delinquent in taxes for a year, the city may begin a foreclosure action. When a court judgment is obtained, the housing agency has eight months in which to transfer title to itself or to a third party.
In the first four months the law assures owners the right to pay off the debt, or enter into an installment agreement to pay it. In the next four months, the redemption agreement may still be obtained, but it is discretionary on the city's part.
With the intention of testing the third-party transfer approach, the city began a foreclosure action last year against 174 properties in a single tax district of the South Bronx. The area includes parts of Hunts Point, Longwood, Melrose, Morrisania, Mott Haven and Port Morris. It turned out that 128 of the 174 ownerships, or 73 percent, showed up to enter into installment agreements, said Robin Weinstein, acting deputy commissioner in charge of the Office of Housing Intervention and Resources. The office was formed last year to run the anti-abandonment program.
THE remaining 46 properties were assembled in packages for which for-profit and nonprofit housing operators were invited to bid. At the same time, the housing agency signed an agreement with a new nonprofit entity called Neighborhood Restore, whose role is to take title temporarily and see the properties through a transition period. It took title to the 46 properties last August.
Neighborhood Restore has a nine-member board of directors that includes bankers and community development leaders and is headed by Lewis P. Jones, vice chairman of Chase Community Development Corporation, the community development arm of Chase Manhattan Bank.
Thomas Ciano, its executive director and a former deputy commissioner of the Department of Homeless Services, said that the operation is on schedule to complete title transfers by the end of May, about two months ahead of the one-year deadline. Efforts are under way to line up the financing that the owners will need for further rehabilitation when they take title, he said.
All these properties are considered "distressed," and the tax liens are therefore not considered salable in the private market. Under another 1996 law, Local Law 26, the city has been selling tax liens of properties with greater economic viability to a trust, which then securitizes the liens. In six sales of packages of properties so far, the process has produced initial cash advances to the city that average 81 percent of the value of the liens, according to the Department of Finance, with the prospect of additional income once purchasers of the securities have been paid.
Local Law 37 defines a distressed property as one in which the tax lien is at least 15 percent of a property's market value. In addition, the distressed property has to have at least five Class B (hazardous) or Class C (immediately hazardous) building code violations, or at least $1,000 in liens for unpaid city emergency-repair work.
These conditions have not discouraged applicants from seeking to take over the owner-management role. A total of 120 nonprofit or for-profit companies submitted their qualifications to become possible future owners. Five were chosen by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development in May for the properties in the round-one cycle.
Three of them are nonprofits: the Belmont/Arthur Avenue Local Development Corporation, a 20-year-old organization that operates 45 buildings in the Bronx, with 1,300 apartments; Community Assisted Tenant Controlled Housing Inc., known as Catch, a foundation-supported citywide mutual housing association in which the Parodneck Foundation is the lead agency, and Neighborhood Housing Services, a nonprofit organization that offers various types of housing programs and services.
THE two private sector organizations are Jerome Associates, the ownership arm of a family-owned plumbing business, Crescent Contracting, on Webster Avenue; and Metropolitan Resources Group, a joint venture of principals of L.& M. Equity Participants, of Larchmont, N.Y., a longtime owner/developer of housing rehabilitated under city programs, and Lemle & Wolff Inc., which manages 5,400 apartments in the Bronx and Manhattan.
The specific causes that led past owners to abandon these 47 properties are by now shrouded in the mists of history. But there are clues. Joseph Cicciu, for 20 years the executive director of the Belmont/Arthur Avenue local development corporation, noted that it was difficult for owners with a small portfolio of buildings to achieve economies in costs, and if rents are too low or uncollectible, a building may soon fail.
In some cases the tenants themselves may have become the owners under a city disposition program, and ultimately, as early leaders depart or die, rent collections may weaken. In round one, three of the seven buildings with 20 apartments or more were formerly owned by the tenants themselves. Tenant ownership may take either the rental or limited-equity co-op form.
"There can be a turnover in leadership, an unexpected rise in costs, a reluctance to raise maintenance charges or rents, or a reluctance to take neighbors to housing court -- any number of reasons," said Harold de Rienzo, president of Catch, whose three-building package includes the 53-unit formerly tenant-owned co-op at 865 East 167th Street, off Intervale Avenue. "When that happens the tenants may just stop paying municipal charges," he said.
Other distressed buildings for which third-party owners have been selected have already been functioning under court-appointed management because of unsatisfactory housing conditions. Hale G. Rickman, a principal of Jerome Associates, was the court-appointed manager at 232 Cypress Avenue, with 20 apartments and a store, on the corner of East 138th Street. It was one of the buildings in a package of five, with 90 apartments, that Jerome Associates is now managing and expects to get from Neighborhood Restore. Mr. Rickman said that the deplorable conditions he found at the building are already being corrected with the help of a $150,000 loan from the housing agency.
When the properties are transferred to third-party owners, rehabilitation loans will be in place to upgrade all the properties. The Jerome Associates buildings include two vacant walk-ups at 613 and 627 East 141st Street and the occupied 25-unit building at 1071 Franklin Avenue.
"We intend to keep the existing tenants in place at the same rent they're aleady at, but the vacant apartments will go for about $550 for a one-bedroom and $650 for a two-bedroom," Mr. Rickman said.
But the road to a successful outcome is not necessarily smooth. Tenant hostility is one of the possible obstructions. Tenants at the eight-unit building at 839 East 156th Street, one of the six buildings that Metropolitan Resources Group is to get, have not even allowed the new managers inside.
"We've written them four letters and we're trying to assuage their fears," said Frank Anelante, a principal in the company. "But we have to have access to determine the scope of rehabilitation that's needed and we've started legal action to get it."

HEADLINE: ART;
In Stamford, Art and Artifacts That Tell a Story of Women

BYLINE: By BESS LIEBENSON 

 BODY:
THE exhibition "Of Significant Influence: Women of Stamford, Past and Present," which is on view at the Stamford Historical Society through Saturday, began with the idea of focusing on seven Stamford women who became well known locally or nationally for their accomplishments: the comedian Gilda Radner, the singer Libby Holman, the philanthropist Helen Altschul, the political activist Louise Seeley, the urban renewal proponent Edith Sherman, the educator Sarah Francis Smith and the physician Dr. Joyce Yerwood.
The husband and wife curators of the exhibition -- Joshua Lane, the historical society's new curator, and Karen Suchenski, director of education -- said they realized there was an opportunity to expand the original premise, and make it more inclusive. 
 They invited the public to contribute to what is now an archive of women who are achievers in Stamford. (The discovery of a 1991 commemorative publication listing 350 notable people -- with only 2 women among them -- helped fire the search.)
Pushing beyond seven notable examples is the heart of the show in a time-line gallery that includes important documents and artifacts, telling the story of women's history nationally.
The exhibition explores the contributions women have made from the 17th century to the present, from the home, religious institutions, organizations and schools, and then from less likely places including the state legislature, corporate boardrooms and laboratories.
Among finds, for example, is the memoir of Louisa Zwart -- "which walked in the door with her daughter-in-law the other day," said Mr. Lane.
Louisa Zwart, who was born in Holland in 1871 and came to the United States in 1901, established a dry goods store in Glenbrook. "She was a businesswoman in an environment where few ran their own enterprises," Mr. Lane said.
Visitors can learn that among other hard-fought rights granted piecemeal to women was the right to vote in school board elections in 1893. (Not until 1920 did the Constitution of the United States give women the right to vote in elections for all offices.)
In the exhibition there is also evidence that early independence-minded women expanded the definition of home with weaving, dying, candle making, cheese making and open-hearth cooking, enabling Stamford residents to forego costly imports and develop economic independence from Britain.
The time-line gallery shows objects from 1640 to 1821, from cradles to hearthside pots and utensils to flax wheels, flax and the finished product, linen.
Women who worked to contribute to their households -- along the way gaining political power -- were referred to belonging to "the cult of the homespun," said Mr. Lane.
The few women who had businesses frequently owned dressmaking and millinery shops.
"The show places women in local history where they have always been, but largely invisible," Mr. Lane said.
"The purpose of the show is to recognize the accomplishments of Stamford women from all walks of life, creating a more inclusive history."
The Stamford Historical Society (1508 High Ridge Road, Stamford; 203-329-1183) is open Tuesday through Saturday, noon to 4 p.m.

HEADLINE: The Struggle to Stay on the Trail;
Kicked Off Land by New Owners, Hiking Routes Are Redrawn, Sometimes Onto Roads

BYLINE: By NANCY DONIGER 

 BODY:
FOR those who have taken to the woods this season to see the fall foliage, a walk along the 700-mile Blue-Blazed Hiking Trail System may seem like a peaceful respite.
But the negotiations required to preserve the well-maintained trails system, snaking throughout the four corners of the state, spanning private property, state parks and forests, municipal land, and water and utility company property, belies the serenity of the hiking system. In an era of economic prosperity and intensive development in most sections of the state, the hiking system's continuity and continuance are at risk. 
 Since the 1950's, the Connecticut Forest and Parks Association, which maintains the system, has lost 100 miles of trails in Fairfield County and other highly developed areas of the state, often causing a fracture in the systems' continuity.
During the same time period, the group also gained about 100 miles of trails in the eastern, less-developed section of the state. That has resulted in the same overall trail mileage, but presented considerable continuity and access issues, all of which have had to be solved through negotiations with property owners.
These negotiations can be intense and time-consuming, according to John Hibbard, the executive director of the association who has led the group for 37 years.
"I spend at least 50 percent of my time engaged in negotiations," he said. "Sprawl is an ongoing challenge. Over all, our goal is to maintain and protect the existing trail system and fill missing links to segments that have closed."
Accomplishing that goal is not easy, he said. In addition to himself, Ann Colson, the group's director of volunteers and trails coordinator, devotes about half her time to negotiations, particularly with new property owners when a parcel that has a trail on it changes hands. Negotiations are a top priority for other association principals as well, Mr. Hibbard said.
The association on Oct. 29 was forced to close a .83-mile section of the Mattabesett Trail in Haddam and relocate it onto the road because of a change in the ownership of the land. "This section of the trail was on someone's driveway who sold the property, and the new owner doesn't want it on his driveway," Mr. Hibbard said.
William R. Bowles, a Haddam lawyer who represented the buyer of the property, Wayland Hall, said the new owners aren't against trail conservation; they simply do not want to deal with the uncertainty of having an unknown number of people traipsing through their yard.
"The seller was an estate, and didn't realize the trail was there because the original agreement was oral, not written," he said. "Not only was the trail there, but it went up the driveway and across the backyard. In buying a home you don't want to be sitting in the backyard, sunbathing, and have some Boy Scouts come hiking through the yard."
At the same time, the association expects to be able to extend the Shenipsit Trail an additional mile in Tolland where an existing property has been subdivided, and the new property owner, Michael Cole, has agreed to allow the trail on an undeveloped portion of the parcel, Mr. Hibbard said.
"I bought 240 acres and subdivided it," Mr. Cole said. "I'll be developing 68 acres into 18 lots. The rest will be vacant land, through which the trial will pass. It's part of my open-space agreement with the town. Town Planner Ron Blake asked for the trail, but I was thinking of doing it anyway."
In this instance, the association is gaining a mile, thereby balancing the loss of .83 mile on the Mattabesett Trail, even though the two trails are not in the same area. Although seemingly small in size, it's an important accomplishment for the association because it will help fill one mile of a four-mile missing link in the Snenipsit Trial from the Cobalt Village section of East Hampton to Somers, 'but there is still much more to be done," Mr. Hibbard said.
Since 1895, the association has been working to conserve Connecticut's woodlands and encourage stewardship of the state's natural resources. The association drafts an annual agenda for state action and said it has been instrumental in enacting major environmental laws and programs. The association added trail development and maintenance to its duties in 1929. Over the years, it has enlisted an all-volunteer work force to maintain its statewide system.
Intense development in Fairfield County, and changing land ownership in other parts of the state, present a threat to the continuity of the trails. The breaking up of large tracts of land into smaller pieces is particularly troublesome because it requires the association to deal with multiple land owners on tracts that used to be owned by a few owners who allowed their land to be open to the public.
"As the blocks have become smaller and smaller, we have many more landowners to deal with," Mr. Hibbard said.
Association officials and volunteers attempt to relocate trails, or negotiate use of the land whenever property changes hands and problems ensue. One of the biggest threats is when the association had not had formal agreements with the previous owners, Mr. Hibbard said. The heirs may decide to selland developers who purchase the land may not want to retain the trails on them, he said.
Property transference and development has forced closure of some sections of the Mattabesett Trail in Middletown and Meriden. The association was also forced to close a portion of the Metacomet Trial in Meriden in the early 1990's, but successful negotiations with the Meriden Water Company will allow a one-mile portion of the trail to reopen later this fall. Restoration work has already begun, Mr. Hibbard said.
In another instance, Durham officials have negotiated with the owner of a site called Mount Pisgah. Mr. Hibbard said the owner didn't want the trail on his property, which forced the closure of a portion of the Mattabesett Trail there. Durham is applying for a grant under the new state act and will hold a referendum later this fall to let taxpayers decide whether the town should buy the site as open space.
One of the association's major successes was the relocation of the historic eastern route of the Appalachian Trail in Cornwall to a route west of the Housatonic River because of property owners who wanted the trail off their land, he said. The eastern route was subsequently re-established as a Blue-Blazed trail, named after the blue blazes, painted on tree trunks, that mark the trails, and renamed the Mohawk Trail.
Another success involved extending the Shenipsit Trail in Vernon over the Belding Wildlife Management area, given to the state by Maxwell Belding, a Connecticut conservationist, he said.
In 1998, the General Assembly approved an act concerning open space and watershed land, with lobbying by the association and other conservation groups. The program has provided $32 million in land grants to communities over the past two years to buy open space, which is part of Gov. John Rowland's plan to spend $166 million over five years to preserve forests and farmlands. Many of the parcels in the grant program contain trails that will be permanently protected from development.
Early in the association's history, members pooled their resources and purchased prime properties until the state could buy them as state forests and parks. Rocky Neck State Park in East Lyme, Hammonasset State Park in Madison, Sherwood Island State Park in Westport, and People's State Forest in Barkhamsted were purchased through such pooling of resources, according to Richard Whitehouse of Glastonbury, association president.
"The spirit and the giving is still out there," Mr. Whitehouse said. "That's one of the enjoyable parts about working with C.F.P.A. People really do care about open space, and they're willing to do something about it."
Russell Brenneman of Westport, a past association president, described the group as "the quiet conservation organization. We're not the government, but all the things we do is for public benefit. Unlike other organizations that make a lot of noise and get in the headlines, we do our work less flamboyantly, but people respect us and turn to us for our thoughtful response."
The association's quiet productivity and commitment attracted Ms. Colson to the organization.
"So many of the people who use the blue trails are unaware of our role in keeping them open," she said. "We work with unit managers at each state park where we have trails to maintain them. It's likely we built them as well."
Daniel Casey of Bristol became involved with the association as a youth volunteer in 1973. He is one of the association's 92 trail managers who carry their chain saws and rakes out onto the trails and direct more than 400 volunteers. His long-standing contributions led to his nomination as Connecticut Volunteer of the Year for 1999.
Maura Allaire, 15, of Bristol, one of the young volunteers who works with Mr. Casey, has been doing trail work since she was 9. She continues to volunteer despite the pressures of homework and sports, she said.
"I've always loved the outdoors," she said. "Trail work is a way to go hiking every weekend. The trail crew goes out every weekend, spring and fall. There are quite a few other young people who work with Mr. Casey."
Mr. Casey urges first-time hikers to start with an easy, well-marked trail, such as Sessions Woods in Burlington, a three-mile gravel road. He also recommends going with a guide or someone who has hiked the area before.
Hikers need to be aware of hunting season, from Oct. 1 to New Year's Day, and wear fluorescent orange while hiking in state forests and private land where hunting is allowed. Hunting is not allowed in state parks and forests on Sunday, he said.
"The trails are beautiful anytime, but especially during the peak foliage season in mid-October," said Patricia Barkman of Newtown, an avid hiker of the Blue-Blazed system. "The combination of rock ledges, foliage and the Housatonic River provide spectacular vistas. An abundant waterfall cascades into Lake Lillinonah," she said. "Preserving the continuity of trails is so important because they provide a place to exercise and regain a feeling of being spiritually restored."
 "The Connecticut Walk Book," published by the association and available at most library and book stores, includes comprehensive maps and information for hikers. For information about group, call the association office at (860) 346-TREE, or visit its website at www.ctwoodlands.org.

HEADLINE: For the Few, a Breathtaking View;
The Island Has Largely Resisted High-Rise Creep. But, Oh, the Scenery...

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

DATELINE: EAST MEADOW

 BODY:
NASSAU COUNTY MEDICAL CENTER opened here in 1974 as the tallest occupied structure in all of Nassau and Suffolk. The 19-floor tower commands a 360-degree view that on a clear day extends to the North Shore, Jones Beach and the distant New York City skyline.
So what was put on that top floor? A revolving restaurant? An observation deck with coin-operated binoculars? The executive offices? The directors' board room? Private suites for V.I.P. patients? 
 None of the above. The floor was designated for storage.
Today that top floor still reigns as Long Island's tallest overlook. It also remains a giant cellar in the sky. Makeshift walkways of old plywood panels wend their way across the rough, uneven concrete floor. Here is a cluster of dented desks and filing cabinets, there shelves are piled with stacks of dusty dinner plates and -- what's that? -- an obsolete iron lung. Much of the space is simply open.
Of the top five floors of the medical center, in fact, one is devoted to mechanical equipment and three are vacant, built for patient demand that never materialized. The exception is the 18th floor, where pediatric patients and staff enjoy a grand vista.
"Oh, yeah, definitely, the view is beautiful," said Lisa Fechtig, who said she had never tired of it in 15 years as a nursing station clerk.
"You can see the New York City skyline that way," she said, pointing west. "You can see the marathon runners on the parkway. We could see the brush fires in Suffolk. The Fourth of July is a major good. You can see all the fireworks."
Various work shifts bring sunsets and sunrises, day views and nighttime sparkle, including lights blinking atop other tall buildings to warn errant low-flying planes. Scenes change with the season: "It's pretty when it snows."
Why the medical center largely ignored its sweeping views is uncertain. Whether intentional or not, the tower stands as a monument to the conflicted feelings that many Long Islanders harbor about tall buildings. When people fled New York City's skyscrapers to become pioneers in the nation's new suburban culture, they adopted a distinctly low profile.
Although the skyline is gradually changing, tall buildings remain an anomaly on the Island. The very idea of constructing them provokes political, social, economic and aesthetic debate.
"In New York City, being in a tall building signifies you're at the top of the mountain, but on Long Island, a certain placelessness sets in," said Paul L. Bentel an architect in Locust Valley who has written about local architecture. "You wonder why a tower, and why here. Are the high rises displaced urban building types, or do they fulfill the modernist image of an tower in a park?"
To many Long Islanders, "high rise" are fighting words. A zoning proposal for three-floor garden apartments can provoke fierce opposition from civic groups. Neighbors rail against such "high rises," a description that may amuse those city folk who live in five-floor walkups. "They don't like tall buildings out here," said a county planner in Suffolk, Roy Fedelem. An architect of tall buildings, Michael H. Spector of New Hyde Park, said: "Some people will fight anything over one story. But we're not a farmland out here any more."
Opposition is receding, however, and tall buildings are growing in height and number. "You can make a beautiful building out of a high rise," said Jonathan B. Friedman, dean of architecture at New York Institute of Technology. High-rise economics can preserve surrounding land, he said. "In a way, it's a way of saving Long Island."
Mr. Bentel is not so sure. "In a flat landscape, a man-made building becomes monumental," he said. "The question is what should that profile be, and how should it be seen against the skyline."
The next major addition on the horizon will be the $240 million federal courthouse opening in the spring in Central Islip. It will have 11 floors, but lofty ceilings will inflate the total height to 240 feet, equal to a typical 22-floor building. As the architect, Mr. Spector said he was conscious about blending the structure into the setting. "We spent as much time solving the roofscape as we spent solving the rest of the space, because we knew people would be flying by it, driving by it and walking by it every day," he said. Capitalizing on the view was also a priority. "On every floor, the judges see the bay, and the public sees the sound."
Tall buildings fetch top dollar in real estate rentals, and rents escalate with the floors. "We're the top of the market, literally and figuratively," said Steven D. Mezick, assistant controller of The DeMatteis Organization, which is ensconced on the 15th floor atop EAB Plaza, which it built from another Spector design.
"It's in effect a Manhattan building in a suburban setting; it makes that statement," he said. "When I came for here for my interview, it made quite an impression." EAB Plaza, whose 1.1 million square feet make it the Island's largest office building, fosters its city image. With a conscious nod to Rockefeller Center, it has an indoor arcade, an outdoor ice skating rink and giant Christmas tree -- some years taller than its city cousin -- whose annual lighting draws thousands.
Views from the tall buildings offer a surprise: a verdant blanket of treetops that conceals the vast network of streets and rows of houses on the ground below. The only things protruding above the tree cover are spindly water towers and the few other tall buildings.
"For eight months of the year, it looks like we're in the middle of a thick forest," said Dr. Lee E. Koppelman, executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board, sitting in his seventh-floor office at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. "That's because the maximum height of a house is 30 feet, if you have a two-story colonial, and the trees have grown to 70 feet. It's only when you fly over in a helicopter and look directly down that you see the sea of houses and swimming pools in almost every backyard."
For decades politicians have fought over high rises. "It was not just an aesthetic question but a major political issue," said Dr. Koppelman, recalling the reaction to proposals for modest to luxury apartments at Mitchel Field. "Margiotta, then the Republican leader, mounted a major campaign. They didn't want to bring New York City to Nassau, they wanted to keep the Tammany tentacles out. The real thing was that to him, tall buildings represented Democrats. But then when DeMatteis wanted to build EAB, all of a sudden it was acceptable. And when Hofstra built residential towers, they said, 'That's not high rise, that's university.' It's a slight bit of hypocrisy."
There may be something to the notion of apartment-dwelling Democrats. The biggest concentration of midrise apartments is in Long Beach -- a Democratic bastion. But even there, resentment of what critics called a "Chinese wall" of 6- to 10-story buildings once forced a moratorium on such projects.
In fundamental ways, the suburbs developed as the city's diametric opposite, with lawns replacing pavement, automobiles replacing mass transit, single-family homes replacing apartments -- and low-rise replacing skyscrapers. Homeowners feared that apartment renters would not have the same commitment to their buildings and community, said the curator of Long Island Studies Institute at Hofstra, Dr. Barbara M. Kelly. Racial prejudice was another factor, based on a stereotype of high-rise public housing.
At the peak of resistance, Republican campaign literature portrayed North Shore Towers looming ominously at Nassau's border. Part of the site is in Nassau; the towers are in Queens. True enough, they soar 32 floors, their shadow falling across the county line. But the landscaped complex seems peaceful and inviting, with a golf course, tennis, pools, underground shopping, a movie theater and a restaurant. The views include a lake, Long Island Sound and the Manhattan skyline. The security director, Kris Debysingh, said: "It's like a city in the country."
Personal preferences also come into play. Years ago when Suffolk opened its 12-floor Dennison building, County Executive John V. N. Klein shunned the top-floor office, moving instead to the first floor. Dr. Koppelman was delighted to get the high office but was puzzled by Mr. Klein's choice -- until the county executive pointed out the absence of sprinklers, hoses and fire escapes.
As a group, the island's tall buildings are architecturally undistinguished, critics say. The Nassau Medical Center is a hulking megalith. EAB Plaza's mirrored exterior reflects the here-but-not-here school. Peter A. Bentel, brother and partner of Paul, says the black tower at Stony Brook "makes me nervous, like the obelisk in Space Odyssey 2001." The adjoining tower, however, is a diverting stack of giant cubes. "They have problems with its concrete exterior," said Dr. Koppelman. "The gag on campus is that they'll never remove the scaffolding because the building might fall down."
The father of our country, George Washington, is also the father of the island's first tall building. As president, he ordered the construction of the Montauk Lighthouse, built in 1796. It stands 110 feet high and is boosted by its hilltop perch.
The Montauk tower was eclipsed in 1858 by the erection of the new Fire Island Lighthouse. At 164 feet, it was the king of the hill more for than a century and remains among the island's tallest buildings. It is also the only one open to the public. Reserved tours are available, $4 for adults and $3 for children and the elderly. A visit requires a hike and a climb. The parking lot is a half mile away, then inside the lighthouse await 182 steps on the original iron spiral staircase, with rope railings.
It is worth the effort. At the top, a circular outdoor catwalk offers what may be the most scenic high view of Long Island, overlooking the endless Atlantic, the slender barrier beaches and the Great South Bay. Below are little clamming boats, big party fishing boats and fast-moving craft whose wakes cut long white arcs across the water. The western view is graced by the Robert Moses Causeway and its bridges at Captree, and the sentinel-like water tower.
"On a clear day, as Barbra Streisand says, you can see the twin towers" of the World Trade Center, said the lighthouse's administrator, Daniel McDonnell.
Some high structures are not occupied by people and instead serve utilitarian functions: power transmission rigs, broadcast antennae and water towers. From Connecticut, the most prominent landmark across Long Island Sound is Keyspan's power plant at Northport. Its distinctive red and white smokestacks stand 600 feet, equal to 60 floors. Another big stack, the 390-foot chimney of the American Ref-Fuel recycling plan, is the only outside structure that pokes above the tree line at the otherwise idyllic Old Westbury Gardens.
The island's biggest cluster of sizable buildings -- a spread-out cluster, to be sure -- is around the Nassau Coliseum: Hofstra's six dormitory towers and library, Nassau Community College's triangular tower, the Omni office building, the Marriott hotel and EAB Plaza.
At Stony Brook, the surgery department's administrator, Roger Bogenshutz, said, "The view never fails to impress." Autumn is the best because of the patchwork of yellow, orange, red, brown and green foliage. He was excited about the annual turning back of the clock, because "that means the sky will be fuchsia before I go home," he said. "It's really spectacular."
It may become easier for regular Long Islanders to see such views. The Nassau Medical Center, recently taken over by a public benefit corporation, is considering installing a restaurant on the 19th floor. "I love views -- I remember when Windows on the World opened," said the executive vice president, Michael M. DeLuca. The menu will have to be something other than bland commissary food, and Windows on Hempstead Turnpike does not quite work for a name. "We're thinking of calling it the Top of Nassau," he said.

HEADLINE: Better Perks Resonate in Boom Times

BYLINE: By MICHELLE LEDER 

 BODY:
HIS name may not be familiar to anyone but his own employees, but chances are you've heard about what Al Galdi has done: given new BMW's to any employee who has worked at his company for at least a year.
During the last six months, Mr. Galdi has handed out BMW keys to 34 of his 45 employees. The cars, which are leased, cost him about $9,000 a year each, including insurance. Needless to say, turnover at Arcnet, an architectural engineering firm in Holmdel, N.J., has been virtually nil since Mr. Galdi began offering the perk in June. Employees who leave have to give back the cars. 
 They also lose out on other goodies, like $100 gift certificates on their birthdays, health club memberships and a cash bonus equal to 25 percent of their annual salary on the fifth anniversary of their employment.
About once a month, Mr. Galdi says, he asks his employees if they would rather have cash. The answer is always no.
"They seem to really like the programs," he said, "because it helps with their quality of life."
You could probably count on one hand, and perhaps even one finger, the number of employers in the New York metro area who are handing out keys to BMW's. But with the economy booming and unemployment at record lows, many employers are trying to come up with new and interesting perquisites.
"It's not so much about rewarding, but retaining," said Michael A. Keane, managing consultant at Watson Worldwide, a consulting firm in Morristown, N.J. "When it comes to employees, it's basically a seller's market, and many companies are having to make extraordinary efforts."
A recent survey by the outplacement firm Lee Hecht Harrison found that the top two perks on employees' wish lists were health club memberships (58 percent) and flextime (57 percent). That's not what most employers are providing: A.T.M.'s on premises (25 percent) and travel services (15 percent), according to a survey of more than 1,000 employers conducted by Hewitt Associates, a compensation consulting firm.
"Employers need to ask themselves how they can make themselves different from everyone else," said Ray Baumruk, who helped conduct the study for Hewitt.
Perks vary widely from company to company and within particular industries. High-tech firms tend to have the most innovative offerings, like on-site massages, concierge services, even quiet rooms where workers can nap. Blue-chip companies, particularly those on suburban campuses, tend to focus more heavily on time-saving perks like on-site dry-cleaning and film drop-off.
For example, the 500 employees at Xerox's corporate headquarters at Stamford, Conn., are able to work out at an on-site fitness center, order meals from the company cafeteria for dinner and drop off dry-cleaning when they get to work in the morning; it's usually ready to be picked up the next day. On-site massage therapy -- a perk offered at other Xerox locations, but not in Stamford -- is in the works, said Christa Carone, a spokeswoman.
One difference from several years ago is that the perks are for a larger pool of workers. At Arcnet, even the receptionist qualified for a BMW. Last month, Ikea, the Swedish furniture retailer that has stores in Hicksville, N.Y., and Elizabeth, N.J., pledged cash bonuses amounting to a day's worth of sales, $80 million worldwide, to its employees, from the snack bar staff and stock clerks to the president. Each employee will end up with $2,435 when checks are distributed this month, said Marty Marston, a spokeswoman for Ikea North America. Retailing tends to be among the lowest-paying type of employment, so the one-time bonus could equal a month's pay for some.
But even companies that can't afford to provide a car or a day's sales have plenty of options. Many perks being offered today cost the employer virtually nothing, but still create plenty of good will. Men's Wearhouse, a large California retailer that operates about 20 stores in the New York metro area, has signed up 120 local employers, including Citibank and New York University, for its V.I.P. program, which gives a company's employees 10 percent off on Men's Wearhouse purchases.
Transitchek, a program that allows employees of enrolled companies to set aside up to $65 a month before taxes for public transportation commuting costs, also provides savings on corporate taxes. Each month 7,000 to 8,000 employers in the New York area participate in the program, said George Serventi, Transitchek director.
"A lot of these things are in the interest of the employers who are doing them," said Helen Darling, a consultant at Watson Worldwide's Stamford office.
Even costly perks often pay off in the end. Lipton Child Care Centers, a Washington company that operates backup child care centers in Manhattan, White Plains and Jersey City, says that employers still save money because parents don't need to miss work when their regular child care provider isn't available. The service has attracted employers like the National Hockey League, the National Basketball Association, Philip Morris, Pepsico and Texaco, as well as newer, smaller companies like Knight Securities of Jersey City.
Stephanie Bernstein, director of human resources for Knight, a Nasdaq market maker, said she and several other parents were able to sell Knight's chief executive on the idea of backup care, even though Knight, like many other brokerage firms, mostly employs single men.
"There were a couple of people here, myself included, who would get into a situation and be jammed," Ms. Bernstein said. Now, for an annual fee of $50, she and other Knight parents have access to the Lipton center in the lobby at Newport Center.
At Dialogic Corporation, a Parsippany technology company recently bought by Intel, the company's 1,000 employees have access to a corporate concierge, who is able to arrange things like dinner reservations, family vacations and oil changes for cars. Dialogic pays LesConcierges of San Francisco for the service, but employees have to pay for individual requests. Other Dialogic perks include an on-site fitness center, a free coffee and juice bar, and heavily discounted soda.
"This is all aimed at making it comfortable for people to be here longer than 40 hours a week," said Ken Cardinal, Dialogic's director of compensation and benefits. Though Mr. Cardinal said the company hadn't tried to figure out whether the concierge service and other perks were paying off for the company, he said that turnover had been lower than expected.
Still, at most companies, benefits are limited to items like health and life insurance and a retirement plan. Mr. Keane, the consultant at Watson Worldwide, estimated that only 15 to 20 percent of all companies offer what he described as nontraditional perks. That could grow if the economy continued to prosper.
"A lot of companies are being pretty cautious, because once you add it, it becomes hard to take it away," said Alan M. Johnson, managing director at Johnson Associates, a Wall Street compensation consulting firm.
Many consultants and even the companies that provide the perks wonder what will happen to the programs when the economy takes a turn for the worse. Employees who have grown used to the perks may be unwilling to give them up.
"We all know it's going to be difficult to take these things away," Mr. Cardinal said. Given the choice of layoffs or reducing perks, most employers would probably reduce the perks, consultants say.
But not Mr. Galdi. When business slowed down a few months ago, he said he had to lay off several employees. But he has no plans to stop handing out BMW's or cut back on any of the other benefits Arcnet employees receive.
"I'm in the service business," Mr. Galdi said, "and having employees that are happy and hard-working is good business for me."
 
Like a Front Desk at the Office
SO what exactly does a corporate concierge do? Just about anything, as long as it's legal.
"I never know what each day will bring," said Pam Wildrick, a corporate concierge at Dialogic Corporation, a technology company that was recently acquired by Intel Corporation. "People come in and they drop their problems on my desk."
In the year and a half since Ms. Wildrick began working at Dialogic's Parsippany headquarters, she's done everything from picking up gifts for spouses who have forgotten a birthday or anniversary to locating a clock that ticks backward to finding a guide to take an engineer through dense jungle in Costa Rica. In a typical month, she fields 230 to 250 requests from Dialogic's 1,000 employees.
Though Ms. Wildrick works in Parsippany, she's actually an employee of Les Concierges, a 13-year-old San Francisco company that provides concierge services to companies. (In the past, she had worked for several nonprofit groups in Morris County, including a stint as president of the Junior League and director of communications and special events for the Arts Council of the Morristown Area.)
Though the concierge concept is popular in California, particularly in the Silicon Valley, corporate concierges are still relatively new in the New York area.
"There's a lot of potential in the New York area," said Phil Wexler, Les Concierges' executive vice president. The company recently reached an agreement with Goldman Sachs to begin providing concierge services to its employees early next year.
Ken Cardinal, Dialogic's director of compensation and benefits, said the service was popular. One part of Ms. Wildrick's job involves arranging for oil changes and other routine maintenance on employees' personal cars while they are working, saving the employees valuable time on the weekends.
So is there anything Ms. Wildrick won't do?
Yes. She won't hire strippers, though she has been asked to.
Though that's not illegal, Ms. Wildrick said she just didn't feel comfortable arranging that kind of entertainment for Dialogic employees, even if it took place off-site.
"That one just crosses the line," Ms. Wildrick said. MICHELLE LEDER

 BODY:

Holocaust and Hiroshima
A link between the Holocaust and the American bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as perceived by the Japanese author Kinue Tokudome, will be the subject of her talk on Friday at noon at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in White Plains. The program, "Holocaust and Hiroshima: Facing Our Past," is being presented by the Westchester chapter of the American Jewish Committee as one of a series designed to promote positive relations among the county's ethnic, racial and religious groups. 
 Ms. Tokudome's "Courage to Remember" was the first book on the Holocaust written specifically for Japanese readers. It was published this year by Paragon House of St. Paul. Ms. Tokudome does extensive research and conducts countless interviews with key figures and individual survivors before embarking on her projects. She is working on a book about America's use of the atomic bomb in Japan in World War II, and the bomb's long-term effect on the survivors and society.
Raised in Japan, Ms. Tokudome has lived in the United States for 21 years, during which time she received degrees in political science and international relations from the University of Chicago. She has reported extensively on American life, to Japanese readers. Admission, including lunch, is $18. Reservations by 5 p.m. tomorrow at 948-5585.
 
Cat Show Contenders
Socks Clinton will be one of three nominees vying for the title of Cat of the Year at the 24th Westchester Cat Show next weekend. It is scheduled next Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the County Center, Bronx River Parkway and Central Avenue in White Plains.
The award is based on uniqueness, courage, altruism and other characteristics more common to cats than most people realize. Last year's winner was actually a dog named Ginny that rescues cats. In the previous year, the winner was Scarlett, a cat that made all the local papers by rescuing her kittens from a burning building and suffering near-fatal burns.
A Japanese bobtail, the second current nominee, left his comfortable home after several visits to a neighbor's child, who, it turned out, had terminal cancer. The cat stayed with the child like a caring friend until the end, then remained with the grieving father.
A 12-year-old short-hair named Mary Paige has earned many thousands of dollars for animal rescue organizations by modeling and acting in print and television advertisements. She is apparently happy to do so in return for being rescued from the streets with her mother, pregnant with Mary at the time.
More than 250 domestic, exotic, and champion cats representing more than 30 breeds will compete for ribbons and the prestigious Best in Show Award. A Meow Market of cat-related merchandise, informal chats with veterinarians, sales of purebred cats and adoptions of cats from shelters are among the many features at the show. Admission is $8, $6 for people older than 61 and $3 for children younger than 12. Call 739-5408 for more information.
 
A Look at European Union
For the last 25 years Wouter L. Wilton of the Netherlands has served in diplomatic posts connected to European politics and economics. In his current role as Minister Counselor of the European Delegation in New York of the European Union, he will give a free talk on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. at Concordia College in Bronxville.
His subject, "The European Union: Changing the Face of a Continent," will range widely over internal trade disputes in Bosnia, to NATO, and the European Union itself as it expands its influence in global affairs.
The college is at 171 White Plains Road and the number for more information is 337-9300, extension 2135.
 
Choreographers' Works
The Dance in Education Fund and Steffi Nossen School of Dance of Purchase College will present an afternoon of new works by Westchester choreographers next Saturday at 2 in the Dance Theater Laboratory at Purchase College. Admission is free and part of the program will be devoted to a discussion between the choreographers and audience. Children will be encouraged to take part.
Among the choreographer-performers are Rachel Berman, a former principal dancer with the Paul Taylor Dance Company; Deborah Damast, a master's degree candidate at the Tisch School of the Arts of New York University; Ara Fitzgerald, associate director of dance and theater at Manhattanville College; and Leslie Farlow, dance-theater faculty member at Trinity College in Hartford.
Reservations are suggested by calling 251-7855.
 
Penguin Rep Performance
Warren Leight, author of "Sideman," winner of the 1999 Tony Award for Best Play, has a new play called "Glimmer, Glimmer and Shine" at the Penguin Rep in Stony Point, Rockland County, through Dec. 5.
The play, initially presented as "Glimmer Brothers" last summer at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts, has been revised for this engagement. The story, described as funny and poignant, revolves around attempts to reconcile estranged twin brothers and their children.
Mr. Leight wrote and directed "The Night We Never Met," a film starring Matthew Broderick, and several additional screenplays, nightclub acts and plays.
The theater, a converted 1880's hay barn, is on Crickettown Road, accessible from the Palisades Interstate Parkway Exit 15 and Route 9W. Penguin Rep, established in 1977 as a professional theater, has produced more than 100 shows seen by more than 150,000 people. Performances are on Thursday and Friday at 8:30 p.m.; Saturday at 5 and 8:30 p.m., and Sunday at 2:30 p.m. Tickets priced at $22, or $19 for people older than 61 and students younger than 22, can be reserved by calling 786-2873.

HEADLINE: Remnants of a War Hidden in the Soil

BYLINE: By DARICE BAILER 

 BODY:
AN archaeology teacher at Joel Barlow High School in Redding is leading a group of students and volunteers on an excavation of Israel Putnam Memorial State Park, work that is proving a hunch he and other historians have had for years: What was believed to be a cemetery for 25 Continental Army soldiers is actually the site of a field officer's quarters during the 1778-79 army encampment in Connecticut.
The teacher, Daniel Cruson of Newtown and an anthropology and archaeology teacher at Joel Barlow since 1968, said he has been fascinated with the site since he was a boy and would accompany his father, Dr. Daniel Cruson, on archaeology digs around Connecticut. Dr. Cruson was a dentist in Bridgeport, but on weekends he pursued his passion -- archaeology. The younger Mr. Cruson said he always wanted to dig around the two parallel rows of crumbled chimneys of the enlisted men's barracks beside Company Street and the cemetery up on a crag. 
 "I wanted to know what was down there, what was left from the Revolution," Mr. Cruson said.
The park is named after General Israel Putnam, a senior major general of the Continental Army, who, with General Enoch Poor, commanded three New Hampshire regiments and one Canadian unit that camped in Redding. That winter, the Continental Army did not camp together in one place as it did at Valley Forge. Instead, the army was spread throughout the tristate region.
Historians have said that the army camped in Redding because it was a sheltered valley with plenty of water and forest cover, and from there the troops could prevent the British from moving up the Hudson River or invading Connecticut through the shore.
The park is a memorial to the soldiers who suffered through one of the longest and severest winters in Connecticut. Twenty-five men died. Many soldiers didn't have clothing or shoes. There were not enough blankets, and the men sometimes went a few days without food because the heavy snowfall made it impossible to gather supplies from the Danbury supply station.
The "cemetery" was thought to be burial grounds because of the two piles of rock -- possibly burial mounds -- that were found on the hill about 24 feet apart. So, in 1902 the area up on the hill was designated as a cemetery, and granite posts were hammered into the dirt, forming a crude square.
But, even as a boy, Mr. Cruson didn't think the soldiers who died were buried in that square.
"I can't put my finger on it, but it just didn't seem right that they were burying in the encampment," he said. "The site didn't feel right. The land didn't feel right."
For one thing, it was pretty rocky and there wasn't much topsoil. "You don't bury someone when there's no topsoil," Mr. Cruson said.
Last spring, to test his hunch, Mr. Cruson asked permission of the State Department of Environmental Protection to excavate. Now, he is giving his students hands-on archaeological experience in a dig that began in September and is expected to end this Saturday.
"This is really bringing back a bit of the past," said Jeanine Herman, president of the Friends and Neighbors of Putnam Memorial State Park.
David Poirier, the staff archaeologist at the Connecticut Historical Commission, said that Mr. Cruson's excavation is giving his department a better understanding of how to manage park resources.
"We'll be better able to make decisions about what should and should not happen regarding future development," he said. "It allows us to better understand what areas are sensitive and how sensitive they are."
Mr. Cruson wasn't the first to excavate Putnam Park. In 1973-74, Mr. Poirier excavated around some of the chimneys, or firebacks, along Company Street.
Then, in 1990-91, Ricardo J. Elia, a professor at Boston University, did an archaeological survey of the park at the request of the state. Prof. Elia was the first person to publicly say that he thought the cemetery up on the hill was actually the site of an officer's barracks.
"That was what had been running through my mind," Mr. Cruson said, "and that's what gave me the courage to go up there and investigate."
Mr. Cruson, president of the Archaeological Society of Connecticut, graduated from Trinity College in Hartford with a bachelor of arts in economics and a master's in education. His archaeology training comes from apprenticeships with a number of state archaeologists. Last year, Mr. Cruson led students and volunteers on a dig of one of the enlisted men's barracks.
Mr. Cruson believes the soldiers who died passed away at hospitals in Danbury and Norwalk. As for what were thought to be the two burial mounds, Mr. Cruson thinks they're two crumbled chimneys that stood at the ends of the 12- or 14-feet-wide by 24-feet-long quarters. The dormitory was a two-room hut for the officer and an orderly.
An inch or two beneath the topsoil, Mr. Cruson and his rookie archaeologists are discovering what the officer and his orderly ate or did before razing the hut to the ground in the spring of 1779 when the group moved on to fight the British throughout the Hudson valley.
Left behind were a musket ball, a pewter button the size of a dime, a piece of a clay pipe, hand-hewn nails, lead casting drippings from pistol bullets, animal bone from a meal and what he said he thinks are peas.
The archaeological findings belong to the state and will be curated by Nicholas Bellantoni, the state archaeologist.
The peas will be taken to a lab to be analyzed by a botanical expert. The bones will be analyzed as well. They are so small as to be unidentifiable.
Eventually, all artifacts will be displayed in the park museum, near the current display of artifacts Mr. Cruson's group found during the excavation last year. Mr. Cruson's excavation report will be published next year in the Bulletin of the Archaeology Society of Connecticut.
About 50 to 60 percent of his students have participated in the dig.
"A soldier was living here 200 years ago and I get to see what he did and the remnants he left," said Neil Davidson, a senior at Barlow.
Kathleen von Jena of Redding, who is helping Mr. Cruson at the site, found the pewter button. She said the dig was fascinating.
"You get underneath the surface of the earth and you're handling a button that was attached to somebody's coat," Ms. von Jena said. "That kind of human connection across time is what really gets me."
Melissa Borko, a senior at Barlow, said she hopes to pursue a career in anthropology after participating in the dig.
"If someone had said to me three or four years ago, 'Why don't you go into anthropology?' I would have said, 'Why do I want to go into anything like that? It's just digging in dirt,' " she said. "But now I see that it's not just digging in dirt. It's finding out about how people lived and what their lives were like."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
How a Pair of Plays Gain Longer Lives

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

 BODY:
FOR everybody's good, not to mention the whole world of theater, Doug Hughes and David Saint not only believe that regional theaters should work together, but also are making it happen, once again, with two new works: "Syncopation," by Allan Knee, and "Down the Garden Paths," by Anne Meara.
Mr. Hughes, the artistic director of Long Wharf in New Haven, and Mr. Saint, artistic director of George Street Playhouse in New Brunswick, N.J., are co-producing, collaborating, pooling resources, dividing expenses, lengthening the life of plays and the employment of actors, and all manner of other good things. 
 "We do our work so often to tear it down," said Mr. Hughes during rehearsals of "Syncopation" at Long Wharf. That often means, he said, "taking stuff to the Dumpster, and I've always been unhappy about that."
There are two pathways to be taken by a regional theater production: to have its run of, say, four to five weeks or to fulfill the wish if not the mission of nonprofit theater, "to go on to an extended commercial afterlife," Mr. Hughes said. He added that he is delighted there is "something in the middle."
That something in the middle -- an alliance between two important regional theaters -- happened recently between Hartford Stage and the McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J. ("Cymbeline" staged by Mark Lamos) and between Long Wharf and the McCarter (John Henry Redwood's work, "The Old Settler").
It helps that Mr. Saint and Mr. Hughes -- "old friends for 20 years" -- have had a professional affiliation in tandem and overlappingly. Mr. Saint assisted Mr. Hughes when the latter was associate artistic director at Manhattan Theater Club from 1980 to 1982 and began directing at Seattle Repertory in 1990 when Mr. Hughes was associate artistic director there. Mr. Saint wound up succeeding him when Mr. Hughes went on to the Tyrone Guthrie in Minneapolis as head of the creative department.
First, both Mr. Knee's and Ms. Meara's plays came to Mr. Saint but Mr. Hughes said, "Anne Meara shows all her plays as she's working on them to John Guare, who told me this one was remarkable. And then David showed it to me."
"I was stunned," Mr. Saint said. "It is remarkable," Mr. Hughes added.
Critically speaking, the audience at the second theater is the beneficiary of a more seasoned performance, of a play refined by time.
"We continue to wave the flag for the new American play," Mr. Hughes said. And he cheered "this sort of shared responsibility for producing one and extending its life -- providing the luxury of a longer run -- especially when we have compatible tastes and the flexibility of dovetailing our schedules with crisscrossing productions."
"A co-production gives the play a chance to be worked on in two venues -- both outside New York," Mr. Saint said. "Working in New York is an invitation to excruciating pressure. You're constantly under the gun by theaters that want to make sure the first audience sees a finished product, or else the word will get out there and we're finished. 'Give us a chance to create something here, folks,' you want to say. Here we have that great opportunity."
Obviously, both theaters reap economic advantages. "We can stretch our money across the season," Mr. Hughes said. "This deal allowed Long Wharf to lavish more on cast size in other productions, to make sure the population of our stage doesn't dwindle."
And, Mr. Saint added, "we share costs without compromising artistic merit."
David Chandler and Lorca Simons are in "Syncopation," to be staged by Greg Leaming, Long Wharf's director of artistic programming. The play is set in 1911 when ballroom dancing was all the rage. Such dancing was still popular in the 1950's when Mr. Knee was growing up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and being taken to dance contests at the old Madison Square Garden.
David Chandler plays Henry, who is 42, Jewish and a butcher. For $7 a week, he rents a Lower East Side sixth floor walk-up, where he dreams of dancing. He also dreams of a partner. He places classified advertisements in the Morning Telegraph. After six weeks of waiting, he receives a reply from Anna (Lorca Simons), an Italian-American woman who is 23.
In the two-character play, which is being staged at Long Wharf after a series of readings in New York, dance is a metaphor for partnering and the struggles inherent in all relationships, Mr. Knee said.
It is also the playwright's response to the dullness ("except for dance," he said) of his teenage years. "I didn't fit in, I was not in tune with my environment," said Mr. Knee, who has also written the book for a musical version of "Little Women" and adapted "The Scarlet Letter" for television. "I lived in the past -- of charm, effortlessness and romance."
Even now, Mr. Knee said, "History tells me more about today than today does."
 "Syncopation," Tuesday through Dec. 19. "Down the Garden Paths," Jan. 19 through Feb. 20. Long Wharf Theater, 229 Sargent Drive, New Haven. (203) 787-4282.

HEADLINE: AILING THEATER;
Best of Three Worlds?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Regarding Steven Drukman's panel discussion with nine American playwrights "Prescriptions for a Troubled Patient: The Theater," Oct. 31 : I work in television, motion pictures and the theater, both as a writer and a producer. 
 I am one of those writers who started on Broadway and who was immediately spirited away to Hollywood to become a very well-paid television comedy writer.
 I currently have a television series going on the air, a second in development at a network, a feature film in pre-production and a new musical opening at the Pasadena Playhouse. What does all that mean?
My television series will stand or fall on the availability of stations and time slots, program lead-ins and shows on other channels at the same time.
My movie depends on the availability of stars, director and financing, finding good distribution and strong marketing support.
But my musical is definitely happening. It will play as part of a subscription series and will have the marketing support of the theater.
Despite the perils of the theater, it is only in the theater that the writer enjoys any kind of meaningful creative control. Producers can, of course, coerce the writer by threatening to pull the financial plug. In television, however, whoever pays the bills dictates every aspect of the show, including the cast, your script and who rewrites your script.
The theater is hard, mainly because you don't get your money up front; you make money only if the show does. Obviously, it's more attractive to get paid a ton of money whether or not your show is a hit.
The theater must deal with the harsh economic realities -- just like the rest of us. Producers need to select the right properties, budget them in a practical way, and go out and compete for the audience's attention and time.
As for being a playwright, I remind myself: nobody asked you to be a writer. Society does not owe it to you. You only owe it to yourself.

Seeing the Corporation's Demise

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
PETER F. DRUCKER, revered as the father of modern management, has a new message for corporate executives: Find another line of work.
"The unique 20th-century creation, the corporation, is not going to survive in the 21st century," he said, almost nonchalantly, in an interview. 
 Big companies, he said, don't seem to be able to thrive for more than 30 years, not even those like General Motors and Sears, Roebuck that have received advice from management gurus like himself. But another reason is seemingly contradictory: management skills have advanced so far that business has lost some of its challenge.
"In business, you are becoming bored, because we know so much," he said. "When I came in, nobody knew the routine and that made it exciting."
Few people in business today can remember when Dr. Drucker appeared as a management visionary in the 1940's. Dr. Drucker turns 90 this Friday, and that is prompting celebrations and reflections on his life and work.
Last Sunday, 400 people, many from nonprofit organizations he has advised, held a birthday party at the Getty Center here. On Friday, Dr. Drucker, a native of Austria, received that country's Cross of Honor for Science and Art. And at least two books have appeared in the last few years assessing his life and work.
Dr. Drucker wears hearing aids in both ears and walks with the help of a cane. But his mind seems as fertile and his pen as fluid as ever. He teaches a course for midcareer executives at the Claremont Graduate School, east of Los Angeles, where he has been based since 1971. He spouts facts, figures and historical tidbits from memory. The author of 31 books, he has recently written major articles for magazines like The Atlantic Monthly and The Economist.
"Writing is a compulsive neurosis," he said.
Dr. Drucker made his mark by viewing management as a subject in its own right, rather than as a collection of specific skills like finance and accounting. "He was the first person to formulate management as a professional discipline," said D. Quinn Mills, a professor at Harvard Business School.
Dr. Drucker recognized early on that a key to corporate success was to motivate employees. He also stressed marketing and innovation over finance.
His books, a mix of pungent generalizations and historical trivia, have been criticized as lacking academic rigor. Some business leaders consider his ideas dated. But his fans have included John F. Welch Jr. of General Electric and Andrew S. Grove of Intel. He also has a huge following among industrialists who rebuilt Japan after World War II.
"We owe him very, very much," said Masatoshi Ito, the founder of Ito-Yokado -- a large Japanese retailer that controls the 7-Eleven chain -- who came to the birthday party at the Getty Center and helped organize one in Tokyo.
Dr. Drucker does not like to be typecast as a management guru. He has written nearly as many books about economics, society and politics as about management. He has even penned two novels. He is an expert on Japanese art and once taught a course in it. Early in his career, he worked as a banker and a journalist.
Born and raised in Vienna, Dr. Drucker received his doctorate in international law from Frankfurt University before he was 22 and then remained in Germany. In 1933, after one of his essays was banned and burned by the the Nazi government, Dr. Drucker moved to London and then, in 1937, to the United States.
In 1944, after publishing a book about business and society, he received an invitation from General Motors to study its inner workings. That led to his first management book, "The Concept of the Corporation," in 1946.
He now does his consulting and writing at home, in the modest house in Claremont where he has lived for 29 years. He reads voraciously, both fiction and history, and does much of his writing on legal pads or a typewriter rather than on a computer, which he says makes him write too fast. Doris Drucker, his wife of 62 years, is a writer and physicist who has designed and manufactured a device to aid in speech therapy. The couple have four children and six grandchildren.
As for his view on the demise of corporations, Dr. Drucker says people will still work for a living but will not cast their lives with a single company. What Dr. Drucker calls the knowledge workers of today will save their best efforts for nonprofit social service organizations, where they can make a bigger difference. "The 20th century was the century of business," he said. "The next century is going to be the century of the social sector."
Dr. Drucker, spending an increasing portion of his time with such service groups, is the honorary chairman of the New York-based Peter F. Drucker Foundation for Nonprofit Management, founded by leaders of other nonprofit organizations that he advised.
Although he is fascinated by the Internet, Dr. Drucker says his choice for the growth industry of the next 30 years is not e-commerce. "It's going to be fish farming," he said, explaining that on the oceans, "we are still hunters and gatherers."
Claremont, which named its business school after Dr. Drucker, is now establishing his archives under the direction of Nan Stone, a former editor of Harvard Business Review. The archives will be largely available online, so Dr. Drucker's insights will be available to corporate managers well into the next century, even if the corporations themselves don't survive.

Young Professionals Group Wants Not Just Jobs, but Room at the Top

BYLINE: By NINA SIEGAL 

 BODY:
Thomas Lopez-Pierre sounds a bit like a neophyte matchmaker when he describes his group: everyone involved, he says, is younger than 39 and earns more than $50,000 a year.
But Mr. Lopez-Pierre, 31, doesn't run a singles agency. He is the chairman of the Upper Manhattan Emerging Leadership Round-Table, a group of black and Hispanic professionals who want to promote minority entrepreneurs in Harlem, East Harlem and Washington Heights. 
 On Tuesday night, Mr. Lopez-Pierre had a dinner for about 40 at the Sugar Shack, a homey restaurant on Frederick Douglass Boulevard at 139th Street.
The group's bankers, real estate executives, brokers and public servants have been holding meet-and-greets like this one for about two years. But Mr. Lopez-Pierre said he wanted the group to meet more frequently to prepare for an ambitious campaign it hoped to begin early next year. It is not likely to win universal approbation: the Round-Table wants to encourage all large corporations doing business in Upper Manhattan to have a business partner who is either black or Hispanic.
Mr. Lopez-Pierre said too many fast-food chains and other corporations have opened franchises in the neighborhood and hired managers who did not represent the area's ethnic makeup.
"I don't feel that in a neighborhood that is mostly black and Hispanic, businesses and real estate should be owned by people of other races," he said. "Arabs and Indians are not from Harlem."
Terry C. Lane, president of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, which has helped many corporations set up shop above 96th Street, said that supporting local job creation and local ownership is vital to economic development.
But, he added: "I don't see race as a formula. What does it really mean? What I see is you want local participation and good corporate citizenship, and if you partner with people in the community it makes better business sense. But that has nothing to do with race."
Mr. Lopez-Pierre recently entered a joint venture with Arthur Treacher's, the seafood restaurant chain, to open a minimum of eight franchises north of 96th Street. With the deal, Mr. Lopez-Pierre becomes the kind of minority entrepreneur who his Round-Table hopes will multiply.
Thomas K. Hoffman, chief operating officer for Arthur Treacher's of Jacksonville, Fla., said the restaurants, which will each contain a Nathan's Famous, should open in a few months.
"When corporations want to appease a community, they give the neighborhood some jobs or come up here for a photo op," Mr. Lopez-Pierre said. "We're not interested in that. We just want access to ownership." NINA SIEGAL

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF;
Hefty History at Reasonable Prices

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
THE autumn has brought a wonderfully rich harvest of affordable and accessible paperback books for fans of business history, a genre whose volumes usually cost a bundle and weigh a ton.
To be sure, one of the new paperbacks -- "Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller Sr.," by Ron Chernow (Vintage Books, $16) -- is still pretty hefty, even without a hard cover. But it is a rich and enlightening tale, especially with the future of Microsoft in the air. And its length only looks daunting: the story of Rockefeller, the man who built the Standard Oil monopoly, races along with all the ease and grace of a well-constructed novel. 
 Graceful storytelling is also abundantly on display in two additions to the splendid Wiley Investment Classics series from John Wiley & Sons -- "Once in Golconda: A True Drama of Wall Street 1920-1938" ($19.95) and "The Go-Go Years: The Drama and Crashing Finale of Wall Street's Bullish 60's" ($19.95). Both are by John Brooks, a financial journalist and novelist who produced a small shelf of delightful books before a stroke brought on his death in 1993 at the age of 72.
"Once in Golconda" opens with an explanation of its title: "Golconda, now a ruin, was a city in southeastern India where, according to legend, everyone who passed through got rich. A similar legend attached to Wall Street between the wars." Of course, a similar legend has attached to Wall Street today, an excellent reason to absorb the gently told lessons drawn from the frenzied prelude and agonized aftermath of the 1929 crash.
The book opens on Sept. 16, 1920, when a bomb exploded in front of the Manhattan offices of J. P. Morgan & Company, then ground zero in the nation's financial landscape. The story closes in 1938 with Richard Whitney, once the unassailable president of the New York Stock Exchange, installed in a prison cell. It is a remarkable span of time, well worth recalling amid today's stock market party.
In "The Go-Go Years," Mr. Brooks sketches the psychedelic 1960's on Wall Street. Colorful crooks, celebrity fund managers, corrupt stock exchange officials and audacious corporate raiders added to the surreal atmosphere as stock promoters extolled an atomic-fueled future while back-office clerks labored in Dickensian conditions against a rising tide of unprocessed paperwork.
Mr. Brooks, with shrewd foresight, notices by the end of his tale that technology is wiping out the traditions of the Street. "Already in the early 1970's," he writes, "a significant proportion of stock trading is being conducted not face-to-face on a floor under a skylight but between men sitting in front of closed-circuit television screens in offices hundreds or thousands of miles apart." We must forgive him for failing to see that those television screens, soon to be replaced by computer monitors, were simply the latest manifestation of the stock ticker that had transformed trading nearly a century before.
IT was 1867 when E. A. Callahan harnessed the new technology of the telegraph to produce the first stock ticker. Improvements to Callahan's model by Thomas Edison yielded the financial windfall that paid for the workshop where he invented the phonograph and the electric light bulb.
That is just one of the nuggets tucked between the slim covers of "The Victorian Internet: The Remarkable Story of the Telegraph and the 19th Century's Online Pioneers," by Tom Standage, a science writer at The Economist in London. Now available in paperback from the Berkley Publishing Group ($12), "The Victorian Internet" puts a cool hand on the feverish face of the Internet.
Mr. Standage writes: "In the 19th century there were no televisions, airplanes, computers, or spacecraft; nor were there antibiotics, credit cards, microwave ovens, compact discs or mobile phones. There was, however, an Internet."
The telegraph, he writes, "revolutionized business practice, gave rise to new forms of crime and inundated its users with a deluge of information."
"Romances blossomed over the wires," he adds. "Secret codes were devised by some users and cracked by others. The benefits of the network were relentlessly hyped by its advocates and dismissed by the skeptics. Governments and regulators tried and failed to control the new medium. Attitudes toward everything from news gathering to diplomacy had to be completely rethought. Meanwhile, out on the wires, a technological subculture with its own customs and vocabulary was establishing itself."
Mr. Standage asks: "Does all this sound familiar?"
ONE emerges from this delightful book both humbled and heartened. The Victorians traveled, in a few short years, from a world in which it took 10 weeks to communicate between London and Bombay to a world in which it took 10 minutes. By comparison, the adjustments that the Internet requires of us -- a generation born with a telephone in our hands, with children who can scarcely remember the purpose of a postage stamp -- seem almost comically trivial.
On the other hand, all the grim predictions about the telegraph's catastrophic effects did not come to pass, and perhaps the same will be true this time as well. In any case, "The Victorian Internet" provides a much-needed perspective on how new technologies shape human society.

BOOK -- Rainbox Six, by Tom Clancy (1997)
WHY -- I read most of his works and enjoyed the majority of them. While I still like Clancy's work in an escapist sort of way, they appear to be losing the intense realism that characterized his early work and are becoming more like very long Hollywood scripts.

WHY -- I'm working on a speech about sustainability. The consumer society we live in is in many ways in conflict with long-term environmental sustainability. This line of thinking reminded me of John Wesley's sermon. I have a few favorite pieces that I like to reread every so often, and this is one of them.

Sights Unseen From a Bus Top: Marilyn's Grate And Gay Harlem

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON 

 BODY:
"I DON'T give tours," said the man in the blue Giants cap and sunglasses. "I live 'em."
With that, Marvin Gelfand folded his white cane and pulled a cigarette from a worn metal case on Thursday morning. Grasping a friend's elbow, he continued down Broadway on his free-association tour of the Bloomingdale district, the area of Broadway around 96th Street. 
 Dressed in tennis shoes, slacks and a blue windbreaker, Mr. Gelfand, who is legally blind, bears little resemblance to the traditional tour guide who points out the postcard city from atop a double-decker bus. Instead of rattling off a litany of facts, Mr. Gelfand conducts "walking essays on the unpredictable human concourse of the city."
His tour subjects are out of the ordinary, too. They range from simple themes like Jewish Harlem, to daylong tours about crime in New York, to private tours on the city's economy given in the back of foreign bankers' limousines.
About 34 million people visit New York City each year. And 1,426 licensed tour guides -- and many more unlicensed ones -- can tell them that the Bronx is up, the Battery's down, and the diner from "Seinfeld" is somewhere in between. (O.K., it's Tom's Diner, at Broadway and 112th Street.) Many tour companies are expanding their mainstream offerings. But more and more offbeat tours, like Mr. Gelfand's, are springing up, too.
If the glimmer of Midtown Manhattan does not grab some visitors, for example, maybe the Wildman will. Steve Brill earned that nickname for his tours finding and cooking edible plants that grow wild in city parks. He leads groups of gatherers wielding clippers and shovels into the underbrush, foraging for vegetables, herbs, mushrooms and berries.
November is harvest time for wild greens like dandelions and chickweed, said Mr. Brill, who is now leading tours in Queens. There, mountain watercress grows in Kissena Park, wintercress in Alley Pond Park and oyster mushrooms on street trees in Kew Gardens.
Mr. Brill leads searches for medicinal herbs and roots, whether it is St. John's wort in Alley Pond Park or gingko nuts near the Central Park Reservoir. But the Wildman strongly recommends identifying any flora before eating.
"You shouldn't eat anything without trying it on the in-laws," he suggests. The edible wild carrots in Kissena Park, for example, resemble a poisonous hemlock growing along the Saw Mill River Parkway.
Michael Henry Adams is a wild life expert of another sort. Mr. Adams, a Harlem historian, runs offbeat tours uptown, including the Hi-Dee-Ho Harlem nightlife tour. It includes dinner and swing dancing at Wells Restaurant on Seventh Avenue near 135th Street, as well as late-night jam sessions at St. Nick's Pub on St. Nicholas Avenue near 149th Street. Diehards can eat a chicken and waffles breakfast at the historic M&G Diner at 125th Street and Morningside Drive.
In another tour, Mr. Adams visits haunts of famous gay Harlem residents, including Langston Hughes and James Baldwin. They stop at a legendary male brothel and then hit the dance floor at after-hours clubs.
Peter Salwen, a Mark Twain scholar, gives annual tours on Mark Twain's birthday. He peppers them with Twain quotations and visits sites in SoHo and Greenwich Village where Twain lived and socialized.
Mr. Salwen shows how Twain used his New York connections to rise from a promising reporter to a national literary figure. The oldest surviving scrap of his actual writing is a note he wrote to his parents while he was visiting New York as a teenager: "I've taken a liking to this abominable place," he confessed. (This year's Twain tour is on Saturday, the 164th anniversary of the author's birth. Call 212-242-5546. Most tour operators are listed in the phone book under their name or their company's.)
Some tour guides cut quite a figure. Arthur Marks is a show-tune aficionado who says he never quite made it on the stage, so he became a flamboyant tour guide who dresses in dapper suits and sings and dances his way through presentations.
"I still get to perform and get paid for it," said Mr. Marks, who takes groups to the Silk Stocking district on the Upper East Side and belts out "Money Makes the World Go Round" on an expensive stretch of Park Avenue.
"I'm more of a personality than a tour operator," said Mr. Marks, who offers 26 tours of Greenwich Village and tours for every major Manhattan neighborhood except Chinatown. "It's too touristy," he said.
Passers-by are also likely to notice Stan O'Connor, another tour guide. He dresses as Abraham Lincoln and conducts his tours of Manhattan from a 19th-century perspective.
"I've been stopped by many people who say, 'Thank you for freeing my relatives,' " Mr. O'Connor said.
Some offbeat tours focus on entertainment. NYC Discovery Tours gives one tour about the Beatles in New York and another about Marilyn Monroe -- including a visit to that naughty subway grating.
There's more. Century Walking Tours gives a tour on Ayn Rand's New York. Joyce Gold gives walking tours of macabre Greenwich Village and gangland Hell's Kitchen, and twice a year sails to New York on the Queen Elizabeth 2 to give slide shows to "prepare" visitors for New York. Philip Schoenberg, an eccentric guide from New York Talks and Walks, shows the sites of landmark New York legal cases. The tour's name is Let's Kiss All the Lawyers.
Howard Goldberg, who runs a tour group called Adventure on a Shoestring, has a special architectural focus. He takes groups to visit city bridges on the anniversary of their opening. "We sing 'Happy Birthday' to them," he said "Bridges have feelings too."
Bruce Kayton, yet another offbeat-tour operator, gives 15 different tours of famous Manhattan sites of radicalism, like the Harlem funeral home where Malcolm X lay after his assassination in 1965.
Mr. Kayton also points out Abbie Hoffman's favorite place for egg creams: the Gem Spa soda fountain, still on the corner of St. Marks Place and Second Avenue.
On New Year's Eve in 1967, Mr. Hoffman created the radical political party known as the Yippies at his apartment at 30 St. Marks Place. According to Mr. Kayton, he bragged for $101 a month in rent, he had "a front-row seat to the counterculture."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Gordon Grender;
GAMerica Capital Fund

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
AS a fund manager, Gordon Grender doesn't seem to mind doing things that might be regarded as a little odd. For example, he runs a United States stock fund, the $58.5 million GAMerica Capital fund, from an office overlooking Westminster Cathedral in London.
The geography gives him an edge, he said. "I can read The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times on the Web and check Bloomberg before anybody in New York gets up," he said in an English accent. 
 Mr. Grender, who has been managing American money from across the Atlantic since 1974, has built an enviable record. GAMerica Capital returned 27.2 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Nov. 5, compared with 10.1 percent for its peer group of small blend funds, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher, and 33.8 percent for the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks.
Mr. Grender, 55, searches the markets for value among American companies of all sizes, although the fund is now heavily weighted in small-capitalization stocks -- the category where he is finding the best bargains. He looks for businesses with annual earnings growth of 15 percent or more and is adamant about not overpaying; he aims to pay less than the market's price-to-earnings multiple, currently 31. "I can't bring myself to buy glamour stocks with capitalizations in the billions but revenues in the millions," he said.
Still, if a stock performs strongly "I tend to run with it," he said, holding on as it rises in price. The turnover rate for his fund, which holds just 40 to 50 stocks, averages 29 percent, versus 96 percent for a typical fund. But its class A shares carry a 5 percent front-end load and an expense ratio of 2.46 percent, versus 1.49 percent for its average peer.
Mr. Grender reads many American business publications and gathers valuable information on the road, he said, attending investment conferences and visiting companies. He tours the United States at least four times a year; each trip lasts at least two weeks.
Unlike many other managers, he ignores quarterly earnings forecasts, which he calls a "futile exercise."
"Analysts tend to report what management tells them," he said. "They don't do their own independent work."
In looking at a company, Mr. Grender wants to see sales growth of at least 5 percent a year above inflation, and relatively substantial free cash flow, although the amount depends on the type of business.
He is particularly drawn to companies with very depressed stock prices -- those that are down 25 percent to 50 percent from their most recent highs. Here, he shows his contrarian streak: "I don't worry about companies whose share prices take big falls when they report disappointing earnings if I think the fundamental story is sound."
Another plus, he said, is inside ownership. "I want top management to own shares in the company, not just stock options," he said.
He is not afraid to carry cash -- the fund's cash position grew to 50 percent by October, as new money flowed in. In the last few weeks, he has reduced it to about 40 percent. "I've been nervous about the level of the stock market," he said. "But I've been buying lately because so many stocks have been taking such big falls."
MR. GRENDER owns stock in Power-One, a company in Camarilla, Calif., that makes power supply equipment for commercial electronic devices like CAT scanners. He bought more shares after a conference call in October in which company management expressed caution about meeting fourth-quarter earnings estimates, driving down the price from over $30 a share to $15. He paid $20. The company, he said, is "a lower-risk way to play the growth in electronics."
The fund initially bought Power-One stock in October 1998 at $6 a share. Earnings have grown about 25 percent a year since the company went public in 1997, helped by acquisitions. Insiders own about 15 percent of the shares, which closed on Friday at $19.625, or 29.5 times consensus earnings estimates of 66.5 cents a share for 1999.
Another choice is Policy Management Systems of Blythewood, S.C., which makes software used by insurers. Mr. Grender bought shares in October for $21, down from $55 in February, after the company said it would miss its third-quarter earnings forecasts because of delays caused by Year 2000 computer issues and other problems. "But because customers tend to rely on them heavily," Mr. Grender said, "the fact that their earnings are poor and their stock price is down doesn't mean that their business will go away."
He estimates three-year earnings growth of 15 to 20 percent a year, on average. And he thinks sales should grow above 10 percent a year over that time. Management owns just under 1 percent of shares, but that is enough for Mr. Grender because of the company's large market capitalization. The stock now trades at $20.875, or 13.9 times 1999 consensus earnings estimates of $1.51 a share.
In September, he paid $47 a share for Sprint, shortly before the company announced its merger deal with MCI WorldCom. The stock price had fallen to the mid-$40's, from $55 in June, because of worries about increased competition from other long-distance carriers. He jumped in, he said, "because I thought the company was a likely acquisition target as the industry consolidated." Moreover, he said, it was "reasonably priced" relative to other companies in the industry.
Mr. Grender is bullish on the merger, and thinks the combined company will grow 30 percent a year, on average, over three years.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
Baby Steps Toward Accord On Social Security

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE country learned one main lesson this year from the inability of President Clinton and Congress to make headway in dealing with the long-term financial shortfall in Social Security: that making even modest changes to the retirement system requires far more political trust than is present in Washington today.
Despite solemn promises from the White House and from Democrats and Republicans in Congress not to use Social Security as a club to batter the opposition, each side whacked away with abandon, contending that it alone could be trusted to save retirees from financial ruin. 
 Lost in the partisan spectacle, however, were some promising developments and even some enlightened debate on various issues.
 
DEBT REDUCTION -- About the only big fiscal agreement between the two parties was that the bulk of the projected federal budget surplus -- the $2 trillion in excess revenue that Social Security will generate over the next decade -- should go toward reducing the $3.6 trillion in national debt held by the public.
The agreement was largely a result of a well-founded fear that using the Social Security surplus for anything else, like tax cuts or government spending, would be painted as a wholesale betrayal of Social Security.
That the outcome had beneficial economic effects, like lower interest rates, was a happy byproduct of gridlock, not the goal.
Still, using Social Security revenues to reduce the debt does nothing to address the underlying long-term shortfall in the retirement system's finances.
 
STOCK INVESTMENTS -- The most divisive issue was whether individuals should have the right and the responsibility to invest a portion of their tax dollars in private accounts. Nearly all Republicans and a few influential Democrats said yes. The vast majority of Democrats said no.
But that divide obscured a somewhat remarkable agreement among almost all voices in the debate. From the most liberal to the most conservative, they concluded that the power of the stock market to generate substantial returns over the long run should be used to help close the gap between the benefits that Social Security has promised to today's workers and the system's ability to pay them.
Mr. Clinton and Democrats in Congress said the Social Security system itself, not individuals, should do the investing, so that everyone would benefit or bear the risks equally. Advocates of private accounts said individuals should have more control over their financial futures, and that collective investment would result in de facto government ownership of private industry.
One way or another, Wall Street seems destined to play a role in dealing with the problem.
 
THE TRUST FUND -- Since its establishment during the New Deal, Social Security has worked in the same way: Today's workers pay a levy on their earnings; the revenue goes toward paying current retirees. Any excess -- payroll tax revenue beyond what is immediately needed to pay benefits -- is theoretically parked in a trust fund that can be used down the road to pay benefits when needed.
Only in the last year has it become clear to people other than policy types and actuaries that the trust fund is basically an accounting fiction. Excess Social Security revenue is not tucked away in the sense that the phrase "trust fund" suggests. Because of the way the government keeps its books, that excess can be used in only three ways: for general government spending, as was done each year until 1998; for a tax cut; or to reduce the national debt, as is being done now.
No matter how the excess is used, the government still deposits an i.o.u. in that amount with the Social Security system. The i.o.u. is nothing more than a promise to pay back the money, almost certainly out of general tax receipts or through increased government borrowing. The i.o.u.'s are not real assets like stocks or bonds, and they do not even represent cash, since the government cannot deposit cash with itself as if it were a bank.
The trust fund now contains i.o.u.'s totaling $865 billion. The amount is projected to peak at $4.5 trillion in 2022, when the system will have to begin redeeming them to pay benefits to retiring baby boomers.
In other words, if benefits are to be maintained after 2022, the government will either have to dip into general revenue or borrow from the public to make good on the $4.5 trillion. And even so, after the i.o.u.'s run out sometime around 2034, Social Security will be able to pay only 75 percent of promised benefits unless changes are made.
 
GENERATIONAL EQUITY -- Finally, there was a dawning recognition that solving Social Security's problems would require tradeoffs between the needs of today's workers -- overwhelmingly the baby boomers, who are at a peak of political and economic influence -- and later generations.
If the boomers cannot rally themselves to find a consensus and make sacrifices and compromises now, the bill will be dumped into the laps of their children and grandchildren.
And who is to say that they'll be in any mood to pay it?

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Construction Stocks Poised for Resurgence

BYLINE: By MICHELLE LEDER 

 BODY:
WALL STREET is never wrong, according to the common wisdom, just early in making its investment recommendations. Analysts were wildly ahead of themselves in 1998, when Congress passed a giant transportation spending bill; many decided to recommend the shares of engineering and heavy-construction companies.
Now, with shares down 38 percent, on average, from their 1998 peaks, it may just be time to take the analysts up on their picks. 
 The bill, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, earmarked $217 billion for federal spending on highways, a 44 percent increase over the bill it replaced. In the first quarter of 1998, the Standard & Poor's SuperCap Engineering and Construction Index rose 21 percent, partly in anticipation of the bill's signing.
"People ran it up because they saw huge amounts of funding," said Charles D. Brady, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, referring to the construction sector.
But the government's future largess would be overshadowed by more immediate concerns. Shares of construction and engineering stocks eased as petrochemical-related projects were canceled because of declining oil prices. The stocks' retreat became a rout amid fears of a global recession.
As appropriations failed to materialize, disappointing earnings reports hurt the industry further. "Over the past year, just about every one of these companies has blown up," Mr. Brady said.
More recently, two construction companies have failed to meet third-quarter earnings forecasts, leading to selloffs. On Nov. 3, Granite Construction of Watsonville, Calif., reported profits of 77 cents a share, versus analysts' estimates of 83 cents as reported by First Call/ Thomson Financial. The stock fell 6 percent over two days, and is now at $20.375.
On Oct. 27, Stone & Webster of Boston announced that it was in violation of its credit agreements and posted a loss of 52 cents a share instead of the profit of 65 cents a share that analysts had expected. The stock fell 40 percent in a day; it is now at $15.625.
But 18 months after the transportation legislation was passed, money is beginning to trickle into the coffers of construction and engineering concerns. Between $25 billion and $28 billion of government funds are guaranteed next year, so analysts say the stocks should begin to recover.
Aside from Granite Construction, which despite its weaker-than-expected quarterly results said it would meet 1999 earnings estimates, analysts' favorites include Jacobs Engineering Group of Pasadena, Calif.; Morrison Knudsen of Boise, Idaho; and the URS Corporation of San Francisco, an engineering company. All are trading sharply below their 52-week highs, most near their 52-week lows.
"The first quarter of next year is when you're going to see the benefit in a major way," said David N. Allen, director of research for the Granite Financial Group, a San Diego brokerage firm not affiliated with Granite Construction. Mr. Allen has buys on Granite, Morrison Knudsen and URS.
Already, about a quarter of the $2 billion order backlog at URS is related to the transportation law. URS is now at $21.5625, 27 percent below its 52-week high. Mr. Allen, who rates URS a buy, has a 52-week price target of $26. He also has a buy on Granite, with a target of $25.
The stocks are trading for under 12 times analysts' consensus estimates for this year's earnings. One of Mr. Brady's picks is Jacobs, now trading at $32.50; his 52-week price target is $45. (Mr. Brady also likes Morrison Knudsen, trading at $8.9375, on which he has a 12-month price target of $14.)
Mark Dyer, an analyst at Strong Capital Management, says the industry is attractive at current prices. The Strong Common Stock fund recently increased its position in Jacobs, bringing it up to 1.2 percent of the fund's assets. Separate accounts managed by Richard T. Weiss, manager of the fund, hold a 1.2 percent stake in Morrison Knudsen.

HEADLINE: After the Fire

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
FOR most of her 20 years at the Manhasset, an ornate century-old building at Broadway and 109th Street, Hilary Schlessiger worked at home, writing children's books in the study of her spacious two-bedroom apartment. When her work lagged or her thoughts grew stale, the lanky, wiry-haired writer would reinspire herself by strolling the hallways and listening.
"I'd hear musicians practicing the piano," Mrs. Schlessiger said. "I'd hear opera singing, voice lessons. Before computers, I'd hear typewriters clacking: the energy of freelancers." 
 Six-year-old Sadie Bergen, the towheaded daughter of Andrew and Cynthia Bergen, had playmates upstairs and a best friend down the hall.
"We'd open the door," her father said, "and from 3 on, the girls would be running back and forth. We would have dinner with neighbors and their kids spontaneously. There was a nice feeling, a home larger than a home."
But a few moments of absent-mindedness all but destroyed this world.
As a result of an accidental fire in a ground-floor restaurant, all 300 residents of the 73 apartments at the landmark building at 300 West 109th Street were driven from their homes by a fire on March 11. They have already been displaced for eight months, and it will be at least six more before anyone can return. Meanwhile, residents are in temporary housing; adequate at best, oppressive at worst. Some have been wandering from place to place every few weeks. A few have given up and left the city for good. Many endured heavy financial losses; a few face bankruptcy. Some suffer from nightmares and insomnia.
In some ways it is easier to handle the initial drama of a disaster. But, as with the diagnosis of a life-threatening illness, the most exhausting and demoralizing part comes much later, in the months after the television cameras have departed. And in the case of the Manhasset, the impact was especially devastating because the building's community was so diverse and yet so cohesive.
The fire started in Fiesta Mexicana shortly after lunchtime. A chef accidentally left a pan on a burner, and in less than 20 minutes, flames from an out-of-control blaze leaped up the greasy ducts to the building's 11th floor, setting fire to the roof.
Word spread almost as rapidly as the flames, and residents converged from workplaces around the city. For hours they waited in the drizzle, desperately hoping the destruction would be less severe than it looked.
Instead, it was worse. After reaching the roof, the blaze flashed down the exterior on scaffolding from a just-completed renovation, exploded through windows and incinerated dozens of apartments. In some spots, the ash was two feet deep. The destruction was uneven, sparing some apartments and cremating others, reducing belongings to heaps of char and melted plastic. Everybody was displaced, on the street, with nothing but the clothes they had on and whatever they had in their pockets and purses.
After a few days of dramatic reports, the disaster disappeared from the evening news, just as the victims began to grasp the extent of their troubles. It was months before the amount of damage became clear. At first, residents thought they would be able to return to their apartments within weeks. Later, they realized they had to find temporary housing through the summer and perhaps even into the fall.
But almost certainly, none imagined they would still be homeless eight months later, still waiting to return.
In addition to personal losses, residents are mourning the loss of the rare, uninsurable treasure they shared: a closely knit community as economically and professionally varied as the Upper West Side itself. Living side by side were high-income co-op owners who bought their spacious, high-ceilinged apartments at market rates of $200,000 to $350,000, and 40-year tenants in equally large regulated apartments paying as little as $400 a month. There were also transient subletters, people with market-rate leases, and former renters who had bought their apartments years earlier for a fraction of their worth.
The population included professional musicians, artists and investment bankers; graduate students, caterers, lawyers and nurses; retirees, stay-at-home parents, a man who makes handmade violins, and a curator and a security guard, both of whom work at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It was a sociable place, one in which residents passing through the dim, roomy lobby exchanged greetings that occasionally mushroomed into long conversations. Retirees and younger couples with children mixed easily, and both groups looked out for the elderly and the disabled.
"I had conversations with one person -- he just seemed like a little old guy -- about bird-watching," said Debrah Gilbert, a labor organizer. "It turned out he knew the Latin names for birds and knew a lot about anthropology. He told me about the Alan Lomax tapes of the blues in the South."
Ms. Schlessiger's husband, Charles, a literary agent, added: "There was an amazing feeling that went through that building. There was a feeling of kinship."
 
The Crisis Is Over; Now Comes the Hard Part
Fires have been decreasing steadily in New York City for more than a decade. In the last four years, the number was down by one-third, and the number of fire-related fatalities is the lowest in 50 years. But that is scant comfort to the victims of the 61,400 fires last year, most of which occurred in poor neighborhoods and relatively few of which were serious enough to displace people from their homes. What makes the Manhasset fire unusual is the large and diverse number of people affected and the extensiveness of the damage, leading to an exceptionally long time of displacement.
Ellen Stoller, president of the co-op board, said residents would start trickling back in the spring, and that everybody should be back by July if there are no delays with construction or insurance. A rough estimate of the restoration cost is $30 million, Ms. Stoller said. Though the building had adequate insurance, the relationship with Liberty Mutual, the insurer, has been rocky. The company declined to comment on the situation.
For the victims, the costs are considerably higher, measurable in emotional suffering as well as material and financial losses. Most of the residents of the 39 rental units and even some of the 34 co-op owners were uninsured, and many co-op owners were underinsured, Ms. Stoller said. The blizzard of paperwork that began within hours of the blaze continues unabated, not only insurance claims and loan applications to cover alternate housing, but also numerous lawsuits by nearly everyone involved against nearly every imaginable party.
There has been the enormous inconvenience of trudging from one temporary roof to another. Most people moved several times before finding a spot, and some are still changing addresses every few weeks.
"My suitcase lid is always open," said a pianist who has stayed with eight friends and who is constantly searching for a piano to practice on. "My question is not, where am I going to sleep? It's, where am I going to practice?"
The weeks right after the fire were chaotic. Like war refugees, residents were preoccupied with finding shelter and clothes. Though there were no fatalities or serious injuries, largely because most people were not home when the fire started, many were traumatized.
Ms. Gilbert organized a group of residents to help the most vulnerable among them. In the midst of salvaging their own belongings, they took time to move elderly people's boxes to storage and help tenants of rent-regulated apartments fill out government forms required to protect their leases. A resident who works for psychologists arranged for counseling sessions for children who were in the building when the fire started.
 
A Mother Works Overtime To Make Things Seem Normal
With more than adequate income and insurance coverage, Denise Pelligrini and Laddie de Paur could afford a one-year lease on a temporary apartment near the Manhasset, big enough for themselves and their three children, 4, 3 and 18 months.
But the fire has saddled them with chores and robbed them of time with their children, just when they needed extra attention. In the initial weeks, they had to spend hours in their apartment, "that toxic waste dump" as Ms. Pelligrini described it, salvaging and making inventories of their belongings. They are still deluged with insurance paperwork and shopping for replacement items.
Ms. Pelligrini, a business journalist, and Mr. de Paur, who cares for the children, also had to spend time reassuring their children. They took them to the city fire museum and encouraged them to talk about what had happened. But the effects of the disaster showed in unexpected ways. When the family moved from one hotel room to another while vacationing in Maine, Dashielle, 4, asked, "Was there a fire in the other room?"
"It has been very tense," Ms. Pelligrini said. "Laddie and I are mean to each other. Lately, Laddie is awake until 2 or 3 in the morning. With the kids, we have had to work really hard to make things seem at all normal."
 
'What's Taking So Long?' Homeless at Age 105
Louise Stern, 105, was probably the Manhasset's best-known resident. For 50 years, she lived in a two-bedroom rent-controlled apartment crammed with fading photos of her parents, her sister and her brother. Frail but gracious, she apologized to the firefighters for not offering them tea before letting them carry her to safety on a stretcher.
Every day, Mrs. Stern's caretaker, Rose Moody, pushed her in her wheelchair across the lobby and out to the sidewalk, to a bagel shop on 107th Street and to a park to watch the children. Mothers encountering her in the lobby lifted up their youngsters for her to see. The bagel shop employees fussed over the tiny white-haired figure covered in a blanket, her alert eyes peering out of in her deeply lined face.
Mrs. Stern, whose only income is Social Security and a small pension, was relocated to a low-rent hotel on 77th Street and Broadway. She has been there ever since, at the city's expense. Her room is tiny and dingy. She and Mrs. Moody sleep side by side on single beds, with only a few feet between them. There is a bureau, a closet, side tables and a bathroom, but no kitchen. Mrs. Moody boils eggs and heats soup on a hot plate, and makes peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches.
"I hate to see her spending her last few years in that situation," Mrs. Stiller said. "It breaks my heart." Not that Mrs. Stern is complaining. That is not her way. But she is noticeably frailer, and has lost interest in reading or watching television. Instead, she sleeps much more than she used to. "There is nothing else for her to do," Mrs. Stiller said.
"She has no visitors," her friend continued. "I think she feels terribly isolated. The room is so small, she and Rose are on top of each other. She just constantly keeps saying: 'When am I going to get back in my apartment? What's taking them so long to fix it?' "
 
A Family Cast Out From a Haven
After 20 years of seeing tenants come and go, Hilary Schlessiger has a keen sense of the Manhasset's history and evolution.
During the 1930's, she said as she sat by her husband in the one-room apartment that is their temporary home, the Manhasset was filled with Jewish refugees from Europe. After World War II, they were joined by other Jews, Holocaust survivors.
By the mid-70's, nearly all the refugees had died, and the building became popular with writers and musicians, including many opera singers and performers at the New York Philharmonic. Many babies were born. "Every time there was a baby, there was a party," she said. "It was a warm, loving building. It was very familial, gemutlich. A community."
As the children, including the Schlessigers', who were young in the 70's, left for college, they were replaced by another generation of babies and toddlers.
"I knew them when they were born," Mrs. Schlessiger said. "I knew them when they got older. I miss them, I miss them. There's a lot of emotion invested in this building."
The Schlessigers' rent-regulated apartment and possessions were not badly damaged, but they had no insurance. Even after discarding hundreds of their thousands of books, they are paying $320 a month for storage. In the summer they moved every few weeks, from a brother's pied-a-terre to a friend's office and back again. They used a shopping cart to schlep their belongings, a motley assortment they grabbed when they were allowed back in their apartment for 20 minutes: manuscripts, books, a small silver box, underwear, passports.
Finally, they found a studio near Lincoln Center, where they pay twice as much for a fifth of the space. The place is so small that when Mr. Schlessiger reads manuscripts on the couch, his head is only a few feet from the bed and his feet almost touch his wife's desk. It is so snug he once sought privacy by working in the tiny bathroom.
"It's not bad," Mrs. Schlessiger said, "if you don't mind staring at your mate all day long."
"We can't get out of each other's sight," Mr. Schlessiger elaborated. "We're both big people, too big for one room. I'm 6-3."
"We got through the summer riding on adrenaline," his wife chimed in. "But four months later, I was hideously depressed. Adrenaline is very sexy. You can go on that for a few months. But then the sadness came. What happened was incomprehensible. I'm homesick. I want my home."
 
'If I'm Going to Have to Move to Jersey, I Might as Well Move to California.'
"I MISS so much about New York," said Toni Boyd, a former resident of the Manhasset who left the city and moved to Northern California after being displaced by the fire. "We had made a nice life for ourselves. The Indian restaurant one block up: divine. Tacci's, where there's opera Saturday nights. Cleopatra's, for jazz."
Ms. Boyd, 51, who grew up in Marin County, Calif., and moved to New York 20 years ago, was the kind of diehard Manhattanite who thought Queens might as well be Ohio. She could not imagine leaving the borough until the fire forced her to.
 In Manhattan, her job as a nurse-anesthetist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering paid well. Her two adult daughters and her former husband lived nearby. And because of the Manhasset's elevators and wheelchair-accessible public buses, her partner, Kevin Cowlthorpe, who is a paraplegic, could get out of their co-op and around the city independently.
After the fire, Ms. Boyd hunted for weeks for a Manhattan apartment in an elevator building she could afford. Her lack of insurance made the search especially difficult. Mr. Cowlthorpe went to stay with his parents in Oregon.
After three months, Ms. Boyd gave up. During the summer, she and Mr. Cowlthorpe moved to an apartment complex in her hometown, Novato, among whose advantages are that he can get around in his own car.
"I thought, 'If I'm going to have to move to Jersey, I might as well move to California,' " she said. BARBARA STEWART
 
'We'd Move Back in a Second. We're Even Considering It.'
AT the time of the fire at the Manhasset, Michael and Cynthia Simpson were living their dream life.
Mrs. Simpson, a volleyball coach, was six months pregnant. She and her husband, Michael, a management consultant, also had a 2-year-old son, Zachary.
After the evacuation, Mrs. Simpson went to stay with her parents in Salt Lake City while her husband remained at his job in New York and commuted to Utah on weekends.
Despite the exhaustion and expense of long-distance commuting and the low cost and convenience of life in Utah, the Simpsons did not give up the city easily. They loved New York. But largely because they had no insurance, they could not afford to remain. So they moved to a condominium they owned in Park City, Utah., a ski resort.
"We were very happy," said Mr. Simpson, speaking from his new home. "I was happy with my job. Our apartment was absolutely gorgeous. We were within walking distance of a dozen friends. We'd meet friends from church and go down to the Village for dinner."
The Simpsons can list many practical advantages of life in the West. Most things are less expensive. Their parents and siblings live nearby. Instead of frequenting museums, they ski and hike in mountains that are minutes away.
"You have to find a way to try to be happy wherever you are," Mr. Simpson said. "But we'd move back in a second. We're even considering it." BARBARA STEWART

HEADLINE: A Grand Idea That Went Badly Awry

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
IN a way, Ernest Garcia and George Akers are flip sides of the same badly tarnished policy coin, the battle against raging unemployment in the inner cities. Both have operated small businesses and received loans from the Los Angeles Community Development Bank, an unusually ambitious, federally financed effort to bring a measure of prosperity to depressed areas of this city.
Several years ago, after his metal-plating business burned to the ground, Mr. Garcia ran out of capital and hope. He had been rejected by every commercial bank he approached, and finally turned to the Community Development Bank for a $500,000 loan to rebuild in his old neighborhood, East Los Angeles. The bank came through and today his thriving company, West Coast Metal Finishing, has increased its payroll from 7 workers to 42, and hums with the sounds of heavy machinery and a salsa beat. 
 The bank now celebrates his success with words it once reserved for Mr. Akers's company, Trinity Knitworks, a garment maker. Mr. Akers and a partner received the Community Development Bank's very first loan, for $700,000 in 1996, when they sought to save Trinity and its roughly 150 jobs. But Mr. Akers now says acidly that the loan was so badly botched by the bank that he was effectively in default from its first day. The company, overwhelmed by debt, has been shuttered and Mr. Akers is mired in litigation with the bank.
Mr. Garcia says the bank saved his life; Mr. Akers says it just about ruined his. In fact, the bank has produced a mix of such personal tales, despite the confident assertions of backers like Vice President Al Gore, who has endorsed the enterprise during visits here and once proclaimed, "This is an example of how an economic empowerment program should work."
But the harsh reality is that, over all, this grand, $435 million government experiment has had negligible impact on depressed areas of Los Angeles, even during an economic boom, and the bank has been a crushing disappointment to many.
Its loan default rate is a towering 32 percent, largely because of one huge failure, and it has created a tiny fraction of the jobs it promised. The Department of Housing and Urban Development, which financed the bank, says the fault lies at least partly with lax oversight by the city, while the city complains that the federal money came with too many strings.
"The past year at the bank has not been enjoyable," said Peter Taylor, an investment banker at Lehman Brothers and a member of the development bank's board. "It's time to catch our breath and narrow our mission and make the implementation of the idea work properly." Both the city and the federal government want to keep trying.
To salvage the idea, the troubled development bank is being reorganized. It is searching for a new chief executive, adding staff and loosening some operating methods as it struggles to learn from its mistakes and land on the right formula for stimulating growth in areas that have been left further and further behind in the current expansion. The bank has written a new business plan that the City Council is scheduled to debate soon.
Many people here remain deeply wary, but hopeful. So far, the lending "has not made a meaningful difference in my district," said Rita Walters, who represents South-Central Los Angeles, a focus of the bank's lending, on the City Council. "This is a whole different world in here, and we cannot give up on it. The execution needs to be better."
Marva Smith Battle-Bey, executive director of the Vermont-Slauson Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit group that invests in poor areas, added: "That was a hard-fought battle to get that bank and get it located in that neighborhood. It would negatively affect investment there if this went south now. I feel strongly that we need to make it a more viable instrument."
The interim chief executive of the bank, Linda Griego, acknowledges the problems and argues that the Community Development Bank can become more viable. "A lot rides on this experiment," she said. "A lot of people went out on the line for this. Some of what's happened is just unbelievable, but it can be fixed in my view."
IN the giddily prosperous era of the so-called new economy, talking about high unemployment in depressed urban neighborhoods may seem an anachronism, like discussing rust-prevention methods at an Internet company. But even as the rates of teenage pregancy and crime are dropping, joblessness in many cities remains disturbingly intractable.
Watts, for instance, which was convulsed by civil disturbances twice in the last 31 years, has shifted from a mostly black to a mostly Hispanic neighborhood, and it has been the target of many government job programs. But the unemployment rate still hovers near 20 percent, compared with 4.1 percent nationally.
The Los Angeles Community Development Bank represents one of the most expensive efforts to try a new philosophy in job creation. These efforts are often described as partnerships, since the view is that the government can merely help foster the growth of businesses that must be able to survive on their own. The theory was summed up in 1995 in an article in The Harvard Business Review by Michael E. Porter, a professor at Harvard Business School.
In it, Mr. Porter said job creation would come only "through private, for-profit initiatives and investment based on economic self-interest and genuine competitive advantage -- not through artificial inducements, charity or government mandates."
Andrew M. Cuomo, secretary of HUD, agrees: "Government is the facilitator for the private sector. You have to promote private-sector growth in there."
THE Los Angeles Community Development Bank was set up by the Clinton administration in the aftermath of the 1992 riots here. Los Angeles had failed to qualify for designation as an Empowerment Zone, a status that gives businesses an array of incentives to operate in depressed neighborhoods and employ local people. Furious, the city argued that it deserved some assistance, and the administration eventually offered the development bank as a sort of consolation prize. (Parts of the city have since received the Empowerment Zone designation.)
The bank was supposed to use public financing merely to water the seeds of the private sector -- to help entrepreneurs help themselves and then to get out of their way. In return, the entrepreneurs were obliged to locate in the depressed areas -- a patchwork of sites totaling 19 square miles, mostly to the south and the east of downtown -- and hire at least half their new employees from the neighborhoods.
There are several other community development banks around the country, in cities like Cleveland and Washington, but none are as large, as political in their origins or as dependent on federal funds as the Los Angeles bank. By the end of 2004, it is supposed to have lent out all $435 million -- and then see that it is all paid back.
But that is becoming problematic at best. Of the $97 million in loans it had extended as of Sept. 30, nearly a third have gone bad. The bank's largest loan, $24.1 million to a dairy operation called the Copeland Beverage Group, exceeded the bank's own loan limit of $20 million to a single borrower, and it has been written off. The company has been shut down. An additional $7.2 million of loans are now listed as very high risk if not actual losses.
The bank says it has fostered the creation or retention of 1,258 jobs, only 41 percent of the 3,039 required under the terms of the loans it has made. (Companies are obliged to create at least one job for every $35,000 borrowed.) And just 249 of those jobs went to people living in the Empowerment Zone, fewer than a third of the number required. The bank points out that since the companies have two years to meet the standards, there is still time for some of them to hire more people.
But the figures are actually worse than they look. The bank's employment statistics include nonexistent jobs -- positions created or retained by companies that later failed, like Copeland and Trinity. (The bank counts jobs created by its borrowers as well as jobs retained by companies that would have closed without the loans.) About 276 such jobs have vanished.
THE bank's proponents say that, at least in part, some of the difficulties are built into its charter. It can now lend only to companies
that have been rejected by commercial banks, yet it places a heavy burden on these companies.
"Let's look at the reality," said Caron Caines, a member of the Empowerment Zone Oversight Committee, a watchdog group appointed by the City Council. "You're going to lend money to businesses that no one wants to lend money to, and then you're going to saddle them with the responsibility of creating all these jobs. I don't get it. What this policy does is to transfer the very important policy goal of creating jobs to some of the weakest members of the business community. These businesses have a hard enough time just surviving."
Ms. Caines added: "It's a grand experiment. But with that you have to constantly monitor and evaluate and adjust the program to make it work. None of that happened."
Ms. Griego, a former deputy mayor, was brought in this summer after the first chief executive, C. Robert Kemp, resigned because of illness. She is leading the reorganization and helping to find a permanent chief executive -- with luck, by the end of the year. She said that every candidate who was approached initially had turned the job down cold, but that some people were now interested. Even the bank's sponsors -- HUD and the city -- have distanced themselves.
"I would beg you not to use the bank as a platform to talk about the bigger issues here," said Rockard J. Delgadillo, Los Angeles's deputy mayor for economic development. "It is one element of what I would say is a large number for attacking this issue. It's not a silver bullet. In fact, we've had more success with other products."
The city has a new program, Genesis L.A., focusing on encouraging businesses to locate in 15 old industrial sites. The Community Development Bank is a bit player in the plan, well down the list of incentives that include discounts on utility rates and accelerated city permits.
Mr. Cuomo said in an interview that the bank's problems were the city's, not the federal government's.
"I can count on one hand the number of conversations I've had with them," said Mr. Cuomo, emphasizing that Washington had not meddled. "The prevailing winds are devolution. The new ideas are coming from the new breed of mayor. We do not come in and micromanage."
He added, "I don't know that there's necessarily a lesson" in the bank's well-publicized problems.
But many experts do see lessons, if not in the politics then in a better understanding of what small businesses here really need. Even some critics of the development bank, and there are many, say it has shed some light on a more fruitful path.
The bank's new business plan, put together during Ms. Griego's tenure, includes some shifts in direction that are meant to take advantage of the experiences so far.
Among the changes is a switch toward finding commercial banks to go in as co-lenders, to ensure that market discipline and professional underwriters are focused on the companies. In addition, the bank intends to do more indirect lending, in which it will provide funds to other, more experienced nonprofit organizations in poor neighborhoods and then allow those groups to make the actual loans to needy companies. That is intended to correct what Ms. Griego said had been a major problem: that the development bank was trying to create a lending and underwriting department from scratch.
"We've been reinventing the wheel," Ms. Griego said. "It's expensive, and it doesn't work to have our own people doing all that. We're not going to compete in this market. We're putting people with less experience than commercial bankers out there in this market. It does not make sense."
She added that in working jointly with commercial banks, the aim was to find more resilient and experienced borrowers, not just companies that had been rejected.
"This is like being a doctor and all of your patients have serious cancer," said J. Eugene Grigsby III, director of the Advanced Policy Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles and a member of the bank's board. "The rules we started with say in effect that we deal only with the financial untouchables. We ought to have more flexibility."
He also said the rules on job creation and the need for the businesses to be in the Empowerment Zone should be loosened. "The last thing a lot of start-up companies need is a requirement that they should create a lot of jobs quickly," Mr. Grigsby said. "They have to keep costs down for a while and minimize their payroll to survive."
GOING forward, the bank plans to look for ways to provide not only standard bank loans, known as senior debt, but also equity and subordinated debt to borrowers, since that capital is more "patient." It is longer term and can be used to help attract capital from usual commercial sources, thus getting the borrowers into the private markets more quickly. The bank already has a small venture-capital fund but is looking to expand the ways it invests.
"Coming up with another debt program does not really help this community," said Roberto Barragan, interim president of the Valley Economic Development Center, a nonprofit organization that has done lending deals with the Community Development Bank. Bank officials built their strategy, he said, "on the model of big companies, which can service a lot of debt."
"It's a philosophy that's been pretty much trashed for these small businesses," he added. "They decided on a debt solution before anyone had asked about the real needs."
Mr. Akers of Trinity Knitworks had much the same view. "I didn't need debt," he said. "I needed working capital."
The proposed changes in the bank's business plan have been long in coming. Other institutions have used some of these new ideas with great success.
IT is illuminating, for example, to compare the experience of the Los Angeles Community Development Bank with a private-sector organization called the California Economic Development Lending Initiative. It is a consortium of 45 banks that has a lending capacity of about $65 million, specifically for companies in depressed areas.
The Community Development Bank, which began with $435 million in capital, took two months to start running and 14 months to make its first loan. It was under great political pressure to put money into the community quickly. Almost no one on the staff had extensive commercial banking experience.
The private consortium, by contrast, solicited two grants and used them for a two-year study on how it should operate before it took its first organizational step. Its staff is made up almost entirely of experienced lending officers. Today, the private consortium has made about $29 million in loans, with only 2 percent of the total in default.
George Williamson, the consortium's chief executive, insists that his organization work with commercial banks to make sure that the borrowers stay close to the private markets.
"Having a close relationship with banks is an important part of our strategy," he said. "I would see dealing with companies no bank would lend to as a silly way to proceed."
There are some experts who say that the Community Development Bank has legitimate functions, but that it should get out of direct lending, because it requires too many skills. Instead, they say that it should be only a co-lender with commercial banks, or that it should lend indirectly through other nonprofit groups.
"At this point I think they need to look at the possibility of closing down the direct lending altogether, just close it," Mr. Barragan said. "They should give management of the portfolio to somebody else who has the experience."
Still, Ms. Caines of the Empowerment Zone Oversight Committee said that her group had surveyed the bank's borrowers and that she was slightly surprised by the results.
"They all said the paperwork was overwhelming them," she said. "And it was clear the bank was really weak on technical assistance to these companies. But, truthfully, I expected it to be more negative."
Albert Gold, the chairman of Gold Graphics in Pacoima, a town at the northern end of the San Fernando Valley that lies in the Empowerment Zone, said his business was thriving until the Northridge earthquake in 1994. The roof of the plant collapsed, and Mr. Gold said he was woefully underinsured. He had a strong track record and was able to secure a loan from the Community Development Bank.
"In some ways, the earthquake was the best thing that could have happened to us because it caused us to undertake an involuntary upgrade of all our facilities," he said. "The technology we put in was the technology the market was looking for."
He said he had gone from about 90 employees to about 180. But one big drawback, he said, was the full year it took to have his loan approved and financed -- a frequent complaint about the program.
NOT far from his modern printing plant is a store called Double D Western Wear, another loan recipient. Abel Diaz, the owner, is bitter about his experience. Mr. Diaz said the bank forced him to incur $18,000 in costs, mostly for accounting work and an expensive appraisal of his property, just to get the $420,000 loan, . And in the year it took him to get the financing, his business had declined so much that he actually needed more capital.
"All of us here ran into the same situation," said Mr. Diaz, who has run the store for more than 30 years. "We came to them because we were in trouble and needed the money. What were we supposed to do in that year?"
The bank said Mr. Diaz was in trouble from the start and that it had offered enormous assistance to help him keep afloat.
Mr. Garcia of West Coast Metal Finishing said his experiences speak to the bank's possibilities. On his office walls are photos of himself with President Clinton, the vice president and Mayor Richard Riordan of Los Angeles -- all elements in the dream he says he has experienced.
"You grow up in East L.A., and you don't have anything in this life, and there I was at the White House," Mr. Garcia said, recalling his visit there. "They gave me an opportunity. Who else is going to do that around here?"

HEADLINE: A Chief Intent on Raising Eyebrows

BYLINE: By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
ONE recent afternoon, Mel Karmazin, the chairman and chief executive of CBS, stormed through the office of the network's late founder, William S. Paley, on the 35th floor of Black Rock, the CBS headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, and collapsed into a chair in the adjoining conference room.
"I've had a busy day," he said, fiddling with his silk tie in a gesture of mock fatigue. "First I worked on Letterman's monologue. Then I wrote all of Howard Stern's jokes for tomorrow. And then, I programmed all the radio stations." 
 No one present -- Mr. Karmazin's public relations envoy, a reporter and a secretary standing at the door -- cracked a smile. It seemed almost plausible.
Three years ago, Mr. Karmazin, a former radio advertising salesman who next year will become the chief operating officer of Viacom-CBS, one of the world's largest producers of news and entertainment, was virtually unknown outside the tiny, tightknit radio industry. Now he is the putative heir to Sumner M. Redstone, 76, Viacom's chief executive.
Yet already Mr. Karmazin is talking about rising further. "When Jack Welch retires," he said, referring to John F. Welch Jr., the chairman of General Electric, which owns the rival NBC, "I plan to buy NBC."
He's not necessarily kidding. He said he believed that Washington could be persuaded to further deregulate the media industry, especially as television audiences continued to migrate to cable channels.
And this is not the first time since the Viacom-CBS merger was announced in September that Mr. Karmazin has gone window-shopping: according to several reports, he has his eye on America Online as an acquisition candidate.
But Mr. Karmazin's all-consuming aspirations raise several questions. What exactly has he accomplished in his three years at CBS? Is his background in advertising broad enough to run not only a network, always considered a public trust, but also a soon-to-be-merged company that will have an $80 billion market capitalization and revenues of $19 billion from movies, broadcasting, cable, publishing and music networks?
Put bluntly, can Viacom-CBS be run successfully by a man who has never seen a television pilot, has rarely made programming decisions and has never supervised creative people on a daily basis? Will his methods of bone-deep cost-cutting and micromanaging work at a company the size of Viacom-CBS? And just what is he thinking about the future of the lightning-paced media industry?
Mr. Karmazin, who leads a quiet life for a media mogul, is a reluctant celebrity, uncomfortable speaking about himself. He is, for example, reputed to be a voracious reader, but when asked about his choices, he snapped: "I'm not going to tell you what books I read. I'm not Oprah. Oprah, you should care about what books she reads. If I were going to form a book club and make lots of money off it, then I would tell you what books I read." (His example shows that he is not a man to miss an opportunity for free promotion. King World -- the distributor of "The Oprah Winfrey Show" -- agreed to merge with CBS seven months ago in a stock swap valued at $2.5 billion.)
When Mr. Karmazin does talk about himself, he sometimes seems awkward, more like a hyperactive 10-year-old boy than a 56-year-old chief executive. He hates to sleep, saying: "Why sleep? It's too boring." So it's not surprising that he rises at 4:30 a.m., without an alarm clock, and rarely takes a vacation, despite owning a beach house at the Jersey Shore.
But his history gives some clues about what he will do at Viacom-CBS, an entity that Mr. Karmazin fondly calls the "largest advertising platform in the world," where he will split duties with Mr. Redstone. It is an advertising behemoth, he has said, that guarantees "unprecedented cross-promotional opportunities around the world."
For Mr. Karmazin, stock price is an obsession, "shareholder value" a mantra he often drops into conversation, and advertising is king.
Mr. Karmazin's roots in advertising go way back. He grew up in Long Island City, Queens, and attended P.S. 1 there. His mother worked in a factory while his father drove a taxi. During high school, Mr. Karmazin was a typist at an ad agency in Manhattan.
UNIVERSALLY known as Mel (reporters who use his full name, Melvin Alan, receive a phone call from a CBS spin doctor with this reprimand: "Ted Turner is not Theodore Turner. Walt Disney is not Walter Disney. And Mel Karmazin is not Melvin."), Mr. Karmazin attended Pace University at night while he worked as an advertising salesman by day.
"The only day I stayed awake in college was the lecture about Supply and Demand 101," he said. His first CBS job, at $17,500 a year, was selling ads for the radio division. In the late 1960's, when his commission exceeded $70,000, his boss balked at his cut; Mr. Karmazin soon left to work for John W. Kluge at Metromedia, the broadcasting company. He married, had two children -- his son owns a small radio broadcasting company in Wisconsin -- and, a few years ago, divorced.
Broadcast advertising sales creates a particularly aggressive, jumpy kind of sales representative, said Norman Pattiz, an old friend who is chairman of Westwood One, the largest radio network in the country and the country's largest supplier of local traffic and news to radio stations. (CBS owns 13 percent of the company's stock and controls 10 percent of the voting power.) "You can't sell yesterday's time," he explained. "So it creates a very intense kind of person. You need to know two things to be a great salesperson. You need to know the business, which Mel does. And you need to ingratiate yourself to the people you are doing business with. And Mel does that, too."
In 1996, Mr. Karmazin was the chief executive of the Infinity Broadcasting Company, which then owned 44 radio stations around the country. He had taken Infinity public in 1992 for $17.50 a share, then sold it to CBS in 1996 for $170 a share, securing his reputation on Wall Street.
That year, using a business strategy that has since become his trademark, Mr. Karmazin approached CBS, which merged with Westinghouse in 1995, and proposed that Infinity buy the company. Instead, CBS acquired Infinity for $4.9 billion that June, and Mr. Karmazin came aboard to run the combined radio operations of Infinity, Westinghouse and CBS, along with its outdoor advertising business. Intent on making his stamp on the company, he was instrumental in persuading Westinghouse to dump its industrial manufacturing assets and to refashion the company under the CBS name.
Michael H. Jordan, then chairman and chief executive of CBS, appointed him to head CBS's station division. Mr. Karmazin rose quickly -- so quickly that in October 1998 he forced Mr. Jordan's resignation, assuming his titles in January. (A spokeswoman for Mr. Jordan, who runs an Internet company in Pittsburgh, said he would not comment.)
IF Mr. Jordan did not sense it, others saw Mr. Karmazin's ambitions.. "He is always comfortable saying: 'I don't have to control everything. Just let me run it.' Once he runs it, his performance allows him to control it," Mr. Pattiz said. "I heard somebody describe him one time by saying, 'Mel is completely without guile. He'll never stab you in the back. He'll stab you in the chest.' "
"Well, that's true," Mr. Karmazin said, hearing the analysis. "I will be totally honest with you -- even if you might not like what I have to say."
But Don Imus, the radio personality whom Mr. Karmazin installed more than 10 years ago at WFAN, one of Infinity's 163 radio stations, knows him well -- and said he believed that Mr. Karmazin, whom he described as "a cross between Lenny Bruce and Don Rickles," had no strategy.
"I really think he goes from one point to the next with no master plan," Mr. Imus said. "I think his goal is to try to get CBS stock to 100."
Indeed, since Mr. Karmazin's arrival, CBS stock has more than tripled, from a low of $15.375 in July 1996 to a close of $51.8125 on Friday.
Jessica Reif Cohen, a media analyst at Merrill Lynch who is one of many loyal Mel Karmazin hagiographers on Wall Street, also said he is single-minded. "He is focused on one thing: bringing the stock up," she said. "Sumner can do the strategic visionary thing, and Mel can be the behind-the-scenes operator, pushing the stock, and that's what he will do."
When Mr. Karmazin arrived at CBS, his goals were few but clear: cut costs and raise revenues so that the stock moves relentlessly higher. To the dismay of many in the news division, he has cut spending on the evening news -- as all three networks have done in recent years -- even as he has invested $30 million to $50 million in a potentially risky morning program, "The Early Show;" it made its debut on Nov. 1.
The rationale is simple. The highest-rated morning program, NBC's "Today," generated $150 million in advertising revenue last year. CBS's previous morning offering had only about one-fourth that amount.
Little wonder that at the "CBS Evening News," Mr. Karmazin is vilified as the man who has continued cuts that began under Laurence A. Tisch, the chairman of CBS from 1986 to 1996, whom news staff members felt had financially handcuffed the news division. According to CBS executives, the "CBS Evening News," under a reorganization instituted by Mr. Karmazin, has continued to reduce its number of camera crews. CBS executives refer to it as surgery, not an amputation, but will not say how many news crews the network has, though they acknowledge that the total is far below the 125 crews fielded by NBC.
Mr. Karmazin makes no apologies. "We've been pretty good at watching expenses," he said. "And we're pretty good at generating revenues. We've always been known to make huge investments in properties that are worth it." For example, Howard Stern, the shock jock Mr. Karmazin hired at WNEW, reportedly has a salary of $20 million a year; Mr. Imus makes at least $6 million, and Leslie Moonves, the president and chief executive of CBS Television, got a raise from to $6 million, from $4 million.
Mr. Karmazin added: "You know, I'm real comfortable getting my own cup of coffee. I don't need a kitchen staff. I'd rather put that money on the screen or in radio, not to behind-the-scenes stuff that is about making my life more comfortable."
After slashing $180 million from the CBS budget last year, Mr. Karmazin has raised revenue. Ad revenue climbed after he and Mr. Moonves started preaching to advertisers that CBS's viewers, while older than those of other networks, were a wealthier and thus better demographic group. But it is unclear whether ad revenue rose because of the demographic push or because of a healthy economy and a big surge in Internet advertising, of which Mr. Karmazin said CBS has managed to garner a majority. CBS's ad rates have increased: for the 1999-2000 season, NBC remains the most expensive with an average unit rate -- the cost for a 30-second prime-time spot -- of $171,114, a drop of around 9 percent from the previous year, according to a survey by Advertising Age published each fall. ABC has an average rate of $165,773, down 3.6 percent.
But CBS, though still in third place, has managed a 27 percent increase, to an average unit rate of $163,773.
Mr. Karmazin's other trick at CBS was to put the sales force on commission, without salary, a measure instituted two years ago and noted throughout the industry.
That is not punitive, he said. "The purpose of it is to have them on your side, so the salespeople don't sit there and say, 'Hey, I did all this work and the big guys get all the money.' " He recently told CBS radio advertising sales managers that he expected to present a sales representative with a $1 million annual paycheck -- a first -- someday soon. His advice to the sales staff is: "Don't give me lame excuses like, 'Oh, Mel, but our ratings are down, wah, wah.' Or, 'there's no activity.' Your job is to create activity."
Significantly, Mr. Karmazin is not a man given to romantic notions about network history. He has said he will sell the network, which analysts say has lost money every year since the mid-1980's , if he cannot make it profitable. (This year, he says it will be profitable.) Asked if he ever senses the presence of Paley's spirit in his office, he said: "His ghost? Well, if it makes a better story for you, sure I feel Paley's ghost." Then he wiggled his fingers, raised his eyebrows and said, playfully, "Whoooo!"
Befitting a man who thinks first of a network as a billboard, not the home of "60 Minutes" -- once even betting Tom Wolzien, a media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, Mr. Wolzien's salary that he could sell the network for more than it was worth -- Mr. Karmazin spends little time worrying about programming. (Mr. Karmazin replies: "Oh, that was a chump-change bet anyway.") He depends on the executives in programming to report to him on an almost-daily basis.
"Mel once said, 'The day that Leslie Moonves asks my opinion about programming is the day I sell all my CBS stock,' " Mr. Moonves said. "That's flattering, but it says a lot about our relationship."
Howard Stringer, chairman of the Sony Corporation of America and a former president of CBS, said that was Mr. Karmazin's style. "He is smart to know what he does not know," he said.
When he moves to the merged Viacom-CBS, Mr. Karmazin is expected to approach his management duties with similar tactics, if Mr. Redstone lets him run the show. By most accounts, the pair's engagement joins two like-minded men from similar backgrounds in a mission to generate more advertising revenue than any other company.
"We are kindred spirits," Mr. Redstone said. "Neither one of us was born with a golden spoon in his mouth. We're both entrepreneurs at heart and we're both driven by the same motivation."
STILL, there has already been a tense moment. Last month, the two appeared to differ over Blockbuster, Viacom's ailing video rental chain. One day, Mr. Karmazin told analysts that it would be best to spin it off, but later that week, in a conference call with reporters, Mr. Redstone shot back that Blockbuster was "not a sick child."
"It is a booming, thriving business," he said, quashing rumors that he would sell it.
Nevertheless, Mr. Karmazin said he had a few concrete plans for the day the merger is approved by the Federal Communications Commission. For one, he wants to integrate music units of Viacom -- MTV and VH1 -- with CBS's radio, advertising and Internet entities in a Web site or series of Web sites.
"Let's assume that the American consumer likes music," he said. "And let's say that music might be something that might be on the Internet. Take our radio stations. Take MTV and VH1, and that's a pretty compelling site. You're able to drive traffic to it because you've got all these billboards and forms of advertising, and I think that's all pretty compelling."
He also intends to scrutinize the children's programming business. "There are interesting opportunities that are still hypothetical," he said. "But they have a lot of children's programming. What if our networks wanted to run some children's programming? That might not be a bad idea." He added that Infinity's radio stations might be a great fit for MTV and VH1 in terms of concert promotion.
The merger also fulfills Mr. Karmazin's longtime desire to own cable properties.
"Up until now, CBS didn't have any cable, and that was a problem," he said. "And now we have cable. We didn't have a major studio and now we have a studio."
None of this will quell the objections raised when the merger was announced, especially from vocal critics in the advertising industry. Because the merger will meld the CBS network, CBS television stations, radio stations and billboards with Viacom's MTV, VH1 and Nickelodeon and the company's stake in the UPN network, some fear that the consolidation will allow Viacom-CBS to charge excessive rates and unfairly corner some advertising markets.
"I don't think what Mel is doing is good for the country," said Jean Pool, executive vice president and director for North American media services at J. Walter Thompson in New York. "I don't think monopolies are good for the country or the economy. Mel is like the robber barons at the turn of the century. And you remember what happened to the oil business and the railroad business at the turn of the last century. They became terrible monopolies that were eventually broken up."
Mr. Karmazin said the new company would "not have, quote, unfair leverage with any constituency at all." He added: "Wherever advertisers want to spend their money, we're going to be there. We're indifferent to where they spend their money, as long as they spend it with us."
Ms. Pool said she did not expect the new company to increase any ad rates before the Senate antitrust subcommittee and the Federal Communications Commission approved the deal. "I am sure Mel is half-joking when he says he wants to buy NBC," Ms. Pool said, "but if that is his dream, he is going to have to be a good boy and at least look as if he is behaving himself."
Jon Mandel, co-managing director of Mediacom, the media services arm of Grey Advertising, said the merger's so-called synergy -- extolled by Mr. Karmazin and Mr. Redstone -- was nonexistent.
"There is no natural fit between Viacom and CBS that makes sense," Mr. Mandel said, noting that audiences watching "60 Minutes" were not also watching MTV. He had one exception: "If you look at music, however, there is a tremendous fit."
Mr. Mandel said the most fundamental issue with the Viacom-CBS deal would be "if Mel ever tries to change the programming."
At CBS, the closest Mr. Karmazin ever came to that occurred when Don Hewitt, the producer of "60 Minutes," and Mike Wallace, one of the program's correspondents, appealed to him in 1998 to not go forward with a plan put forward by Mr. Moonves and Andrew Heyward, the president of CBS News, for "60 Minutes II." One CBS executive said that Mr. Hewitt and Mr. Wallace begged Mr. Karmazin to quash the show, but that Mr. Karmazin listened and said, "Sorry guys, but I'm not going to override Andrew and Leslie."
According to another executive, the encounter had Mr. Karmazin barking: "We're putting on '60 Minutes II' whether you like it or not. If I have to slap the title '60 Minutes II' across 'The Nanny,' I'll do it, but you're going to have '60 Minutes II.' "
 IN either case, it was a good move: "60 Minutes II," despite its low ratings with younger audiences, is ranked 24th in Nielsen ratings, after ABC's "Dharma and Greg" and NBC's "Law and Order: Special Victims Unit." Mr. Karmazin smiled and said only this: " 'The Nanny?' Does that sound like me? I think the team at "60 Minutes" was concerned. I was pleased that they cared so much about the brand name."
Mr. Karmazin is notoriously tough with staff, and has become only tougher.
"If he likes you, it would be great to work for him," Ms. Cohen said. "If he doesn't, it would be a nightmare." And his style is famously brusque.
One former CBS executive said he once attended a meeting with Mr. Karmazin and Fred Drasner, then the co-publisher of The Daily News of New York. After the meeting, according to this account, Mr. Karmazin stood at the elevator, looked at the CBS executive, and said: "The day I fire you, the company's stock will go up $2." (Mr. Karmazin fired him a few months later.)
Some people who know Mr. Karmazin say an early career humiliation is at the heart of his intensity. In the late 1960's, Mr. Karmazin, then at WCBS Radio, tried to get a job at WCBS television. "CBS was dominated by a bunch of guys who were in the job because they looked good and went to the right schools," another executive said. "The network business was great. O and O's were big. Cable was still far over the horizon." (In TV jargon, "O and O" refers to stations that are owned and operated by a network.)
Mr. Karmazin, though, "wore the wide lapels and the hair going out in 18 different directions, his tie undone," this executive said. "He came off as a street tough. And I believe that he was rejected on a cultural basis." Mr. Karmazin still wants to prove them wrong, the executive said.
Mr. Karmazin's spokesman said he had no comment about the story.
Ascending at Viacom-CBS would, of course, be the ultimate payback. Mr. Karmazin said he had no intention of trying to oust Mr. Redstone. But a provision of the merger was that if Mr. Redstone were to step down, Mr. Karmazin would become chief executive of Viacom-CBS. "And that was to satisfy the board members," Mr. Karmazin said. The two are paid identically, but Mr. Redstone also retains the right, until 2003, to dismiss Mr. Karmazin, which doesn't seem to bother him at all.
At a dinner meeting with analysts last week, Mr. Karmazin said that whether he and Mr. Redstone are friendly is "immaterial," stressing instead the assets of the combination. "But," he added, "I expect to be here in 20 years."
To which Mr. Redstone said: "And so do I!"
Mr. Karmazin had little to say about Viacom's movie and book business, but those who know him said he would keep his hands off unless profits eroded.
"What is it that I would want this job for?" he asked. "I enjoy running my company. I like hands-on operations. I don't like the visibility."
But, he added: "I'm very conscious of the fact that I wasn't successful as a kid. I wasn't making a lot of money. I didn't come from a rich family. I was comfortable in that lifestyle. But having all this stuff -- people coming up to you, being in the public eye -- is more, well, unusual for me. I don't enjoy it."

HEADLINE: PORTFOLIOS, ETC.;
As the Stock Rally Broadens, The Role of the Fed Grows

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
HERE'S some good news ahead of the meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers on Tuesday: The stock market rally is broadening. More stocks are doing better -- or at least not as poorly as they once were -- compared with the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.
Strategists are generally more comfortable with a broader market; a market with narrow leadership is often headed for a fall. 
 According to one measure, the Laggards indicator produced by Jeffrey M. Warantz, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, 58.8 percent of 7,598 common stocks are trailing the performance of the S. & P. 500 by 15 percentage points or more over the last 12 months. But that is down from a record 77.1 percent in April.
More evidence of the broadening is seen in the Russell 2000 index, which measures smaller-company stocks and is up 17.3 percent from its low for the year in March. On a wider scale, Mr. Warantz said companies with market capitalizations of $10 billion or less were up 15.6 percent, on average, in the second and third quarters of this year. This performance of midcap to small-cap stocks compares with an average decline of 4 percent for companies with capitalizations of more than $10 billion.
And that broadening has occurred while the Federal Reserve has been raising its short-term interest rate target, to 5.75 percent from 5.25 percent. Another increase is possible on Tuesday.
While the Fed was raising its target three full percentage points between February 1994 and February 1995, this index jumped to 44.4 percent from 28.6 percent, meaning that the leadership of the market narrowed significantly as investors chose to switch into the most liquid, big-company stocks that have good, long-term earnings records.
What does all this mean? One interpretation is that even though the market has broadened, the improvement has been only from the narrowest market since the indicator was created in 1971. Now at 58.8 percent, the indicator is still well above the average of 34.9 percent and at the fourth-highest point since 1971. By this interpretation, the performance since May is not as positive as it looks.
"The market was excruciatingly narrow at its worst and it is still narrow at its best," said Byron R. Wien, United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
Another interpretation is that this is just another market indicator that worked in the past but isn't working now. That is the story for many of the guides that equity strategists and Fed policy makers have been using to help them understand the performance of the stock market and the economy in the last half of the 1990's.
In 1973, 1987 and 1990, this indicator peaked and the stock market had a big fall. This time, that hasn't happened yet.
Or the index is proving that investors in general are still confident about the outlook for stocks -- and probably more confident than they were several months ago.
The economy is growing strongly, while inflation still appears in check. Third-quarter operating earnings for the S. & P. 500 have risen 22 percent, according to the First Call/Thomson Financial, and the forecast for growth in the fourth quarter is 18 percent. Further, the outlook for avoiding Year 2000 computer problems is improving.
That optimism could change if the Fed raises interest rates again. The October increase of 0.3 percent in the Producer Price Index for finished goods, excluding food and energy, was bigger than expected and revived worries about a Fed rate increase. But strong productivity numbers and moderate retail sales data, reported on Friday, seemed to calm investors.
With a third quarter-point rate increase, the Fed would finish erasing the three cuts made in the fall of 1998 to counter the impact of Russia's bond default, the near collapse of a major hedge fund and the deepening global financial crisis.
That would set the stage for new concern. Investors may find a third rate increase tolerable because they were just taking back the largess of 1998. But if the economy does not slow down, the speculation will turn to where the Fed goes from here. That means the real test for stocks and bonds won't come until after a third rate increase.

Snail Mail: It's Alive! And It's Mutating!

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
THE United Parcel Service, with its fleet of unfashionable brown trucks and brown-uniformed drivers, picks up big boxes, moves them around the world and then drops them off. Founded in 1907, the company is in many ways a quintessential bricks-and-mortar business, the kind that the new economy of the Internet was supposed to overshadow.
Yet when U.P.S. offered shares to the public last week, investors greeted the new stock with an enthusiasm usually reserved for dot-com ventures whose founders' parents had not even been born by 1907. U.P.S.'s shares quickly shot from $50 apiece to $70, and the company is now worth about $85 billion. It was the largest initial public offering in history, making the early valuations that Wall Street placed on darlings like Amazon.com and Yahoo! look almost old fashioned. 
 At first glance, it appears to be a stirring vote of confidence in snail mail, a debunking of the myth of a paperless society and a harbinger of good things for the United States Postal Service. Neither the telephone nor the fax put a dent in the amount of mail people send. Now, perhaps, the Internet will fail to, as well.
The underlying message, however, is more complicated, and it indicates that the concept of mail is indeed on the verge of changing radically. Mail is really two different things -- letters and packages -- and their fortunes are quickly diverging. One is likely to be all but replaced by e-mail eventually. The other, contrary to some initial expectations, will only grow in importance.
Since Benjamin Franklin created the United States Postal Service in 1775, mail has meant, above all else, the bills and personal letters that come in envelopes, which weigh just a few ounces and are smaller than a human forearm. In fact, the Postal Service was legally barred during its first 138 years from delivering just about anything else. For packages, people used separate "express companies" like American Express and Wells Fargo. Even today, when people hear "mail," they think primarily of the bundle of envelopes waiting in the mailbox, not a package sitting at their door.
But the Internet could eventually usher in a day when almost all those envelopes will contain advertisements, and the majority of mail people really care about will come in packages. The rest -- letters, bills, money and even photographs -- will arrive through the computer, mail experts agree. Already, according to Jupiter Communications, Americans are sending 122 billion e-mails annually, more than half the number of pieces of mail that the Postal Service handles each year.
And that shift promises enormous changes for the largest civilian employer in the United States and one of the few institutions that every American comes into contact with every week.
The Postal Service's rivals, by contrast, are watching their business grow, as U.P.S.'s record-setting day showed. With information shoving aside industry as the fastest-growing sector of the economy, the country today is far more reliant on small goods that can be shipped from point to point. "A billion dollars of G.D.P. created by Microsoft weighs less than a billion dollars of G.D.P. created by Ford Motor Company," said Paul R. Schlesinger, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
At the same time, electronic commerce causes more items to be shipped individually, rather than taken home from the store, and it leads to more returns. Thus the recent success of U.P.S. and Federal Express, and investors' confidence that the two will be making good profits in the decades to come.
The picture isn't so rosy for the Postal Service. It relies on the sending and paying of bills for $17 billion, or almost 30 percent, of its revenue. These pieces of first-class mail, often sent short distances from, say, an electric company to a house in the same metropolitan area, help subsidize the organization's ability to charge just 33 cents for a letter that travels from Santa Fe to northern Vermont and costs more to transport.
But that subsidy won't be around for long. Next year, Internet portals like Yahoo! and a number of large banks will begin allowing people to receive many of their bills over the World Wide Web, pay them with a credit card or directly out of their bank accounts and never lick an envelope. "That's serious business," Bob Krause, the Postal Service's vice president for e-commerce, said, anticipating the loss.
As a result, the volume of first-class mail is likely to decline for the first time in the Postal Service's history, starting in 2003, according to the General Accounting Office. "The Postal Service may be nearing the end of an era," a G.A.O. report concluded last month.
WITHOUT that $17 billion in revenue, or a substitute for it, the post office would have to raise its prices significantly or perhaps even cut back on its six-day-a-week service, Mr. Krause said. The latter would be a historic shift Congress is unlikely to allow. The operation of a post office, after all, is one of the powers the Constitution specifically grants the federal government.
"People like having their own little post office, especially in small towns where it is the center of town," said Stephen Moore, an economist at the Cato Institute who was a member of a Reagan administration commission that tried unsuccessfully to privatize the post office. Other people like knowing a letter they send will be physically held by the recipient, be it a faraway parent or a lover, and that it won't end up being forwarded all over the Internet.
The overall threat to the Postal Service is serious, however, and that is why it is furiously trying to expand its business. This month, it began allowing consumers to return items bought over the Web by printing a postage label from their own computers and billing the suppliers. It also wants to set up an electronic post office where people could conduct secure transactions over the Web.
But the efforts could fail for any number of reasons, including the political debate over whether a federal agency should compete with private companies. If those efforts fall short, some of Postal Service's more than 800,000 jobs will be in jeopardy. And the relatively low price of sending an envelope to any home in the country would rise, much as the stock of U.P.S. might.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Playing Catch-Up With Monopolies

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN President Clinton signed legislation on Friday updating the Depression-era law governing banking, insurance and Wall Street, he was doing little more than allowing Washington to catch up with the sweeping changes that have reshaped the financial services industry over the past few decades.
In Congress, the two parties have yet to really address the public outcry over the health care industry's drive to cut costs. While they dithered, the landscape was abruptly altered again last week when one of the nation's largest managed care companies reversed the trend by returning power over treatment choices to doctors. 
 In an economy that changes as swiftly as this one, driven in particular by breathtaking technological advances, it is clear that government faces a growing challenge in keeping pace with what is happening on the front lines of business.
Securities regulators are struggling to keep up with the rapid growth of on-line stock trading. No one in Washington seems to know quite how to protect consumers against unauthorized use of data about everything from their medical histories to their supermarket purchases.
"Government at every level is totally frustrated," said Thomas J. Donohue, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce.
Nowhere is the issue playing out more vividly -- or with higher stakes -- than in the Justice Department's antitrust case against the Microsoft Corporation, the biggest player in an economically vital industry that has redefined all the nostrums about the importance of speed.
Is the Justice Department pursuing Microsoft over the way the company developed and marketed products that are yesterday's news? Can the case be resolved before the industry is transformed once again? Should the government even be butting into an industry that has thrived because it has developed largely outside the scope of regulation and legislation?
"It's only with the Microsoft case that the law has collided with an area of technology moving so fast as to call the basic premise of federal litigation into question," said John Shepard Wiley Jr., a law professor at the University of California at Los Angeles. "If your remedy is moving at the speed of federal litigation, the question has to be whether the whole thing will be relevant."
LOOKING across a range of issues, from telecommunications to banking to the development of online commerce, consumer advocates say they fear that technology and a general ideological drift toward greater respect for the market has created unwarranted deregulatory zeal.
"No one will be able to stop technology, and that's not the answer here," said Frank Torres, legislative counsel at Consumers Union, an advocacy group. "There are a lot of benefits from technology all through the marketplace. The question is who's looking out for the little guy, and what role should government play?"
The government is by no means unaware of the problem. In the Microsoft case, both the Justice Department and the federal judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, have been quite successful thus far at keeping the proceedings moving quickly, at least by the standards of antitrust litigation.
More broadly, antitrust law has proven relatively flexible over the past century in dealing with changing business environments. As markets have become more global, for example, antitrust policy has become less hostile to sheer size in assessing mergers and focuses more on whether business combinations benefit consumers.
To some extent, the mismatch between the pace of business and government is an old problem. Legislation, with all the power it holds to create, nurture or cripple industry, can take years to emerge from the maw of partisanship and special interest pleadings. The new financial services bill was tied up for decades by disputes among the affected industries.
Moreover, just because government operates slowly does not mean that its influence on the private sector is reduced. The simple threat of action can often be enough to compel changes. Congress may be all but paralyzed right now over how far to go in giving patients more power to challenge medical decisions by managed care companies and the right to sue when things go wrong. But the H.M.O. that gave power back to doctors last week, United Health Group, was no doubt aware that failure to respond to public and political pressure could lead to legislation with far stricter terms.
A similar pre-emptive strategy might be at work in the Microsoft case. Microsoft might stall the process of getting to a final ruling and imposing any sanctions in the hopes that a friendlier administration will take office in 14 months, or in the belief that its current generation of products will be archaic by the time the process is complete. But the company might just as easily give competitors a bit more running room in response to the antitrust case, or agree to a settlement, accomplishing at least some of what the government set out to do without enduring a protracted legal struggle.
TO many conservatives, the problem is not so much that the government must scramble to keep up as it is that government is trying to stifle entrepreneurial and fast-moving industries precisely because they are difficult to regulate. They fear that in responding to the issues raised by technology and global markets, government is about to do for the 21st-century economy what the antitrust laws and regulatory agencies created a century or so ago did for the 20th century: create a system that gives Washington power over every nook and cranny of the economy.
"The Internet is something many conservatives believe is a model of the free market," said Marshall Wittman, director of government relations at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group. "You have to wonder, will we see by the end of the next century the same degree of regulation in that marketplace as we have now in the general marketplace?"
Still, there seems to be a prevailing belief that even in times of rapid change -- and perhaps especially in such times -- the government should strive to maintain its role in setting rules for the marketplace and enforcing them when they are broken.
"The total free market is a barroom brawl," said L. William Seidman, a former top banking regulator. "The real free market is a prizefight."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Sudan's Slaves and War Get a Second Look

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya

 BODY:
WHAT'S an ambitious senator to do? Get re-elected or awaken the world to slavery in faraway Sudan? That was the crux of a recent episode of "Touched by an Angel." Oversimplified and a mite soppy, the show presented one character who reflected American attitudes toward Sudan (and most African countries for that matter).
"Forget Sudan," says the character. "Waste of time. Not going anywhere. It's a complicated issue no one understands. Trust me." 
 While it is true that the majority of Americans care little about Sudan, a small number care deeply, in part because the country presents such stark issues: Famine, drought and endless aid. Arabs in the north warring with Christians in the south. Slavery and its morally snarled question of self-styled "redeemers" buying humans back.
And so Sudan is becoming that rarity in American foreign policy: an African nation with a grass-roots constituency, however small. American schoolchildren raising money to free people for $50 to $100 apiece. Christian-right allies in Congress worried about the Islamic threat finding common ground with black legislators concerned about slavery. Officials of various aid agencies meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright to plead for a new course on Sudan.
These constituencies want the Clinton administration, which is already hard on Sudan, to get tougher still or to loosen up. So what's a superpower to do? Here are a few options:
* Bomb them. Sounds extreme but the choice presents an interesting, if slightly unfair, argument: African leaders often complain that the West does not treat crises in Africa as seriously as elsewhere. If the rest of the world decided that slavery or the absence of peace was intolerable and the Sudanese government refused to take steps, would NATO use the same force it used on Slobodan Milosevic?
Probably not. Administration officials might argue that war in Sudan, while not good for stability in the region, is only one of several conflicts there with less strategic value than, say, eastern Europe. The Sudanese government would also argue that slavery does not exist, although it acknowledges what they call "tribal hostage-taking" of southerners by government-backed northern Arab raiders. But the United Nations and other organizations say they have documented the existence of slavery.
On the other hand, the United States has already bombed Sudan after the terrorist bombing of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The result was a public relations disaster. There is considerable doubt that the pharmaceutical plant bombed produced nerve gas or that it was tied to Osama bin Laden, who is accused of directing the attack on the embassies.
THE bombing strike also temporarily increased support for the otherwise unpopular Sudanese government, both locally and among Arab nations.
* Arm the rebels. Even supporters of this option know it is improbable. Yet some in Congress say that America should, as it did in countless cold war conflicts, train and arm the Sudan Peoples Liberation Army, the main rebel group in the South, and other groups.
"It will create a balance of power," said Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, who traveled to Sudan this summer. "If this situation was occurring in Europe or the rest of the world -- South America or Asia -- we would be all over it."
The many opponents of this option, including the Clinton administration, argue that the war in Sudan cannot be won by either side. It would only add more weapons to a region with too many already. Some of the rebels are accused of human rights abuses, war profiteering and being as uninterested in peace as the government in Khartoum.
* The China route. The aid officials who met with Ms. Albright advocate a policy endorsed by European nations: engage Khartoum, lessen antagonism and help influence an end to the war.
"Right now the United States has cut itself off from the negotiations," says Peter D. Bell, president of Care USA and one of the aid officials who met with Ms. Albright. "I don't see any cost to the United States in engaging in discussions and engaging in explanations about how the outstanding problems could be resolved."
ADVOCATES say that kind of relationship could include rewarding Sudan for progress toward peace or ending human rights abuses with, for example, an easing of the economic sanctions imposed in 1997.
The Clinton administration seems to be testing this approach, even as it keeps up strong oratory against the government. In her trip to Africa last month, Ms. Albright pledged to pick up half the cost of the next round of regional peace talks on Sudan. This summer, the administration appointed a special envoy to Sudan. But the appointment angered the Sudanese, who saw it as meddling.
* Sit tight. Despite all the talk of a new, more muscular American policy toward Africa -- with greater trade and engagement -- some American officials say bluntly that the overriding aim is not to get too involved in a faraway place like Sudan.

After-Hours Trading: Managers Aren't Thrilled

BYLINE: By RICHARD TEITELBAUM 

 BODY:
After-hours trading is upon us. But who will be doing the buying and selling when the Nasdaq market and New York Stock Exchange start staying open past their current closing time of 4 p.m.? Nasdaq is in the midst of the transition, and the Big Board will make the change next year.
A survey conducted by Midwood Securities, a brokerage firm in New York, suggests that the traders will not be mutual funds, pension funds or insurance companies. In October, the firm surveyed 700 institutional money managers with assets of $500 million to $500 billion; 60 percent of those responding said they would probably not participate in extended trading hours, and of the remainder, almost all said they thought that it would not play an essential role in their business. 
 "If institutions had their way, we wouldn't be extending the hours," said Terry L. March, chief executive of Midwood.
When asked about potential benefits of extended hours, 51 percent said they did not expect any. About one-quarter felt that it would be useful in reacting to company and industry news, economic or political developments and earnings reports.
The managers were also asked about their concerns over after-hours trading. Some 65 percent of the respondents said they were worried about a possible lack of liquidity and 63 percent cited the prospects of increased volatility.
So who are the likely beneficiaries of extended trading? No surprise there -- 68 percent of the managers cited the computerized trading systems known as electron ic communication networks, or E.C.N.'s, many of which already offer after-hours trading.

Of all the offensives he has mounted as secretary of defense, William S. Cohen, a Republican, might be remembered less for the military operations than for persuading a reluctant Democratic president to sign this year's $17 billion spending increase for the Pentagon.
Within that one measure, the members of the armed services received their largest pay increase since 1981, and the Defense Department got its biggest budget increase since the end of the cold war. 
 The budget ends the so-called peace dividend, or nearly 10 years of shrinking armed forces and military budgets after the collapse of Communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. And the budget finances the possible deployment of a national missile defense system that has thrown into question decades of arms control treaties.
As the only Republican member of the cabinet, Mr. Cohen was tapped to become the administration's voice on tough national security policies before the Republican-controlled Congress. Instead, Mr. Cohen, a former senator from Maine, may have accomplished the opposite and sold a Republican agenda -- including the military increase -- to President Clinton, who already had a reputation for stealing Republican ideas.
When Mr. Cohen asked Congress to support Mr. Clinton's military spending bill, the only complaint was that it was not big enough. Republicans added $5 billion, increasing the military pay raise and finding money for projects in some of their home districts, so that the military budget for the year totals $268 billion.
With some reluctance the president signed the bill, making the United States military the biggest beneficiary of the federal budget surplus.
For Mr. Cohen, the increase was essential. "If you don't have an adequate budget, you don't get the increases, you don't keep the people, and you don't have a military," Mr. Cohen said in an interview in his office in the Pentagon's executive wing, with its wall of windows facing the Potomac River. "Things tend to deteriorate. We were in that process of things going down, and now we've brought it back up.
What Mr. Cohen called deterioration stemmed from the defense priorities of NATO nations, priorities he now challenges. After the fall of the Berlin Wall 10 years ago this week ended the Communist threat in Europe, the countries in the Atlantic alliance scaled back their military spending in favor of social and economic programs. Now Mr. Cohen is openly pushing the European allies to follow the United States with major increases in their military budgets once again.
He has some allies. Lord Robertson, the new secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, said in a visit here that one of his top goals was to convince the European allies that they would have to expand military spending to field modern forces.
"We've got to get to the point where we could do another Kosovo," Lord Robertson said.
On the other side of the ledger, Mr. Cohen failed to persuade Congress to support the administration's more contentious policies. Last month, Republican opposition led to the defeat of the nuclear test ban treaty. But Mr. Cohen refuses to take responsibility for that failure.
"Don't put that on me," said Mr. Cohen, who was called back from an Asian trip to do last-minute lobbying.
Earlier this year, he failed to overcome the Congressional propensity to hold onto local jobs and contracts and could not deliver the votes to close military bases the Pentagon said were no longer necessary. Closing of the bases could have saved the Defense Department billions of dollars in coming years.
Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is running for President, defended Mr. Cohen, an ally and friend, saying that the defense secretary should not be blamed for losing those battles supported by Mr. Clinton. At the same time, Mr. McCain said, the defense secretary himself did not deserve credit for the spending increases, which the senator said the Republicans would have passed anyway.
But Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who once worked for Mr. Cohen, said she gave him credit for persuading the president to sign the big budget increase instead of provoking a fight with the Republican-controlled Congress over military spending.
"I'm sure he got the president to sign," Senator Collins said, echoing the perception among Republicans in Congress that Mr. Cohen overcame the president's economic advisers, who had urged a smaller increase for the Pentagon.
But to some, this budget victory signifies that Mr. Cohen has failed to live up to his reputation as an independent thinker, first earned as a young congressman who broke party ranks to vote with Democrats to release the tapes of President Richard M. Nixon in the Watergate investigation.
He has avoided fights with the entrenched Pentagon bureaucracy. His travels are intended to hold together this country's longtime relationships, whether in the Middle East or Asia. And his backing of a national missile defense system to protect Americans from a limited attack by an emerging nuclear power or an accidental missile launching by a major one is the endorsement of a plan that has been on the Republican agenda for years. The plan is a scaled-down version of the "Star Wars" program of the 1980's.
"We're closer to the old cold war Pentagon than we were three years ago," said John Pike, director of programs at the Federation of American Scientists, a private group here.
 
Keeping in Step With the President
Unlike Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, with her backing of forceful military responses to halt extreme human rights violations abroad, Mr. Cohen has kept a low profile in debates over the contentious matters of war and peace.
Perhaps as a result, the air campaign over Kovoso has become known as Madeleine's war, which is fine with Mr. Cohen -- so long as he and the Defense Department get credit for winning that conflict.
"If it's her war, then it's the department's peace," he said.
Samuel F. Berger, the president's national security adviser and the other member of the triumvirate that makes security policy, described Mr. Cohen as modest.
"He is one of the few people who underestimates his own accomplishments," Mr. Berger said.
At the Pentagon, Mr. Cohen is called reserved, cautious and, at times, distant. When he arrived, Mr. Cohen kept on nearly all of the political appointments who were there, adding only three aides. He also followed the basic military plan left by his predecessor, William J. Perry.
"I wanted to continue what he had started," Mr. Cohen said.
He kept in step with Mr. Clinton by initiating programs to protect against the threat of biological, chemical and nuclear terrorist attacks.
Apart from the two military operations fought under his watch, in Iraq and Serbia, Mr. Cohen made his biggest waves with his budget increase and the first financing to deploy a national missile defense system. The first installment of the defensive missile system, which is prohibited under the Antiballistic Missile Treaty signed with Moscow in 1972, would be built in Alaska as a shield to protect all 50 states against attacks by rogue states, in particular North Korea.
Mr. Cohen and his aides say they believe the Russians will agree to modify that treaty -- even though the Russians have said they will not. Instead, Moscow is asking the United Nations to help keep the treaty in tact and stop the United States from deploying a missile defense system.
The ABM treaty remains the cornerstone of most subsequent arms reduction agreements.
 
Growing Into Role Of Military Chief
Shortly after Mr. Cohen appointed Gen. Henry H. Shelton chairman of the joint chiefs of staff two years ago, the general presented the secretary with a book to set the tone for their relationship. The book was "Dereliction of Duty; Lyndon Johnson, Robert McNamara, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Lies that Led to Vietnam," by H. R. McMaster (Harper Collins, 1997).
"It's what I never wanted to happen between us, the chairman and the secretary lying and going behind each other's backs," General Shelton said he told Mr. Cohen.
If anything, Mr. Cohen, who has never served in the armed forces, has become the ideal spokesman for the military, General Shelton said. "I trust him implicity to represent the armed forces point of view," the general said.
Mr. Cohen did so forcefully this year by persuading President Clinton to approve the Defense Department budget. Early in 1998, the chiefs put together their budget proposal, calling it "Houston -- We Have A Problem." In it, they set out a dire view of the effect of almost 10 years of shrinking military budgets, saying the cuts had imperiled the armed forces' ability to be ready for combat.
"Before we only had anecdotal evidence," General Shelton said. "This time we had the data we needed. We went up and got the secretary's support and he acknowledged we needed to do something, that we were not taking care of the troops."
In September, Mr. Cohen organized a symposium at the National Defense University, bringing together the joint chiefs and top overseas commanders to help him present the case for the huge budget increase to a special guest: Mr. Clinton.
Two events had helped pave the way for Mr. Clinton to accept the proposal. By early summer the Congressional Budget Office had reported that the budget surplus would run $43 billion to $63 billion. And just days earlier the Starr Report about Mr. Clinton's relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky had been released, raising questions about his ability to survive as president.
All of a sudden there was money for an increase in military spending, and it made sense politically. The president and then the president's aides agreed to the raise.
"That's an extraordinary achievement in a budget that was otherwise static," said Mr. Berger, the national security adviser, who supported increasing the military budget.
As it turned out, Mr. Cohen found almost no opposition to the plan in Congress, which held relatively few hearings on the whole $268 billion spending bill.
Democrats and Republicans said it was reassuring to see their old colleague, Mr. Cohen, sitting across the table with the country's top military leaders, making the arguments for the Clinton administration.
"He's got such a mastery of detail that he can show his case in a strong way," said Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, the ranking minority member of the Armed Services Committee. "Particularly with the end of the cold war, it's kind of counterintuitive that the defense budget should be increased."

Lions Discover Life After Sanders

BYLINE: By MIKE FREEMAN 

 BODY:
Joe Louis Arena in Detroit was packed last month with more than 17,000 people waiting excitedly for the boxer Prince Naseem Hamed to enter the ring. Before Hamed did, the announcer introduced two hometown guys, one of them Barry Sanders.
Sanders, perhaps the most popular athlete in the city's history, was booed. 
 And it was not just a smattering of boos. There were many of them, and they were throaty, heartfelt boos.
Last Sunday, Detroit Coach Bobby Ross had just led his Sanders-less and Herman Moore-less team past the St. Louis Rams to push the Lions' record to 6-2. As Ross was walking off the Silverdome field, he did so to cheers and to one fan's screaming, "Bobby, you're my hero!"
This is called flipping the script. When Sanders decided to quit the team last July, Ross was the villain and Sanders was the hero sticking up for his rights, tired of playing for a team that did not know how to use him and was a constant loser. Ross's job status was even questioned. He was the one who lost Barry Sanders, and he would eventually pay for it.
Then something funny happened on Ross's way to the unemployment line. He showed what a masterly a coach he is, taking a team without its top two stars in Sanders and Moore, a Pro Bowl wide receiver, who has nursed several injuries all year, and guiding it to a 3-0 division mark.
So suddenly Ross is a demigod, and Sanders is one of the most disliked people in and around Detroit. Is this "The X-Files"?
"Nothing surprises me anymore," Ross said last week, chuckling when asked if he was shocked by the Lions' success. "This has been a wild year for us, but it shows what happens if as a team you give yourself a chance."
When it comes to Sanders, Detroit now has a chip on its shoulder. The Lions were angry when most members of the news media assumed they would take a swan dive in the standing without their Pro Bowl running back on the roster. Of course, that was an understandable presumption. How many teams can withstand the loss of their star player and still survive?
Statistically, Detroit isn't doing as well on offense as it did with Sanders last season. At this point last year, the Lions had 1,132 yards rushing, compared with 783 yards now. Total yardage last year at this point was 2,648 yards, against 2,385 now.
But Ross has managed to turn the loss of Sanders into a positive. The Lions have rallied around his absence, and Ross's more conservative game plans have worked. The defense, which against the Rams had all 11 starters on the field for the first time this season, has been outstanding, as have the special teams. Kicker Jason Hanson has connected on 16 of 17 field goals, with half his conversions coming from 47 yards or more. He has hit twice each from 47, 48 and 49 yards and once each from 50 and 51 yards. His accuracy has given Detroit the edge in close games.
The Lions now seem offended when asked about Sanders. "Barry Sanders has nothing to do with this team," safety Ron Rice said last week. "We were 5-11 last year with him. Barry is probably at home watching our games. If you guys see him, tell him I said hi."
As Mike Holmgren showed in Seattle by refusing to bow to the salary demands of his star player, Joey Galloway, the Lions demonstrated that no single player is bigger than the team, even if that player is a future Hall of Famer.
The team owner, William Clay Ford, was asked what would he say if Sanders called. "I'm not going to play that game," he said.
Has he spoken to Sanders recently? "No, nothing has changed," Ford said. "We haven't talked to Barry and Barry hasn't spoken to us."
The current rumor is that Sanders will be traded to Washington next season, though a Redskins official strongly denied that, saying the club had not even thought about acquiring him. Sanders may still return to Detroit, though the chances of that happening are extremely slim.
But if he does return to the Lions, Sanders, for the first time, will have to adjust to the Lions, instead of the Lions having to adjust to him.
 
The Cast Is Changing
This has been one of the quirkiest seasons in a long time, maybe the strangest of this decade, and the novelty of unfamiliar teams dominating the National Football League is being reflected in the fan portion of the Pro Bowl balloting. Fans began voting Nov. 1, and four of the top six vote-getters thus far have never played in the annual Hawaii game.
The top 10 vote-getters as of late last week are: Indianapolis quarterback Peyton Manning (33,380), St. Louis quarterback Kurt Warner (31,547), St. Louis running back Marshall Faulk (29,447), Indianapolis running back Edgerrin James (26,802), New England quarterback Drew Bledsoe (26,328), Indianapolis wide receiver Marvin Harrison (26,009), Tampa Bay fullback Mike Alstott (25,965), St. Louis wide receiver Isaac Bruce (25,380), Washington quarterback Brad Johnson (25,368) and Tennessee running back Eddie George (22,705).
Other Pro Bowl voting tidbits:
*Washington's Champ Bailey is the leading vote-getter among National Football Conference rookies and is second to Dallas's Deion Sanders among all N.F.C. cornerbacks.
*Bailey's teammate Stephen Davis is second to Faulk among N.F.C. running backs.
*Tennessee defensive lineman Jevon Kearse leads all American Football Conference defensive rookies and is second to New England's Willie McGinest among the conference's defensive ends.
*Orlando Pace of St. Louis leads all N.F.C. tackles. His teammate Adam Timmerman is third among the conference's guards.
*Minnesota's Randall McDaniel leads all N.F.C. guards and can increase his league record to 11 consecutive starts in a Pro Bowl.
*Miami's Olindo Mare leads all kickers and has more votes than Doug Flutie, Bruce Smith, Dan Marino, Keyshawn Johnson and Troy Aikman.
Fan voting counts for one-third of the total balloting for the Pro Bowl, with two-thirds split between players and coaches. They vote Dec. 20-21.
 
Boom! He's Got It
One of the most bizarre incidents of the season happened during the Minnesota-Dallas game in the Metrodome last Monday night, and it infuriated Vikings players and coaches.
Vikings wide receiver Cris Carter was running a pass route in the back of the end zone during the fourth quarter when quarterback Jeff George spotted him. George threw the ball and Carter caught it for a 4-yard touchdown pass to give Minnesota a 20-17 lead.
Carter's catch was a tribute to his concentration. A second before the ball landed in Carter's hands, a deafening cannon explosion sounded because the operator of a special cannon and fireworks display pushed the trigger too early. Amazingly, Carter didn't seem distracted.
Vikings players and coaches were furious after the game. And understandably, the operator of the cannon will no longer be near the controls.

HEADLINE: The Most Innovative Figure in Silicon Valley? Maybe This Labor Organizer

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif.

 BODY:
With a Prada bag and the air of an entrepreneur, Amy Dean is an unlikely labor trailblazer.
But as head of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s Silicon Valley office, Ms. Dean, at just 37 years of age, has become the labor movement's chief navigator, its Christopher Columbus in the roiling and uncharted seas of the new economy. 
 Working in a flourishing, free-wheeling valley that has hardly welcomed the often stodgy labor movement, she spends her days thinking up ways for unions to be relevant to workers in booming high-tech companies, and labor leaders nationwide are tripping over themselves to copy her ideas.
To help the valley's horde of temporary workers who have no health insurance, she has taken the unorthodox step of creating a nonprofit temp agency that, unlike most profit-making agencies, offers health coverage that temporary workers can afford.
She has established a research institute that has reshaped California's economic debate by churning out weighty studies, including one on the growing gulf between the haves and have-nots in a valley often thought to have mostly millionaire haves.
Through a full-court political press, she and her army of union members have pressured San Jose to enact the country's highest living-wage law, requiring city contractors to pay workers at least $9.50 an hour, nearly double the minimum wage many were earning.
And she has proposed using a hiring-hall concept to provide uninterrupted health and pension benefits to high-tech workers, who often jump from job to job.
"She's a new breed of labor leader," said Harley Shaiken, a professor of industrial relations at the University of California at Berkeley. "She's put a number of issues about Silicon Valley on the public agenda -- inequality, temporary workers and the lack of affordable housing. She's hit nerves in a way that resonates."
Her goal, Ms. Dean acknowledges, is nothing short of turning the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s Silicon Valley operation into a model for the rebirth of the labor movement, just as the valley's entrepreneurs have brought about a rebirth of American industry.
So far Ms. Dean's efforts have made a difference in the lives of many of the valley's have-nots. But all her strategizing has failed to strike a chord with the valley's haves, like software designers, who, happy with their stock options, often think unions are as useful as manual typewriters. Her biggest challenge is figuring out a way for unions to connect to these high-tech workers.
Her exploits, especially the living-wage law, are already irking many business executives, fueling worries that labor's growing power is signaling that a valley renowned as a fertile ground for entrepreneurs is turning unfriendly to business.
Ms. Dean put on such a bravura performance in pushing through the living-wage ordinance that business executives speak of her with equal parts awe and anxiety, fearing what her next battleground will be.
When the San Jose City Council was debating the wage ordinance Ms. Dean, all 5-feet-3 of her, came on like a petite field marshal. She packed the chamber with allies, lined up clergymen and community leaders to testify, and, in a sure-voiced speech, nearly brought down the house.
"There's part of me that envies her because she's so good at making an emotional, passionate pitch," said Steve Tedesco, president of the San Jose Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce, who fought the living-wage proposal, saying it would hurt San Jose's business image. "She's tenacious. She doesn't tilt at windmills."
Instead, she tilts at what she views as economic injustice, and she does so by mobilizing the valley's union movement to back her crusades. Five years ago, Ms. Dean took the helm of the South Bay Central Labor Council, becoming the youngest person to head one of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s 600 local councils.
While many of her fellow Generation X'ers see unions as irrelevant and outmoded, Ms. Dean says she is devoting her life to labor because she is convinced it is the only movement that can lift America's have-nots and stop the nation's rightward tilt.
"Why do I spend so much time in the heart of this new economy working with unions to build a voice for working people?" she said. "It has everything to do with whether we can revitalize an institution that so many people in this country depend on. It's the only vehicle in this country that can balance the political landscape."
Ms. Dean is a rara avis in labor, a movement not exactly known for promoting women, the young or those who spout new ideas. In a movement in which entrepreneurship is usually considered the enemy, she is an entrepreneur par excellence. And in a movement where blue jeans are favored, she wears pumps and gold bracelets, although her Ann Taylor look has not stopped her from earning the nickname the Mother Jones of Silicon Valley.
Convinced that the labor movement should be a social movement, Ms. Dean has refocused the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s operation here so it helps not just unionized workers, but all workers, especially those, like janitors and temps, on the bottom rungs.
When Ms. Dean took labor's helm here, many high-flying high-tech companies were using cleaning contractors that paid their janitors the minimum wage and scant benefits. So, working with the Service Employees International Union, she led a Justice for Janitors campaign to pressure and embarrass giants like Apple Computer so they would force their cleaning contractors to pay janitors higher wages and grant union recognition.
"The labor movement was strongest when we were the moral voice in the community," Ms. Dean said. "That's when people were attracted to us, wanted to be part of us, wanted to be mobilized into action with us. That's when we just weren't seen as a special members club for a few people. Our job has to be helping folks who don't have a voice."
Ms. Dean's central labor council represents 110,000 unionized workers: carpenters, nurses, teachers, but precious few high-tech workers. She acknowledges that labor's traditional contracts-are-everything model is largely irrelevant to high-tech workers because it is based on a 1930's notion of people working at industrial behemoths, not agile start-ups, and of workers spending decades at one corporation, not jumping like grasshoppers between companies.
Recognizing this, Ms. Dean has become the foremost exponent of a provocative theory: that labor should return to its craft guild and hiring hall roots as a way to keep up with the fast-changing high-tech world.
For high-tech workers, who often hold 10 jobs over a career, constantly losing and regaining health and pension coverage, Mr. Dean says unions should be a source of stability and protection. No other institution, she says, is as well-equipped to provide such workers with the two things they say they need most: portable benefits and continual upgrading of their skills.
Like the craft guilds of old, she says, unions could provide high-tech workers with classes in the latest skills, like writing new software languages, and could provide certification that workers have attained specific skill levels.
Then, like construction unions, which have hiring halls, unions could become the place high-tech employers turn to for trained workers. Also like construction unions, high-tech unions could provide uninterrupted health and pension coverage for workers who jump from job to job.
"Is the current model that unions are offering relevant to the knowledge workers of today? No." Ms. Dean said. "Are the principles and benefits that unions offer relevant? Yes."
Hers is a compelling vision for high-tech unions, but if she builds it, there is little guarantee that high-tech workers will come.
Ms. Dean has come a long way from the mid-1980's, when, having just graduated from the University of Illinois, she was planning to pursue a Ph.D. in public policy at the University of Chicago.
But inspired by a grandmother who organized apparel factories, she left academia for a job as an organizer for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union in her native Chicago.
In 1989, she moved to San Francisco for that union, partly to follow the man, now an Internet entrepreneur, who would become her husband. Soon she was climbing the ladder at labor's Silicon Valley office, where she made such a mark that John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, tapped her to head a national committee charged with recommending ways to rev up the nation's local labor councils.
Her most innovative work has come in seeking to help the thousands of temporary workers who flood in and out of high-tech companies -- secretaries, clerks, bookkeepers, software testers.
Aided by foundation grants, she has set up a nonprofit agency that is placing temporary workers, for the most part secretaries, who start at $10 an hour, compared with the $8.50 paid by many agencies. Unlike most for-profit agencies, her agency offers low-cost health coverage, paid sick leave and paid holidays and works with a community college to furnish subsidized courses to upgrade the workers' skills.
Ms. Dean has also set up an association, in essence a fledgling union, where temporary workers can compare notes, air grievances and map strategies to win better working conditions. The latest idea is to pressure agencies to adhere to a code of conduct requiring health insurance and a respectable wage.
Eileen Wodula, a secretary tired of bouncing between jobs, said, "This is like a dream come true because it's giving a voice to temporary workers."

HEADLINE: Furor Rises In Canada Over Hunt For Grizzly

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: KHUTZE INLET, British Columbia

 BODY:
Harry McCowan, a grizzly-bear hunting guide, looked harassed.
Boatloads of nature tourists were buzzing up and down this coastal rain forest waterway. Mr. McCowan's taciturn Austrian hunting client was emitting signals of impatience, and while a helper loaded rifles and supplies into a seaplane, a black bear started pawing through the camp. 
 "There are too many people here," grumbled the veteran guide, whose seaplane was stenciled: "Selling the last frontier." While the helper sent the curious black bear bounding back into the woods, he continued: "I used to have a grizzly quota of nine, now I have one. I used to kill three or four. Now, with luck, I will take one."
But judging by the protests at Canada's overseas consulates and the petitions regularly dumped on the desk of the provincial minister of environment, Mr. McCowan may be fortunate to get even that.
British Columbia, which in the 1880's marketed itself in Europe as the "sportsman's Eden," is increasingly defensive about its status as the last Canadian province to allow a major grizzly bear hunt. From an average of 350 grizzlies killed each year through 1992, the annual "harvest" dropped last year to 207.
Under pressure, the province is quietly restricting hunting of one what are among North America's largest land mammals. Under a lottery system introduced two years ago, only a quarter of the residents who apply get permits to hunt the bears. Areas along the border with the United States have been largely placed off-limits to hunting, following American complaints that a grizzly protected under the United States Endangered Species Act can be shot if it wanders across the border.
Toronto's Globe and Mail, echoing the sentiment of many Canadians, wrote in a recent editorial about the grizzly, "Given the scientific uncertainties about how many there are, the knowledge that the population is not large and the fact that the hunt serves no purpose, except giving hunters pleasure, why should it continue?"
Environmentalists agree. "Trophy hunting of North America's slowest-reproducing mammal is just unacceptable," Wayne McCrory, a bear biologist, said over the mess table of a tourist sloop that rocked at anchor here one recent evening. "We wiped them out from half of their range in Canada, and yet we continue to allow them to be hunted here."
As nature tourism soars on Canada's Pacific Coast, grizzly bear hunting shrivels in economic importance. Last year, according to the Environment Ministry, the grizzly hunt generated $700,000 in economic activity, compared with $2.5 billion generated by tourism as a whole.
"The whole concept, in this day and age, does not work that one person, for a few moments of glory, can go out and shoot a grizzly and put it on the wall of his den," said Eric Boyum, the skipper of the tourist ship. "That same bear could live its life, perpetuate the species, and, for tourism, could provide an experience, for many people, not just one."
Environmentalists also say that by having a spring and fall grizzly-hunting season, the province unwittingly provides cover to poachers, who sell bear claws and gall bladders to be marketed in Asia, where they are prized as delicacies. The Environment Ministry estimates that poachers kill up to 200 grizzlies a year.
"Poaching is happening all the time," said Merran Smith, a Sierra Club forest campaigner who lives in northern British Columbia. "In the valley just next door, a bear was found with its paws cut off. The paws and gall bladder go for the Chinese market."
In addition, every year wildlife officers kill about 50 grizzlies deemed a threat to humans. The bears kill about one human a year in the province.
In a fight over numbers, Environment Ministry officials estimate there are about 12,000 grizzlies in the province, while Mr. McCrory and other environmentalists estimate that there are only half that number. In neighboring Alberta, on the eastern side of the Continental Divide, there are about 800 grizzlies. Alberta keeps alive a tiny hunt, issuing about a dozen licenses a year.
In British Columbia, where the professional basketball team is the Vancouver Grizzlies, polls show that city dwellers oppose the hunt while rural residents support it. The Guide Outfitters Association of British Columbia, which represents 237 licensed guides, argues that hunting keeps grizzlies wary of humans and provides jobs to economically depressed rural communities.
Outfitters here say that a ban on hunting grizzlies would simply mean that wealthy hunters would fly over British Columbia to Alaska, where up to 1,200 grizzlies are shot every year. While grizzlies in the lower 48 states are protected as an endangered species, Alaska, where the population is estimated at 65,000, has a fall and spring season.

HEADLINE: Flat Tax Goes From 'Snake Oil' to G.O.P. Tonic

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
Four years ago, when Steve Forbes first promoted the idea of a flat tax, he was ridiculed by his fellow Republicans. "A truly nutty idea," said Lamar Alexander. Others, like Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich, heaped scorn, calling it everything from "snake oil" to "voodoo."
But in last month's New Hampshire forum among five Republican presidential candidates, when the question "Do you favor a flat tax?" was posed, three candidates said they favored throwing out the existing federal income tax code and replacing it with a one-rate plan. 
 "Sure, I'm for a flat tax," said Senator John McCain, who said he wanted a system so simple that a tax return could fit on a postcard. The conservative Gary Bauer boasted that his 16 percent flat tax was better than anyone else's.
And Mr. Forbes, who made the flat tax the centerpiece of his 1996 presidential bid, said he was happy that other Republicans were "coming on board."
What a difference four years makes. The flat tax -- having a single income tax rate for all American taxpayers instead of the current graduated set of rates -- is slowly gaining ground as a campaign issue in the Republican presidential race, much the way that school vouchers moved from a back-burner issue popular mainly among conservatives to one that is now embraced by all Republican candidates.
For Mr. Forbes, who has since added other conservative issues to his agenda, this is a bittersweet victory. While other candidates are stealing some of his flat-tax thunder, he can take credit for putting the issue on the political map. "It's almost an unalloyed blessing," Mr. Forbes, who advocates a flat 17 percent income tax, said in an interview. "But people just like it. They feel they are burdened by taxes and are really becoming very enthusiastic about it."
So far, the idea has yet to filter down to Congressional races, and the Republican front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, does not support it. But analysts say it has undeniably potent appeal.
"The flat tax is not quite Republican dogma yet," said Ed Gillespie, a Republican strategist and president of Policy Impact Communications, a public relations firm. "But it is something that most Republican candidates want to be for. The flat tax resonates strongly with core Republicans, and it has broad appeal across party and demographic lines. We've seen this before with school vouchers."
Grover Norquist, executive director of Americans for Tax Reform, a Republican anti-tax group, added: "Not everyone will have a completely written-out plan like Forbes. But they are all saying, 'That's the direction I want to go.' "
That direction is to reduce federal income tax rates across the board and provide a huge tax cut on a scale not seen in more than a decade. Tax experts on all points of the political spectrum say the rich will benefit more than the poor. Flat-tax proponents are playing to sentiment against Washington, especially the Internal Revenue Service.
One of Mr. Forbes's biggest applause lines is his vow to abolish the I.R.S.: "Take this monster, kill it, put a stake through its heart and make sure it never rises again to terrorize the American people."
And less money flowing to Washington means less government -- another goal of Republican conservatives. Backers of the flat tax say the economy would prosper even more if tax dollars now sent to Washington were left in private hands.
Liberal critics dislike the flat tax for the same reasons that it is gaining popularity among conservatives: because it would deprive the government of money, and top income tax rates would drop. The Forbes plan would reduce tax receipts to the government by $50 billion a year.
"There are two things that the flat tax is fronting for," said William G. Gale, a tax expert at the Brookings Institution, a Washington research group. "One is tax cuts for the rich -- though while not talking about it and putting it into the guise of simplicity or fairness. And it is an attack on government. It makes more sense to complain about how high taxes are rather than to attack all these wonderful benefits the government is bestowing on the people. The flat tax is a proxy for both those things."
A Republican who remains cool to a flat tax is Mr. Bush, who advocates flattening marginal tax rates by reducing them and eliminating estate taxes. But he has not endorsed a single-rate tax and has said he will have a more detailed tax proposal before the year's end.
Congress, too, has not embraced the idea, even though major elements of a flat tax -- eliminating estate taxes and reducing taxes on wages and capital gains -- have been proposed by various Republicans on Capitol Hill.
The flat tax that Mr. Forbes is pushing would change the entire theory of taxation embedded in the United States Tax Code. It would abolish the current progressive tax system -- one in which lower-income people are taxed at lower rates and higher-income people at higher rates -- and replace it with a single tax rate for everyone, rich or poor.
Current federal income tax rates on wages go from 15 percent to 39.6 percent. For instance, a family earning under $43,000 has a tax rate of 15 percent, one earning over $104,000 has a tax rate of 31 percent and a family earning over $283,000 pays at a rate of 39.6 percent. These are the marginal rates, or what people pay on the last dollars earned.
Of course, taxpayers now have a variety of ways to whittle their taxable income to fall into a lower tax bracket -- everything from mortgage interest payments, to donations to charities, to payments for child care, education and health care can be deducted to reduce taxable income.
A flat tax would replace this progressive system with a one-rate plan; under Mr. Forbes's proposal, for instance, both Bill Gates and the factory worker would pay the same 17 percent of income in taxes. In addition, there would be no deductions, like those for home mortgages, although some politicians, including Mr. Forbes, are beginning to soften on the issue.
Earnings from investments -- capital gains from stock and bond sales and dividend and interest income -- would not be taxed at all. Capital gains are now taxed at a 20 percent rate, and interest and dividends at the same rate as wages.
"The tax system we have now is steeply progressive," said Steve Moore, a flat-tax advocate and director of fiscal policies at the Cato Institute, a Washington nonprofit organization. "The wealthiest 1 percent are paying around one-third of all taxes, and the bottom 50 percent of the people pay only 4 percent of the burden. Anything you do to flatten tax rates will lead to lower taxes on the rich and more to those on the bottom."
Moreover, under a flat tax, it is possible for a wealthy person who lives solely off income from an investment portfolio to pay no taxes at all, while someone working in a factory or driving a cab faces a 17 percent tax bill. To many, the prospect of such glaring inequities between rich and working class is the plan's political Achilles' heel.
"I don't think the flat tax will work for a lot of reasons," said Michael J. Graetz, a professor at Yale Law School and a tax policy official in the Bush administration. "As it's been proposed, it involves a massive tax cut for the very best-off people in society. There will be questions as to why a tax cut ought to be concentrated in that group."
He said taxpayers in the $75,000 to $150,000 income range would be hurt the most under a flat tax.
This is an especially sensitive political point for Mr. Forbes, whose $440 million net worth comes from inherited wealth, and for Republicans in general, as the party tries to shake an elitist image and appeal to new and less-affluent constituencies.
For corporations, taxes would fall to 17 percent from 35 percent under the Forbes plan. In addition, the flat tax would allow corporations to deduct the costs of capital improvements in a single year, rather than spreading them out over time. This would favor young and fast-growing companies, which could see their tax bills wiped out entirely, over older businesses, whose years of heavy capital spending are behind them. A company like, say, Intel, a computer chip maker, would benefit under a flat tax, while older manufacturers like the General Motors Corporation could be hurt, tax experts say.
Corporations would see all other deductions wiped out under a flat tax, and many critics worry that once the tax code no longer provides deductions for workers' benefits -- especially health insurance -- companies will stop providing them.
"Flat-tax advocates are being completely deceptive when they say they are closing loopholes," said Robert McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a Washington nonprofit group. "Au contraire. Calling it a loophole-closing plan is a misnomer. This is more of a loophole-consolidations plan. It's saving the tax breaks that matter -- those that favor the high end and some corporations."
Mr. Forbes defends his flat tax by saying that the economic growth it would unleash would be so great that all Americans, even the poorest, would benefit from new-found wealth. And he said $50 billion in lost tax revenues to the government from a flat tax could be covered by the current $200 billion budget surplus -- which, Mr. Forbes said, should be dedicated to tax relief.
He also predicted that a flat tax would cause the nation's economy, which is already operating at full employment, to grow by 4 percent to 4.5 percent a year.
Yet those rosy predictions have been greeted with skepticism. "Forbes is proposing an enormous tax cut that drawfs anything Congressional Republicans were proposing this year," said J. D. Foster, a former Bush tax adviser and head of the Tax Foundation, a Washington nonprofit organization.
"And he says that the economy, which is now cruising at a 3 percent real growth rate, will suddenly jump to 4.5 percent. Most economists have dismissed that out of hand. Short of annexing Mexico and some Asian countries, I don't know where you get that growth rate."
Moreover, even flat-tax proponents say that Mr. Forbes's 17 percent rate is too drastic a cut in government financing. A 1996 Treasury analysis said a flat tax rate of 20.8 percent would be needed to raise the same revenues as the current system. Even a flat-tax supporter like Mr. Moore of the Cato Institute said a 20 percent tax rate is more realistic -- "17 percent is probably too low."
And if Republicans succumb to political pressure and begin to give back popular deductions -- like the mortgage interest deduction -- tax experts estimate that the number might have to climb even higher.
Even Mr. Forbes is softening his plan. He is offering personal exemptions of up to $36,000 for a family of four. This means that the actual taxes paid under his plan could drop to as low as 10.9 percent for a family earning more than $100,000, a 33 percent tax cut, according to Mr. Forbes's campaign literature. His plan would also allow taxpayers to stick with the current tax system if it worked to their financial advantage.
"What you are beginning to see is a kinder and gentler flat tax," Mr. Moore said. "It isn't the same product talked about four years ago; it's a little more of a politically strategic version. The question is how do you get popular appeal for the flat tax, without all the baggage?"

Chart: "POLICY POSITIONS: Tax Proposals From G.O.P. Candidates"
Here is what Republican candidates for president are saying about taxes, according to each candidate's campaign Web site:
 
GARY BAUER -- "Our current tax code is needlessly complex and deeply unfair. It has been written by lobbyists and special interests who could care less about average Americans."
 
He proposes: A 16 percent flat tax on individuals and corporations. No corporate deductions allowed. Families would receive a $1,400 per person tax credit. Home mortgage and charitable deductions would be retained. Capital gains would be taxed at a 16 percent rate. Estate taxes would be eliminated.
 
GEORGE W. BUSH -- "It is conservative to cut taxes and compassionate to give people more money to spend."
 
He proposes: A cut in marginal tax rates, but does not specify rates. A phase-out of estate taxes. An increase in tax incentives for charitable giving and expansion of tax breaks for education.
 
STEVE FORBES -- "With more personal control you will be free to choose a less burdensome tax system that's simple, honest, fair and a real tax cut."
 
He proposes: A 17 percent flat tax on individuals and corporations, with existing deductions eliminated. Investment income would not be taxed. Estate taxes would be eliminated. Each taxpayer would get an exemption of $13,000 per adult and $5,000 per child. Corporations could deduct capital investments in one year.
 
JOHN McCAIN -- "It is essential that we provide American families with relief from the excessive rate of taxation that saps job growth and robs them of the opportunity to provide for their needs."
 
He proposes: Expansion of the 15 percent tax bracket, which is the lowest. Elimination of estate taxes and the so-called marriage penalty. Simplification of the income tax code and elimination of "special interest loopholes." (pg. 30)

HEADLINE: ANNUAL SPENDING ON MEDICARE DIPS FOR THE FIRST TIME

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Medicare spending declined in the most recent fiscal year for the first time in the history of the program, even as private health insurance plans reported increases of 4 percent to 10percent, new government data show.
The decline was slight -- 1 percent from 1998 to 1999 -- but significant because Medicare has grown every year since its creation in 1965. 
 The reduction in Medicare spending surprised many experts on health policy. Medicare had been growing 10 percent a year when Congress curbed Medicare payments to doctors, hospitals and nursing homes in 1997. Lawmakers said then that they intended to slow the growth of Medicare, but they never expected to reverse it.
The savings stem from many causes, including cuts made by Congress, low inflation and efforts to rein in fraud. Those conditions may prove temporary, experts said. Even so, they could relieve worries about the program's long-term stability and make it easier for Congress to provide coverage of prescription drugs or other benefits.
The federal fiscal year 1999 ended on Sept. 30. In April, the Clinton administration reported a slight decline in Medicare spending for the first half of the fiscal year, but said it was a fluke, not a trend. In June, the White House was still forecasting an increase in Medicare spending for the full fiscal year.
But new statistics from the Treasury belie those predictions. Medicare spending fell 1 percent, to $212 billion in the most recent fiscal year, from $213.6 billion in the prior year.
By contrast, when the Balanced Budget Act was passed in 1997, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that the government would spend $231 billion on Medicare in 1999 -- or $19 billion more than was actually spent.
"The decline in Medicare spending is a phenomenal development," said Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, "considering the increase in the number of beneficiaries and the resurgence of rapid growth in health costs in the private sector."
In a recent survey of 600 large employers, Hewitt Associates, a consulting concern, found that the cost of their employee health benefits increased by an average of 7.8 percent this year, the largest increase since the early 1990's.
One big difference between Medicare and private health plans is that Medicare generally does not cover prescription drugs.
A sharp increase in drug spending is widely cited as a major reason for the increase in the cost of private health plans. Drug manufacturers have developed dozens of effective but costly new medicines, and drug companies have encouraged greater use of their products through advertisements aimed at consumers.
President Clinton and Congressional Democrats are mobilizing a campaign to secure Medicare coverage of prescription drugs. The issue is sure to be hotly debated in next year's presidential election and in many Congressional races.
Medicare spending rose an average of 10 percent a year from 1990 to 1997, then climbed 1.5 percent in the fiscal year 1998.
The decline in Medicare spending in the last fiscal year means that more money remains in the Medicare trust fund to buy health care for people who are elderly or disabled. But it does not solve Medicare's long-term financial problems.
Medicare finances health care for more than 39 million people. The number of beneficiaries has increased about 1 percent a year and will grow faster as millions of baby boomers join the rolls after 2010.
Nobody can say for sure when the growth of Medicare spending will resume. The slowdown has already lasted longer than experts predicted. Congress and the White House agreed this week to restore some of the money cut in 1997. But the amount to be restored, averaging less than $2.5 billion a year, is relatively small, compared with total Medicare spending.
Health policy experts in and out of the government gave these reasons for the drop in Medicare spending:
*Hospitals and other health care providers, scared by the federal crackdown on Medicare fraud, have become more conservative in their billing practices and more diligent in trying to comply with federal rules.
*Hospital admissions for Medicare patients have unexpectedly declined. Even more surprising, the severity of illness for the average patient, as measured by the government, has also declined. So Medicare is paying less for the average patient than it otherwise would.
*Health care providers are taking more time to submit claims, perhaps because they have been preoccupied with efforts to prepare their computers for the year 2000. And the government has been slower in paying claims. These delays temporarily slow Medicare spending, but do not save money in the long run.
*Inflation has been lower than expected. This lowers Medicare spending because payments to health care providers usually include an allowance for inflation.
*In writing rules to carry out the 1997 law, the Clinton administration has restricted Medicare spending more than Congress intended.
The law established complex new formulas to pay health care providers. Marilyn Moon of the Urban Institute, a public trustee of the Medicare trust fund, said that confusion about the new payment rules might have depressed spending.
"A lot of health care providers don't know what to make of the new law and the new rules, so they take a go-slow approach," Ms. Moon said. "They are interpreting the regulations even more stringently than they have to."
William S. Custer, an economist at Georgia State University in Atlanta, said the Medicare cutbacks could indirectly contribute to increases in costs for private health insurers.
"Hospitals, doctors and other health care providers may be unable to give discounts to private health plans because of the financial constraints imposed on them by Medicare," Mr. Custer said. Many hospitals say Medicare does not fully cover their costs, so they find it difficult to cut prices for patients with private insurance.
More than six million Medicare beneficiaries, about 16 percent of all recipients, are in health maintenance organizations, and the number climbs a bit each month. In theory, H.M.O.'s can save money for Medicare.
But federal officials contend that because of flaws in the reimbursement formula, the government spends more, on the average, when patients join H.M.O.'s than it would spend on the same people if they were in Medicare's traditional fee-for-service program.
Enrollment in Medicare H.M.O.'s was lower than expected in the last year. Clinton administration officials cite that as another factor that helps explain why overall Medicare spending was lower than anticipated.

Financial Stocks Bask in the Limelight

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE

 BODY:
Financial stocks are looking for a little respect, but that's asking a lot, given investors' love of all things technology of late.
Not only were financial stocks like American Express, Citigroup and J.P. Morgan in favor on Friday, but they helped push the Dow Jones industrials higher for the week, to close at 10,769.32. (The newfound enthusiasm did not come at the expense of technology stocks, which led the Nasdaq to its 10th record close in the last 11 sessions on Friday, to 3,221.15.) 
 On Friday, President Clinton signed into law the sweeping overhaul of Depression-era banking laws, opening doors for mergers among banks, securities firms and insurance companies.
Earlier in the day, investors gained confidence that the Federal Reserve would not raise rates for a third time this year when the Federal Open Markets Committee meets on Tuesday. Two government reports indicated that inflation was in check.
Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment officer at Gruntal & Company, told Bloomberg News, The economy has overall strength, and there is no inflation underneath it, so the Fed need not take any action next week.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
Visiting Pilgrims and Paul Revere

BYLINE: By SETH MARGOLIS; SETH MARGOLIS is a novelist who writes frequently about travel.

 BODY:
IN early October, with the leaves in Central Park just beginning to turn, a New England weekend beckoned as insistently as the beach in summer. My wife, Carole, and I quickly settled on the Boston area. Thanksgiving was approaching, and our children, Maggie, 9, and Jack, 7, knew little of their Colonial roots. We'd introduce them to Pilgrims and minutemen while squeezing in a some leaf peeping -- without breaking the bank, we hoped.
Alas, we weren't alone in thinking October an ideal month for a long weekend in the cradle of American democracy. Every hotel we called was booked solid for every weekend in October -- a popular time for parents to visit their children at the many colleges in and around Boston. The only room we found was at the Renaissance Hotel in Bedford, Mass., about a half-hour northwest of downtown Boston. We were planning to spend two of our three days outside Boston anyway, so we booked a room. 
 "Let's explore Colonial America!" isn't exactly a rallying cry for the Pokemon generation. When it comes to sightseeing, our kids require a steady stream of encouragement, snack breaks and outright bribes to keep them motivated. Luckily, Boston's Freedom Trail, our first destination, is packed with enough historical and gustatory distractions to keep even balky children from getting too cranky. In fact, the best part of the day for Maggie and Jack was following the trail's occasionally elusive red line as it snaked along sidewalks, across streets and into and out of sites -- a red brick road, not to Oz but into history.
Boston sparkled under a bright October sun. The growth in the technology and financial services industries have fueled a spate of new buildings and renovations in recent years. An early stop on the Freedom Trail, the Old State House, resembles a tiny Colonial jewel nestled in a setting of gleaming glass-and-steel skyscrapers. At the National Park Service visitor center across from the Old State House, by the way, you can pick up free activity books for kids; if they complete a series of projects along the trail, a ranger at the last stop will sign their books and anoint them junior park rangers.
At Faneuil Hall Marketplace, another early stop on the trail, the kids insisted on lunch, although it was only 11:15 a.m. Carole and I looked longingly at the stalls selling pot pies, fried clams and other New England treats, but the path of least resistance led to four oversized hot dogs, $2 apiece, followed by a bag of candy corn. "Trail mix," we called it, and headed back to the trail.
We went next to Paul Revere's house in the North End, following the Freedom Trail as it threaded under the elevated Interstate 93, which cuts off the North End and much of the waterfront from the rest of Boston. A huge construction project, "The Big Dig," will submerge this colossal urban mistake, while keeping the existing highway more or less operational. It's a hugely ambitious undertaking, the subject of its own interesting exhibit in a building opposite the New England Aquarium.
The Paul Revere house is a fragile-looking, Tudor-style wood structure whose 320-year survival seems a miracle in a neighborhood of densely packed 19th-century brick tenements. While waiting to enter ($2.50, children 5 to 17, $1), I launched into a minihistory lesson, beginning with "Listen my children and you shall hear" and ending with "The British are coming!"
A guide inside the house sternly informed us that Revere would never have shouted "The British are coming!" -- everyone in Boston was British! Another guide in the second-floor master bedroom encouraged Maggie to try on reproduction Colonial costumes, which brought the era alive for her.
We also took a guided tour of the adjoining Pierce-Hichborn House (also $2.50 and $1), a Georgian-style survivor from 1711 that lacks any important historical associations but offers a particularly good look at middle-class life in 18th-century Boston.
The last stop on the trail was the U.S.S. Constitution, completed in 1797 and anchored across the Charles River in Charlestown. Touring "Old Ironsides," the kids were intrigued by the guide's discussion of the 20 or so "powder monkeys," young children, commissioned for their small size and agility, whose job was to rush between decks during battles carrying powder up from the hold.
None of the guidebooks we'd consulted had bothered to point out the lack of bus or subway service back to Boston. We noticed a few beleaguered families calling for taxis, and were about to follow suit when we discovered a ferry nearby that runs every 15 minutes, costs just $1 and affords beautiful views of the Boston skyline. It deposited us on Long Wharf, right next to the New England Aquarium, thus deciding for us what to do next.
The centerpiece of the aquarium is a four-story tank teeming with sharks, giant turtles and a variety of exotic fish. For an entry fee of $12, $6 for children, visitors can climb or descend a circular ramp, Guggenheim Museum style, to view the marine life at various depths (and take in a sea lion show, which we missed). Jack got his second wind in the Aquarium, mimicking the fishes' strangely human expressions as they returned his gaze. We all welcomed the break from the 18th century.
Dinner soon beckoned. There's an outpost of the Legal Seafood chain directly across from the Aquarium, but somehow we weren't in the mood for fish. I'd heard that the South End was the new SoHo of Boston, so we took the subway back to our car and drove there for dinner. Tremont Street is the dining hub of the neighborhood, its sidewalks teeming with fashionable young Bostonians and lined with enticing restaurants and cafes. Most were neither wallet- nor kid-friendly, however, so we were fortunate to find the casual and inexpensive Mildred's, at 552 Tremont.
Later, the kids insisted on a swim in our hotel's indoor pool. Even at 9 p.m. there were several children splashing around. What the Renaissance lacked in central location it made up in value and amenities. Our attractive room, with two double beds, was just $99 -- you can't beat that rate in Boston. Besides the pool, the Renaissance has a small fitness center and indoor and outdoor tennis courts.
After touring Revolutionary America on Saturday, we traveled further back in time on Sunday to the nation's earliest roots, in Plymouth -- 45 minutes south of Boston. Plymouth Rock, where the pilgrims supposedly landed in 1620, is covered by an elaborate portico on the edge of Plymouth Harbor. It's one of those tourist shrines, like the "Mona Lisa," that can't possibly live up to its reputation. At least it was free.
Far more interesting is the nearby replica of the Mayflower, which costs $3.75 to $5.75 to board. It's almost impossible to imagine 102 passengers (and 30 crew members) crammed into so small a ship along with their furniture, clothes, food and provisions for the New World, not to mention their livestock.
Plymouth offers many harbor-side spots for a seafood lunch. We headed for the cafeteria-style Lobster Hut on the Town Wharf. Our tab for a tasty lobster roll, bowl of clam chowder, two platters of lightly fried clam strips and four sodas was $29.
Plimoth Plantation, a re-creation of the original settlement a few miles outside of modern Plymouth (it uses one of a number of early spellings), was our next stop. (Admission costs $16 and $9, but can be combined with a Mayflower II ticket for a slight savings.) We had expected to breeze through the plantation -- the word "re-creation" struck terror in our purist hearts -- but we were quickly won over by its uncanny authenticity and earnest spirit.
We visited more than a dozen houses, amazed at how small, dark and primitive they were. Actors in Colonial garb portrayed the settlers, expertly answering questions in beautiful Shakespearean English. The kids enjoyed asking about daily life in the plantation; one of their favorite questions, on glancing around the one-room houses: "But where did everyone sleep?" (Answer: On straw mats on the floor.) Outside the plantation's walls, we also visited a small re-creation of a Wampanoag home.
We'd planned to tour Plymouth itself. We'd also promised the kids a swim at the hotel in return for meltdown-free sightseeing. Guess how we spent the late afternoon?
After drying off and changing for dinner, we headed to Cambridge. Having spent nearly an hour the previous day looking for parking in Boston, this time we drove to the Alewife "T" stop, about 15 minutes from our hotel, parked in a huge covered lot ($4 for the day), and arrived in Harvard Square 10 minutes later.
Cambridge may be a college town, but there's actually plenty to enchant young children. As we wandered the streets looking for a restaurant, we passed numerous street performers, including a rock band jamming Rolling Stones hits and a pair of actors on stilts performing "The Phantom of the Opera."
We ate at the Algiers Coffee House, a lively, casual restaurant on Brattle Street, just a block from Harvard Square. The chicken kebabs, lamb sausage and hummus were all delicious, and the tab was a digestible $29. During our after-dinner stroll through the Harvard campus, the kids agreed that Cambridge would be a cool place to attend college. This seemed a good opportunity to underscore the importance of schoolwork. Midlecture, the children become unaccountably distracted by a street juggler and ran ahead.
Our final day was spent in Concord and Lexington. Concord was at its autumnal peak when we pulled in, its numerous Colonial houses nestled cozily in breathtaking yellow and red foliage.
We stopped by the visitor center for a quick introduction to the town's history, then walked to the North Bridge, where the "shot heard round the world" was fired. An unusually moving site, the tiny wood bridge brought home the scale of the early battles, in which small groups of men fought at perilously close range.
Concord has many historic houses. In the interests of family harmony, we decided to concentrate on one. The Old Manse, near the North Bridge, proved a good choice: Nathaniel Hawthorne lived there, Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote there and Henry David Thoreau gardened there. Standing outside the Old Manse, one can easily imagine the anguish of its original owner, the Rev. William Emerson (Ralph Waldo's grandfather), as he watched, from the same spot, minutemen and redcoats firing at each other from opposite ends of the small bridge.
Maggie and Jack remained energetic, so we pushed on. In nearby Lexington we toured the Buckman Tavern, the only building on the Green still standing from April 19, 1775, when Battle of Lexington was fought.
The tavern (admission, $4 and $2) provides wonderful insights into 18th-century life, but we liked the etymological revelations best. For example, still visible behind the bar are scratch marks used by the tavern owner to track how many pints and quarts of ale his customers had consumed -- "minding his p's and q's."
We were all flagging now, but so close to the Hancock-Clarke House, just off the green (also $4 and $2), that we made it there for a fitting last stop. Built in 1698 and furnished in Colonial style, it was the house where Samuel Adams and John Hancock were sleeping when Paul Revere arrived to warn them of the advancing British troops. So what if he never really shouted "The British are coming!" Our kids had heard him loud and clear.
 
The bottom line: from Pilgrims to redcoats
Our family of four spent about $195 a day on our hotel, meals and sightseeing during our weekend in the Boston area.
 
Getting There
Driving is the most economical way for families in the Northeast to get to Boston, though you'll wish you never saw a car once you try to park. Garages run about $25 for 24 hours.
Frequent Amtrak service is available. From New York, the trip takes about five to six hours, and costs $48 to $69 each way. Children 2 to 15 pay half fare with an adult. Information: (800) 872-7245.
Once you've disposed of your car, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (M.B.T.A.), (617) 222-3200, will get you just about anywhere you want to go; The subway system, the T, costs just 85 cents for most rides. A Visitor Passport, for unlimited subway, bus and ferry rides, costs $5 a day, or $9 for three consecutive days.
 
Where to Stay
The Renaissance Bedford Hotel, 44 Middlesex Turnpike, Bedford, (781) 275-5500, caters to business travelers during the week. The $99 weekend rate includes a spacious double room, with a free cot available. For an added $15, two people can enjoy the hotel's large breakfast buffet.
On our next trip, we will try to stay at the Newbury Guest House, 261 Newbury Street, (617) 437-7666. Its 32 rooms run $110 to $155, with parking available for $15 a day. This bed-and-breakfast in the Back Bay was built as a private house in 1882, and entering it feels like stepping into a Henry James novel.
 
Where to Eat
If possible, plan your walk along the Freedom Trial so that you end up at the Faneuil Hall Marketplace for lunch or dinner. Virtually every cuisine is represented among the 40 stalls and restaurants in the Quincy Market building. Most stalls are open 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., and noon to 6 p.m. Sunday.
We enjoyed the pita pizzas and the delicious frittatas at Mildred's, a casual spot at 522 Tremont Street, in the heart of the newly chic South End. Four entrees and sodas, with two desserts, cost us $29; (617) 426-0008.
In Cambridge, you'll find several inexpensive restaurants catering to college students. We had a good meal at Algiers Coffee House, which is upstairs in Brattle Hall at 40 Brattle Street, one of the nation's oldest movie houses. It features a small choice of entrees, including kebabs and lamb sausage (about $8 or $9), as well as many coffees and teas; (617) 492-1557.
At the self-service Lobster Hut on Town Wharf in Plymouth, the clam strips are lightly fried and served with fries and cole slaw ($4.95 at lunch, $7.25 at dinner). The lobster roll ($6.50) is also excellent, as is the view of the harbor; (508) 746-2270
When we asked for a budget-friendly restaurant at the Visitors Information Center in tony Concord, the otherwise helpful representative rolled her eyes. But she directed us to two inexpensive spots in the heart of town, the unpretentious Milldam Store, 55 Main Street, (978) 369-2854, for simple sandwiches and soups, and the Brigham's outlet at 17 Main Street, (978) 369-9885.
 
What to See
You can follow the Freedom Trail on your own -- allow at least half a day -- or opt for a 90-minute abbreviated tour led by a National Park Service ranger. The free tours begin at the Park Service office at 15 State Street. Schedules: (617) 242-5642. Most sites on the trail are open daily, and several, including the U.S.S. Constitution and Old North Church, are free. Others, including the Paul Revere and the Pierce-Hichborn Houses charge $2.50, or $1 for ages 5 to 17. Information: (617) 523-2338.
At the New England Aquarium, Central Wharf, (617) 973-5200, www
.neaq.org, winter admission is $12, and $6 for children 3 to 11 (prices will rise 50 cents on Jan. 1). The fee includes the sea lion performances, given at least four times a day.
In Plymouth, there's no charge to view the Rock, but admission to the Mayflower II is $6.50 and $4 for ages 6 to 12. Admission to Plimoth Plantation is $16, $9 for ages 6 to 12. Combination tickets are $19 and $11; (508) 746-1622; www.plimouth.org.
Guided tours of the Old Manse, 269 Monument Street, Concord, (978) 369-3909, are $5.50 and $3.50 for children 6 to 12. Concord is accessible by M.B.T.A. train from North Station.
In nearby Lexington, the Buckman Tavern and Hancock-Clarke House charge $4, $2 for ages 6 to 16. Combination tickets for both, as well as the Munroe Tavern, are $10 and $4. The Lexington Historical Society, (781) 862-1703, operates all three. M.B.T.A. buses run from the Alewife Station of the Red Line to Lexington, except on Sunday. There is no public transportation between Lexington and Concord. SETH MARGOLIS

The Frugal Traveler column on Nov. 14, about a weekend in the Boston area, referred incorrectly to its geography and to the availability of transportation to and from the Charlestown Navy Yard. The Charlestown neighborhood, where the Constitution is anchored at the Navy Yard, is on the Inner Harbor, not the Charles River. For the return to downtown Boston from the yard, the No. 93 bus stops outside Gate 4; there is also a ferry, which the author took.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT;
Predicting Sunny Days For Latin Stocks

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
THOSE analysts who last year consigned Latin America to a long convalescence after the economic crises in Asia and Russia and the near collapse of Long Term Capital Management might want to think again.
Summer is about to start south of the Equator, and the Latin economies, which were not hurt as badly as many feared a year ago, are looking much livelier. 
 The stock markets are doing well, too. From the start of the year through Thursday, the 58 Latin American equity funds tracked by Lipper Inc. have posted an average total return of 30.9 percent.
Analysts are excited about the potential for further gains: Based on price-to-earnings ratios, Latin stocks are still very inexpensive compared with those of other parts of the world.
Carlos Asili, Latin American equity strategist for J. P. Morgan, took some time last week to discuss how the coming year is shaping up for Latin stocks. Following are excerpts from the conversation:
 
Q. Latin stocks have been very strong for the last couple of weeks. Why is that?
 
A. When the European and American bond markets began their strong rally, that was a big positive for Latin equity markets. Also, during the period this summer when the American stock market was correcting, there were net inflows into international equity funds. Some of that money went into Latin funds. Finally, there is a sense that the Latin economies have bottomed out and are in a recovery phase.
 
Q. Do you agree that the worst is over for these economies?
 
A. Our economists have forecast that growth will show a steady acceleration in Latin America through the end of next year, to an annualized year-over-year rate of 4.4 percent by the fourth quarter of 2000.
The drivers will be Chile and Mexico. Brazil will be a little weaker than those countries, with growth of about 2.5 percent in the first half of the year, accelerating to 3.5 percent in the second half. And Argentina should see its economy accelerate in the second half of the year.
 
Q. Latin stocks and economies are hostage to what happens in American and European bond markets. Do you fear a rise in interest rates in the developed world?
 
A. It is very likely we will see bond yields back up some, but we will not return to the levels we hit three weeks or a month ago.
And while fixed-income spreads between emerging-market bonds and Treasuries have narrowed, we think they could narrow further.
At the height of the crisis last year, rates on emerging-market bonds were as high as 17 percent above U.S. Treasuries, according to the J. P. Morgan emerging-markets bond index. Now, that spread is around 9.8 percent. Conservatively, we could get a further 2.5-percentage-point improvement in those bond spreads.
It depends on the country, but in Latin America a 1.5-percentage-point compression in those spreads could lead to an expansion in price-to-earnings ratios on stocks of 20 percent to 30 percent.
 
Q. Political instability is often another source of potential concern in emerging markets. Do you see potential problems in any of the major Latin countries?
 
A. No one can say that nothing bad will happen, but at this point the outlook looks positive.
I feel comfortable about political stability in Argentina, Chile and Mexico, which will hold presidential elections next summer. There is a lot of confidence in Mexico.
Of the four major investible countries, Brazil is the country where there is some risk. That is not because of impending elections, but because of the future of economic reform and liberalization.
 
Q. How do you see the rally continuing? And do you have a list of stocks that are trading as American Depository Receipts in this country that you like?
 
A. Recently, the stocks that have outperformed have been the telecommunications companies, which are by far the most liquid. Telmex, Telebras and Televisa have all moved up significantly. As the rally matures, we expect it to broaden out.
There are at least 10 stocks that are liquid, trade A.D.R.'s and have very good bottom-up fundamentals.
In Mexico, Coca-Cola Femsa, which has risen around 5 percent this week, still offers good value. Two conglomerates we like are Grupo Alfa and Carso. Cifra, a retailer, is another.
In Brazil, we like some of the retailing stocks. We just upgraded Pao de Azucar. We like Tele Norte Leste, a telecommunications company. And we like Brazilian steel stocks CST and CSN, which are selling at valuations that are among the most compelling in the world.
And in Chile, we like Endesa, an electricity company.

HEADLINE: Better Perks Resonate in Boom Times

BYLINE: By MICHELLE LEDER

 BODY:
HIS name may not be familiar to anyone but his own employees, but chances are you've heard about what Al Galdi has done: given new BMW's to any employee who has worked at his company for at least a year.
During the last six months, Mr. Galdi has handed out BMW keys to 34 of his 45 employees. The cars, which are leased, cost him about $9,000 a year each, including insurance. Needless to say, turnover at Arcnet, an architectural engineering firm in Holmdel, N.J., has been virtually nil since Mr. Galdi began offering the perk in June. Employees who leave have to give back the cars. 
 They also lose out on other goodies, like $100 gift certificates on their birthdays, health club memberships and a cash bonus equal to 25 percent of their annual salary on the fifth anniversary of their employment.
About once a month, Mr. Galdi says, he asks his employees if they would rather have cash. The answer is always no.
"They seem to really like the programs," he said, "because it helps with their quality of life."
You could probably count on one hand, and perhaps even one finger, the number of employers in the New York metro area who are handing out keys to BMW's. But with the economy booming and unemployment at record lows, many employers are trying to come up with new and interesting perquisites.
"It's not so much about rewarding, but retaining," said Michael A. Keane, managing consultant at Watson Worldwide, a consulting firm in Morristown, N.J. "When it comes to employees, it's basically a seller's market, and many companies are having to make extraordinary efforts."
A recent survey by the outplacement firm Lee Hecht Harrison found that the top two perks on employees' wish lists were health club memberships (58 percent) and flextime (57 percent). That's not what most employers are providing: A.T.M.'s on premises (25 percent) and travel services (15 percent), according to a survey of more than 1,000 employers conducted by Hewitt Associates, a compensation consulting firm.
"Employers need to ask themselves how they can make themselves different from everyone else," said Ray Baumruk, who helped conduct the study for Hewitt.
Perks vary widely from company to company and within particular industries. High-tech firms tend to have the most innovative offerings, like on-site massages, concierge services, even quiet rooms where workers can nap. Blue-chip companies, particularly those on suburban campuses, tend to focus more heavily on time-saving perks like on-site dry-cleaning and film drop-off.
For example, the 500 employees at Xerox's corporate headquarters at Stamford, Conn., are able to work out at an on-site fitness center, order meals from the company cafeteria for dinner and drop off dry-cleaning when they get to work in the morning; it's usually ready to be picked up the next day. On-site massage therapy -- a perk offered at other Xerox locations, but not in Stamford -- is in the works, said Christa Carone, a spokeswoman.
One difference from several years ago is that the perks are for a larger pool of workers. At Arcnet, even the receptionist qualified for a BMW. Last month, Ikea, the Swedish furniture retailer that has stores in Hicksville, N.Y., and Elizabeth, N.J., pledged cash bonuses amounting to a day's worth of sales, $80 million worldwide, to its employees, from the snack bar staff and stock clerks to the president. Each employee will end up with $2,435 when checks are distributed this month, said Marty Marston, a spokeswoman for Ikea North America. Retailing tends to be among the lowest-paying type of employment, so the one-time bonus could equal a month's pay for some.
But even companies that can't afford to provide a car or a day's sales have plenty of options. Many perks being offered today cost the employer virtually nothing, but still create plenty of good will. Men's Wearhouse, a large California retailer that operates about 20 stores in the New York metro area, has signed up 120 local employers, including Citibank and New York University, for its V.I.P. program, which gives a company's employees 10 percent off on Men's Wearhouse purchases.
Transitchek, a program that allows employees of enrolled companies to set aside up to $65 a month before taxes for public transportation commuting costs, also provides savings on corporate taxes. Each month 7,000 to 8,000 employers in the New York area participate in the program, said George Serventi, Transitchek director.
"A lot of these things are in the interest of the employers who are doing them," said Helen Darling, a consultant at Watson Worldwide's Stamford office.
Even costly perks often pay off in the end. Lipton Child Care Centers, a Washington company that operates backup child care centers in Manhattan, White Plains and Jersey City, says that employers still save money because parents don't need to miss work when their regular child care provider isn't available. The service has attracted employers like the National Hockey League, the National Basketball Association, Philip Morris, Pepsico and Texaco, as well as newer, smaller companies like Knight Securities of Jersey City.
Stephanie Bernstein, director of human resources for Knight, a Nasdaq market maker, said she and several other parents were able to sell Knight's chief executive on the idea of backup care, even though Knight, like many other brokerage firms, mostly employs single men.
"There were a couple of people here, myself included, who would get into a situation and be jammed," Ms. Bernstein said. Now, for an annual fee of $50, she and other Knight parents have access to the Lipton center in the lobby at Newport Center.
At Dialogic Corporation, a Parsippany technology company recently bought by Intel, the company's 1,000 employees have access to a corporate concierge, who is able to arrange things like dinner reservations, family vacations and oil changes for cars. Dialogic pays LesConcierges of San Francisco for the service, but employees have to pay for individual requests. Other Dialogic perks include an on-site fitness center, a free coffee and juice bar, and heavily discounted soda.
"This is all aimed at making it comfortable for people to be here longer than 40 hours a week," said Ken Cardinal, Dialogic's director of compensation and benefits. Though Mr. Cardinal said the company hadn't tried to figure out whether the concierge service and other perks were paying off for the company, he said that turnover had been lower than expected.
Still, at most companies, benefits are limited to items like health and life insurance and a retirement plan. Mr. Keane, the consultant at Watson Worldwide, estimated that only 15 to 20 percent of all companies offer what he described as nontraditional perks. That could grow if the economy continued to prosper.
"A lot of companies are being pretty cautious, because once you add it, it becomes hard to take it away," said Alan M. Johnson, managing director at Johnson Associates, a Wall Street compensation consulting firm.
Many consultants and even the companies that provide the perks wonder what will happen to the programs when the economy takes a turn for the worse. Employees who have grown used to the perks may be unwilling to give them up.
"We all know it's going to be difficult to take these things away," Mr. Cardinal said. Given the choice of layoffs or reducing perks, most employers would probably reduce the perks, consultants say.
But not Mr. Galdi. When business slowed down a few months ago, he said he had to lay off several employees. But he has no plans to stop handing out BMW's or cut back on any of the other benefits Arcnet employees receive.
"I'm in the service business," Mr. Galdi said, "and having employees that are happy and hard-working is good business for me."
 
Like a Front Desk at the Office
SO what exactly does a corporate concierge do? Just about anything, as long as it's legal.
"I never know what each day will bring," said Pam Wildrick, a corporate concierge at Dialogic Corporation, a technology company recently acquired by Intel Corporation. "People come in and they drop their problems on my desk."
In the year and a half since Ms. Wildrick began working at Dialogic's Parsippany headquarters, she's done everything from picking up gifts for spouses who have forgotten a birthday or anniversary to locating a clock that ticks backward to finding a guide to take an engineer through dense jungle in Costa Rica. In a typical month, she fields 230 to 250 requests from Dialogic's 1,000 employees.
Though Ms. Wildrick works in Parsippany, she's actually an employee of Les Concierges, a 13-year-old San Francisco company that provides concierge services to companies. (In the past, she had worked for several nonprofit groups in Morris County, including a stint as president of the Junior League and director of communications and special events for the Arts Council of the Morristown Area.)
Though the concierge concept is popular in California, particularly in the Silicon Valley, corporate concierges are still relatively new in the New York area.
"There's a lot of potential in the New York area," said Phil Wexler, Les Concierges' executive vice president. The company recently reached an agreement with Goldman Sachs to begin providing concierge services to its employees early next year.
Ken Cardinal, Dialogic's director of compensation and benefits, said the service was popular. One part of Ms. Wildrick's job involves arranging for oil changes and other routine maintenance on employees' personal cars while they are working, saving the employees valuable time on the weekends.
So is there anything Ms. Wildrick won't do?
Yes. She won't hire strippers, though she has been asked to.
Though that's not illegal, Ms. Wildrick said she just didn't feel comfortable arranging that kind of entertainment for Dialogic employees, even if it took place off-site.
"That one just crosses the line," Ms. Wildrick said. MICHELLE LEDER

 CORRECTION:
An article on Nov. 14 about corporate concierge services, which assist employees with personal chores, referred incorrectly to negotiations between one such service, called Les Concierges, and the investment firm of Goldman Sachs. The negotiations have not produced an agreement for services to Goldman Sachs employees next year.

CROSSING
 A Memoir.
 By Deirdre McCloskey.
 Illustrated. 266 pp. Chicago:
 The University of Chicago Press. $25. 
 When I received "Crossing," I wondered why the editors had not designated it for review by someone gay, or someone involved in the transgendered community. Reading it, I realized that I -- a lifelong heterosexual woman -- need this book. All of us need to consider the way our culture shapes gender expectations and makes unspoken but profoundly rigid gender assignments based on physical appearance, apparel, gait, gestures, voice and so on.
Early in the memoir, the former Donald McCloskey refers to being "read" by others: casual passers-by, shoppers in a department store, patrons in a bar, professional colleagues. Each of us is read daily, and we read others. When the author was still what he thought of as a male heterosexual cross-dresser lightheartedly exploring his hobby, the game was to cross-dress so successfully that he was read as female and thereby "passed." McCloskey concludes there are two patterns governing transsexuality: "Either you've always known you were of the wrong gender or you've constructed a psychological dam against the realization, which suddenly breaks, usually in mature adulthood." His dam burst in his sixth decade.
This is not a new story. When the British journalist and travel writer James Morris made his transition to Jan Morris in the 1970's, his account, "Conundrum," transformed gender crossing from a dubious enterprise to one of somewhat bizarre respectability. I was dimly aware that articles had appeared in Harper's Magazine, The Boston Globe, Worth magazine and The Chronicle of Higher Education about the decision by the renowned economist and historian Donald McCloskey at the age of 52 to undergo all the requisite procedures to become Deirdre McCloskey.
But it had not occurred to me that there was a brisk trade in pornographic magazines targeted at cross-dressers. I did not know that conventions of them assembled regularly in reputable hotels around the country, that chat rooms for cross-dressers provided means for this group to mingle electronically, despite geographic distances, and often to arrange to meet offline.
I did not know how difficult and how expensive it is to change sex, or that more than 25,000 Americans have done so. Just for starters, the cost of getting rid of a male beard by electrolysis is a minimum of $10,000. Sessions under local anesthesia can run as long as seven or eight hours at a stretch. Since only about 40 percent of the hairs treated are killed at each attempt, retreatments -- strippings" -- are necessary. Only an "active" follicle can be destroyed; there is no way to tell in advance the stage of growth of a treated follicle. At the second treatment, the percentage of regrowth is reduced to 36; the third leaves 21.7, and so it proceeds. McCloskey was still going back for retreatment after two years of womanhood. But before making the commitment to extirpating the beard, McCloskey scheduled removals of hair on the backs of the hands, then arms, then back, legs and stomach. The dedication required for this monumental task is mind-boggling.
After hair removal came a tummy tuck and breast augmentation. Then facial reconstruction: reduction of the eyebrow ridge by grinding down the bones; cheek and jaw surgery, an operation to reduce the nose, move the hairline forward, point the jaw, lift the eyebrows. The first voice operation was not successful, nor were subsequent ones. Retraining the existing voice proved a better solution. "Get a tape recorder," Deirdre was advised. "Place your voice forward. Speak in your head instead of your chest. Articulate more clearly. No harsh onsets."
"Crossing" details the often excruciating physical procedures undergone in making the transition, but the book's major focus is on the gradual emotional evolution the writer experienced traversing from man to woman. McCloskey was married, the father of two grown children, when he made the leap.
Sadly, his son, daughter and former wife turned away from this new person. His sister and one of her academic colleagues played a sinister role in trying to thwart him. They conspired to have him committed as mentally incompetent -- unfit to sign papers for optional surgical procedures. They devised a theory that he was manic and that his mania could be treated with psychopharmacology, much as in the 50's psychiatry thought that homosexuality could be overcome with electroshock. Twice during his determined journey into womanhood, they managed to have him incarcerated -- handcuffed, locked away where he could not harm himself, at first in the University of Iowa Hospital's mental ward and later in the University of Chicago Hospital -- to await evaluations by psychiatrists whose knowledge of his situation was less than rudimentary.
The shrinks he had the misfortune to encounter seemed still to be operating at a pre-60's level. At that time, the profession's "standards of care" required a two-year waiting period before a would-be transsexual could have surgery. The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is what transsexuals fear. In 1997 the American Psychological Association declared that it "opposes all portrayals of lesbian, gay and bisexual people as mentally ill," and the psychiatric association adopted that code in 1998. Gender crossers are still waiting for the gender identity "disorder" to be removed from the list of mental illnesses.
The family rift has not shown signs of closing. But Deirdre McCloskey's mother and brother have been bulwarks of support, and her sister is moving toward reconciliation. She has finally stopped calling her "Donald."
I admire the unflinching direct narrative the author employs: no self-pity; no denying the years he spent cross-dressing before the "epiphany," the coming to terms with the ultimate goal; no verbal reprisal against the wife or the sister, only a little directed at the psychiatrists; much praise of and gratitude to the Dutch academic community in Rotterdam, which unquestioningly took McCloskey in as a visiting professor.
The final surgery to remove the male genitalia and replace them with a neovagina took place in Australia in 1996: "Being able to say you are finished, complete, really a woman by the no-penis criterion is the most powerful rhetoric for acceptance of behavior. . . . In our medicalized culture the ceremony that seals the agreement is the operation." In McCloskey's case, the neovagina had to be fashioned from a portion of the small intestine and manually dilated every day, a chore that took about half an hour and was, at least initially, quite painful.
While McCloskey is silent on sexual gratification after the surgeries, she is refreshingly articulate on the female sex: "She had started to forget what it was like to be a man. . . . She forgot what it felt like to not understand relationships because you find them boring. Or to feel that you are by rights the local hero. Or to feel that people should serve you. Or most superficially and most fundamentally to think of men as 'we' and women as 'they.' "Transgendering has made her a feminist.
Far more important to her than the possibility of sexual intimacy in the future is being accepted as a woman among women. Being elected president of the Economic History Association, she says, "was glorious, affirming." After the final surgeries, including a second face lift, she is "read" less and less. Her career survives, seemingly undamaged.
The total cost of her transformation to date comes to about $90,000, far higher than average because she had so much cosmetic surgery and voice surgery, together with surgeries to repair those surgeries. Travel between Iowa and Dallas (electrolysis), San Francisco (cheek and jaw surgery), Philadelphia (voice operation) and Australia (genital replacement) in search of the best procedures also has to be factored in. A variety of wigs while she experimented with how to wear her own hair, the acquisition of an extensive wardrobe, do not come cheaply. Then there were legal fees as she untangled the web woven by her sister, and fees to the mental hospitals where she was held against her will. Despite having to overcome so many roadblocks and despite the outright failure of some of the cosmetic surgeries, Deirdre McCloskey is not bitter. Even rejection by her children is met with sorrow, not anger. This is a woman worth knowing. She has given us a highly readable, dramatic account of her crossing.

HEADLINE: Carrying Coals to Newcastle, or Seaweed to Long Island

BYLINE: By MARY CUMMINGS 

 BODY:
SEAWEED, seaweed everywhere, and not a bite to eat.
Well, not quite. Long Island waters are indeed rich in seaweed (though, happily, Long Island beaches are seldom piled high with it). And there is indeed seaweed you can eat: seaweed salads sold in local seafood shops, seaweed wraps wherever sushi is served, rockweed garnishes on restaurant entrees, pills and powders from the health-food store. 
 But the seaweed Long Islanders see on the beach is almost never the seaweed they eat. Nor is it the seaweed the spa at Gurney's Inn in Montauk uses for its signature seaweed wrap. And although gardeners recognize seaweed as a fine fertilizer, rich in minerals and trace elements, no enterprising horticultural entrepreneur has seen fit to harvest and market it locally.
In fact, a highly informal investigation recently uncovered just two instances of local seaweed harvested for local use. Make that three if you count the occasional gardener who finds it useful as mulch, four if an old-timer's tale of packing seaweed around the bottoms of barns to keep the cold out is historically valid.
More recently, a true, documented case of organized seaweed collection for commercial use occurred in 1979 when the International Health and Beauty Spa at Gurney's Inn first began offering its seaweed body mask and wrap using kelp harvested daily for the purpose at Montauk Point.
Today, "we get it from France," said the spa director, Suzanne Lieder. As the spa literature boasts, the source is Laboratoires Euroderm, which uses "the highest grade of pure fresh seaweed and marine plants, harvested meticulously under strict French government regulation from pollution-free ocean water off the coast of Brittany."
Mind you, no one is suggesting that local waters are impure or that the home-grown seaweed is inferior. It just takes too long to refine the Montauk harvest and make it usable, Ms. Lieder said. Evidently it didn't take long to discover that shortcuts wouldn't work. At least one patron complained back in 1979 that spending 20 minutes under heat lamps, snugly wrapped in a cocoon of seaweed that smelled vaguely of fish, left her anything but soothed and revitalized.
At the George Braun Oyster Company in Cutchogue, Ken Homan reported one other borderline case of commerce in local seaweed.
"We sell quite a lot to chefs in the Hamptons," said Mr. Homan, referring to rockweed, the seaweed of choice among local chefs who pride themselves on their presentation. Perhaps the most common seaweed found on local beaches, rockweed is that brown, leathery plant with the little air pockets that beg to be popped. Mr. Homan said he normally bought it at the Fulton Fish Market in New York. But occasionally, when some chef has an urgent need and there's no time for a city run, his father and 8-year-old son are commissioned to "run down and gather some."
The seaweed salads increasingly available at seafood shops come mainly from the West Coast, Mr. Homan said. California is also the source of most of the seaweed products used locally in Japanese restaurants, said Chef Toyo of Sen in Sag Harbor, who said he also imported some products from Japan. In the Northeast, Larch Hanson's Maine Seaweed Company has a mailing list of 100 seaweed enthusiasts and retailers scattered throughout the United States and Canada, whom he supplies with edible and fertilizer seaweeds harvested from offshore beds.
So what's wrong with Long Island seaweed, and why isn't anyone harvesting it?
George Kraemer, who is looking into the potential for seaweed cultivation on the East Coast at the State University at Purchase, says he doesn't think anything is wrong with it. He and three fellow scientists recently received financing from Long Island Sea Grant for a project they hope will demonstrate that local cultivation of nori (the red seaweed Porphyra, used primarily as the wrapping for sushi rolls) could not only give the region a piece of an industry with annual revenues of $1.8 billion but also promises to help clean local waters.
The idea, he said, is to grow the seaweed in conjunction with fish farms. Effluent from fish farms, Mr. Kraemer said, can have the same deleterious nutrient-loading effect on waters as municipal sewage, while increasing the likelihood of ecologically and economically damaging algal blooms. Previous experiments have shown that growing seaweed near fish production can remove excess nutrients from the fin fish effluent, he said, citing an example from Chile, where red seaweed was integrated into salmon mariculture and reduced the release of nitrogen and phosphorus by 56 and 94 percent, respectively.
If the project pans out, the future may see some very positive developments on the local seaweed front. For if nori, with its healthful nutritional content, can remove excess nutrients from the waste streams of fish farms before they foul local waters, everyone wins. Fish farmers stay on the right side of environmental law; the water is cleaner; the potential for algal bloom outbreaks is reduced, and a new, potentially profitable, aesthetically and ecologically correct industry is born. The day when sushi rolls come wrapped in native nori may not be far off.

To the Editor:
The hypocrisy of doctors who have applauded the decision by United Health Group to suspend preauthorization for testing and treatment decisions is breathtaking (front page, Nov. 9). 
 Why the nostalgia for the time, not long ago, of double-digit yearly health care inflation and unnecessary health care expenditures?
No study has found any evidence that managed care review resulted in systematic undertreatment or statistically significant adverse outcomes. In fact, review had scarcely begun to take effect when an unholy alliance of doctors and misled consumers began to create the current atmosphere of hysteria.
A look back to a time when doctors' decisions were not subject to review does not inspire confidence in our ability to make health care affordable or available.

To the Editor:
Alice M. Rivlin (Op-Ed, Nov. 12) says that "a tax cut would hurt prospects for economic growth by encouraging more consumer spending and forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates and avoid inflation." 
 Curtailing consumer spending can't bring us anything but trouble. Doesn't the Federal Reserve implicitly recognize the catastrophic dangers of deflation as it walks the tightrope of controlled growth?
The larger our economy grows, the more room there will be for Social Security benefits. We can handle this without a misguided and puritanical effort to eliminate the federal debt.

HEADLINE: Granddaddy of Computer Trade Shows Is Remaking Its Global Gigs

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN 

 BODY:
Comdex, the Las Vegas exhibition that is the king of computer trade shows and the jewel in the crown of its sponsor, ZD Events, opens today for the 20th consecutive year.
In those two decades, Comdex has grown from a humble gathering of technology fans into the flagship in an international armada of trade shows. Even now, ZD Events is erecting booths in Israel for the opening of the first Comdex/Israel 99 show on Nov. 30 and mapping logistics for the third Expo CommChina South, which opens the same week in Guangzhou. A week later, it's the fourth annual Comdex India show in New Delhi. 
 The sun, it seems, never sets on the ZD Events empire. Virtually every week, somewhere in the world, the company is setting up or tearing down a computer trade show. Today, ZD Events produces 100 shows, including 22 Comdexes, in 25 countries, and this year it is adding a show in Greece as well as in Israel. Next on its list of target markets are Sweden, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Turkey.
Comdex in Las Vegas is the undisputed top dog, the world's largest computer trade show. ZD Events says it expects the event, which attracted 4,000 computer enthusiasts and dealers in 1979, to draw roughly 202,000 people this year. They will trek through a million square feet of exhibition space in search of the next trend in computing technology. While that turnout would mark a decline from the show's peak of 215,000 in 1996, Comdex remains a cash cow for ZD Events and the biggest brand in the computer trade show business.
But a huge transition is under way for Comdex.
The glory days of the one-size-fits-all computer show are past, replaced by smaller, more focused gatherings -- an enormous and still-growing crop of executive seminars and single-subject conferences. As the high technology industry enters the post-PC era in which the Internet is king, it is hardly surprising that a decidedly PC-centric trade show would face substantial change.
"Where people get their information is changing," said Alan Meckler, who founded the popular series of Internet World shows before selling to Penton Media Inc. last year. "The problem that Comdex has is that the PC is finished as an innovator."
And with the Internet supplying customers with up-to-the-minute product information and industry news, they no longer must attend conventions to stay up to date. Even at Internet World's New York show, which soared to 70,000 attendees in only a few years, attendance is flat, Mr. Meckler said, adding, "Niche shows are the rage now."
ZD Events is already beginning to reinvent the show, even dubbing it "dotComdex" in its recent marketing campaign.
"It's part of our branding campaign to try to put Comdex at the epicenter of all decisions about technology relating to the Internet economy," said Peter Shaw, executive vice president of ZD Events, which is part of Ziff-Davis Inc., the leading publisher of computer magazines.
Thanks to its magazine publishing roots, ZD Events can offer technology companies something its competitors are hard pressed to match: packaged deals that include both a trade-show presence and advertising in some of the largest computer magazines in the business, said Mandana Hormoiza, an analyst at Lazard Freres & Company in New York.
At the same time, ZD Events is building a research and development unit called ZD Studios, charged with creating new, typically highly focused events for corporate clients like Sun Microsystems, for which it produces the JavaOne show.
Still, the company is not about to abandon its general shows just yet.
"We see there's a trend toward vertical industry events," Mr. Shaw said. "But if you look around the globe, every country with an information technology industry, except for the U.K., looks to have a center of gravity with a Comdex show that covers a broad spectrum."
The Comdex brand has undergone transitions before.
In 1995, the Interface Group, the company that founded the show, sold its trade show division to Softbank, the Japanese conglomerate, for $800 million. Within a year, Softbank also bought a majority stake in Ziff-Davis, eventually merging the two operations. Today, Softbank owns 70 percent of Ziff-Davis, which operates ZD Events as one of five units. Ziff-Davis stock, which went public in May 1998, has fluctuated widely in price in the last year -- from just above $8 a year ago to a high of $29 last March and a closing price of $17.1875 last Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.
Another Ziff-Davis unit, ZDNet, tracks its stock separately.
In July, after Softbank announced that it would focus on Internet-only companies, Ziff-Davis said that it had hired investment bankers to help it sell off its business units. Softbank has already sold off Ziff-Davis's market research business to Harte-Hanks for $101 million in cash.
Mr. Shaw said several potential suitors had expressed interest in buying all or parts of Ziff-Davis, though he declined to name them.
Though Ziff-Davis has been steadily losing money the last few years, its losses have narrowed recently. For the third quarter, the company lost $14.9, compared with a loss of $27.6 million for the quarter last year. Revenue rose 10 percent, to $232 million.
The company's trade show division accounted for much of the improvement; 23 percent of Ziff-Davis's revenue came from ZD Events. Besides Comdex, ZD Events' other big brands include Network+Interop, which is geared to network managers, and Seybold Seminars, a series of shows related to desktop publishing. But the division's future growth, say both analysts and Ziff-Davis officials, lies in ZD Studios.
Despite uncertainty over its ownership, ZD Events continues to open new shows abroad, typically with local business partners familiar with the trade show landscape. In India, for example, the show organizer is Business India Expositions, an 11-year-old event management company. Without a local partner to arrange the show, ZD Events officials say, the risk of making a cultural gaffe or other business mistake is too high. In South America, for example, ZD Events has learned there is no point in presenting a keynote address in the morning because no one will show up until noon.
"We think globally, but we try to act locally," said Jason Chudnofsky, chief executive of ZD Events.
For local attendees, the draw is the big-name speakers from Silicon Valley that the Comdex brand is able to attract. The benefit for ZD Events is that its foreign shows tend to feed its United States operations. As foreign companies learn the advantages of trade show marketing, Mr. Chudnofsky said, they start making the trek to the United States. For American technology companies, consultants and analysts who attend ZD Events' overseas shows, the international circuit can be costly and exhausting, but many say it is worth the effort.
"I send people to nearly all these events," said Howard Anderson, founder of the Yankee Group market research firm and most recently a venture capitalist. "It seems like it's one long, endless caravan."
A caravan that starts and ends in Las Vegas.

HEADLINE: Two Cities, Two Leaps of Faith;
Columbus Pins Its Dreams on a Jazzy New Science Center

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio, Nov. 11

 BODY:
"Is this, like, Gilligan's Island's lost temple or something?" the teenager asked.
The short answer was yes. In front of him, and a dozen of his classmates from a southern Ohio high school, was a junglelike environment with a maze of pathways and bridges connecting temples and caverns, jazzed up with laser effects and populated by gargoylish icons, each representing a quality -- like inspiration or perseverance -- that is an element of problem solving. By listening to the figures' instructions and those of actors serving as guides, visitors are coaxed to collect the elements of a code, a la Indiana Jones, that will gain them entrance to a "secret" tomb. 
 The exhibit, called "Adventure," is one of the seven "learning worlds" that are the heart of the new Center of Science and Industry here. The $125 million museumesque attraction is actually the reincarnation of a 35-year-old institution that was in a historic building downtown.
The new structure, which opened on Nov. 6 and is known as COSI Columbus, is just west of downtown, on 17 acres nestled in a bend in the Sciota River. It is intended to revitalize the city's riverfront and bolster its regional and national profile, with its grafting of art and entertainment onto the enterprise of kindling a love of science and learning in, to use the apt cliche, children of all ages.
"You'll notice they don't use the word 'museum' in the name; that's an important point," said Kathleen M. Fox, executive director of the Ohio Arts and Sports Facilities Commission, the administrator of the state grants to the new center. Part theme park, part theater, part interactive laboratory, and created with an installation artist's sense of provocation, the center hopes to draw 900,000 or more people annually.
The building, by the Japanese architect Arata Isozaki, makes use of the riverfront facade of a former high school, onto which the architect has fitted a 960-foot-long curved concrete facade that resembles nothing so much as an overturned canoe. Inside, length is the defining feature. The exhibits are in spaces that branch off from wide hallways running uninterrupted on three floors.
There is some conventionality to the exhibits. One learning world, "Gadgets," is devoted to, well, gadgets, and allows visitors to do the kinds of fooling around with gears and magnets that is the foundation of the Exploratorium in San Francisco and other science centers. But the center largely has the feel of something new; the main teaching tool is the immersion of the visitor in a world of artifice.
"What we do and how we do it are distinguished by strongly themed environments," said Kathryn D. Sullivan, a former astronaut who is the center's president and chief executive officer. "That's rather different from most places."
Most science museums, anyway. But the learning worlds borrow heavily from Disneyland and other theme parks. In "Oceans," for example, visitors enter through the hull of a simulated shipwreck (wittily christened "Indomitable") and engage with exhibits illustrating the properties of water in the environment of an undersea cave watched over by a mammoth statue of Poseidon.
In "Progress" visitors walk Hope Street and Fear Street (change occurs at the intersection -- get it?) in Progress, Ohio, circa 1898, then pass through a darkened hall and emerge on the same set of streets in 1962.
And in "Life," which deals with birth, aging and death (a sign at the door warns that the exhibit contains potentially disturbing subject matter), there are human fetuses in stages from one to seven months, videotaped interviews with men and women who know they are dying and forthright exhibits on breast and testicular cancer, as well as more lighthearted fare like an actual meal decomposing under glass and an organ that plays, instead of music, the sounds of bodily functions.
"Life" is clearly aimed at older visitors , and on one day last week it was free of the crowds and cacophony in the other learning worlds. It will also include, when it is complete, an exhibit that could easily go in a gallery or a modern art museum, one that raises resonant philosophical and emotional issues: a reconstruction of an actual auto accident that killed three of the five occupants of a car. The crumpled car is already on display, complete with debris from the road. Added to it will be videotaped interviews with relatives of the dead and, most provocatively, computer-generated comparisons of what would have happened had the driver engaged the brakes an instant sooner or an instant later.
Aside from the whiz-bang effects throughout, "Life" is the new center's most concerted effort to stretch its visitor profile.
"Since I came here three years ago, I've heard three sets of comments over and over about the old COSI," Ms. Sullivan said. "One is, 'I went there all the time when I was a kid.' Two, 'My kids used to love it.' The third is, 'I take my grandkids there all the time.' I want to add one more: 'I go there when . . . .' "
Throughout the center, designers have largely avoided the convention of informational plaques, preferring to engage rather than to explain. In one part of "Oceans," for example, visitors can control the shape and flow of an air vortex within a tube of water, but nowhere is there an explanation of the suction principal that makes it work.
"The biggest hurdle is getting people over their expectation of a museum as a place of didactic, fact-based learning," said Joseph D. Wisne, the center's vice president for design and production, who oversaw 25 exhibit designers. Instilling wonder is the goal, he said, though each exhibit was designed with a "learning outcome" in mind.
Surveys indicate that people are leaving the place fully persuaded they have learned something. Mr. Wisne added, however, that tinkering is still possible based on visitor reactions in the opening weeks. Staff members wander through the exhibits with the express purpose of answering questions.
"What we don't want is people feeling compelled to spend their time in here reading," he said. "But if they need help, they'll tell us."
The new center is a mammoth project for this expanding state capital of 700,000, known as a test-market city and the home of the Limited, Nationwide Insurance and the Wendy's hamburger chain. Columbus is often overshadowed by the state's other population centers, and the center is clearly intended as a foundation for growth, the centerpiece of $2 billion in planned economic development. It was built with the substantial cooperation of the state government, which provided $55 million, the city government ($25 million) and corporate and individual support ($46 million). It opened debt-free, without granting any corporate sponsors labeling rights to the individual exhibits or product placement within them.
"We made it very clear that learning was the motivation for COSI," Ms. Sullivan said. "It is not a marketing opportunity. We expected our funders" -- whose support is noted on plaques outside the individual exhibits -- "to say, 'We are proud to help COSI present these environments.' "
All of this testifies to the confidence that the community has had over the years in the science center, which has a history of producing popular traveling exhibitions on subjects like the science of sports and space travel. Its "Kidspace" exhibition has been replicated in dozens of museums around the world. The city, home of Ohio State University and the high-tech research company Battelle, has long seen itself as science-friendly. And, of course, John Glenn is the quintessential Ohioan. For all these reasons, the project was deemed appropriate as a identity-making emblem, a launching pad for the city's reputation in the next century.
"Ohio is really a collection of city-states, each with its own identity," Ms. Fox, the state commission director, said. "You're a Clevelander or a Cincinnatian or a Toledoan first. Columbus is a city with much less history than those other places. It wasn't built on transportation or industry; it was chosen as the capital, largely for its central location, and developed as a center for government. But with Ohio State and the science-based companies that have grown up here, an institution that will teach young people the elements of science and technology makes sense."
The hope is that the center will elevate the status of Columbus as a destination city, at least within the Midwest, if not nationally. The old COSI drew a substantial percentage of its visitors from out of state; now the prospects are greater.
"The city gets many Japanese visitors because of the Honda assembly plant in Marysville, and we get a lot of Middle Eastern visitors because of O.S.U.," said Paula Spence, chairwoman of the COSI fund-raising board. "The mere fact that this building is here will attract attention in Europe and the Middle and Far East."
Eventually, Ms. Spence said hopefully, "when you say Columbus, you'll no longer have to put 'comma, Ohio,' after it."
In the meantime, the center has to succeed on its own.
"Do I know if we've placed all the right bets? No," Ms. Sullivan said, adding, in not very scientific language, the center's continuing task: "We've got to concentrate on how people are feeling about it. How do we make it sing?"

HEADLINE: A Microsoft Remedy: Antitrust Experts Offer Prescriptions

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14

 BODY:
Groups of experts from a score of universities nationwide are preparing recommendations for the government as the Justice Department and 19 states prepare for the penalty phase of the Microsoft antitrust trial early next year.
If Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson finds Microsoft guilty of antitrust violations -- as his exhaustive findings of fact published nine days ago indicate he will -- a new proceeding will determine what should be done to be sure Microsoft can no longer illegally wield monopoly power. 
 A committee led by Timothy Bresnahan, a Stanford University economist, is preparing recommendations for the Justice Department, and a professor familiar with the panel's work said that it was likely to call for changes that would restructure Microsoft or its products in some way.
Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert and law professor at the University of Iowa, is among the academics and consultants working for the states. In an interview last week, he said, "If the findings show significant abuse of monopoly power, then the appropriate remedy is to break up the monopoly -- not to hobble the company or try to regulate it."
For his part, William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, said he would like to settle the case and would be willing to consider any settlement proposal that protects the company's ability to add any features it wants to the Windows operating system.
In an interview in the issue of Time magazine that reaches newsstands today, Mr. Gates was asked whether he might accept one oft-suggested remedy -- ordering Microsoft to publish the source code for Windows so competitors could create operating systems that are compatible with the vast library of software written for Windows. Mr. Gates said:
"The only thing that we know for sure would be bad for consumers is anything that blocked us from being able to innovate Windows, or anything that made it so that when people buy Windows they don't know what is in it. Beyond that we'll be as pragmatic as we can."
Late last week, The New York Times interviewed five other academic authorities or former government officials who maintain a direct professional interest in the case but are not attached to either Microsoft or the government. All have followed the case closely and have studied the judge's findings of fact.
Each was asked what remedy he would choose, if he had the power to impose a solution. Three called for structural remedies. Two said they believed that remedies keeping Microsoft intact but forcing the company to modify its behavior would be sufficient.
But all agreed on one point: Any remedy should be "self-executing," as several of them put it. In other words, once imposed it should not require further oversight or interference from the courts or the government. On that point, at least, the Justice Department, the state attorneys general and, most likely, Judge Jackson agree.
 
Nicholas Economides
Professor of economics
New York University
Mr. Economides teaches economics, including antitrust issues and computer networking. He has written academic papers on the case, but said, "I am not now and have never been involved in any litigation involving Microsoft."
Mr. Economides would institute remedies that correct the specific allegations raised in the government's case but would have little effect on future behavior because, he said, "one has to be very careful to be sure that the remedy is not worse than the present situation."
He described himself as an admirer of Microsoft, adding, "I don't see how consumers were hurt when they were given a browser free, and Microsoft has not raised the price of its operating system." A key conclusion in the judge's findings is that Microsoft's decision to tie its Internet browser to the Windows operating system was an anticompetitive act.
Mr. Economides would force Microsoft to rewrite its contracts with many or all of its partners, customers and suppliers, "to be sure that the violations in the suit" -- like Microsoft's restrictive contracts with online service providers -- "will not happen again." Of the concern that Microsoft might find a way to evade contract restrictions, Mr. Economides said, "I have confidence that smart lawyers will be able to work it out."
He also said he would require Microsoft to publish many of the software codes known as application programming interfaces that allow other software companies to "hook their programs to Windows." Netscape and other companies have accused Microsoft of withholding those as penalty for failing to comply with requests from Microsoft. But he would force Microsoft to publish the codes only for Netscape and the other companies that were part of the lawsuit.
Other companies facing similar problems in the future would have to make their own cases in court, he said. If stronger remedies were imposed, Mr. Economides averred, "consumers would lose."
 
William J. Baer
Former director
Bureau of Compliance
Federal Trade Commission
The trade commission shares antitrust enforcement with the Justice Department, and Mr. Baer ran the agency's enforcement office until last month. He supervised the commission's antitrust investigation of Intel, which ended with a settlement last March. But Mr. Baer was not working for the agency when it last investigated Microsoft, in the early 1990's.
While Mr. Baer said he had not steeped himself in the merits of the specific remedies under discussion, he was clear on the principles he would work to uphold.
"If you start with a monopoly company that has unlawfully limited competition," he said, "the goal of any remedy has to be more than telling them, 'Go out and sin no more.' That approach would allow the monopolist to maintain the benefits it has gained from illegal use of its monopoly power.
"What you want to do is move the market back in the direction it would have gone but for the unlawful conduct. So the remedy has to be something structural."
While Mr. Baer was not willing to suggest a specific solution, he did say: "It would be something like licensing their source code, spinning off part of the company. Whatever it is, it should be self-executing.
"But my key point is this: What kind of lesson does a monopolist take if he is told, 'Please don't do this any more,' and is allowed to keep all of his ill-gotten gains? If the judge found that Microsoft obtained its position illegally, then Microsoft should have to pay for it.
"A structural remedy also sends a signal to any possible future monopolists that they don't want to go down this road."
 
Robert Litan
Director of economic studies
Brookings Institution
While deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's antitrust division, Mr. Litan negotiated the consent decree with Microsoft that resulted from the department's previous antitrust investigation of the company in 1995. The present case began when the Justice Department charged that Microsoft had violated that 1995 agreement.
Mr. Litan said he now believes another conduct remedy of the sort agreed to in 1995 "just invites more lawyering."
"Microsoft lawyers would immediately go to work going around it," he said. "It's like a dam. Leaks would spring, and you'd constantly be trying to stop them.
"So my proposal," he added, "would start with breaking the company in two -- one operating system company and another with everything else. But if you stop there, it'll be fraught with all kinds of problems. You'd have to continually be supervising the operating system company" to make sure it did not pursue other anticompetitive practices.
"So therefore I'm attracted to the idea of breaking the operating system company into three equal companies -- all with identical properties and activities. And then you let these three operating system companies loose to compete."
William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, would choose which company he would lead -- one of the three operating-system companies, or the fourth one holding all of Microsoft's other products and services.
But the company's other senior leaders could not go with Mr. Gates. They would have to be spread themselves among the other new companies. And the $18 billion in cash reserves Microsoft holds would be divided among the four new companies, too.
Critics of this idea, or variations of it, say they worry that consumers would soon be faced with incompatible operating systems. Mr. Litan said that would not occur in the short term because the companies would start with the same operating system code.
And if, as expected, the systems eventually diverged, other companies would spring up to write what he called "bridging programs" that would let software for one operating system work with the others.
"With these companies competing with each other, you'd get more innovation, and that's the goal," he said. "It may be that the trade for that" is the risk of incompatibility.
In the end, Mr. Litan concluded, "the operating system market will probably collapse over time."
"There may be just one left, one winner," he said. "But whoever won would be severely chastened by this case."
 
Robert E. Hall
Economist
Stanford University
Mr. Hall comments on and writes about the case but said, "I enjoy the position of being neutral."
Of his proposed remedy, he said, "I can't claim that it will solve every problem. But the real issue is being sure that the remedy does more good than harm. So I think it needs to be conservative and clean."
Mr. Hall said he "admired the quality of the economic arguments in the judge's findings." And one good way to address them, he added, would be to prohibit Microsoft from "conditioning the sale of Windows licenses to computer manufacturers on anything other than the manufacturers' ability to pay for the license and to respect Microsoft's intellectual property."
Evidence presented during the trial showed that Microsoft threatened to withhold Windows from I.B.M. and Compaq Computer when those two companies engaged in other actions Microsoft did not like.
"A remarkably large number of problems shown in the suit would be resolved with this," he said.
Mr. Hall said he would also force Microsoft to revise its contracts to prevent predatory or exclusionary dealings. That would ensure that Microsoft did not condition its dealings with other companies on their willingness to support other Microsoft products or ventures, he said.
Mr. Hall acknowledged that his proposed remedies were "modest." But, he added, "I think this whole system is gong to work -- and work without strangling Microsoft."
 
Steven Salop
Professor of economics and law
Georgetown University
Mr. Salop has worked as a consultant for many computer and software companies, including some of Microsoft's competitors. He has also written about the case. And to him, "the record is sufficiently strong to support a strong structural remedy."
He added that a conduct remedy -- forcing the company to rewrite contracts or modify its behavior -- "is too intrusive and regulatory."
"It's not in the interests of the economy, or of Microsoft," he said. "What they want is to get this behind them once and for all so they get on with what they say they want to do, and that is innovate."
So Mr. Salop advocated "a hybrid remedy" -- exactly the same proposal Mr. Litan offered for dividing the company into four parts.He rejected the idea long favored by the states of forcing Microsoft to auction the source code for Windows so that other companies could use it to develop competing operating systems.
"The source code is not well documented," he said. "It's not like the recipe for the new Coke; there are 30 million lines of code. You need access to information from Microsoft employees. So these new companies would start with a real technological disadvantage. Microsoft would leave them in the dust."
The beauty of his idea, he said, is that it is one-time and clean. "And we'd have competition in the operating system market."

HEADLINE: In Kansas City, Few Trains, but New Life in the Station

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN 

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., Nov. 14

 BODY:
It required new laws in two states, sales-tax elections in five counties and an act of Congress, as well as a major corporate giving campaign, but Kansas City's monumental Union Station has finally been restored to the grandeur it once enjoyed as a centerpiece of the nation's passenger rail network.
Even as construction crews raced to finish the $250 million restoration and expansion of the station, the completed portions opened to the public last week after a spate of events toasting large donors and volunteers. 
 Very few passenger trains pass through Kansas City now, so the station's restored Grand Hall, with its 95-foot ceiling and three 3,000-pound chandeliers, is to serve as a public space, surrounded by new restaurants, shops and offices. The station, second in size in this country only to Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan, is envisioned as a vast indoor plaza, a gathering place intended to help draw people back to the center of the city.
The station opened in 1914 with nearly one million square feet of space. It has been expanded in this new incarnation with a 300,000-square-foot wing on the west side to house Science City, described by its creators as a place of "recreational learning." Science City is projected to draw a million paying visitors a year.
"We are creating an educational attraction for all ages," said David A. Ucko, president of Science City and the Kansas City Museum, which will manage it. "There will be a high degree of emotional engagement, and everything will be contextual, nothing abstract. There will be a lot of humor. This won't be a deadly serious place."
Those who planned, argued and campaigned for years to put together the complicated financing package for Union Station are so pleased with the results that even before the reopening they were talking of returning to the voters and asking them to extend the culture sales tax, which made the restoration possible. The idea would be to use the tax to finance a wider array of cultural offerings. Supporters said the rebirth of the station, whose architectural features are similar to those of Grand Central and Union Station in Washington, has brought a new sense of metropolitan spirit on both sides of the Missouri-Kansas line, a border across which some of the vilest actions of the Civil War occurred.
Civic leaders are daring to dream of what else might be financed by extending the eighth-of-a-cent culture tax beyond 2002, when the station restoration will be paid off. Possibilities include creation of a publicly financed arts endowment, which could benefit museums like the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, performance groups like the Lyric Opera and the Kansas City Symphony, and smaller organizations.
Other noncultural possibilities include updating the stadiums in which the football Chiefs and baseball Royals play and improving the very limited public transportation system, which serves one of the most sprawled metropolitan areas in the country.
The new Arts Council of Metropolitan Kansas City was formed partly to look at how a culture tax or other public money might be sought for the arts.
"Kansas City is in the top quartile of cities for private funding of the arts," said Jan Kreamer, president of the Greater Kansas City Community Foundation and an organizer of the arts council. "But we are near the bottom in public funding."
Two regional neighbors, Denver and St. Louis, have adopted taxes for cultural purposes, she said. But she added that no specific proposals would be formulated here until public surveys on the issue are completed. Joan Israelite, president of the Arts Council, said its creation was part of a great expansion of arts and cultural activity. "We're on the verge of a cultural renaissance," she said.
The financing of the area's cultural and other needs has grown increasingly complicated as development has spread into the five counties in Kansas and Missouri that make up the metropolitan region, and into a second tier of surrounding counties in both states as well. More than 100 municipal and other governmental entities are involved, and the principal city, Kansas City, Mo., has become a smaller piece of the whole even though its population is growing slightly.
Unlike most other metropolitan areas that reach across state lines, this region's population of 1.7 million is fairly evenly divided between the two states, as are business and industry, and people here seem to view the state line as the de facto heart of the city. Booming Johnson County, Kan., with 20-some suburban cities, rivals Kansas City proper in size and economic clout. Kansas City, Kan., much smaller and poorer than Kansas City, Mo., or Johnson County, maintains a strong industrial base.
A century and a half ago civic leaders of the two Kansas Cities laid out their principal arteries within walking distance of the other state; Union Station was built just blocks east of the state line.
"The fact is that we function as an economic city-state," said Jack Holland, an investment banker who began working on the bistate financing concept 15 years ago.
He was part of a group called Kansas City Consensus, which formed in the early 1980's to look at how Kansas City could continue to pay for cultural and recreational offerings while much of the core city's economic power was being lost to the suburbs. From that group the idea of the bistate tax emerged in 1985.
The group recommended a sales tax instead of a property tax because a sales tax could be applied uniformly throughout the metropolitan area. By contrast, assessed valuation for a similar piece of property might vary from county to county and state to state.
Supporters of the bistate tax said they found many examples around the country of culture taxes and of metropolitan area taxes that crossed county lines, but no examples of a tax that crossed a state line.
After passage of the enabling legislation in Kansas and Missouri in 1993, representatives from each state decided what projects to propose to voters. Although arts and other culture groups had been the driving force behind passage of the legislation, they had trouble agreeing on a package of programs and institutions to support.
In the end everybody could agree only on raising money to restore Union Station. Its beauty, even in its abandoned and unmaintained state, and the emotional attachment felt by people across the area made the station "the perfect candidate for election," said Jack Craft, a lawyer who led the culture-tax campaign in Missouri. "It's handsome, and it doesn't talk."
Next, advocates of the tax had to deal with the almost legendary distrust that Kansans have of the politicians in Kansas City, Mo. "So a lot of safeguards were built into the Union Station operating agreement,"said Steve Rose, a suburban newspaper publisher who ran the culture-tax campaign in Kansas.
A separate legal entity was created to own and operate the station, and an agreement was drawn up that, if the restoration project should fail at some point, ownership of Union Station would pass not to the city of Kansas City, Mo., but to the community foundation headed by Ms. Kreamer. Still nervous about the outcome of the voting, the advocates of the tax mounted what Mr. Craft said was the most expensive political campaign ever conducted in the Kansas City region, costing slightly more than $1 million. Some advertising and public relations concerns donated services.
On Nov. 5, 1996, the culture tax went before the voters in the five counties. It passed with more than 60 percent of the vote in four, losing only in Wyandotte County, site of Kansas City, Kan., the poorest county in the metropolitan area.
The tax is raising $118 million of the cost of restoring and expanding the station. An additional $100 million was raised from private contributors; the rest is coming from federal money.
Forty million dollars of the estimated $250 million price tag was set aside as an endowment whose income will pay part of the operating costs for Science City and Union Station. The rest of the $18 million operating budget is to come from paying visitors to Science City and from leasing the office and commercial space.

HEADLINE: Net Investors Wary About Trade Talks With China

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Nov. 14

 BODY:
As the United States and China continued marathon negotiations today on China's possible entry into the World Trade Organization, nobody watched the to-and-fro more anxiously than entrepreneurs and investors in the Internet.
China's Internet industry has been in a state of suspension since September, when the nation's top communications official suddenly reaffirmed a longstanding ban on foreign investment in Chinese Internet service providers. While any trade agreement was not expected to deal specifically with the Internet, analysts said it could clarify Beijing's stance toward its bubbling online industry. 
 For restless cyberspeculators, such clarity could not come soon enough. Intel, Yahoo and other American companies rushed into partnerships with Chinese Internet providers before Beijing's warning. But new deals are being held up as investors try to guess the intentions of the Chinese official, Wu Jichuan, the minister of information industries.
"It has cast a big shadow over the industry," said Duncan Clark, a partner at BDA China, an Internet consulting firm in Beijing. "People think of it as unfinished business."
Mr. Wu said he would issue new rules on foreign investment by the end of the year. A trade agreement could have a decisive influence on those regulations because it is expected to open China's telecommunications sector to outsiders. Mr. Wu has cited the existing ban on foreign ownership of telecommunications providers as the justification for keeping foreigners out of the Internet.
"I find it very hard to believe there could be a W.T.O. deal at the same time China is imposing a complete ban on foreign investment in the Internet," said Gordon G. Chang, a partner who advises Internet companies in the Beijing office of the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.
Part of the problem in predicting China's Internet policy is that it crosses industry boundaries and intrudes into politically sensitive areas. Internet service providers, which connect users with state-run gateways to the global Internet, could be opened up as part of an agreement to open state telephone companies.
But Internet content providers could face stricter regulations, like those put on the film and publishing industries. Beijing continues to block a handful of foreign Web sites, and the authorities have begun warning Chinese Internet providers not to provide links to news services on foreign Web sites.
Some analysts say China could strangle the industry in its crib if it does not allow in foreigners. Although the number of online users in China almost doubles every year -- it is projected to grow from 2.4 million in 1998 to 16 million in 2003 -- China needs software technology from the United States to develop more sophisticated businesses in areas like electronic commerce.
"Even a momentary dip in enthusiasm in China will put it behind," Mr. Clark said. "It's like a hothouse flower: if you break the window and let in the cold air, you will kill it."
Left unsaid is that China's Internet entrepreneurs could miss out on a rich payday. China.com, a Hong Kong-based Internet provider for the mainland market, raised $84 million in a recent stock offering on the Nasdaq exchange that valued the company at $1.5 billion. Mainland Web companies with names like Sina.com and Sohu.com had hoped to reap similar riches from the market.
Publicly, the entrepreneurs are keeping up a confident front. They say they are plowing ahead with plans to raise capital and find foreign partners. They say Mr. Wu's recent dictum was part of a power struggle between conservatives and liberals in the Communist Party. And they say the government will come to accept the futility of trying to control a medium as anarchic as the Internet.
"The attitude of most investors is, 'We're going to ignore this. Eventually Beijing will lighten up,' " said Hanson Cheah, the executive director of Asia Tech Ventures, a venture capital firm here that specializes in Internet companies. But he added, "If we're wrong, we're dead."
Such caveats may be wise, given China's tense political climate and Beijing's mounting suspicion that the Internet can be used as a tool for subversion. Despite a sweeping crackdown on a spiritual movement known as Falun Gong, the government has been unable to prevent its members from using the Internet to spread news throughout China. The Chinese authorities recently arrested a student in northeastern China after he posted information about Falun Gong on the Internet.
Beijing's ambivalence toward the Internet may benefit Taiwan and Hong Kong, which are far more hospitable to foreign investors and share a common language with their mainland neighbor. America Online recently announced a partnership with China.com to introduce an America Online service in Hong Kong. The company hopes to break into the mainland, but for now, it regards Hong Kong as a reasonable staging ground.
Not all Chinese Internet entrepreneurs think open markets are an unqualified benefit. Edward Zeng, the founder of Sparkice I-Com Ltd., a three-year-old e-commerce venture in Beijing, said that letting in foreign companies without any restrictions could squash some nascent local companies.
"AOL has the money, the technology and the global consumer base," Mr. Zeng said. "If they want to set up an AOL China, nobody could compete with them."
The more likely possibility, he acknowledged, is that America Online would choose a Chinese partner to set up such a service. Mr. Zeng's own company is building an e-commerce business to sell Chinese products to consumers overseas. And he is scouting for foreign partners, a process that he says has been slowed down by the worries about China's Internet policy.
So like the political bosses in Beijing, Mr. Zeng is torn. He believes that China's Internet industry would grow faster if it were open to foreigners. But he worries about small local companies like his. In addition to his global venture, Mr. Zeng runs a string of Internet cafes and is starting a domestic e-commerce business. He plainly does not relish the prospect of competing against Amazon.com or Ebay.
Mr. Zeng, who spoke to Mr. Wu at a conference in Shanghai in October, said the minister's statements about the Internet had been misunderstood. Mr. Zeng said he believed the government's goal was not to seal off China's Internet business, but to set the stage for controlled development.

Under Wall St. Pressure, Bottler to Field Questions
In a highly unusual move, Coca-Cola's largest bottler plans a conference call with analysts and investors today that a spokeswoman said was intended to clarify questions about pricing and other issues that surfaced at a beverage conference in New York earlier this month.
The bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, is under pressure from Wall Street. The company has seen its stock battered this year -- especially since Nov. 3, when it said at the industry conference that the price it pays for the prime ingredients for soft drinks would rise at twice the usual rate next year.

HEADLINE: A U.N. Watchdog Exits to Applause

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
Five years ago, under pressure from the United States, where an anti-United Nations lobby was growing on the political right, the General Assembly created a watchdog office to fight corruption and mismanagement within the organization.
On Friday, a German Foreign Ministry official, Karl Theodor Paschke, ended his nonrenewable term leading that office, having uncovered millions of dollars of fraud or abuse. 
 For the first time, the United Nations began dismissing employees quickly, recovering losses by confiscating their pensions and property, and turning over criminal cases to public trials in national courts rather than allowing malfeasance to disappear quietly. In the international legal limbo of the United Nations system, offenders may still be transferred rather than disciplined, but Mr. Paschke hopes this will be less likely in the future.
In Washington, there was parting praise for Mr. Paschke from a spokesman for Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and a frequent critic of the United Nations. The spokesman, Marc Thiessen, said Mr. Paschke had taken on an enormous job in trying to reform "a very dysfunctional institution" and that the work must continue. He said that the experience proved that Congressional pressure, which led to the creation of Mr. Paschke's office, pays off.
Mr. Paschke has worked against a backdrop of unrelenting criticism from a group of developing nations, which objected to the appointment of an inspector general from an industrial nation and has blocked approval of several of his major reports. But two of his biggest cases of fraud involved Americans.
One bilked the United Nations out of about $500,000 in Geneva by setting up phony training programs, then collecting expenses for nonexistent participants. The other colluded with a travel agency in Croatia to defraud the organization for travel costs. The first was tried and convicted in Switzerland, the second in a federal court in New York.
"Clearly no one can accuse me of blurred vision," Mr. Paschke said of critics in the developing world.
Secretary General Kofi Annan has not yet chosen a replacement for Mr. Paschke, who as head of the Office of Internal Oversight Services ranked as an under secretary general.
Mr. Paschke, 64, is a former spokesman and former personnel and management chief in the German Foreign Ministry who from the outset supported more openness in the United Nations. A lawyer by training, he expanded auditing throughout the organization and sent inspectors around the world, shaking up distant offices unaccustomed to surveillance.
In an interview, Mr. Paschke said that five years of looking for trouble had taught him that corruption and mismanagement at the United Nations "are not better or not worse than in any other big bureaucracy." Problems may be more difficult to deal with, however, because of the nature of the organization and the circumstances in which it has to operate in remote, dangerous regions.
"It is a myth to believe that this organization could ever be run like a big multinational business," he said. Improved management techniques, which Mr. Annan has backed or instigated, could make a difference, Mr. Paschke said, but he added that the nature of the organization remains a barrier to fundamental change.
"This is a very political organization, a multicultural organization, an organization with a board of directors from 188 countries," he said. "Consensus management is very difficult to achieve."
Just defining corruption is not easy, as Mr. Paschke's periodic reports and thousands of recommendations attest. Is taking a free trip at the expense of a United Nations contractor unethical? Not in most member countries. Putting friends or relatives on the payroll? That is standard operating procedure in many places -- not always excluding western Europe and the United States.
Add to the mix an international civil service of very uneven quality. "This organization, until very recently, has never chosen senior staff on their management abilities," Mr. Paschke said. The result is a lack of hands-on direction, giving opportunities to wrongdoers.
"The farther away from headquarters, the more risky the environment gets," he said.
Mr. Paschke's office, which has no power to prosecute, soon identified three areas of United Nations activity where corruption arises most frequently: in peacekeeping operations, emergency relief activities and general procurement.
In such operations, United Nations officials say, ad hoc arrangements often have to be made without consultation. Many transactions in countries at war or in crisis have to be handled in cash in the absence of functioning banking systems. Local contractors, and sometimes governments, take advantage, demanding inflated payments for urgently needed goods or services. Bookkeeping is patchy, often nonexistent, especially in private organizations through which the United Nations must often work in the field.
The United Nations observer mission in Angola was examined in some detail in Mr. Paschke's last annual report, published in October. There, a resident auditor found a contractor submitting multiple photocopies of invoices, resulting in double payments totaling $30,000.
Over four years, the mission bought all airline tickets from one Johannesburg travel agent, and paid the agent more than $1.7 million without seeking approval from any superiors, the report found.
Although the Angolan government was required to give free office space to the United Nations mission -- sent to help the country recover from a devastating civil war -- Mr. Paschke's office found that various landlords had collected about $13 million in rent.
In some countries, the United Nations inspectors and auditors found government officials collecting taxes and duties on aid materials that were supposed to be imported free.
Around the world, Mr. Paschke has found the organization robbed through currency speculation, careless or nonexistent record-keeping, misuse or disuse of acquired materials (amounting to $22 million at a single supply base in Brindisi, Italy), petty cash disappearances ($3.9 million is still missing in Somalia), the loss of expensive vehicles and fraudulent claims of all kinds.
For example, two field staff members of the peacekeeping department, since dismissed, submitted $222,345 in forged education bills for their children. At the Economic Commission for Africa, $30,000 vanished when two employees began writing checks to themselves. In some cases, Mr. Paschke has advocated complete overhauls of offices abroad.
"Reform does not happen overnight," he said. "But we have been an agent for change."

HEADLINE: Daniel Margolies, 89, Lawyer And a Nuremberg Prosecutor

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
Daniel Margolies, a lawyer with a long career in public service, including membership in the team of American prosecutors at the war-crimes trials in Nuremberg after World War II, died Nov. 6 at a hospital in Aurora, Colo., a suburb of Denver. He was 89.
Partly because of the fluent German he learned while doing postgraduate research on medieval manuscripts in Germany in the early 1930's, Mr. Margolies was assigned to interrogate and help build a case against the 24 major Nazi leaders in preparation for the Nuremberg trials, which began in November 1945. 
 Mr. Margolies's account of the trial, included in "Eyewitnesses at Nuremberg" by Hilary Gaskin (Arms and Armor Press, 1990), contains chilling excerpts of his questions and the banal responses they elicited.
"We would say," Mr. Margolies recalled, " 'Well, here's a document that you issued, saying that all the inhabitants of such and such a town should be shot -- Is this your signature?' and 'Why did you do this?' And he would say, 'Well, somebody or other had destroyed a truck,' or something, 'and we had to maintain a certain amount of respect.' "
Mr. Margolies married Harriet Zetterberg in London in 1945, while they were both helping to prepare the indictments.
She then joined Mr. Margolies as a member of the prosecution team in Nuremberg, but when Gen. George S. Patton Jr. decreed that there would be no room in the American Zone for the wives of his officers, Harriet Margolies dropped her married name so she could live with her husband in the hotel in Nuremberg where the prosecutors were housed.
They were, according to "The Nuremberg Trial" by Ann Tusa and John Tusa (Atheneum, 1984), "the only sinners with a marriage license."
Harriet Margolies died in 1986.
Daniel Margolies was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 12, 1910. After graduating from Harvard in 1931, he traveled to Germany to study medieval manuscripts. He returned after a year, graduated from Harvard Law School in 1936, and then moved to Washington where he lived for most of the next 50 years.
He began his career investigating unfair labor practices for a Senate subcommittee presided over by Senator Robert M. LaFollette Jr., the Wisconsin Republican. He then worked in the Office of Price Administration and the Office of Economic Warfare.
One of the earliest draftees in World War II, Mr. Margolies worked for the Office of Strategic Services in London and in occupied Germany before becoming a prosecutor at Nuremberg.
After the trials, Mr. Margolies joined the State Department and later the Foreign Service. He was the economics counsel in the United States Embassy in London from 1957 to 1960 and in Leopoldville, Congo, now known as Kinshasa, from 1960 to 1962.
Returning to Washington in 1963, Mr. Margolies worked on Latin American affairs and then as foreign policy adviser to the President's Science Advisory Committee.
Mr. Margolies is survived by two children, Mary Margolies DeForest of Denver and David Margolies of Oakland, Calif.

HEADLINE: If It's Monday, This Must Be Turkey

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, Nov. 14

 BODY:
As a candidate in 1992, Bill Clinton criticized President George Bush for excessive globe-trotting. But in his nearly seven years in office, Mr. Clinton has taken more foreign trips, spent more time overseas and assembled larger and costlier entourages than any president before.
He has been to summit meetings, and seen big game in Botswana. He has held tete-a-tetes with heads of state and strolled the Great Wall of China. He has visited troops in Bosnia and viewed Michelangelo's masterpieces in the Sistine Chapel. 
 "There are a few places still left on the list he hasn't been," Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, remarked recently. "And we have 15 months to rectify that."
When Air Force One touched down late tonight in Ankara, President Clinton began a trip through southern Europe that will eclipse Mr. Bush's last remaining travel distinction, the record for number of nations visited by an American president.
Until now, Mr. Bush had visited more countries than any other president: 60 stops in just four years. Mr. Clinton will knock Mr. Bush off that perch in the days ahead.
After a state visit in Ankara, Mr. Clinton will fly to Istanbul for a security conference. Then he is off to a meeting on progressive governance in Florence; a state visit to Greece; the first-ever stop by an American president in Sofia, Bulgaria; and a visit to American troops stationed in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
By the trip's end just before Thanksgiving, Mr. Clinton will have stopped over the course of his presidency in 63 nations, many of which have never before been host to an American president. Mr. Clinton, according to State Department historical records, was the first United States chief executive to set foot in Botswana, the first to stop in Kuwait and the first to visit Denmark, Slovenia and South Africa.
Already, Mr. Clinton has left the United States more often than any other president. His visit to Oslo last week for events commemorating the death of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel was Mr. Clinton's 44th overseas trip, almost as many sojourns as Mr. Bush and Ronald Reagan amassed in their combined three terms. And, according to White House records, Mr. Clinton has already spent nearly 200 days out of the country, considerably more time than any predecessor.
Presidential travels can focus the spotlight on countries that often feel ignored. "We don't expect a magic wand," said a Bulgarian official in Washington. "But if President Clinton pats us on the shoulder, he may give a signal to private businesses to start looking at us."
The cost of the trips has riled some of Mr. Clinton's detractors on Capitol Hill. In the course of just over three months in 1998, the president's trips to Chile, China and six African countries cost an estimated $72 million, according to a recent study by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress.
The total number of officials and others who traveled at government expense in connection with the three trips exceeded 2,400 people, excluding Secret Service agents, the accounting office report said. Although the report did not directly compare Mr. Clinton's entourage with those of past presidents, administration officials say presidential travel has grown more elaborate and complicated over the years.
Ten advance teams traveled to Africa in the months leading to Mr. Clinton's visits in Ghana, Uganda, Rwanda, South Africa, Botswana and Senegal. The bulk of the $42.8 million cost for the Africa trip -- the longest trip to the continent by any American president -- fell on the Defense Department, which flew 98 airlift missions to deliver vehicles and other equipment from various locations in the United States and Europe. The Pentagon also provided 13 Army and Marine Corps helicopters in Africa and set up temporary medical evacuation units in five countries.
"I encourage people to go and see the world," said Senator Craig Thomas of Wyoming, one of the Republicans who asked for the cost accounting of the president's travel. "I am not an isolationist. I don't expect him to pack his own lunch or use frequent flier miles. But I expect this president and all presidents not to be excessive about the cost."
Presidential aides say that travel costs are high for good reasons and that overseas visits benefit the United States economy more than they sap the treasury.
"There is a high cost of providing physical security to the president when he's overseas and providing secure communications," Mr. Lockhart said. "We are the lone remaining superpower in the world. The president needs the ability to handle any crisis any time, anywhere. That comes at a cost."
"The kind of engagement around the world that the country deserves does cost money," Mr. Lockhart added, "but I think the president believes that it's money well spent."
The makeup of Mr. Clinton's entourages has been scrutinized from the start. On his first overseas trip to Japan and Korea, he briefly considered taking his mother-in-law; his daughter, Chelsea, and three of Chelsea's teenage friends. He traveled with his personal secretary, Betty Currie, to Africa shortly after she testified before the grand jury investigating him. His aides studiously avoided taking any United States businessmen along to China during controversies over campaign contributions and technology transfers.
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has traveled considerably. Of her 51 trips to such far-flung countries as Nepal, Iceland, Morocco and Uzbekistan, 23 have been solo ventures (with an entourage but without the president). She will travel along for part of the trip through Europe, and advisers said both her schedule and the president's had to be meshed while planning the complicated, politically sensitive itinerary.
White House aides point out that political opponents have found ulterior motives just about every time Mr. Clinton's Air Force jet has left United States airspace.
His first trips in 1993 -- to Canada, Korea and Japan -- were seen as efforts by the young president to show that he really could handle foreign affairs. The barrage of travel early in his second term was written off as the beleaguered chief executive's trying to escape investigations back home. Now, with the end of his presidency growing near, Mr. Clinton is said to be on a farewell tour.
"There is always an inclination for a president to want to say goodbye to his peers around the world, and I think that's the phase we're in now," said Marlin Fitzwater, press secretary to former Presidents Bush and Reagan. "Also, he is becoming less relevant. If no one pays any attention to him here, he can go oversees and find that everyone cares."
Mr. Fitzwater remembers candidate Clinton's urging Mr. Bush to stay home more often. "It's time for us to have a president who cares more about Littleton, N.H., than about Liechtenstein, more about Manchester than Micronesia," Mr. Clinton said back then.
White House aides say Mr. Clinton's real point was not Mr. Bush's travel schedule but his seeming lack of focus on domestic policies. Balance is essential, Mr. Clinton's advisers say, pointing to the trip that the president sandwiched in between Oslo and Athens this month -- an antipoverty tour with a domestic focus and stops no more exotic than Newark and Hartford. (It was his second such tour this year.)
And although the current trip will allow the president to see some prime tourist draws, advisers say it is full of serious foreign policy pursuits. The trip's goals, said Samuel R. Berger, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, are nothing less than "promoting stability in the Balkans, democracy in Serbia, reconciliation in the Aegean, a settlement on Cyprus, peace in the Caucasus and integration of Russia into the global community."
Despite all his travel, Mr. Clinton does not appear overly jet-lagged. On his travel wish list in the year 2000, aides say, are trips to southern Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and Europe.
Yet there are limits even for a president with a gassed-up jet at his beck and call. Diplomacy can sometimes interfere with desire.
Mr. Clinton postponed a trip to India and Pakistan after dueling nuclear tests in those countries and now faces the sticky question of whether to visit the region in the wake of last month's coup d'etat in Islamabad.
"The president has wanted to visit the region for some time, and he continues to want to do so," Mr. Berger said. "The coup in Islamabad complicates that situation, but at this point no decisions have been made."
Mr. Clinton also bypassed Nigeria during his 1998 tour of Africa to protest the military leadership there, although he welcomed the newly elected president, Olusegun Obasanjo, to the White House last month.
Political considerations have also prevented President Clinton from touching down in Havana, where Fidel Castro has frustrated the United States for 40 years. "I hope someday we'll all be able to travel to a democratic Cuba," Mr. Clinton said at his very first presidential news conference, on March 24, 1993.

HEADLINE: Communist Losing Bid For Top Job In Ukraine

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine, Nov. 14

 BODY:
President Leonid Kuchma was heading for a second term today, according to early results that indicated a convincing victory over a Communist who had frightened many voters with his calls to turn back to the Soviet era.
With about 66 percent of the votes counted, Mr. Kuchma had won 56.5 percent and the Communist Party chief, Petro Symonenko, had 37.5 percent, the Central Elections Commission reported. Voter turnout was 73.8 percent, it said. 
 Mr. Kuchma, 61, focused his campaign on warnings that Mr. Symonenko would revive the restrictions of the Soviet era.
The president has pledged to continue market reforms and a foreign policy that centers on close ties with western Europe, the United States and NATO. But he failed to revive the economy or crack down on rampant corruption during his first term, and most analysts doubt there will be a dramatic turnaround.
Mr. Symonenko, who tried at the last minute to convince voters that they had nothing to fear, admitted today that their fears were too great.
He had pledged to maintain rights to private property, support private business and restore churches despite the Communists' atheistic policies. But the Communist program also called for a state-planned economy with heavy subsidies for major industries, price controls, halting the privatization of state assets, a ban on land sales and a likely government monopoly on foreign trade.
Despite widespread dissatisfaction with Mr. Kuchma, a return to Soviet-style life seemed even more frightening to some Ukrainians. Even impoverished Ukrainians were voting for Mr. Kuchma today, seeking to avert a Communist comeback and preserve whatever stability they might have.
"I've marched enough under red flags in my life," said one Kiev factory worker, Oleksandr Plakhotniuk.
Mr. Symonenko, 47, was second in the first round of voting on Oct. 31, when Mr. Kuchma failed to gain an outright majority.

HEADLINE: Why Trade Will Win

BYLINE: By Gordon G. Chang; Gordon G. Chang is a lawyer based in Beijing for an American firm.

DATELINE: HONG KONG

 BODY:
Many Americans seem to think it is vital that we find a way to get China into the World Trade Organization. The United States trade deficit with China, likely to reach $60 billion for 1999, is already the worst case of imbalance in all of our foreign trade -- imports from China are now about five times higher than our exports there. If China can't be drawn into the disciplined framework of the W.T.O., the alarmist thinking goes, the United States may never be able to sell widely in the huge Chinese market.
A W.T.O. agreement, the proponents think, would lead rapidly to lower Chinese tariffs and a fixed timetable for measures to open China as a market. Failure to lock up a deal now could mean the earliest that China could join would be three years from now, at the conclusion of the round of trade negotiations that begins in a couple of weeks in Seattle. 
 But the worrying is wrong. America need feel little urgency to get China into the W.T.O. The Chinese economy is in big trouble, and ultimately it cannot be rescued without further economic reform of the kind that will let foreign businesses operate far more freely and fairly. Whether there is an agreement or not, China is going to have to liberalize its economy.
A trade agreement now, before the inevitable structural reform, might have little positive effect anyway. China, after all, does not always live up to its agreements as foreign nations see them. Ask the elderly Falun Gong practitioners who were dragged by their hair from Tiananmen Square this month, for example, about Beijing's adherence to the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which it signed last year. Chinese citizens have human rights, but only as their government defines them.
Foreign investors know that China has a similar genius for reinterpreting economic agreements as its ministries make new rules.
What China cannot interpret away are the signs of its own economic failure. Two years of deflation have taken their toll. Heavy government spending has not worked to restart domestic consumption. China is now an addict in the debt markets. It builds roads and bridges and dams and hands out increases in pay and pensions and benefits, but it cannot persuade its citizens, who evidently see hard times ahead, to become bigger spenders.
At the core of the problem, China's state-owned enterprises are dying, noncompetitive even in its restrictive system. Beijing forced domestic commercial banks to lend them money that, as it turns out, will never be paid back, leaving the banks with bad and nonperforming loans that some estimate at $500 billion.
Obsolete inventory scars balance sheets. Foreign investment sinks monthly. Corruption eats away at the fabric of society, and, most telling of all, foreign currency flees the country. China claimed its economy grew 7.8 percent last year. Adjust the statistics for exaggeration and subtract out economically useless production, and China barely had positive growth. The country has tens of millions unemployed or underemployed citizens, with millions more young people ready to enter the job market.
All of this is why, despite all of the anti-American sentiment in China these days, Chinese negotiators have been talking so intensely in the last few days to Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative. And it is why, W.T.O. or no W.T.O., China will open its economy.
Take telecommunications, one area of contention with the United States. China's telecommunications ministry is trying to prohibit foreign investment, but Beijing has staked much of its future on the growth of technologically advanced industries. Its leaders know that the fast way of building them is with the technical and financial help of foreigners.
In banking, another controversial area, the future is even clearer. After failures of China's nonbank financial institutions, the country is facing an acute shortage of liquidity and is accelerating the relaxation of rules that hampered foreign bankers. Perhaps even more important, its troubled domestic banks have begun to benefit from foreign know-how and will need more of it.
Deng Xiaoping, President Jiang Zemin's illustrious predecessor, talked about making China rich and strong. Mr. Jiang knows that, in these troubled days, his country cannot go it alone in reaching that goal. China will move forward, whether inside or outside the W.T.O. At the end of the day, it really doesn't matter which it is.

HEADLINE: For Three Interns, Fatigue And Healing at Top Speed

SERIES: LIFE, DEATH AND MANAGED CARE: A Welcome to the Real World -- Second of four articles.

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
The interns felt they had to watch "E.R.," because it was about them. Or it was about them spiced with a lot more melodrama. Sometimes it was silly. Sometimes it was maudlin. Sometimes it was all too real.
One evening on "E.R.," an intern nearly comatose from working all night miscalculated a dosage because her vision was blurry, sending a patient into cardiac arrest. As she watched, weary herself from the tornado of work these early weeks, Dr. Jennifer James thought, "Wow, that's really true"; her vision got blurry as well during overnight duty. And then she worried a little more about her long hours and the paralyzing possibility that she might do something wrong. 
 What with New York's much-publicized assault on interns' hours, Dr. James and the other new recruits might have expected the issue to have gone away. Instead, as St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center struggled to cope with relentless cost pressures, hours seemed to be driving everyone crazier than ever before.
Everyone talked about hours. Opinions flew back and forth. Were the interns working too long for their own and their patients' good (as the interns themselves insisted) or not long enough (as many of the senior doctors felt just as passionately)? Were their brains active or inactive when they did that lumbar puncture at 4 in the morning?
Dr. James's days were merciless assaults on her circadian rhythm. They started in the dark, and seemed never to end. She came out of sleep slowly, everything swaying foggily before her. Since her husband insisted on further rest, she flicked on a flashlight to rummage through her bureau for clothes. Then she ate a soundless breakfast.
She and the other interns lived in apartments opposite Roosevelt Hospital, the buildings preternaturally quiet since their inhabitants were perpetually at work or asleep. So many ate at the Olympic Flame Diner on 60th Street that it was christened the resident dining room. Everything proceeded so fast in their lives that one resident conserved precious nanoseconds by having coffee delivered to his door.
As she hurried across the street to the hospital, amid waves of rumpled white coats, Dr. James mulled the day's prospects: it was her "Good Day," which, in the converse thinking of the hospital, meant she was likely to be swamped with work. Sure enough, once she was inside the residents' room, with its sharp smells of moldering food from the night workers, the senior resident, after a chummy, "Hiya!" inquired, "What are you, Jennifer, good day?"
"Yes, Good Day," she replied, and three patients and two sets of transfer orders were flung at her. She woke up fast.
The interns sorted their days into three categories: Good Days, Bad Days and Call Days. On Call Days in some rotations, they officially worked from 8 a.m. until 8 the following morning (in practice, closer to 10:30 or noon). You only admitted patients on Call Days. A Bad Day was the day after call, when supervisors tried to be easy on the fatigued interns. Good Days came between Bad Days and Call Days, when you were supposedly reinvigorated and the hospital felt free to pile on the work.
So Good Days really became Bad Days, and Bad Days came closer to being Good Days. Given that the interns never felt fully rested, all days felt like Mediocre Days interspersed with Hideous Days.
Hours had become a hot issue a decade ago, when, after the death of 18-year-old Libby Zion at New York Hospital, the state fortified supervision and barred residents from working more than 80 hours a week and 24 hours straight. Before then, interns at St. Luke's-Roosevelt had worked in excess of 100 hours and commonly went 48 hours straight caring for patients.
Now, schedules called for six-day, 80-hour weeks, with Call Days coming every fourth day on the wards and every third day in intensive care. Undoubtedly, the workload had eased up -- some.
To the older doctors, though, the new work rules threatened to render the interns soft. They hated the rules and seemed to make no great effort to ensure that they were enforced. As they saw it, patient care was being compromised and teaching hours lost; each time a patient was handed off to another doctor, they argued, something was sacrificed in the "continuity of care."
"Society is pushing doctors to be cops and firemen," Dr. Michael Lesch, the chairman of the department of medicine, liked to say. "You work shifts and you don't take the patient home with you. How would you like to have a 14-hour surgical procedure and after 8 hours they change doctors? They do it in Sweden."
This inevitably led to a lesser-of-two-evils debate: Who would you rather be treated by -- a walking zombie who knew your case or an alert intern who did not? Dr. Lesch's choice was the exhausted intern familiar with his case, not a night-shift worker.
Dr. James voted for the alert intern, especially with hospitalized patients so much sicker these days. She had only to assess herself during the latter hours of call. Tiredness blanketed her, blotting out much cerebral activity. Her speech was hesitant.
And the issue had been muddied even further by staff cuts and other new demands on the interns.
Toward the end of her rotation in intensive care, she was averaging 120 hours a week, in clear violation of the law. Some Call Days, she worked 30 hours straight. Occasionally, she went 12 days without a full day off. Fatigue dogged her like a bad back.
The emotional toll made her even more exhausted. She had a 62-year-old leukemia patient. On rounds, her supervisor said there was a 99 percent chance he would die within 24 hours. Just yesterday the man had joked with her: "This sure isn't like 'E.R.' "
"No it isn't," she had laughed.
Now she felt heartbroken.
Addled interns on the floors were juggling a blur of up to 20 patients at a time, far beyond the 12-patient limit set by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Interns were supposed to handle only five admissions a day, though the hospital had its own limit of six, because of insufficient manpower. On weekends, interns commonly had as many as eight. Small wonder they called admissions "hits." One intern would ask another after a night on call, "What was the damage?" and the groggy reply would be, "I really got hurt last night."
Dr. James and the others lamented that, among other things, they had no time for the reading or noon lectures essential to their education. The discontent escalated. Finally, they had had enough. In mid-August, the residents held a meeting and drafted a petition listing their grievances.
Dr. Lesch met with them and acknowledged that they were right in their outrage. He promised to advertise at once for four more residents. The help was sorely needed. One of the original interns had quit, overwhelmed. He had returned home to Japan and an uncertain future.
 
'I Need a Doctor'
Every time he put his hand on another patient, Dr. Edward Lathan felt he was learning something. He was amazed at how much responsibility he was given. After he examined someone in the Roosevelt Hospital emergency room, he would sit down with his supervisor, who would grill him: "What do you think?" "Did you see the X-ray?" "Why didn't you see the X-ray?" But there were also times when the supervisor would get that icy look that meant, "Have you seen that chart rack?" In the grand sense, the E.R. was a game of ever-increasing speed, of lives slipping from one state to another, and it was called Clear the Rack.
There were days when the intern faded and the physician-to-be came into focus, and vice versa. Dr. Lathan sent a woman to be X-rayed for a possible fracture. X-ray sent her right back. Please remove her earrings and necklace. "I get so tired of telling them," said the radiologist. A man was crashing, and Dr. Lathan hooked him up to an oxygen mask. He stared incredulously. Why wasn't he improving? It helped if you turned on the oxygen.
There were infinite distinctions to be learned, certain managed-care phone numbers to call for permission to let patients pass Go and enter the hospital. "You wait 45 minutes and no one calls back," he said. "Meanwhile, there are five more patients."
He could be excused in his incomprehension, for Dr. Gregg Husk, the department chairman, felt bewildered himself. "It's like good luck in knowing what I'm supposed to do -- what phone number I call and what behavior I'm supposed to follow so everyone is ecstatically happy," he said. "If we admit someone and we didn't make the right phone call, it affects revenue. Many people don't have a medical card on them. They didn't plan on getting shot that day."
Everything imaginable showed up -- ear cut on a dresser, "poisoned" by tap water, nail in the foot. And more often than not in this age of emergency room as primary-care physician for the poor and uninsured, the precipitating reason was less than life-threatening, never less so than when an agitated woman arrived by ambulance with a broken fingernail. The sub-specialist needed was a manicurist.
Next night, three patients were "going down" simultaneously. "I need a doctor," a nurse shouted. She looked straight at Dr. Lathan. He felt he was watching something on a screen.
The man had congestive heart failure. Dr. Lathan talked soothingly, coaxing him to relax, as he listened to his lungs. They were filled with fluid. He kept talking, buying time, acting superficially calm as he silently prayed for a supervisor. Why was the staff so thin? At last the supervisor came.
When he left work, Dr. Lathan had to force himself to eat. He could never go straight to bed. His thoughts had to settle first. "You spend the whole day in the emergency room giving," he said one evening. "When you get home, you wonder, when do you get to take?"
 
Indignities of Internship
Dr. Bryan Holland was already on overload when a nurse appeared to report that an I.V. had to be replaced.
"Can you do it?" he asked.
"He's a hard stick," she said, jargon for someone with veins difficult to locate. Sometimes it was truly a hard stick (a drug addict with deflated veins or an obese patient with veins obliterated by fat), but often it was a nurse deflecting work.
It was not what he had signed up for, being treated as a "scut monkey." True, scut work had always been part of the bargain. But cuts in support staff sometimes heaped more work on interns.
Scut work had elastic meaning, but tended to cover things like taking blood, attaching I.V.'s, transporting patients and writing progress notes. Dr. Holland figured half his day was given to paperwork alone. The parameters of scut work widened when the hospital began requiring that all orders be entered into the computer. Many of the supervisors -- known as attendings -- did not care to be bothered learning the electronic notation. Just like that, the interns became data-entry clerks.
Internship also came with certain hazing rituals. In the clinic, the attendings stressed the importance of not giving children foul-tasting medications. Several times, Dr. Holland was told to sample various concoctions for suitability. The attendings knew full well which tasted like candy, which like sewage. But they delighted in watching him wince his way through the rancid offerings.
Even the dress code got the interns exercised. Residents had to wear thigh-length white jackets, while attendings and chief residents wore knee-length ones. It was a demarcation of the strata of the hospital. Dr. James and the other interns detested the short coats, feeling they looked "stupid," especially with their pockets full of instruments and books. For a while, a rash of medicine residents flouted the rules and donned long coats. Their superiors told them to get them off.
 
Hurry Up and Wait
It took time to figure out the clinic. Everything was on parade, an awesome randomness of complaints -- a rash, a headache, asthma, a bum foot. Much of it was detective work. The criminal was disease.
Dr. James had just seen a 65-year-old woman, petite and confused. The other day, she said, her legs had felt hot and she'd had chest pain. Now Dr. James was in line, waiting to review the case with an attending. It was almost like a bakery -- take a ticket. She would see a patient, talk with an attending, return for a final word with the patient. Sometimes she got right in. Sometimes, like now, she was third in line. Patients waiting for interns, interns waiting for attendings. Everyone waiting.
Seated before the attending, Dr. James went over the woman with chest pains.
The attending said, "It could be a viral thing. It would be good to know what she was doing when she felt the pain and exactly what it felt like."
"I tried to get that," Dr. James said. "She wasn't sure."
"I'll go in and ask some questions," he said. "They always tell a different story when the attending comes in."
He went in and said: "Now inside your chest, did it feel like butterflies in there?"
The woman said, "It felt slow."
A nurse poked her head in: "There are three waiting."
Dr. James had someone scheduled every half-hour, yet she often needed twice that much time. This was the new equation of the teaching hospital -- trying to balance economics, instruction and patient care -- and it often didn't equate.
Not so long ago, interns spent nearly all their time on the wards. Now, under the confinements of managed care and enhanced treatment techniques, most of the work of medicine got done not in hospitals but in doctors' offices. Internship had begun to change accordingly: the year before, the outpatient portion of a medicine resident's training rose to 33 percent from 25; for pediatric residents, it went to 50 percent from 25. The clinics, the theory went, would help mold a doctor for a new era of preventive medicine and primary care -- one who would enter practice attuned to interpersonal relationships.
For Dr. James, that meant spending Friday afternoons at her "continuity" clinic, where patients would be assigned to her for the entire three-year residency, as well as several monthlong clinic rotations.
Yet, she was still spending the bulk of her time on the wards. And though she liked the clinic because it mimicked her future life ("I'm beginning to feel like a real doctor," she said. "It's cool."), much of it was bread-and-butter medicine, and she felt she learned more on the floor. The supervisors seemed to treat the clinic as a sideline. If she didn't finish her work on the floor before clinic, she would have to return in the evening. "When you go to the clinic, it's on top of everything else," she said.
Plus, the clinic seemed to allow little time for teaching. On the floors, patients remained for days, not minutes. The interns heard about them at length during daily rounds. In the clinic, the attendings were under pressure to keep patient flow speedy. Insurance paid the same if a visit took two minutes or two hours. One attending in the clinic habitually spent a lot of time teaching and questioning. Dr. James dreaded seeing him on busy days. By teaching so much, he put her behind schedule.
"There's less time to soak things in and put it on the table and discuss it," said Dr. Lesch. "When do I get a chance in clinic to talk about ethics? How do I teach the difference between treating a patient and managing a patient? How do I teach someone to be kind? How do I teach someone how and when to be scared?"
A 26-year-old woman appeared with a numb hand. Ultimately she didn't need Dr. James. She needed a hand specialist. What she got was Dr. James. She had waited two hours to see her. She had waited a week for the appointment, after having been to the E.R. This was the gatekeeper theory of managed care -- no one went to a specialist until the primary care doctor said so.
Dr. James said so; she also said she did not understand this delay. The woman had carpal tunnel syndrome. The E.R. doctor had known she needed a specialist. Dr. James's role, as she put it, was "basically just to do the paperwork."
Naturally empathetic, she tried to spend time listening to patients, to win people over with fraternization, to counsel them on preventive care. Also, arguably the most important thing the interns learned was how to elicit information. What did it mean when a woman told Dr. James: "I've got something like an infection in my mouth. Also pain in my back. And in my ear, a little noise. It goes and comes back." What did it mean when someone said, "I just feel weird."
And yet the clock was always ticking away money. She had learned in medical school that, on average, doctors let patients speak no more than 16 seconds before interrupting them. A man came in and his heart was racing. Turned out he had just scampered out to feed the parking meter. Let him sit for 20 minutes and check him again was the counsel of the attending. The hospital should have just paid the parking ticket.
That patients felt dehumanized in this beat-the-clock environment was a much-heard truth. Dr. James had been taught certain techniques so patients would not feel rushed even as they were being rushed. Take a deep breath before entering, so your speech is unhurried. Sit down rather than stand up, if only for a second. When you enter, don't walk right to the patient, but meander around insouciantly as if you have nothing else to do.
As much as she could, Dr. James did sit down with patients. But she didn't always remember the deep breath, and she usually forgot about her footwork. She headed straight for the patient.
 
Diagnosis: Managed-Careitis
In the early-morning gloom, a woman in her late 60's arrived at the E.R. with her daughter. She had chronic obstructive coronary disease. She had been discharged just the day before. She had a fever. She was disoriented. Her respiration was slowing down. An attending instructed Dr. Lathan to insert a breathing tube. Ten minutes later, her blood pressure began to drop. Five more minutes and the doctors were trying to revive her. A half-hour later, she was dead.
The daughter began wailing and banging on the door of her mother's room. Fearing she would break the glass, the doctors let her in.
Dr. Lathan's first interaction with death came in college, and he had reacted less to the death than to the conduct of the doctors, who were so detached they joked as they worked on the faltering patient. "I didn't think that was anything to laugh about," he recalled. "I wasn't going to be that way."
Now, with his own first death, he felt like crawling into a corner, but it was the beginning of his shift and there were patients waiting. His whole countenance changed. He was bothered that the woman had been sent home in this new world of quick movement, though who knew if it had contributed to her death? He remembered the crying, the anguish of the daughter. No, there was nothing funny in his mind.
You dealt with a lot in the E.R. other than medical care. You dealt with people who showed up with a feigned complaint that was really an interest in free food. You dealt with people who wanted a "drive-through," in and out as fast as it took to acquire a burger and fries at McDonald's. You dealt with people who "eloped," walked out unannounced, labs and diagnosis still pending.
And you got people whose primary emergency was that they had had to wait too long for an appointment with their managed-care doctor. Or they came with the self-diagnosis that they hated their managed-care doctor. They had managed-careitis.
Here now was an elopement. The man kept saying, "Beer, beer, beer." The nurse told him, "No beer." His beverage of choice unavailable, he yanked out his I.V. and left.
Sardonic epithets were part of the medical experience, best used out of public earshot. "Noncitizens" were people who went to jail or abused drugs and alcohol. Hopeless cases sometimes got referred to as Tobash (Take Out Back and Shoot in the Head). The elderly women who showed up out of loneliness were Lol in Nad (Little Old Ladies in No Apparent Distress).
During a long night with the usual overtones of tragicomedy, a 65-year-old Medicaid patient came in, a manic depressive of devout religious beliefs. He had not left his apartment in 10 years, feeling it was God's will that he stay put pending a sign to the contrary. His wife decided his illness was the sign and called an ambulance. He complained of frequent and painful urination. Glucose was entering his urine. He was given insulin and hydration.
Normally, it might have been sufficient to follow him up at the clinic. But who knew what he would decide once he was home? It was hard to make appointments 10 years hence. Yet Dr. Lathan had to struggle to get him approved for admission. "You have to tell a good story," he said.
The attending argued hard and the man got in. What became of him, Dr. Lathan did not know. He had a woman with a nosebleed.
 
'Buy the Ticket, Take the Ride'
Several months into the year, an 87-year-old woman with platelet disease was sent to the E.R. by her private physician and admitted to the floor. The intern who admitted her was due to leave and handed her off to the incoming intern. The woman needed a platelet transfusion, but the newly arrived intern instead ordered plasma, which did her no good. Later, he defended himself by pointing out that plasma and platelets were adjacent on the computer. The woman died, and might have anyway, though there was no certainty of that. Procedural changes were instituted, but the human dimension of the case was seized on as a teaching tool by the administrators, for they felt it resonated to the heart of ethics and doctoring.
The setting was one of the medicine department's Morbidity and Mortality conferences, or M. & M.s, where the doctors alternated with somber recitals of their mistakes and tried to learn from them. Every Friday, the week's "expirations" and other "adverse outcomes" were laid out in an especially clubby forum, closed to outsiders, with all information protected by statute from use in a lawsuit.
To interns still so uncertain of so much, it seemed that the crushing hours and rushed state of medicine only encouraged error. They had all made small blunders. A few times, exhausted while on call, Dr. James had written notes on the wrong patient's chart. When she returned later, the notes made no sense. She corrected them. Her worst mistake, in her view, had been ordering a CAT scan of a patient's head instead of the chest. Afterward, she was a mass of guilt. But she was unaware of anything she had done that had harmed a patient.
Still, she was unusually fastidious, for she felt she had a propensity for mistakes. Underlying her anxiety was a weakness for malapropisms. In medical school, friends told her she was bound to tell a patient, "You have cancer . . . oh, I mean a cold."
For the most part, the conclusion at M. & M.'s was that the patient was unharmed, and those who died would have anyway. The cases covered a wide range. An intern gave a 70-year-old woman four times the proper dose of amiodarone, a drug for an irregular heartbeat. She became hypertensive, but recovered. A man had a CAT scan before surgery for bleeding in the brain. Normally, the patient would lie on his back. In error, the technician programmed the machine to suggest he was on his stomach. The film came out so marked. The surgeon initially operated on the wrong side of the brain. The hospital found no adverse effect, but ordered that all films be manually marked; the technician, who had other performance problems, was dismissed.
And then there was the platelet woman.
Dr. Lesch's preaching that day got at something that was happening as cost pressures shaped and twisted medicine like a piece of clay. Young doctors, the administrators felt, were less inclined to feel culpable when they did something wrong. It was not them, it was a system that, as the interns kept hearing, had stolen so much of their autonomy. The system didn't let them do it right. Ship the blame elsewhere -- to a computer, to the next shift, to the head of the hospital, to society itself.
Dr. Lesch had often told the interns, and told them again now, that when they handed patients off, they should be as detailed as during rounds. (That rarely happened. To the interns, these were hollow murmurings that misread the exigencies of their lives. "That could take an hour, and we don't have an hour," Dr. James said. Often sign-outs lasted five minutes. Sometimes, an intern would sign out to another while passing in the hall, as if transferring a baton in a race.)
The room was stone silent as Dr. Lesch said that if someone was sick, getting off on time no longer mattered, rules or no rules. Nothing mattered except giving the best possible care until you could pass the patient on to someone who fully understood his condition. Your name was on the chart; you were responsible. As Dr. Lesch put it, "You buy the ticket, you take the ride."
Dr. James and the others left the meeting visibly shaken. For some time, she double- and triple-checked everything she entered into the computer. She had bought the ticket.
 
A Zebra or a Horse?
It being a Monday, the dogs came. They played with the sick children and enacted well-rehearsed stunts (catch a treat in the air, bow). Other times, a clown performed.
The doors of the Roosevelt pediatric floor were painted sky blue and festooned with stars and a rainbow, while the doors of the rooms were bright yellow, a color scheme meant to bring joy to an inherently unhappy experience. A large board kept track of patients, and when one was discharged, Dr. Holland drew a happy face next to the name. Now and then, to torment an arriving intern, those leaving would ink in imaginary patients to make the ward seem more frenetic. One day, Clinton, Starr and Lewinsky were all pediatric patients.
But Dr. Holland saw a lot of sadness on the floor. And while the interns hoped to learn detachment without becoming jaded, that art did not come quickly to him.
He treated several girls who had tried suicide. Boyfriend problems. You always knew the suicides by the black rings around their mouths, residue from the activated charcoal pumped into them in the E.R.
There was a 13-year-old girl with a brain tumor. She was getting radiation after surgery, but it was all too late to do much good. Her parents were poor. She kept asking, "How much is this costing my mother?" Not long after being discharged, she died.
"It bummed me out for several days," Dr. Holland said. "Her medical issues were to control her pain. It was all we could do. And she was worried about the expense."
He kept discovering nuggets that jelled into an education. One day his supervisor asked him the most common side-effect of a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. Nightmares was the answer, and a good thing for parents to know.
The school year brought a spate of fictitious ailments. A 13-year-old boy showed up complaining of a stomach ache. Dr. Holland felt his abdomen. "You don't look at your fingers, you look at the patient's eyes," he said. The boy didn't even wince. Dr. Holland told the attending it was a charade. The attending felt the stomach. Now the boy winced. The attending proceeded to teach Dr. Holland something he had read in no textbook. He ordered the boy to do jumping jacks. The boy was practically laughing as he effectively executed them.
Another day, Dr. Holland was working the cardiology clinic under Dr. Richard Golinko. There was a medical cliche among the teaching doctors: "If you hear hoofbeats, assume it's a horse, not a zebra." This meant that when commonplace symptoms suggested an obvious diagnosis -- a horse -- the odds were overwhelming that that was what was wrong. Expect the common, a horse, not the uncommon, a zebra. Dr. Holland, though, was beginning to wonder. He had already seen a number of zebras.
Now, Dr. Holland examined a 16-year-old girl who collapsed after complaining of chest pain. When an adult has chest pain, the first thought is the heart. With a child, it's the last. Dr. Holland examined her and found nothing amiss. He spoke to Dr. Golinko. "You could try Rolaids," Dr. Golinko said. "It could be an ulcer."
Dr. Holland said: "It doesn't sound like she's making anything up. She seems well taken care of. She has braces." (In the clinic, where poor and often poorly cared for children predominate, braces are a sign of committed parents.)
Dr. Golinko threw out other possibilities: "She may be having sexual problems that could manifest themselves in psychosomatic complaints." Her sister had migraines, and some people get migraine-like pains elsewhere in the body. Finally, it was agreed to schedule her for a sonogram to see if it was a zebra or a horse.
 
'This Gloom and Doom Feeling'
The greatest satisfaction came from seeing her patients progress and go home. And Dr. James experienced a lot of that. But there was little satisfaction when patients piled up into gridlock.
She was at Roosevelt on Team C, the cardiology team. She had a dozen patients. The evening brought five more. She did not feel she had a handle on everyone. At 1 a.m., she did what she had never imagined doing -- she cried. "It's not my fault," she said. "I'm just getting slammed." Not until 5 p.m. did she leave the hospital. She had been on since 7 a.m. the previous day.
She insisted on a real life, and she and her husband took in a movie or a meal out every week. Again and again, she fell asleep before the movie ended. She nodded off at dinner. She subscribed to the New England Journal of Medicine and Annals of Internal Medicine, but the issues piled up unread.
She worked Thanksgiving and had 18 patients at one point. Morose about being on duty, she had a friend cover for her for two hours, not sure if this was even proper, and rushed over to relatives for some semblance of a Thanksgiving dinner.
She was so tired she failed to fulfill a cherished Christmas tradition. She always made about 20 angel tree ornaments for friends and relatives. This year, she did doctor angels, their skirts fashioned from old scrubs. But she made only 10.
Friends remarked that she had lost weight. It was the Intern Diet -- no food.
One morning, after a frantic and food-free night, she began eating a yogurt during rounds. The attending's voice rose in reprimand: "We don't eat on rounds." She threw it away. "I felt like, what's the problem?" she said. "I wasn't going to take it into the patient's room and drop it on him. It really gets me when they take away your basic human rights -- sleep, food, freedom."
It was that forlorn, nether juncture of her internship. The initial excitement had dissipated. The end was not near. It was cold and bleak outside. The hospital seemed to suck not only the energy but the very soul out of you. "I've had this doom and gloom feeling," she said. "I've actually asked myself, 'Have I made the right decision?' "
Her husband noticed that her left eye was drooping, which she ascribed to lack of sleep. Her legs were swollen from standing so much. "It's gotten to the point where I haven't been even flossing my teeth," she said. "I just go home and go to bed. And so my gums started bleeding."
The night before, she had called a medical-school friend and poured out her heart. She told her how she was so tired and not sleeping, and then how she spent the days worrying about not sleeping, which made her even more tired. Her friend, a fatigued intern herself, commiserated as best she could. But she was falling asleep.
 
Life, Death and Managed Care
 On July 1, 1998, Drs. Jennifer James, Edward Lathan and Bryan Holland began their internships at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan, an institution struggling to thrive in the age of managed care. As they started out, filled with medical-school idealism and what they saw as sensibly scaled-down ambition, they found themselves preoccupied by the most concrete things -- finding the bathrooms, finding time to eat, keeping their first patients alive. What they weren't doing was thinking much about commerce and what it might mean for their own medical training. Today: Endless debates over interns' hours . . . trying to learn more at twice the speed . . . and paperwork, paperwork, paperwork.

HEADLINE: Tight Labor Supply Creates Jobs for the Mentally Disabled

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: MADISON, Wis.

 BODY:
A bit fretful about joining the work force, Virginia Andrajewski, 56, turned to a fellow employee on her new job at the Crowne Plaza Hotel and whispered, "Am I doing all right?"
Told she was doing splendidly, Miss Andrajewski, who has mental retardation, broke into a broad smile as she stood behind a laundry table, neatly folding pillowcases into a tall pile. 
 As a flourishing economy exhausts the nation's labor supply, more employers are courting disabled workers like Miss Andrajewski, whose talents were long overlooked.
"I'd like to say we hired Virginia because we're just a good corporate citizen," said Bob King, the general manager at the Crowne Plaza here in the Wisconsin capital, where the unemployment rate is less than 2 percent. "But the truth is, we hired her because she's a good, loyal and dependable worker, and our business needs her."
On the job less than a month, Miss Andrajewski recently earned a wage increase to $6.65 an hour, which surprised and delighted her when she opened her check.
"This is all new to me, but I sure do like it," said Miss Andrajewski, whose warm manner and dry wit have made her popular with colleagues in the hotel laundry. "For a long time, I was just floating along."
Charles Lakin, the director of the Research and Training Center on Community Living in Minneapolis, said, "There has been incredible growth in the number of people with intellectual disabilities going to work for pay."
"We've gone from just getting a job for these people to sitting down and asking them about their career aspirations," he said referring to the center, a government-supported group that studies the integration of people with developmental disabilities in the larger society.
From 1988 to 1996, employment increased more than 300 percent among people served by state mental retardation agencies, Mr. Lakin said. Some 337,000 adults with mental retardation hold jobs, about 17 percent of the more than 2 million Americans of working age who have cognitive disabilities. Of those working, nearly half have jobs in competitive employment, while the others work in jobs subsidized for people with disabilities.
While the severity of developmental disabilities varies widely, Mr. Lakin said, the vast majority of disabled people can work, and almost all of them want to. Despite the increasing movement into the job market, people with developmental disabilities still have a high unemployment rate.
The level of employment is highest among young adults with mental retardation who have left school in the last five years, with about 23 percent holding "competitive," or unsubsidized jobs, according to Arc, an advocacy group for people with mental retardation.
Just last month, President Clinton directed government employers to aggressively recruit workers with disabilities.
And a bill pending in Congress would sharply increase the ranks of disabled workers by allowing them to keep their Social Security health benefits if they take jobs. Fear of losing benefits has been a roadblock to increasing employment among people with disabilities.
The changing fortunes of people with mental disabilities are part of a trend, experts say, reflecting a broader change in societal views of the mentally retarded, especially among younger people who were raised in what are called mainstreamed classrooms, where disabled children learn with other youngsters, and were taught that diversity means more than different races or religions.
The self-image and expectations of the mentally retarded, and their families, have been enhanced in recent years, as advocacy groups for disabled people have become a potent political force.
Notions of the proper role for the mentally retarded were far different when Miss Andrajewski was young. She was kept at home most of her life by her parents, a custom of a time that called for the retarded to be sheltered, but rarely challenged. Moreover, people with retardation were not always welcome in public.
"In those days, if you were retarded, that was that, and there was nothing more to be done," said Miss Andrajewski's older sister, Victoria Peetz, who farms in Prairie du Sac. "My mother simply took care of her. Virginia never used the telephone. She didn't even know how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich."
Now Miss Andrajewski is taking dance lessons, learning to swim and calling relatives on the telephone. She soon will join the choir at St. Bernard's Catholic Church.
"My sister has come alive," Mrs. Peetz said. "It is so wonderful to see."
After her mother died in August, Miss Andrajewski was placed in a home with another woman with mental retardation and a caretaker. Her caseworker referred her to a job broker for people with disabilities, Successful Work Options, which promptly found several employers looking for help.
"Virginia said she wanted to fold clothes, since that's what she did at home," said Doug Quinn-Gruber, a manager at the job broker. "So I called the Crowne Plaza, and they were very receptive."
While more employers are willing to hire disabled people, the unemployment rate remains very high among the nation's adults with mental retardation, said Steven Eidelman, the executive director of Arc.
Some corporations have been recruiting workers with mental retardation for years, including McDonald's and Marriott. Several studies of such workers show they tend to be at least as productive as their fellow workers.
"Employers have finally figured out this isn't charity, it's good business," Mr. Eidelman said.
For all the talk about highly technical jobs, he said, employers desperately need workers willing to complete simple tasks dependably.
"I don't care what company it is," Mr. Eidelman said, "if you show up, you're eager to work and you get along with your co-workers, you're going to keep your job."
People with mental retardation are working as janitors and gardeners, grocery clerks and office receptionists, toll collectors, farm hands and short-order cooks, among many other occupations. In some cases, they are rising to supervisory jobs.
Young people with mental retardation today receive much better education and job training than in earlier times, which makes them more valuable to employers, he said.
But people with disabilities still face barriers. A janitor with mental retardation who worked at Chuck E. Cheese here lost his job recently after a company official visited the restaurant and told the manager to discharge the man, a suit filed against the restaurant says. A group of people with mental retardation, People First, recently held a protest march at the restaurant.
Workers are so hard to find in Madison that the Crowne Plaza pays a $100 bonus to any employee who makes a reference that results in someone's being hired.
A supervisor in the laundry room, Diane Kasuboske, acknowledged that she was initially skeptical when she heard that a woman with mental retardation was going to work in her department.
But then she saw Miss Andrajewski work.
"She did 120 pillowcases today," said Ms. Kasuboske, arching an eyebrow with admiration. "She's a perfectionist. She rubs her fingers across each pillow case, so any hint of wrinkle is gone."
Besides being a good worker, Miss Andrajewski has helped lift worker morale, her colleagues said. Along with being warm and kind, it is clear she cares about her laundry mates, and admires their skills. One recent afternoon at work, she spoke several times about her worry for a co-worker named Jesse, who was absent because his sister was having surgery for cancer that day.
"I wonder how Jesse is doing," she said with a look of concern, shaking her head slowly.
Another day, she turned to a fellow worker and confided, "You know, I've never been so close to so many people."

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Mayor's Harsh Style: Despite Critics, No Plans to Change

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
Verbal combat seems to sustain him. When he is not questioning the motives of various judges, he is dismissing possible successors as unworthy, assailing the integrity of reporters and cutting short citizens who dare to challenge him on his weekly radio program.
As ever, he is the classroom know-it-all, the professional scold, the John Calvin of city government, so much so that caricaturists routinely portray him in an apoplectic state. When people were asked in a recent New York Times/CBS News poll what his name brings to mind, 37 percent said either that Rudolph W. Giuliani was the mayor or the man who cleaned up New York City. But 17 percent answered with one of the following: bad temper, harsh personality, stubborn, dictator. 
 He is also on a losing streak, loudly picking fights in the courts and at the polls that he does not win. On Friday came yet another loss: a federal judge ruled that his administration had improperly retaliated against an AIDS service organization -- known for aggressively protesting the Mayor's policies -- by effectively blocking it from receiving $2.4 million in federal money.
For most politicians, all this would spell trouble. Consultants would suggest a softening around the edges. End news conferences with "Be well," maybe. Wear sweaters that highlight eye color. Adopt a smile that does not look as if it hurts.
But Mr. Giuliani is not like most other politicians. As he closes out his sixth year in office and prepares for a possible run for the Senate next year, his advisers say he has no plans to refine his abrasive tendencies. Naomi Wolf will not be coaching him on becoming a beta male anytime soon.
The aides say there are three basic reasons that the Giuliani-for-Senate camp wants to let Rudy be Rudy. First, one aide explained, "It would be artificial if all of a sudden he became Pat Boone." Second, as the City Hall joke goes, no consultant would dare to suggest that he tap into his feminine side. Finally, there is this: In Mr. Giuliani's case, aggression seems to be a positive thing.
The Times/CBS poll indicates that the Republican mayor's popularity has not suffered as a result of recent battles infused with his caustic style of debate, including his failed attempt to cut public financing to the Brooklyn Museum of Art for an exhibit that he found offensive. Even though the poll indicated that most people disagreed with him on that issue, his favorability rating still had climbed since the last poll, in the spring, while that of his likely opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, fell.
In fact, Mr. Giuliani exudes such self-righteous confidence that he often seems to turn defeat to his advantage. Besides the court drubbing over the museum, he lost a City Charter revision referendum by an overwhelming margin and lost court battles over access to the City Hall steps and the rights of an organizer with antiwhite views to hold a youth rally in Harlem.
Any other politician facing the race of his career would bury these humiliations on his resume. But Mr. Giuliani celebrates them as reflecting the qualities that many people admire in him: unyielding on principles and willing to stand up to racists, deluded liberal judges and elitist museum directors who embrace what he considers smut.
His advisers acknowledge that a race between Mr. Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton would be close and would focus on wooing the small pool of undecided voters.
They also agree that unlike city residents, upstate voters have yet to be exposed to the full force of Mr. Giuliani's personality; his streetwise swagger may not play so well in Herkimer County. For now at least, his television advertisements tend to show a grinning mayor presiding over a glittering city.
There is also the question, with the election still a year away, whether Mr. Giuliani's combative style will eventually wear thin.
"It would make some sense for him politically to temper his personality a little bit over the next year, because it may get tiresome," said Steven Cohen, vice dean of the School of International Public Affairs at Columbia University. "If he has a debate with Hillary Clinton, he needs to chill out a little bit."
Even so, his supporters say, Mr. Giuliani's style is not losing any voters, and in fact may be winning a few.
"You either like him or you don't," said one person close to the mayor. "I've sat in with a lot of consultants, and they tell him: 'You are Rudy Giuliani and this is what brought you to the dance. You have to be what brought you to the dance.' "
And while Democrats may privately hope that he explodes on the public stage someday -- say, during a debate with Mrs. Clinton -- some concede that his style has not alienated voters so far.
"He's in your face, confident, aggressive, and undeviating," said former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat who received Mr. Giuliani's cross-party endorsement during his failed re-election bid in 1994. "Some people will find that disconcerting; some people will find it wearying. But the essential question is whether he's competent to the task. And the elections show that people think he's competent."
Phil Friedman, a consultant to Democrats, agreed. "So far he's proven the pundits wrong," he said. "He's fought with nearly everyone, lost to nearly everyone, been criticized by nearly everyone. And gone up in the polls."
The last few months demonstrate that weight loss and Friday-afternoon golf outings have not softened Mr. Giuliani's assertive, somewhat impolitic ways.
During his weekly radio program, for example, the mayor is often pleasant, helping callers to navigate city bureaucracy. But he rarely shies from opportunities to scold, whether to question the parental skills of a woman whose 18-year-old son -- a robbery suspect -- was shot to death by the police, or to harangue a caller complaining about a pet ferrets ban.
His administration spent much of the summer pushing a referendum proposal to change a city law to prevent the city's public advocate, Mark Green, a liberal Democrat, from succeeding him if he were elected to the Senate in 2000. After criticism that the mayor's hubris, not good government, was behind the plan, the administration dropped the idea from its list of proposals for changing the City Charter.
Still, the administration's approach galvanized the city's unions and Democrats in opposition. On an Election Day with little voter turnout, Mr. Giuliani was handed a rare and embarrassing political loss; his administration's proposals were defeated by a three-to-one margin.
Meanwhile, the mayor was losing several fights over the First Amendment and free speech. His penchant for parting shots at judges prompted the Association of Trial Lawyers for America to complain, "It has become a disturbing trend that a few public officials and candidates try to make political points by unfairly attacking the judiciary and the fair administration of justice."
But the issue that best captured the Giuliani paradox -- of burnishing his reputation by losing in the courts -- centered on the Brooklyn Museum of Art's "Sensation" exhibition, which featured, among other controversial works, a portrait of the Virgin Mary decorated with elephant dung and cutouts from pornographic magazines.
The mayor went all out to oppose the exhibit. He blocked the public financing for the museum, tried to have the museum evicted from the city-owned building and reveled in portraying the exhibit as anti-Catholic and its supporters as ethically suspect.
In a scathing rebuke two weeks ago, a federal judge accused the city of tampering with the First Amendment and ordered it to back off. But by then, the Giuliani campaign had already sent out a fund-raising letter in which the mayor criticized Mrs. Clinton for supporting the museum's right to hold an exhibit that "aggressively attacks the Catholic faith" and includes "pieces glorifying pedophiles."
In fact, his advisers claim to see hidden victory in all these defeats. In the loss over the charter referendum, for example, they say the united effort by unions and Democrats to defeat the Giuliani administration will remind voters of "the bad old days," as one aide put it, of union domination, economic recession and the bloated government of liberal city Democrats.
Democrats say this assessment of the referendum is particularly delusional; they say Mr. Giuliani paid the price for his unrestrained arrogance. But some Democrats agree that the clash over the Brooklyn Museum is another story.
"It's a tossup politically," Mr. Cuomo said. "I disagreed with him. But it's as likely to be good for him as not. The people he offended he didn't have to start with. And the people whose support he earns are some of the upstate Republicans, some of the moderates and the conservatives in an increasingly conservative era."
Myron Magnet, the editor of City Journal, a magazine published by the generally conservative Manhattan Institute, said the museum debate supported the Giuliani-as-crusader theory, one that the mayor has propagated. It holds that he had to be tough to battle the entrenched Democratic machine to restore civility, cut crime and reduce welfare.
"He was taking on a structure that had a lot of things wrong with it," Mr. Magnet said. "Since he has succeeded, it's kind of hard to quibble with the methods that he used. Everybody who stood in his way, everybody who believes that the old ways and old ideas were correct, feels that his combativeness is unjustified, shrewish. But that's because their ox is gored. And this Brooklyn case is a perfect example."
Mr. Giuliani has said he is truly offended by the exhibit, and not motivated by politics. But Mr. Cohen of Columbia said that if that were the case, then some diplomacy would have been in order.
"If he really wanted to affect what was going on at the museum, he could have done so quietly, behind the scenes," Mr. Cohen said. "But he chose to make a public issue out of it."
The professor added, "He's a very smart guy."

Signs of a Trade Pact Between China and U.S.
On the sixth day of difficult talks on China's entry into the World Trade Organization, it appeared that a deal was imminent. Chinese officials told journalists to be ready to witness a possible signing ceremony. No details of the substance of the agreement were available. The talks apparently were given a lift on Saturday when the Americans, led by Charlene Barshefsky, above, the trade representative, and Gene Sperling, a presidential economic adviser, were called for a meeting with Prime Minister Zhu Rongji. A12 

Quake Toll Seems Sure to Rise
The officially announced death toll of 374 from Friday's earthquake seemed sure to rise as hopes of finding more people alive under the rubble faded. Residents of Kaynasli, a town of 15,000 that may have been harder hit than the regional center Duzce, buried 60 of their dead. A12
 
New Effort for Cyprus Peace
The leaders of the sharply divided Greek and Turkish sectors of Cyprus have agreed to begin "substantive" talks next month on reunification of the island, the United Nations announced. But before the end of the day, doubts were briefly cast over the talks when the Turkish Cypriot leader objected to the arrangements. The Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders met two years ago but failed to reach any agreement beyond promising to consider future talks. A16
 
Talks on West Bank Withdrawal
The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, held an unscheduled meeting. With a planned Israeli pullout from more West Bank land one day away, they failed to end a dispute on which areas should be included in the handover, officials said. A8
 
Macedonia Presidential Vote
The Social Democratic Alliance, with Tito Petkovski as its candidate, conceded defeat to Boris Trajkovski's party in the presidential election. Macedonia becomes the first of the countries in the former Yugoslavia to have a president step down and make way for new politicians. A14
 
The traffic volume and the lack of facilities on the Kosovo-Macedonia border are a growing concern for United Nations officials and aid workers who want to feed and shelter thousands of homeless residents of Kosovo this winter. A14
 
Ukraine Incumbent Leads Vote
President Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine was heading for a second term, according to early results that indicated a convincing victory over a Communist who had frightened many voters with his calls to turn back to the Soviet era. A14
 
Afghan Sanctions Take Effect
The sanctions that the United Nations imposed on Afghanistan for refusing to hand over the suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden took effect at midnight. Thousands of protesters in the streets of Kabul shouted "Death to America" and stoned the empty American Embassy. (AP)

DATELINE: BEIJING, Monday, Nov. 15

 BODY:
It appeared that the signing of a landmark international trade agreement was imminent today as Chinese officials told journalists at 2:30 this afternoon to line up outside the Trade Ministry to witness a possible signing ceremony.
No details on the substance of the agreement were yet available. 
 The negotiators had met for five hours this morning on the sixth day in closed-door talks on China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
China's entry into the trading agreement was an important goal for President Clinton as well as the Chinese government, which hopes to accelerate economic modernization.
The negotiations were given a lift on Saturday when the Americans, led by Charlene Barshefsky, the trade representative, and Gene Sperling, a presidential economic adviser, were called to a meeting with Prime Minister Zhu Rongji.
Ms. Barshefsky had publicly threatened to return to Washington, citing a lack of progress in the initial three days.
But after the meeting with Mr. Zhu, who is known here as a leading advocate of free markets and economic change, the two sides plunged back into detailed negotiations on Saturday night. They met again three times on Sunday.
For political and economic reasons, both countries wanted the talks to succeed. But the United States said it would approve China's entry into the global trade organization only if China makes sweeping commitments to cut tariffs and allow wider foreign investment in domestic industries such as telecommunications, banking and securities.
To preserve political support for an agreement at home, President Clinton also needs to keep protections for domestic textile producers, including a gradual phasing out of existing import quotas.
Many Chinese leaders would prefer to introduce foreign competition more gradually, fearing that unemployment could surge in the short run and that cherished state industries might sink.
Another point of contention involves how easily the United States could suspend trading privileges if it suspects Chinese firms are dumping products abroad below cost.
China had hoped to join the World Trade Organization, which sets rules for commerce among its 134 member nations, by the end of this month so that it could take part in a new round of global trade negotiations scheduled to begin Nov. 30 in Seattle.
But first it must complete side agreements with major partners, mainly the United States and the European Union.
The United States and China have engaged in intermittent talks on the trade organization for more than a decade. They came close to agreement in April, when Mr. Zhu offered major concessions in Washington.
But relations between the two countries soured temporarily after American planes bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, last May during the Kosovo conflict, and industries here that feel imperiled by open markets have lobbied for China to dig in against some American demands.
Aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Mr. Clinton said of the negotiations: "It is impossible to predict the outcome. They're still there and they're still talking."

HEADLINE: 'Japanese Only' Policy Takes Body Blow in Court

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 14

 BODY:
After Ana Bortz arrived from Brazil six years ago, she like many foreigners who live here -- grew used to the countless means employed by the Japanese to enforce distinctions between themselves and others.
She endured the bureaucratic devices, like the re-entry permits foreigners need to return to Japan even when they already have a visa, and the fingerprinting that every outsider has to undergo to get a temporary resident's card. 
 She even became inured to the way Japanese avoid sitting next to foreigners on the subway. Or, worse for her, the almost daily stereotyping of Brazilians as criminals in the local press.
But what Ms. Bortz, 35, a reporter for a Brazilian satellite television network, said she had not been prepared for was being escorted out of a jewelry store in Hamamatsu City where she lives, because, as the store's owners stated adamantly, they had a policy of refusing people of her nationality.
So, setting off what may one day be looked back on as the Japanese equivalent of Rosa Parks's defiance of bus segregation in Montgomery, Ala., Ms. Bortz took on the discrimination against foreigners in Japan's courts, and to the surprise of many, not least herself, she won.
"This sort of thing is a very big problem in Japan, but its discussion has remained taboo," Ms. Bortz said. "This country has signed international conventions against discrimination but has never wanted to deal with the subject domestically. For a country that talks about getting a chair on the Security Council, these kinds of attitudes are just shocking."
More than the victory of an individual, the Bortz case is already being seen by many foreigners grappling with the legal system here as an invaluable precedent in their antidiscrimination struggle.
In English, Japan's 1946 Constitution, largely written by American officials during the military occupation, states that "all of the people are equal under the law and there shall be no discrimination in political, economic or social relations because of race, creed, sex, social status or family origin."
In the Japanese version, however, "all of the people" is rendered "kokumin," essentially meaning all Japanese people.
In the absence of Japanese laws covering the treatment of foreigners, the judge in the Bortz case said that the country must abide by its international treaties. In 1996, 31 years after the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination was adopted by the United Nations, Japan finally signed it, becoming the 148th country to do so.
"This was an illegal act against an individual," ruled Tetsuro So, a Shizuoka District Court judge, who cited Japan's treaty obligation last month in awarding Ms. Bortz $47,000 in damages. "Ejecting the plaintiff from the store merely because she was a Brazilian was unfair." Because the judgment was based on international law, it cannot be appealed under Japanese law.
Ms. Bortz's lawyer, Hideyo Ogawa, said: "Frankly speaking this case's influence will be very big. Just as I didn't know of the existence of this treaty beforehand, neither did most other lawyers."
The store owner, Takahisa Suzuki, has not been giving interviews. In court he said that he had asked Ms. Bortz to leave because her behavior was "unnatural." He and his wife also said that fears of crime by Brazilians is justified, and hence does not constitute discrimination.
For years many foreigners living in Japan have suffered silently when landlords denied them housing. They have put up with employment contracts that treat them differently from Japanese, and have been turned away from public establishments like bars, restaurants and hot baths with signs in their windows reading "Japanese Only."
The Bortz case is among a wave of challenges being brought by foreigners who say that if they can do nothing about the famous Japanese standoffishness toward outsiders, they can at least insist on equal treatment before the law.
Cynthia Worthington, an American, has been battling what she says is the disparate treatment of Japanese and foreign faculty members almost from the day she was hired by Kumamoto University as a professor of English in 1993.
Dr. Worthington was hired after responding to a job listing for a full-time position, and was subsequently told that as a foreigner, what she would be given was "special irregular" status.
"We were employed on a year-to-year basis, we were not entitled to prefectural housing, we couldn't join the credit union and we didn't get bonuses," she said. "They were calling us part-time workers, and yet they were giving us full-time responsibilities, in the classroom, on committees and with research. The only difference was that we were foreign."
Three years ago, Dr. Worthington, along with other foreign faculty members, formed a union to pressure the university into offering them the same treatment it accorded its Japanese staff. They went on strike and drew support from the community, eventually earning the attention of a parliamentary labor committee that got the university to back off, at least temporarily, from its efforts to get rid of the troublesome foreigners altogether.
"Foreigners are discriminated against in Japan, period," Dr. Worthington said. "What has changed is that people are trying to do something about it."
In one victory after years of complaints by foreign embassies, Japan will end the fingerprinting of foreign residents next April.
Japan has always stood out as a stubbornly near-monoethnic nation, not only proud of it but also fiercely attached to the idea.
It has the lowest percentages of immigrants and expatriate workers of any advanced industrialized nation -- about 1 percent of the population. Naturalization, even for Koreans who have lived here for generations and fought in wars for Japan, is extremely difficult. On average, fewer than 20 people are legally recognized as refugees each year.
Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, has been one of the rare Japanese voices for change.
"Japanese people are relatively monoethnic," she said in a speech in Tokyo recently, urging her country to consider globalization in terms of cultural openness. "We live under the illusion of one ethnic race, one culture. A monoethnic island of prosperity won't survive in the 21st century."
David Aldwinckle, 34, an American university professor who has lived in Japan for 12 years, has made the notion of bringing multiculturalism to the country something of a personal crusade. Living in the northern city of Sapporo, he has fought discrimination against foreigners for years, organizing quiet protests against hot baths that deny access to non-Japanese, or insisting that he and his Japanese wife be listed in marriage records the same way any Japanese couple would be.
The challenge now for Mr. Aldwinckle is to obtain Japanese citizenship. The process is kept so exclusive that more foreigners are naturalized each week in the United States than in Japan in an entire year. Indeed, rejections are known to occur over something as minor as a speeding ticket.
"I have often sat and wondered why things are this way in Japan," Mr. Aldwinckle said. "There is a real fear and misunderstanding of things that are different. They don't know how to deal with things that are abnormal to them, and they are afraid of what will happen if the differences are allowed to stand."

A front-page article on Monday about discrimination against foreigners in Japan misstated the size of the award to a Brazilian woman who sued a jewelry store that refused to serve her. It was $14,000, not $47,000.
The article also referred incompletely to the university where an American, Cynthia Worthington, says treatment of Japanese and foreign faculty members is unequal. It is Kumamoto Prefectural University, not Kumamoto University.

HEADLINE: Historians Revisit Slaughter on the Plains

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS 

DATELINE: MISSOULA, Mont.

 BODY:
The wanton slaughter of millions of bison in the 19th century by white hide hunters, abetted by a military intent on subjugating Indians, is probably the most famous conservation horror story in United States history.
The problem with this tale, a growing number of scholars and historians say, is that it is not true. As portrayed in a number of controversial new books, the real story of the decline of the buffalo involves a significant change in climate, competition for forage and cattle-borne disease. Another major factor, the authors say, were Indian tribes, empowered by the horse and gun and driven to hunt buffaloes for the profits that came from hides and meat. 
 "What most people don't consider in their 'Dances With Wolves' version of history is that Indians were involved in the market," said Dr. Dan Flores, the A. B. Hammond professor of Western history at the University of Montana. "They were cashing in on buffalo in the 1840's as their principal entree into the market economy, and very few species are able to survive when they become a commodity."
White hunters who killed buffaloes by the millions in the 1870's and 1880's played a major role in the demise, said Dr. Flores, but only as the coup de grace. "The hide hunters are not off the hook," he said. "They share the burden of the final mop-up. But without their involvement, the buffalo would probably have only lasted another 30 years." That is because their numbers had been so greatly reduced by the other factors.
The buffalo studies are part of a continuing debate about the role of Indians in Western history. In "The Ecological Indian" (W. W. Norton, 1999), for example, Shepard Krech III, an anthropologist at Brown University, argues against the romantic image of the Indian as the first environmentalist. When Indians had had the means and the motive, he says, they abused nature for profit.
Dr. Flores, whose work on buffalo has appeared in The Journal of American History and elsewhere, is writing a book on bison under contract with Yale University Press. And Dr. Drew Isenberg, an assistant professor of history at Princeton, has a book called "The Destruction of the Bison: An Environmental History, 1750-1920," which will be published by Cambridge University Press in April.
Not everyone subscribes to the new wave. Dr. Vine Deloria Jr., a professor of history at the University of Colorado at Boulder and a member of the Standing Rock Sioux, finds the revisionism preposterous. "It's nonsense," he said. "The Indians did not make any appreciable dent in buffalo numbers in the Northern Plains. It's anti-Indian stuff."
Indians were involved in the buffalo market, scholars generally agree. Their acquisition of horses and guns made buffalo hunting much easier. As steamboats started plying the Missouri River into the heart of buffalo country in the 1840's, hide hunting by the Kiowa, Blackfeet, Sioux and other Plains tribes soared.
For the first time, there was a way to haul the bulky robes back East, where they became popular as a covering during cold weather travel and for leather goods. Indians found they could trade the robes for firearms, lead balls, gunpowder, blankets, textiles, pots and pans and whiskey.
Dr. Isenberg estimates that before the 1840's, 60,000 Plains Indians were killing half a million bison a year for sustenance. After the robe trade began in the 1840's, that total went over 600,000 a year, "clearly into unsustainable range," he said.
While white hunters killed more buffaloes (their total throughout the West is estimated at four million), Dr. Flores argues that Indians concentrated their killing on buffalo cows, which had more tender meat and were much easier to skin and treat, resulting in severe damage to the herds' reproductive capacity.
Environmental factors play large roles in newer histories of the West. For example, Dr. Flores says that the study of tree rings, or dendrochronology, suggests that Indians were so effective in decimating the buffalo because climate had already weakened and diminished the herds.
From the 1500's to the mid-19th century, a period known as the little ice age, tree rings show that the climate in the West was much colder than normal. That favored the grasses buffaloes eat, and they flourished. When a long, widespread drought ended the little ice age in the mid-1800's, the grasses changed and the bison population crashed just as the tribes began market hunting.
At the same time, Dr. Flores said, buffaloes began having to compete for forage with horses that were brought by the Spaniards to North America in the 1500's and later went feral. By the 1800's, Dr. Flores estimates, two million horses were sharing the range with the buffalo.
Dr. Flores and the others also differ from their predecessors in their use of Indian sources. Many bands of Indians, for example, kept a record of events, often symbols painted on bison robes. The Northern Plains tribes kept winter counts of buffaloes on buffalo hides, while the Kiowa, in the south, kept calendars. "The symbol for 'many buffalo,' a circle with a dot in the middle, appears numerous times from 1800 to 1840 in the Kiowa calendars," Dr. Flores said. "But after 1840 it appears only once."
Such counts are crucial to the debate over who or what killed off the bison, but all sides agree that estimates are a tricky business.
In the past, historians estimated bison numbers at 40 million to 60 million, sometimes as many as 75 million. But Dr. Flores has tried to calculate how many buffaloes the range could support by analyzing 1910 census data on cattle, and has concluded that in good years the range could hold only 20 million to 24 million. After the little ice age, at the time of the Civil War, buffalo numbers may have been as low as 10 million to 12 million, he said.
But his calculations have been criticized by Dr. Deloria, who says that comparing fenced-in livestock with free-roaming buffaloes is an inappropriate comparison.
Dr. Calvin Luther Martin, who taught history at Rutgers and lived with Eskimos for two years on the Alaskan tundra, also disagrees. Dr. Martin, the author of a new book on Indian life, "The Way of the Human Being" (Yale University Press), argues that to judge Indians by contemporary environmental standards "is patent foolishness."
The Indians were caught between two worlds and two realities, Dr. Martin said. "They don't translate into each other," he said, adding that Indians had no concept of being wasteful.
And the claim that competition with horses would have affected the buffalo has also been criticized by Dr. Valerius Geist, an ecologist who is an emeritus professor of environmental science at the University of Calgary in Alberta. Dr. Geist, author of "Buffalo Nation: The History and Legend of the North American Bison," (Voyageur Press) noted that bison had evolved on the prairie with other large mammals. "Flores is a historian playing ecologist," Dr. Geist said.
Finally, the new bison scholarship also casts doubt on another major tenet of buffalo history: that the destruction of the herds was a conspiracy between the United States Army and hide hunters who did the killing.
"I don't think there was a conspiracy by any means," Dr. Isenberg said. "The army was happy to see hide hunters, but they were not commanding them to kill bison."
Dr. Flores traces the notion of a conspiracy to the memoir of a Texas buffalo hunter named John R. Cook, called "The Border and the Buffalo." According to the book, the Gen. Philip H. Sheridan, the Indian fighter, urged the Texas Legislature not to pass a law that would protect the buffaloes remaining there and instead to create a bronze medal for the hunters "with a dead buffalo on one side and a discouraged Indian on the other."
Dr. Flores said he had found no record of General Sheridan's speech to the Legislature and believed it was apocryphal. The notion of a conspiracy, he said, has become fact through repetition.
Dr. Flores said he had recently discovered letters in which General Sheridan wrote that he was concerned about the demise of the buffalo. After hearing in October 1879 about the killing of thousands of buffaloes by hide hunters near Miles City, Mont., General Sheridan sent a telegram to Washington, saying, "I consider it important that this wholesale slaughter of the buffalo should be stopped."
Dr. Isenberg denies that the new work on the buffalo is anti-Indian.
"It's romantic to imagine Indians as always living in harmony with nature," he said. "But they are people who did many things right and who also made mistakes. If you want to see them as a real people and not a romantic notion, then you have to look with a clear eye at these kinds of things. None of us have any animus toward Indians."

HEADLINE: ARTS ABROAD: An American Dares to Film Islam's Story;
Making a PBS Series in Iran, a U.S. Crew Breaches the 'Wall of Distrust'

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: BAFGH, Iran

 BODY:
As an Emmy-winning documentary film director, Rob Gardner has called "Cut!" in many far-flung locations, from Egypt to Antarctica. But none of his previous ventures have called for quite the tact and daring required for his current project, as the first American filmmaker to be allowed to work in Iran since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
Coming to Iran is only the half of it. In a country where Islamic hard-liners still gather to shout "Death to America!" on major anniversaries of the revolution, Mr. Gardner has chosen the one topic that oddsmakers in Iran and elsewhere might think most likely to detonate in an American filmmaker's hands: the history of Islam as a faith, a culture and a civilization, with pivotal sequences in the story re-enacted by a cast of 150 Iranian actors and extras. 
In this desert town 350 miles southeast of Tehran, Mr. Gardner, 53, has gone a step farther. For a three-part series titled "Islam: Empire of Faith" that is on the PBS schedule for next fall, he has been filming sequences that involve the life and death of Muhammad, the Muslim prophet, a subject so sensitive that the merest hint of a slight, however unintentional, could sink the project in a moment.
In Bafgh, as in five other Iranian towns where Mr. Gardner has filmed, power still resides with the mullahs, or Muslim clerics, men with a network of eyes and ears to scan for any hint of apostasy. Although much in Iran is changing under a reform movement headed by Muhummad Khatami, a Muslim cleric who was elected president in 1997 on a pledge to curb the clergy's powers, almost every day brings word of some new miscreant's arrest on allegations of "insulting Islam."
If this suggests that Mr. Gardner and his American crew have to operate in a climate of rigid conformity, the reality is otherwise. About the only stifling thing on the set in Bafgh has been the heat, which was pushing toward 100 degrees on a recent morning as the Iranian cast recreated the scenes in A.D. 632, when word of the prophet's death in Mecca reached his distraught followers in Medina, a Muslim holy city in what is now Saudi Arabia.
In Medina, Muhammad raised the army that conquered Mecca, setting the stage for the rapid sweep by Arab armies that eventually carried Islam across Arabia, westward through North Africa, Sicily and Spain, and north and east as far as modern Turkey, Iran and Central Asia. The PBS series will begin with the life of Muhammad and end with the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, the 16th-century Ottoman emperor whose era many historians regard as one of the most glorious in the Islamic story.
For hours, Mr. Gardner, shielded from heat and dust by a flowing turban, shot and reshot the mourning scenes in an old caravanserai, a mud-walled structure once used as a staging post by camel trains crossing the desert. With women in flowing robes and face masks wailing in a recess, a small army of ferocious-looking men, in white robes and turbans, each with a luxuriant beard and mustache, waved curved swords in the air in a trance-like dance of grief.
During breaks, Americans and Iranians alike relaxed and chatted over glasses of sugary tea and Coca-Cola, still available here after 20 years of American economic boycotts. With the atmosphere more like that of a party than a film set, Mr. Gardner chuckled at a visitor's suggestion that the entire project, involving more than 40 days of filming in Iran, was the filmmaker's equivalent of a high-wire act -- exhilarating, but poised at the brink of disaster.
"In 30 years of filming, I've never experienced the same degree of simpatico," said Mr. Gardner, who is based in Baltimore. "The more connected we've become with the people here, the higher the comfort level has become. We haven't had a single problem with the mullahs; in fact, they've leant over backward to help us out. I think they've concluded that we can help carry the message of Islam to the world, and as long as we are doing it in a way that's sensitive to their beliefs, they're happy."
He added, "If that seems strange to Americans, I guess it's because, psychologically, we are forever referencing the hostage crisis of 1979," the seizure of the United States Embassy in Tehran in the early months of the revolution, and the 444 days of captivity for American diplomats that ensued. "In the American consciousness, it was the worst thing the Iranians could have done. But to make this project work, all of us on this project have had to get past it, and we have."
When they came to Iran last fall to scout locations, Mr. Gardner and his wife, Char, 53, an assistant producer on the $1.5 million project, were struck by the fact that filming costs in Iran, lowered by the Iranian rial's steep devaluation against the dollar since 1979, were lower than in Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Israel and Turkey, other countries they considered. The abundance of eye-catching Iranian locations -- desert sand dunes, waving palm trees, blue-tiled mosques -- was another attraction.
But the couple were also impressed by the talent in the Iranian film industry, which, like other creative endeavors, has had greater latitude -- not yet free of Islamic strictures, but far more so than before -- since President Khatami's election. American moviegoers have already had a taste of the new Iranian cinema from feature films like "The Children of Heaven," Majid Majidi's story of a brother and a sister struggling to survive poverty, which was among the nominees for best foreign film at this year's Oscar presentations.
Getting approval to film from the Ministry of Islamic Guidance and Culture -- despite its forbidding name, a stronghold of Mr. Khatami's reformers -- was simple. Morteza Shayesteh, the project's Iranian co-producer, said officials had issued a film permit without seeing a script.
"They asked my opinion, I told them it would offer a positive view of Islam, and they took my word," he said. "These days, there aren't official prescriptions for filmmakers anymore. It's up to us -- we have to decide what we can do, and also what we can't do."
But the Gardners faced more serious obstacles in Washington. Under American sanctions, imposed at the time of the embassy seizure and reinforced later to punish Iran for its alleged support of international terrorism, the filmmakers needed a Treasury Department exemption to bring computerized American filmmaking equipment to Iran and to pay Iranian costs. The exemption was granted only after after Mr. Gardner enlisted the support of Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland. "The initial reaction was, 'Hey, Iran's a terrorist state, you can't film there,' " he said.
Among Iranians working with the Americans, there is delight at what they see as a major breach in what President Khatami has called "the wall of mistrust" between the two countries. Majid Mir-Fakhraei, 48, the art director, has been crucial to the project's success, finding remote locations, designing a credible seventh-century wardrobe for the actors, recruiting stuntmen to ride horses and camels in battle scenes and hiring 40 Bedouin men and women from Iran's only Arab-majority province, Khuzhestan.
But Mr. Mir-Fakhraei said Iran was the real winner. "We have been waiting a very long time for this," he said, looking like an American filmmaker in jeans, sleeveless jerkin and baseball cap. "It's very important for us to work with Americans, because in my thinking the cinema belongs to them. We are learning so much -- about their new camera systems, their techniques, their working attitudes -- that will make our cinema so much stronger in the future."
Among the uniformed police officers and local government officials gathered near the set, the view was similar. But the most joyous endorsements came from extras and stuntmen who enveloped a visitor during a filming break.
"Very good, very good," a beaming Zabihpour Zabiholam, who specializes in camel riding, said in English. Switching to Persian, he said that Iranians longed for what President Khatami calls "a dialogue" with America. "A dialogue is what we want," Mr. Zabiholam said, "and inshallah" -- an Arabic word meaning "with God's grace" -- "we will have it."

HEADLINE: Union Leaders Seek Unconditional Salary Raises

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
In their first joint statement regarding next year's contract talks, the leaders of New York City's municipal unions said yesterday that they wanted the city to give their nearly 300,000 members a wage increase significantly higher than the inflation rate.
The leaders, who included the heads of the teachers, police and firefighters unions, insisted that this pay increase should be independent of any improvements in productivity that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has said must offset raises. 
 At a news conference in City Hall Park, leaders of the Municipal Labor Committee, a coalition of 75 unions, issued what they called a compact in which they pledged to share bargaining strategies and present a common front in negotiations for contracts that begin next year, even though many unions plan to negotiate individually with the city.
Deputy Mayor Randy Levine, the mayor's chief of labor negotiations, said the unions did not seem serious about negotiating with the Giuliani administration because they have not presented formal proposals. He has predicted the unions will delay negotiations a year or two, until there is a new mayor, who the unions expected would be more generous.
The presidents of several unions said they would present the city with formal proposals early next year, after determining their members' top negotiating concerns. .
In their compact, the union leaders said their primary negotiating goal was that "our members, whose sacrifices have helped produce repeated surpluses in the city budget and whose work has driven the city's recovery, receive a substantial increase in real wages."
But Mr. Levine said the mayor would grant raises only if they were offset by increases in productivity.
The labor leaders said they would take a new approach in which many unions would bargain individually, instead of all unions accepting whatever wage increase was negotiated by the first union to reach a contract.
Mr. Levine said the city would not agree to the new approach, partly because it would be difficult to persuade one union to accept smaller pay increases than another union.

HEADLINE: Former Agent's New Clients: Companies Seeking Web Sites

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
The vortex of investment banking and entertainment has interested Mark Patricof for a long time, ever since he came to the conclusion after graduating from film school that he did not have the talent to make major movies himself.
After stints at Premiere magazine and Creative Artists Agency, Mr. Patricof is now working in development, but his agenda now is the digital setup and expansion of Internet sites for businesses ranging from retailers like Bluefly.com to publications seeking an online audience, like Variety. 
 Many of the Web sites are developed with entrepreneurs, who combine their ideas with Mr. Patricof's technological and marketing prowess.
Last week, his company, kpe, announced that it had raised $21.5 million in venture capital that it plans to use to increase the size of its offices in New York, London and Los Angeles. Mr. Patricof's comany is far from the only player in the field, called venture incubation. The best known companies are Idealab, founded by Bill Gross, and Ecompanies, founded by Jake Weinbaum.
"In incubators, the idea is to share more resources across the incubatees, and there tends to be one or two high-profile visionaries associated with them," said Ross Rubin, a vice president for research development at Jupiter Communications Inc.
Venture incubation is meant to match resources -- from marketing to order fulfillment -- with ideas that show some promise. In the case of Bluefly.com, the company's chief executive thought an electronic outlet mall dedicated to clothing would be as attractive to shoppers as its bricks-and-mortar counterparts tend to be. The company posted sales of $8.6 million last year, a year after going public.
"We loved the culture," said Mark Utay, a managing partner with Clarion Capital Partners, part of the investor group that is supplying kpe with capital. "The esprit de corps there is terrific, and the energy level there is just terrific."
In addition to developing sites for other companies, kpe is developing its own sites. One of them, Goodstory.com, is intended to be a place where writers can shop their work to Hollywood producers and agents for $25 to $50 a project. The proposals go into a database and copyrights will be protected, Mr. Patricof said.
Whether it will appeal to the creative community remains to be seen, but it seems to have appealed to investors.
"It's representative of how you can create interesting businesses out of whole cloth in this space, if you understand the community you are addressing," Mr. Utay said.

HEADLINE: Arts Coverage Falls Behind A Cultural Boom, Study Says

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
While a flush economy has fueled an artistic boom around the country, arts coverage in local newspapers has often failed to keep pace with the new range of art exhibitions, symphony performances, film festivals, dance troupes and television shows, a new study has found.
In addition, cultural listings, as opposed to reviews and articles, consume an increasing portion of space devoted to the arts. These findings are offered in a new report by the National Arts Journalism program at Columbia University's School of Journalism. The report, including a study of coverage in 15 newspapers as well as on network television, presents a nuanced picture that also counters the idea that cultural coverage overwhelmingly favors Madonna over Mozart. 
 It confirms the dominance of movie coverage, however, with film reviews taking up a third of the space devoted to culture in the newspapers surveyed. Visual arts, architecture, dance and radio get "only cursory coverage," the report added, while television, music and books anchor arts pages. Blockbuster museum exhibitions and the opening of cultural venues tend to be well covered, as are prominent cultural institutions like the symphony orchestras in Cleveland and Philadelphia.
The 125-page survey, called "Reporting the Arts," is designed in part as a baseline study on the issue, said Michael Janeway, who was project director of the survey with Andras Szanto. Mr. Janeway was struck by the extent to which listings dominate arts space, particularly because they are the kind of coverage most easily duplicated by online competitors.
"If 50 percent of what they are doing is listings, what does that also say about how much they have thought through what they are doing," he said of arts editors. "That is a lot of ink and paper, and maybe it is what you want to do, but it's not journalism. Maybe they ought to be defining what their journalistic role is."
Where the arts sector is changing rapidly, arts coverage often fails to keep pace, the report says. It quoted Jack Major, the managing editor for features at The Providence Journal in Rhode Island, who told the report's authors, "We have more than doubled our staff in 30 years, while the number of Providence's arts organizations has increased at a much greater rate."
The report said that this gap was a result of competition for resources, with newspaper editors often devoting more reporters and more space to sports or business coverage. It cited coverage by The Charlotte Observer in North Carolina, where "despite phenomenal growth in almost every area of the arts, as well as surveys that show readers spend as much money on arts and entertainment offerings as sports, the arts staff has not increased," although new positions were created in sports to cover new professional sports teams.
Frank Barrows, the managing editor of The Charlotte Observer, told the Columbia researchers: "If I had the resources, I would have an arts section every day. But we don't have those kinds of resources. When you can't do broad-stroke coverage every day, you try to aggregate it for maximum impact."
The report focused on the arts coverage in the 15 newspapers in October 1998, trying to measure its sheer bulk and the way that popular culture, including movies, television and rock music, was treated in comparison with the visual arts or classical music. The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times were left out of the study because "arguably, New York and Los Angeles constitute their own arts and entertainment universes," the report said.
Of the newspapers surveyed, The Cleveland Plain Dealer and The Philadelphia Inquirer provided the most extensive music coverage -- classical music in The Inquirer's case and classical and rock in Cleveland, home of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum.
The Chicago Tribune and The San Francisco Chronicle were singled out among the surveyed newspapers for the broad extent of their coverage. "The Tribune leads all newspapers in the study in coverage of performing arts," the report said. Its average of eight daily cultural reviews was higher than any other newspaper in the study.
The Tribune is shifting its emphasis, Tim Bannon, editor of the arts and entertainment section, told the study's authors. The section's Sunday issue has changed, he said. "It used to be geared more toward the arts aficionado. Now it is geared more toward entertainment."
Television networks, the report said, cover the arts on morning programs like NBC's "Today" show. "Broadly defined, the arts-and-culture beat is an indispensable staple of network television's morning journalism," the report said. Evening network news programs devoted less than 1 percent of their time to the arts that October.

HEADLINE: Vastogirardi Journal;
Blissful Bachelorhood and the Shrinking Village

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: VASTOGIRARDI, Italy

 BODY:
At the Bar Sport, the cafe that serves as this village's bachelor clubhouse, a government notice promising financial aid to families with children is posted on the wall -- more as an inside joke than as a community news bulletin.
Mario Di Benedetto, 40, the unmarried cafe owner, nudged Orazio Izzi, 46, a regular, and said: "What about him? He's been engaged to the same woman for 22 years." Both men are confirmed bachelors, and they are targets of the new mayor's war on singles. 
 Aghast at the number of adult men and women who show no desire to marry or have children -- 50 men and 20 women in a village of 823 people -- Mayor Vincenzo Venditti has threatened to levy a tax on unmarried people.
"This is a real problem, a serious problem," he said earnestly as a group of single men grinned sheepishly behind him. "We risk losing everything, our culture, our traditions, our schools. It is useless to ask for economic investment if we cannot keep our village alive to use it."
Vastogirardi, a small village in the hills of Molise, a region in southern Italy, is in many ways typical of rural areas throughout Europe, where migration from small towns and falling birthrates are producing a devastating demographic shift. The population of Vastogirardi, known for its delicate hand-made cheeses, has shrunk by two-thirds in the last 30 years as younger people defected to better jobs and bigger towns. The only bank closed down years ago, there is no movie theater, two of four churches have closed, and the local priest commutes from a town 12 miles away.
"So far this year, I have performed only two weddings, and six funerals," said the priest, Father Erasmo. "Nobody seems to idealize the family anymore."
Last year, only one baby was born in Vastogirardi.
Birthrates are low all over Western Europe, but Italy and Spain, Roman Catholic countries, have the lowest of all: an average of 1.2 children per woman, slightly lower than in Greece and considerably lower than the 2.1 rate in the United States.
There are objective reasons why Italy's birthrate is so low: State aid to families with children is lower in Italy than in France or Germany. There are also cultural differences; studies show that in Italy women who work outside the home still bear the brunt of domestic chores.
Marzio Barbagli, a sociologist at the University of Bologna, said Italian men had not yet adjusted their expectations to accommodate working wives. "If women work at the office and also do everything in the home, something has to give, and that tends to be a second child," he said.
But sociologists are puzzled by a phenomenon that in Italy seems to unite two clashing impulses: a new generation's yearning for sexual freedom, and financial independence, mixed with a reliance on parents for housing, food and doting companionship. Scholars have written entire books on "mammoni," Italian sons who are so dependent on their mothers for care and pampering that they never leave home.
"Maybe it is my fault," Ada Marracino, 70, said as she readied lunch for her husband and two children, a son and daughter who are both in their mid-40's, unmarried and living at home. "These children just don't count the years."
Her husband, Alfredo, smiled sadly. "It used to be the kids who would look after the old people," he said. "Around here, it is the reverse."
Their daughter, Vincenza, 43, is the village pharmacist. She studied in Rome, then decided to return to her village 16 years ago, where the family lives in a narrow apartment inside a crumbling 1,000-year-old fortified stone hamlet above the village. Only one other family lives there year round.
"I resented the way big cities eat up your time," she explained. "Here, I have time even to be bored." She said she felt no social or family pressure to wed. "I don't feel I have to get married, just to be married," she said firmly, adding, "Though lately, I have been thinking more about having children someday."
Changes in social mores throughout the West are felt even in remote Vastogirardi. There is little stigma left to premarital sex, or spinsterhood, though divorce is still considered mildly scandalous. The mayor would be delighted if some women chose single motherhood, but few have.
The disproportion between single men and single women, moreover, is attributed to the environment. Numbingly boring for many women, Vastogirardi is in many ways a bachelor's paradise: it offers hunting, fishing, a soccer field, wine-making and a clubby cafe. Some of the same married men who lecture their single friends on the need to settle down, at times sound ready to trade places.
"I would love to be free to stay out late, play music with my friends and go hunting," Filippo D'Aloiso, a city council member, said wistfully as he sat in the dining room of Mr. Izzi's camping ground, sampling the home-made pasta, made by the mother of another local bachelor. "But I have a child. I have to make sacrifices."
Mayor Venditti figures that unless something dramatic is done to increase birthrates quickly, the village nursery school will have to close. To give locals work, he wants to start a cooperative dairy and export local cheeses. "The town can provide the cows and the fields," he said, "but I cannot produce the babies."
Already there are not enough children to fill the elementary school: first and third grades are taught together, as are fourth and fifth graders.
There is no middle or high school. Mr. Venditti, who actually lives in Isernia, a town 21 miles away, so his teen-age children will not have to take a bus to school, concedes that his tax on singles will probably be ruled unconstitutional, but he said he had to serve notice to the town, and the world at large.
"You are 20 years too late," Stella Scocchera, scolded him furiously. Mrs. Scocchera, who has taught kindergarten since 1976, is convinced that she will be out of a job within two years. She blames residents who have taken the easy route and left.
"You are looking at the last kindergarten class of Vastogirardi," she said.
"Even if some of these oafs do get married," she added, pulling at Mr. Izzi's sleeve. "They will never have enough children to make up a real kindergarten. You can't do a ring-around-the-roses with only two kids."

HEADLINE: A 0.4% Jump In Inventories For September

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
The nation's businesses stockpiled goods in September at the fastest pace in six months, led by wholesalers counting on increased holiday sales, Commerce Department figures showed today.
Inventories rose four-tenths of a percent in September after a three-tenths of a percent increase in August. Business sales fell for the first time since January, dropping two-tenths of a percent in September after a 1.2 percent gain in August. 
 Expectations for a "resurgence in consumer spending for the Christmas season" were behind the increase in wholesaler inventories, said Hai Hoang, an economist at Banc of America Securities in San Francisco.
Businesses are also increasing inventories in anticipation of possible Year 2000 disruptions, said Christopher Low, an economist at First Tennessee Capital Markets in New York.
As early as August, companies were stockpiling toys and clothing from China, which sent a record amount of goods to the United States that month. Wholesale inventories, which account for about one-third of total business stockpiles, increased seven-tenths of a percent in September after rising half a percent in August.
The September inventory figures and other recent statistics "suggest that third-quarter G.D.P. will be revised upward to about 5.1 percent," from an initial estimate of a 4.8 percent annual rate, said Ray Stone, managing director of Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J.
The government reported last week that retail sales in October were 8.5 percent higher than in the month a year earlier. Businesses are still "surprised by the strength" of consumer demand, Mr. Low said. That strength is keeping inventories lean.
The inventory-to-sales ratio, which measures the time goods sit at businesses, stayed at 1.33 months during September, the lowest since the government started compiling the data in 1980.

HEADLINE: Coca-Cola Bottler Discusses Its Price Increase

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
Insisting that there had been no fundamental shift in strategy, the Coca-Cola Company's largest bottler told investors and money managers in a rare conference call yesterday that its decision to raise retail prices earlier this year should improve the company's cash flow and profitability despite a drop in volume.
The increases in the United States and Canada by the bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, were followed in recent weeks by an increase in concentrate prices by Coca-Cola. Both companies have said that a marketing campaign by Coca-Cola is supposed to persuade consumers to pay more for Coke products after years of low prices brought on by a price war with its rival, PepsiCo, and the emergence of private-label soft drinks. 
 The changes confused many on Wall Street, who had been accustomed to using volume as the chief measure of success at both companies. Share prices for Coke and its bottlers, and at other soft-drink makers, have fallen sharply this year.
"The interdependence between the Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola Enterprises is firmly established," said Henry A. Schimberg, the bottler's chief executive, who is set to retire at the end of next month. "C.C.E. can't be successful at the expense of Coca-Cola, and conversely, Coca-Cola can't be successful at the expense of C.C.E."
Mr. Schimberg added that although volume was flat for the year, decreases in capital spending have helped create an additional $200 million in cash flow, which will be used to buy back stock. The company is reducing its investment in cars, trucks and fillers, said the bottler's chief operating officer, John R. Alm.
Mr. Schimberg also indicated that prices would rise at the same rate as inflation over the next several years. "We'll continue to move pricing forward in a rational manner," he said. Earnings improvement is expected to come from more purchases made in the highly profitable "cold-drink" segment of the soft-drink market, which includes vending machines. For the year, sales in supermarkets have fallen 6 percent, Mr. Alm said, while cold-drink sales have risen at a double-digit rate.
Analysts seemed mostly reassured after the conference call, although several said only time would tell whether the Coca-Cola strategy was effective. "It's still going to be, show us the volume," said Caroline Levy, a beverage analyst for Schroder & Company.

HEADLINE: Game Shows Thrive on 'New' Greed

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "A Million Reasons the TV Quiz Show Has Struck It Rich" (front page, Nov. 14): 
 The reason behind the current revival of television shows like "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" or the bluntly named "Greed" is primarily economic. The booming economy has made the success of these shows possible.
At the heart of all shows of this genre, from "Jeopardy" to "Wheel of Fortune," is the lure of "filthy lucre."
In the 1960's, 70's and 80's, with all the social unrest, inflation, rising inequality, staggering budget deficits and high unemployment, this aura of greed offended the general sensibilities.
But now, as in the 1950's, life is good again -- unemployment is low, inflation is nonexistent and no one minds when someone makes half a million dollars answering some inane question about the Duke of Wessex.

Crude Oil Closes Above $25, The Highest Level in 3 Years

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The price of crude oil rose above $25 a barrel yesterday, the highest level in almost three years, amid expectations that rising demand, outstripping production, would eliminate a global surplus.
Many members of OPEC favor keeping oil output low after their current production agreement expires in March, said Obeid bin Saif al-Nasiri, oil minister of the United Arab Emirates. Prices have more than doubled this year as inventories have dwindled, and analysts said that further rises were likely to occur during the cold-weather months, when demand is greatest. 
 OPEC will have to increase production "so that prices don't get out of sight," said Marianne Kah, chief oil economist at Conoco, the nation's fifth-largest oil company. "Otherwise, it will choke off demand, start production in non-OPEC countries, and companies like us will start spending money to find more oil."
In New York, crude oil for December delivery rose 22 cents yesterday, to $25.13 a barrel, the highest closing price for a contract closest to expiration since January 1997.
In London, crude oil for December settlement rose 41 cents, to $25 a barrel, on the International Petroleum Exchange, the highest there since October 1996. The December contract expired yesterday. The January futures contract rose 24 cents, to $24.36 a barrel.
Oil prices rallied this year as 10 of the 11 OPEC members led efforts to reduce output by five million barrels a day, or about 7 percent of total supply. The cuts were intended to eliminate surpluses.
But the Center for Global Energy Studies, a research institute in London, warned in a report yesterday that Brent crude oil for immediate delivery could soar to an average price of $35 a barrel in the fourth quarter of 2000, from $22.60 so far this quarter, if OPEC production was not increased.
A "failure to increase output would rapidly push the oil market into a dangerously unstable situation," the report said. Still, the oil ministers of Iran, Qatar, Venezuela, Kuwait and Algeria all said this month that OPEC might maintain production cuts after March.
Unseasonably cool American weather is igniting a rally in heating oil prices. Demand is expected to be 22 percent above normal through this Friday in the Northeast, the region that uses the largest share of the nation's heating oil, according to Weather Derivatives of Belton, Mo. Heating oil for December delivery rose 0.32 cent yesterday, to 66.54 cents a gallon, the highest since January 1997. Prices are up 16 percent this month.

HEADLINE: THE TRADE DEAL: THE POLITICS;
Agreement Presents a Split for Republicans in Presidential Race

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
The Clinton administration's agreement to support China's membership in the World Trade Organization today laid bare the deep divisions among Republican candidates for president on the nature of relations between the United States and China.
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Senator John McCain of Arizona gave qualified endorsements of the trade deal, saying that bringing China into the global trading scheme would help moderate its economic and political behavior. 
 But the more conservative candidates for the Republican presidential nomination condemned it, accusing the administration of ignoring gross human rights violations in its eagerness to expand commerce with China.
The two Democratic candidates, Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley, applauded the trade agreement, although aides said that Mr. Bradley would reserve final judgment until he had a chance to study its terms. Both candidates are seeking a way to embrace free trade with China while not alienating important Democratic constituencies -- including organized labor and some human rights advocates -- who oppose it.
The initial reaction signals that the coming political battles on China and trade will take place largely within the major political parties, rather than between them.
"The more heated debate will be within the Republican Party," said Gary Bauer, a Republican presidential candidate and vehement opponent of the trade deal. "There will be a Reagan wing making my argument, and the trade wing -- the Bush wing -- unfortunately siding with Clinton and Gore on this."
Mr. Bush said in a statement that he has consistently supported membership of China in the World Trading Organization, a position also advocated by his father, former President Bush.
"I welcome news of an agreement that will open China's markets to American products and help introduce American values into China," Governor Bush said. "The agreement should give American farmers, ranchers and businesses access to China's growing market, and help introduce American values along with American products. An agreement with China should also open the door for Taiwan's admission to the W.T.O., which is long overdue."
Mr. Bauer's view, which is largely shared by his fellow conservative candidates, Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes, is that China's record on trade, human rights, weapons proliferation and threats to Taiwan has worsened in recent years. He said the administration should have sought significant changes in the way Beijing does business before agreeing to sponsor its membership in the trade organization.
Mr. Forbes, a millionaire magazine publisher who is largely financing his own campaign, said last week in a speech on China policy that he strongly opposes allowing China to join the global trade group.
"Let me be clear," Mr. Forbes said in an address at the Nixon Library in Yorba Linda, Calif.: "Yes to Taiwan in the W.T.O. No to China. Beijing hasn't earned it, and we shouldn't give it. Period. It is time for our government to reward freedom and democracy -- not force and demagoguery -- and let us never forget it."
Mr. Bradley did not directly address the China trade agreement today. But an aide said that Mr. Bradley supports China's membership in the trade group as long as it has to meet the same legal and economic requirements as any other nation.
"Senator Bradley believes it is better to have China inside W.T.O. subject to universal rules rather than outside cutting unilateral deals," said Kristin Ludecke, a spokeswoman for him.
Mr. Gore supports the administration's position on trade with China, but he is also trying to finesse the issue because of the fervent opposition of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has endorsed his presidential bid.
John Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, criticized the agreement as a "grave mistake" and accused the administration of being "disgustingly hypocritical" in claiming that trade deals help to moderate Chinese behavior.
A spokesman for Mr. Gore, Christopher Lehane, said in response to Mr. Sweeney's criticism, "Al Gore has made absolutely clear -- as he did at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention last month -- that all future trade agreements he would negotiate as president would include labor, environmental and human rights agreements as part, and they would be enforceable."
Patrick J. Buchanan, who is seeking the Reform Party's presidential nomination, has long opposed what he considers one-sided trade deals that hurt American workers.
"This is the latest administration capitulation to Beijing at the expense of working American families and for the benefit of transnational corporations," Mr. Buchanan said in a statement. "It is a cave-in, pure and simple, to a regime that even today persecutes religious minorities and aims nuclear rockets at the United States of America. I will fight it with everything I have right through to November 2000."

HEADLINE: THE TRADE DEAL: BEIJING;
Reformers' Comeback: New Power Against Opponents of Open Markets

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Although the immediate effects of China's landmark trade agreement with the United States may be mixed, the deal is a major victory for Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, an advocate of reform who has been under fire from conservative opponents in recent months.
When he took office in March 1998, Mr. Zhu promised to close the bulk of China's nonperforming state-run industries in three years. Those efforts, however, have been stymied by his rivals, and Mr. Zhu was hurt by President Clinton's rejection of trade concessions last April and then by the wave of nationalism fired by NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia. 
 Now, Mr. Zhu has a new quiver of arrows for his campaign. After China enters the World Trade Organization, he and other reformers will be able to use international guidelines to challenge officials suspicious of openness and market-based competition.
Since the trade deal fell apart in April, Mr. Zhu's influence had been in decline as he faced criticism that he tried to give too much away. Under attack by conservatives led by his predecessor, Li Peng, who is now legislative chief, Mr. Zhu offered to resign twice last spring, political insiders said. Yet President Jiang Zemin, who political analysts believe uses Mr. Zhu as a lightning rod for criticism, has both assumed more control over reform efforts himself and protected Mr. Zhu.
The trade deal is expected to breathe new life into the reform effort. Over all, several economists said, more open trade will have broadly beneficial effects on China's economy, even if it causes greater unemployment as a result of factory closings.
Various sectors of the economy will be affected differently. The automobile and oil sectors will be forced into a painful restructuring, while apparel and textiles will gain access to exports. But, economists and political analysts said, the overall effects of liberalizing trade will inevitably spur long-term economic growth and benefit reformers.
"Unquestionably, it strengthens the hand of Zhu and other reformers," Qu Hongbin, an economist at the Bank of China International, said. "On the macrolevel, this is a major plus for China."
Although Mr. Jiang regards better relations with the United States as one of his major achievements, Mr. Zhu is even more closely identified with the pro-American sentiment that favors greater openness -- best characterized by entry into the World Trade Organization.
Since China's leadership decided 13 years ago that it would seek membership in the organization, the issue has been when and on what terms. With China's economic growth slowing, some conservatives have argued that a wrenching restructuring might better be put off.
Reformers have countered that China badly needs a boost in foreign investment. Membership in the trade organization would also give a palpable boost to China's investment environment, which has soured in recent years, as many foreign executives grapple with thorny obstacles to making money here.
Yet even with the deal, change is not expected to come overnight. Despite the agreement for gradual opening of capital markets like banking and insurance many obstacles remain in financial services. A major restraint is the central control on the currency, the yuan, also known as the renminbi, or "people's money." The yuan can not be freely traded for dollars or other international currencies because China's leaders fear that their financial system is not strong enough to bear sudden heavy inflows or outflows of currency. For banks, that makes doing business difficult.
"Even if we are allowed to make loans in renminbi, we have first to borrow renminbi from Chinese banks, and the spread is too thin to be profitable," said Julia Wang, chief representative for the National Bank of Canada in Shanghai. "Obviously, entering W.T.O. is a step forward. But it is only one step that Chinese banks have to take."
A few years ago, Chinese officials spoke about the possibility of making their currency freely convertible by 2000. But after the Asian financial crisis of 1997, they started saying that such a move would be many more years away.
For foreign investors already in China, the move to membership in the trade organization is seen as a mixed blessing. An executive at General Motors in China said recently that in his view an international company's enthusiasm for China's entry could probably be measured in inverse proportion to the size of its investment in China.
The larger the investment, the more negative a foreign business here is likely to feel about greater competition. General Motors has invested more than $2 billion, a large chunk of that in an assembly plant in Shanghai that began manufacturing a new version of the Buick for the China market.
Because the car sells for $36,000, it will not be competitive after steep import duties have been reduced. The accord today calls for reduced of duties on importing automobiles, to 25 percent from 80 and 100 by 2006.
Foreign investors with smaller investments to date, however, are more likely to benefit from the gradual opening of trade barriers. So will efficient Chinese companies, which generally favor faster reform and freer trade.
Oil and petrochemical industries may be adversely affected, though they have already been subject to a certain level of international competition. Import tariffs have been so high that a vast business in smuggling oil has blossomed in the last decade.
According to a study by the China International Capital Corporation, an investment bank that is a joint venture between the government and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, on the effects of possible membership in the trade body, four major international suppliers exported 14.9 million tons of light diesel oil to China last year. But customs recorded only 6.7 million tons that legally entered the country.
"Ironically, widespread smuggling has also helped domestic firms to prepare for the realities of W.T.O. membership," Shawn X. Xu wrote in the report. "In order to evade import tariffs and value-added tax, smugglers have been importing large amounts of foreign goods through illegal channels and selling them substantially below market prices."
Another part of the economy that is quite likely to be heavily affected by membership in the trade organization is agriculture. By phasing out import quotas and licenses and reducing import tariffs slightly, compliance with the trade body's regulations will dramatically open China's market to agricultural imports. Mr. Xu estimates that agricultural imports will double in a few years.
A large unanswered question is how well China's government will be able to carry out the W.T.O. requirements.
"Of course, the government could rely solely on administrative means to push reforms through," Mr. Xu wrote. "However, absent a credible backup or threat, the stick might not be as effective as a carrot, for people do not believe in the government's ability to enforce its policies."

HEADLINE: Spheres of Influence Grow in Washington;
Once the Enclave of a Few Old Hands, Lobbying Is Corporate and Fast-Merging

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
When lobbying first became a serious profession a few decades ago, the ground rules were pretty basic. About two dozen members of Congress decreed the way most issues were decided, and an effective lobbyist had to cultivate a personal relationship with at least one of them to have any real influence.
But now lobbying has turned into a well-ordered global business, with the influence game taking on a decidedly corporate look. 
 Congress and the rest of the government have changed in myriad ways in a quarter-century, and the transformation has only accelerated with the more recent explosion of information and technology. The capital's government affairs and public relations businesses are changing, too, suddenly engaging in a flurry of consolidations and mergers.
A handful of huge firms are being born, offering clients a full buffet of services under one roof -- everything from public relations, traditional lobbying, research, polling, and direct-mail canvassing to specialists who deal in drumming up "grass roots" support for issues.
The latest and most significant acquisition came this month, when Shandwick USA bought the Cassidy Companies, one of Washington's largest and most successful public affairs groups. The acquisition, which was valued at $70 million to $80 million, instantly gave Shandwick a big presence in Washington, where it was virtually unknown only a few years ago.
This and the other giant firms being created have a foothold not just in Washington, but in London, Brussels and elsewhere, reflecting the new global character of regulation and legislation, especially in the area of trade.
"What's going on is akin to an arms race, with everyone trying to beef up their arsenals," said Anthony T. Podesta, who is chairman of podesta.com, a medium-sized lobbying firm that specializes in high-technology clients and is being eagerly courted by some larger firms. "The trend toward consolidation is a very strong one, as public relations and advertising have come to realize the benefits of adding a government relations component."
Some acquisitions have already been made and others are in the works in what is known here as K Street, a designation that connotes the whole industry of public affairs much the way "Wall Street" is shorthand for the financial trade.
Shandwick, strictly a public relations company, is owned by the Interpublic Group, a huge New York-based advertising company. Interpublic and two other global advertising companies, the WPP Group and the Omnicom Group, now constitute the three giants hoping to offer one-stop shopping in Washington for corporations and interest groups wanting coordinated lobbying and public relations campaigns. Omnicom and WPP have been steadily making acquisitions and are said to seek more.
Cassidy's founder, Gerald S. J. Cassidy, a Washington lobbyist for more than 20 years, has seen changes both sudden and gradual. In the early days, the barons of lobbying were individuals like Thomas Corcoran, a New Deal-era adviser to Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Clark M. Clifford, who began as an aide to Harry S. Truman and went on to serve as Defense Secretary in the Johnson administration.
"The whole system revolved around 25 people who had the power to get things done," Mr. Cassidy said in an interview in his office -- not on K Street but three blocks south on 13th Street, near the White House. "You had to know those people and establish your credibility."
But in 1974, in the wake of Watergate, the caste-ridden seniority system was scrapped in response to the demands of the flood of newly elected reformers in Congress.
"There was suddenly a diffusion of power," Mr. Cassidy said. "The power moved away from the chairmen. At the same time, more issues were being decided in Washington, and that was accompanied by an explosion of staff here."
With the election in recent years of increasing numbers of legislators who vowed fierce resistance to the Washington culture, public affairs professionals learned that they could influence lawmakers more effectively by whipping up sentiment beyond the capital. Public affairs and lobbying began to merge in campaigns back in lawmakers' home districts -- campaigns that mobilized prominent citizens, editorial writers or simply those affected economically to weigh in on an issue.
As an example, Mr. Cassidy recalled a campaign his company waged starting in 1992 to keep the Seawolf class of nuclear attack submarine alive. After President George Bush canceled the project, Cassidy was hired by the manufacturer, General Dynamics, whose Electric Boat Division built the submarine.
"We set out to change the debate," he said. "At one point, we identified every single supplier from around the country and brought them all to Washington for a meeting."
Those suppliers were then sent directly to their members of Congress, not the committees that dealt with military appropriations.
The Cassidy company also sought support from unions and oversaw letter-writing campaigns, paid retired admirals to speak in local districts and arranged meetings with as many editorial boards as were willing to listen.
The first tangible result was that Bill Clinton, then a presidential candidate, came out in favor of the Seawolf. The project was saved and is still alive, in spite of periodic raids by Congressional budget-cutters who contend that it is superfluous.
Last year, Cassidy was ranked first among Washington lobbying and public relations firms in the amount of business it did, edging out the law firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson & Hand. Verner Liipfert is one of a handful of firms that specialize in lobbying and constitute the other major wing of this business.
Two other big ones are Patton, Boggs, whose partners include the well-known lobbyist Thomas H. Boggs Jr., and Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, home to Robert W. Strauss, the former Democratic National Committee chairman, and Vernon E. Jordan, a prominent friend of President Clinton. Corporations and interest groups that use such law firms find they usually have to assemble a team of other agencies to handle public relations, polling and the like.
It is a matter of debate whether that is better or worse than the all-under-one-roof approach. But Verner Liipfert, with high-profile partners like the former senators Bob Dole and George Mitchell, led the successful campaign to persuade Congress to block federal anti-tobacco legislation.
In acquiring Cassidy, Shandwick gets a collection of companies that billed more than $40 million in 1998, as well as a group of prominent political figures, including Jody Powell, President Jimmy Carter's press secretary, and Michael Boland, a former aide to the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott.
It was once customary for Democrats and Republicans to lobby separately, but that custom first broke down when Ronald Reagan was elected president while the House was still ruled by Democrats. It has pretty much vanished with the advent of a Republican Congress and a Democratic White House. The Cassidy group, carefully cultivating its bipartisan influence, has become a model for other Washington firms that combine prominent Democrats and Republicans under one roof.
The umbrella of Cassidy companies includes the Cassidy lobbying operation; Boland & Madigan, another lobbying firm; Powell Tate, a public relations firm; Frederick Schneiders Research, which offers opinion and polling services; and Bork & Associates, which does law-related public relations.
While Interpublic is now an instant Washington presence, Cassidy is suddenly connected with a company with offices in 52 countries. The newest development in lobbying, experts say, is the expansion of the European Union's effect on issues.
To Howard Paster, the Shandwick-Cassidy merger is only the latest round in a trend that began a decade ago, when Hill & Knowlton gobbled up the lobbying firm Gray & Company. Mr. Paster, a former head of Congressional liaison for the Clinton administration, now heads Hill & Knowlton, the second-largest public relations firm both in the nation and in Washington.
Hill & Knowlton is owned by WPP, which also owns the advertising giants Ogilvy & Mather and J. Walter Thompson.
In 1990, Hill & Knowlton acquired the Wexler Group, a lobbying firm with a Democratic heritage, a year after it took over Timmons & Company, a Republican-oriented lobbying firm.
Omnicom has acquired such Washington public relations outfits as Fleishman-Hilliard, Porter Novelli and Ketchum. Omnicom is looking to bolster its lobbying capabilities through acquisitions, industry experts said.
In addition to podesta.com, another firm sought for acquisition in Washington is Barbour, Griffith & Rogers, a Republican lobbying firm headed by Haley Barbour, the former head of the Republican National Committee.
Mr. Paster, who spent several years trying to sway Congress as the chief lobbyist in the Clinton administration, said that "while having real smart Washington people still helps greatly, it's important to understand how changes have driven influence away from the center." Lawmakers are moved, he said, by plausible coalitions put together by professionals.
Victor Kamber, head of the Kamber Group, which has special expertise with labor-related issues, said the future probably means more and more mergers. Companies have to grow to please their stockholders, he said, and "realistically what's happened is that the easiest way to grow is acquire someone with clients; it's much faster than building up new clients."
Mr. Kamber said that in the current atmosphere of mergers, he constantly asks himself if he can thrive as an independent or merely survive, which means he would be looking to merge his 50-person firm with another.
"Right now, the answer is really unclear to me," he said.

HEADLINE: U.N. Details Its Failure to Stop '95 Bosnia Massacre

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Secretary General Kofi Annan laid out in a somber, self-critical report today the tragic story of how the United Nations allowed the Bosnian Muslim "safe area" of Srebrenica to be overrun in July 1995 by Bosnian Serbs, who then systematically killed thousands of the town's men and boys.
The fall of Srebrenica became a damaging symbol of the United Nations' failure at peacekeeping in a new era of civil wars, and it demonstrated the inadequacy of a system that allowed political considerations to color military decisions when troops were under the command of the United Nations. 
 "The tragedy of Srebrenica will haunt our history forever," the report concludes.
The fall of Srebrenica and other towns that the Security Council had identified as safe areas, but then refused to authorize enough troops to defend, led four months later to the American-sponsored Dayton peace agreement and the introduction of a NATO-led international military force in Bosnia.
While blame is widely distributed in the report, the self-examination of the United Nations' own record in Srebrenica breaks new ground by effectively condemning the organization's tendency to try to remain neutral in a civil conflict.
This conclusion comes two months after Mr. Annan, taking a more aggressive stance on crimes against civilians, startled the opening session of this year's General Assembly by saying that national borders would no longer protect leaders who abuse people under their control.
With Mr. Annan's declaration and today's report, the United Nations is saying that the time has come to take sides.
"Through error, misjudgment and the inability to recognize the scope of evil confronting us we failed to do our part to save the people of Srebrenica from the Serb campaign of mass murder," a senior United Nations official said today, introducing the report. "These failings were in part rooted in a philosophy of neutrality and nonviolence wholly unsuited to the conflict in Bosnia."
"In particular," this official said, "the report makes clear the inadequacy of the entire approach of the United Nations to the Serb campaign of ethnic cleansing and mass murder, culminating at Srebrenica."
Mr. Annan was then in charge of United Nations' peacekeeping activities; Boutros Boutros-Ghali was the Secretary General.
The report, based on about 100 interviews with a range of international figures involved in Bosnia, singles out the Bosnian Serb political and military leaders, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, as the "architects and implementers of the attempted genocide in Bosnia" and criticizes those who negotiated with them rather than using military force in the war's early stages. It demands that they be brought to trial.
"The cardinal lesson of Srebrenica," the report says, "is that a deliberate and systematic attempt to terrorize, expel or murder an entire people must be met decisively with all necessary means."
The report on Srebrenica was released on the same day that the three members of Bosnia's collective presidency, speaking to the Security Council on the fourth anniversary of the Dayton agreement, pledged to create the first integral national institutions for Bosnia. The country is now divided into an ethnic Serbian republic and a federation of Bosnian Muslim and Croat areas.
A multiethnic border patrol will be established to help curb cross-border terrorism, smuggling and corruption. A secretariat will be created for the joint presidency, which has had no shared staff, and a common passport for all Bosnians will be introduced. The three presidents have also agreed to form a peacekeeping unit of their own to contribute to the United Nations mission.
American diplomats said that while these may seem like small steps, it took Richard C. Holbrooke, the author of the Dayton accord and now chief United States representative at the United Nations, six hours on Sunday to extract an agreement.
Officials say that the willingness of the three presidents -- Alija Izetbegovic, a Muslim; Ante Jelavic, a Croat, and Zivko Radisic, a Serb -- to act jointly in issuing what they call their Declaration of New York reflects some important changes in the political atmosphere of the Balkans. The Bosnians now see their neighbors moving toward integration in Europe and possible membership in the European Union -- a hope that a fragmented, frequently dysfunctional Bosnian state cannot entertain.
Moreover, American officials said, the crumbling economy and unstable political situation in Serbia, the major republic remaining in Yugoslavia, mean that Serbia is no longer a beacon to the Bosnian Serb republic, which is now economically stronger in some ways than the Serbian motherland. The officials said that in recent months, some Bosnians, apparently feeling more secure, have begun returning to rural areas from which they were displaced as ethnic minorities during the four-year war.
"With this important act," Mr. Holbrooke said today, "the presidents have taken a major step toward consolidating the progress of the past few years -- and in doing so, have helped Bosnia take another step toward fulfilling the vision of Dayton: a unified, single democratic country."
Bosnian Muslims now control the Srebrenica city council, though not without considerable fears for their own safety, officials say. Elected in 1997 but unable to venture back to the town for more than a year, they were among the survivors of the massacres in July 1995.
Srebrenica was then under the guardianship of 110 Dutch peacekeepers, who were no match for the Serbs who suddenly surrounded and attacked the town. The United Nations report says that the Dutch commander had asked for NATO air support on several occasions but was turned down until, finally, he was provided with two air patrols that dropped two bombs and left. The Dutch government, however, feared that its troops might be taken hostage and, at least on one occasion, strongly opposed air strikes.
The report says that the Dutch could have been more forthright in reporting immediately after the incident what evidence they had that a massacre was taking place. The study also faulted French and British commanders leading United Nations troops for their reluctance to call on NATO.
But at the heart of the problem of protecting the safe areas -- Srebrenica, Zepa, Goradze, Bihac, Tuzla and Sarajevo -- was the refusal of Security Council members, including the United States, to authorize enough troops to do the job. Mr. Boutros-Ghali wanted 34,000; the Security Council authorized only 7,400. Later, American politicians blamed the Secretary General for the capture of most of these enclaves.
"When the international community makes a solemn promise to safeguard and protect innocent civilians from massacre," the report says, "then it must be willing to back its promise with the necessary means."

HEADLINE: For Voters, the 60's Never Died

BYLINE: By Sean Wilentz; Sean Wilentz is a professor of history and director of the program in American studies at Princeton University.

 BODY:
Liberalism is back -- maybe not in name, but in spirit and in substance. Its return has been forecast several times in the 1990's, but now it is clearly in flower. From voter surveys to the floors of Congress, we see abundant evidence that Americans are embracing sensible activist government. This swing of the pendulum represents more than a correction of conservative excesses.
Polls by the Pew Research Center for People and the Press and The New York Times/CBS News were the latest to reveal that voters have rejected the antigovernment politicking of years gone by. All of what the respondents identified as the main issues of the day, and most of the secondary issues, breaks in favor of liberals and against conservatives. The Pew poll showed that Americans are markedly less cynical about government than they have been in many years. 
 The Times/CBS survey showed that the voters rate health care (13 percent) and protection of Social Security (8 percent) as their chief concerns, while only 2 percent cited defense. (Although concern over the health care system was also high early in the decade -- especially in 1992, before the Clinton administration's botched reform plan -- it was not viewed as being nearly as important as, say, the economy or the budget deficit.)
The polls' findings underscore the numerous recent signs that our politics have shifted. The movement started with small bipartisan efforts like mandating television V-chips and endorsing school uniforms but today is moving to support for universal health care and the federal financing of 100,000 new schoolteachers.
In the House, the Republican majority is even grudgingly trying to appear to support some sort of increase in the minimum wage, after years of arguing that such a raise would irreparably injure the economy.
On the Democratic side, Al Gore and Bill Bradley are arguing over whether Mr. Bradley's health care proposal is concerned enough with protecting poor families.
Over in the Reform Party, the former Republican Pat Buchanan has cozied up to the erstwhile Marxist-Leninist fringe candidate Lenora Fulani. Even Donald Trump, the living symbol of 80's excess, has gotten into the act, with a soak-the-rich tax proposal that comes straight out of the Huey Long populist playbook.
The easy explanation for the change is that flush times produce more liberal outlooks. With plenty of money in their own pockets and in government coffers, Americans are more willing to back federal spending. But that economic determinist reading is superficial. We are witnessing a revival of a liberal tradition that had been given up for dead but has assumed a new and disciplined form.
When last in bloom, between 1961 and 1965, liberalism achieved an amazing amount in a short time. Using the powers of the federal government, the Kennedy and Johnson administrations effectively outlawed segregation and overturned racist immigration policies. Attempts to enact universal health care failed, but Medicare and Medicaid were the cornerstones of the Great Society.
Even by 1968, when liberal divisions over Vietnam and the G.O.P.'s "Southern strategy" helped elect Richard Nixon, Nixon did not declare war on domestic programs, but expanded them, establishing, for example, the Environmental Protection Agency.
The backlash truly set in later in the 70's, when oil shocks and inflation eroded the economy. Ronald Reagan's counterrevolution lasted into the 90's, with conservatives tainting their opponents as "tax-and-spend liberals." That culminated with the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress, when the traces of liberalism that helped elect Bill Clinton two years earlier seemed crushed once and for all.
Yet throughout the antigovernment era, the achievements of the 1960's were becoming sacrosanct. Liberals and conservatives fought fiercely over affirmative action and the merits of racial gerrymandering, but not over the basic tenets of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Republicans and Democrats clashed (as they continue to do) over the financing and scope of Medicare, but not over the program's legitimacy. What conservatives condemned 30 years ago as creeping socialism an accepted part of the American Way.
With this baseline of federal commitment firmly established, liberalism was never quite so weak as it seemed to be. A paradox of the Reagan years was that, even though the president was popular (and national Democrats were singularly unpopular), polls repeatedly showed the electorate opposed to the administration on many leading domestic issues, like education and the environment. Too many conservatives misread Mr. Reagan's twin electoral triumphs (and Mr. Bush's victory in 1988) as a full-scale ideological conversion by the voters to their cause.
What the voters may have liked best about Mr. Reagan's politics, his uncompromising anti-Communism in foreign affairs, hardly translated into liberalism's demise. Until Vietnam, after all, liberalism and anti-Communism had gone hand in hand; many of those Democrats who switched to Mr. Reagan over foreign affairs remained, in their hearts, more liberal than not. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, that underlying liberalism understandably resurfaced.
Liberalism's comeback, however, required an updating of its themes, which has been the signal success of Bill Clinton.
In his first term, after falling on his face with his health care initiative, he emphasized fiscal responsibility, with (did no one notice?) increased federal spending on social investments.
The turning point was Mr. Clinton's welfare reform, which was negotiated in the face of severe outrage on the part of much of the Democrats' longtime base. At the time, it appeared to be a victory for Republicans. But it ended up shattering the conservatives' claim that government could do nothing right and paradoxically made federal action respectable once again.
 This was lost on Congressional Republicans, who have cluelessly followed up their impeachment drive with an outdated agenda of regressive tax cuts and across-the-board budget reductions. The polls strongly suggest that, as a result of their misreadings, the House Republicans are in danger of losing their majority next year. George W. Bush may not know the name of the new leader of Pakistan, but he has been savvy enough to distance himself from the House Republicans, at least rhetorically, and to proclaim himself a champion of a vague "compassionate conservatism."
Whatever the campaign year brings, one thing is clear: the Reagan-Bush era is over. Republican nostalgia for that era is politically delusional. And if, as President Clinton once said, the era of big government is over, a new era of liberal government activism, tempered by adversity, could be beginning.

HEADLINE: THE TRADE DEAL: THE STRATEGY;
A Deal That America Just Couldn't Refuse

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
In the end, the deal struck today between the United States and China was one that President Clinton had little choice but to seal.
For a president who talks constantly these days about harnessing the forces of economic globalization, the agreement to integrate China into the global trading system marked the culmination of Mr. Clinton's single biggest imprint on American foreign policy: the use of American economic power for strategic ends. That is what this agreement is all about, locking in China's commitment to economic reforms and with it, he is betting, a further opening of Chinese society. 
 Mr. Clinton came to that strategy in the most roundabout of ways. He began on the other side of the China debate, denouncing President Bush for economic engagement with a nation that had just killed hundreds at Tiananmen Square. Soon he came to the conclusion that every president since Nixon has reached: There is little realistic choice other than engagement.
A year and a half into his presidency, Mr. Clinton had already reversed course, saying he would no longer link human rights, missiles or other issues to his annual renewal of China's trading rights with the United States. Ever since, he has advocated the long-term benefits of opening up China's politics by opening up its markets -- stringing American-built cell-phone networks from Shanghai to Tibet, letting a hundred Internet sites bloom, insisting that if China applies the rule of law for Boeing, it eventually will have to apply it to dissidents.
He has pressed the economic engagement argument to an extreme no other president, Mr. Bush included, has ever taken it. Along the way he has learned a hard lesson: His early hopes that economic change and political change would quickly come hand-in-hand in China were a fantasy. He concluded that if the business of America is business, so was much of its foreign policy.
Last week, for example, China's leaders thought nothing of simultaneously negotiating with Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, over subjecting China to the trade organization's commercial laws while it was sentencing four members of the Falun Gong, the movement whose silent meditations have struck fear into the heart of the Communist Party, to prison sentences of up to 12 years.
"We have to be realistic about the prospects for change in China because there are elements of the country that will never change," Ms. Barshefsky said today. "But what's the alternative? Let's punish China by not gaining access to its market? Who does that punish? I am cautious in making claims that a market-opening agreement leads to anything other than opening the market. It may -- it could have a spillover effect -- but it may not. And we've got to understand that."
Perhaps it reflects a maturing of the China debate in the United States that just as Mr. Clinton has come to understand the limits of trade agreements, some of his critics have come to appreciate their possibilities. Human Rights Watch, one of the many organizations constantly monitoring the country, embraced the accord today, sounding a note of cautious hope that Mr. Clinton's long-term bet could pay off.
"China's membership in the W.T.O. could increase pressure for greater openness, more press freedom, enhanced rights for workers and an independent judiciary," Human Rights Watch said.
There are elements of today's agreement that could do just that -- if one is willing to wait long enough.
For example, Ms. Barshefsky's negotiating team spent a considerable amount of time defanging China's insistence that foreigners could never invest in Chinese Internet service providers. The United States maintained that the Internet had to be dealt with like the rest of the telecommunications market -- open to foreigners and Chinese alike. That is a remarkable concession in a country that only a few years ago strictly controlled who could own radios and that put speakers in every village, to blare propaganda.
"In an increasingly information-based economy it is difficult to tell people to be economically creative and politically suppressed," the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said today in Turkey, where he is traveling with Mr. Clinton. "But it's a long-term hypothesis."
Just as importantly, the Chinese gave away their ability to be the sole judge of what foreign investors can do and what they cannot. Once China is a member, it must submit to the World Trade Organization's dispute-settlement system. Cases of Chinese trade barriers will be sent to three-judge panels in Geneva.
No one expects that the Chinese leadership will roll over and do whatever the courts command. But then again, neither do the Europeans.
There is hope but no assurance that trade liberalization can lock in political liberalization. There is a far better bet that it may be able to lock in China's economic liberalizations.
Over the next five years the accord will throw open to foreigners -- at least on paper -- markets that have long been out of reach. Life insurance companies will have the right to sell their policies anywhere in the country. Grain producers and computer makers can distribute their goods themselves, without going through state-owned firms. Five years from now, foreign banks will be able to open branches, doing business with ordinary Chinese in the national currency, the yuan.
Each of these businesses have long been protected by the Chinese government. By throwing open the doors, after five years to prepare, China's leaders are betting that the arrival of foreigners will spur efficiency and growth. It demonstrates, experts say, that China has learned a lesson from the experiences of Japan and South Korea: Over-protection of domestic industries breeds fat, smug companies ripe for disaster when hard times strike.
It is a risky strategy for the Chinese, of course. Competition can breed unemployment -- already a growing problem in China -- and unemployment can breed political activism.
It is also a risk for the United States. "We're seeing a backlash against too much trade liberalization too fast," said Jeffrey Garten, the former undersecretary of commerce and one of the architects of Mr. Clinton's early forays into commercial diplomacy.
It is a backlash already in full swing in Europe and parts of Asia. If it hits particularly hard in China, Washington may be reassessing the political benefits of Mr. Clinton's strategy.

HEADLINE: Many Winners and Some Losers in Trade Accord With China

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
For American International Group, the giant insurer, the new trade agreement with China is a long-awaited go-ahead to sell insurance everywhere in China, not in just a few cities. AT&T sees the door open to provide Internet services in China. But Milliken & Company, the big textile manufacturer -- forecasting doom -- says that President Clinton's negotiators have signed a death warrant for textile makers in America.
Many industries -- commercial banking, auto and aircraft manufacturing, farming and food processing, investment banking, electronics, money management -- hailed the agreement yesterday between China and the United States as a wonderful opportunity to expand rapidly into the giant Chinese market. The Clinton administration gave its blessing to China's entry into the World Trade Organization in exchange for numerous market-opening concessions. 
 "Right now, we have $200 million in revenue from selling insurance in China and I expect that to grow to a very big number in the future," said Maurice R. Greenberg, chairman of American International Group, which has been selling life insurance to the Chinese since 1992. The agreement would allow the insurer to greatly increase the number of its branch offices, which now number only four, and expand into property and casualty insurance -- well ahead of other American insurers just moving into China.
The dissonant notes came mainly from textile makers, although a spokesman for the computer software industry said his people would withhold judgment until they knew the details of the agreement dealing with piracy. "We are cautious in endorsing anything until we have seen the final ink dried on the paper," said Dan Duncan, a vice president of the Software and Information Industry Association.
The piracy rate for business software has been 95 percent in recent years, which means that for every 100 copies of Microsoft Office software exported to China, 95 are copied illegally, Mr. Duncan said. "One has to wonder why the rate has stayed so high over the years unless there is some government involvement."
Textile import quotas now limit the shipment of yarn and cloth to the United States from China's modern and low-cost textile industry, which is big enough to supply the entire world, said John F. Nash, counsel for Milliken in Washington. The World Trade Organization requires its member countries to phase out tariffs and quotas, but American manufacturers had counted on 10 more years of limits on Chinese imports, until 2010, Mr. Nash said. The new agreement, however, specifies Jan. 1, 2005.
"The administration and Congress are spending our jobs like drunken sailors," Mr. Nash said, arguing that many of the 551,000 people still employed in American textile factories could lose their jobs as a result of the accord. The deal reached in Beijing is subject to Congressional approval.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. also objected strenuously to a deal with a country with a poor human rights record and numerous violations of labor standards. In a statement that promised fierce opposition to Congressional approval, John Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said, "The agreement reached this weekend deals away our democratic principles and most cherished values, and we will fight it."
But the cheering from corporate America carried the day. "China is the only place in the world where you can go and see economic development right in front of your eyes," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "If China comes alive, they are going to really need advice and insight from global financial service companies like ours."
American commercial banks are big beneficiaries. Since 1997, they have been allowed to provide services to foreign companies operating in China. Now they will gradually be allowed to provide services to Chinese companies, making loans, handling currency transactions and providing other services. "Based on our understanding of the terms, the agreement provides a very significant liberalization in China's financial services market," said a spokesman for Citigroup, which has seven offices in China.
For the first time, American money managers, including the big Wall Street brokerage houses and mutual funds like FMR's Fidelity, Vanguard and T. Rowe Price, will be allowed to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, owning up to 33 percent at first and as much as 49 percent in a few years. Just as these companies rushed into Japan when that nation opened its gates, they most likely will rush into China, where they see a fresh supply of investor cash.
"The Chinese are big savers," said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs International.
Telecommunications companies see themselves as big potential winners. AT&T, whose operations are limited now to providing services for 50 foreign multinational companies in China, sees the agreement as the first step in allowing American companies to invest in Chinese Internet providers. "Internet is the biggest area that we are currently excluded from," said Bruce Jackson, AT&T's vice president for global marketing.
Motorola also viewed the agreement, or at least the sparse details available yesterday, as a new Chinese willingness to permit foreign investment in mobile phone systems and other telecommunications services -- providing Motorola with an expanded market for the cell phones, pagers and semiconductors that Motorola already manufacturers in China.
"Any expansion in investment opportunities in China translates into opportunities for Motorola," said Norman Sandler, the company's director of strategic issues. "Motorola itself might invest in new wireless ventures, foreign or Chinese, and sell equipment to them."
Automakers, whose sales in China are still tiny, hailed a provision in the agreement that will let foreigners provide the Chinese with car loans, but most said they were waiting to see the final terms before judging its benefits. And Caterpillar Inc. pointed to China's new willingness to let foreign companies distribute their own products exported to China, replacing Chinese distributors.
"We are allowed to own one dealership now and we would set up more, although how many more we don't know yet," said William Lane, Caterpillar's director of governmental affairs. "This is just the first bite of the apple" he added. "By joining the World Trade Organization, China will be obligated to permit further market openings."
Farm organizations said that China had moved in the right direction in lowering tariffs on food imports, although Gene Paul, president of the National Farmers Organization, cautioned: "This is not going to change the current situation of low prices. I've read that China had a record corn crop, and we have to realize that ships run both ways."
Electronics manufacturers expressed concern that the Chinese government would press foreign manufacturers to buy supplies from state-owned Chinese companies. But in general, United States corporations saw in the treaty a new willingness by China's leaders to abide by international rules of trade and to avoid conflict.
That is certainly the view at Boeing, which has always sold aircraft to Chinese airlines. "This treaty brings us a huge step toward creating a normal business relationship between the two countries," said Tim Neale, a Boeing spokesman. "And in that climate we can be very successful."

HEADLINE: Suit Says I.N.S. Undercut Honduran Aid Effort

BYLINE: By SUSAN SACHS 

 BODY:
Lawyers accused the Immigration and Naturalization Service yesterday of undermining a federal program that offers work permits to Honduran immigrants so they can help relatives at home recover from the devastation of Hurricane Mitch.
In a class-action lawsuit filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, four immigrant advocacy groups said the agency's processing center in Vermont had failed to provide short-term work permits to thousands of Hondurans who have been entitled to them for months. 
 In early January, Hondurans living in the United States were offered the chance to apply for temporary protected status under a law that protects some foreign nationals from deportation when their home country has been devastated by armed conflict or a natural disaster.
Hurricane Mitch struck Honduras and other parts of Central America in October and November 1998. The immigration service immediately announced that it would suspend deportations to the affected countries as a humanitarian gesture; when the full extent of the damage became clear, Attorney General Janet Reno expanded the gesture with the offer of temporary protected status.
Lawyers for the Honduran immigrants said yesterday that officials in Vermont had improperly demanded documentation from immigrants that was not legally required for temporary protected status, further delaying the issuance of permits. The program for Hondurans is set to expire on July 5, 2000.
Immigration officials in Washington acknowledged yesterday that there had been problems in processing some applications.
"Over all, there was a misunderstanding or misconception on the part of the Vermont Service Center," said Bill Strassberger, an I.N.S. spokesman. "Their understanding of the regulations was that there was more documentation required than actually was necessary. That's now been clarified and we are working to get the applications processed."
The lawsuit and the official response underscored recurrent problems at the Vermont center, which handles immigration cases from states along the East Coast from Maine to Virginia. Applicants for citizenship and for green cards have waited as long as three years -- longer than in other regions -- for the Vermont center to locate and then process their requests. Its handling of the Honduran program has drawn criticism from immigration lawyers.
Nearly 107,000 Hondurans nationwide applied for the benefit by the August deadline, and nearly 70,000 had received a work permit as of the first week of November, according to the agency.
However, of the nearly 36,000 requests for work permits received at the Vermont center, 21,000 were sent back with a demand for more information. No other service center in the country raised questions about so many applications.
To receive the legal right to live and work in the United States while their country is rebuilding, Hondurans had to show they had resided in the United States since Dec. 30, 1998, and had not traveled outside the country since Jan. 5, 1999.
But many applicants to the Vermont center received letters telling them they had to prove, instead, that they had resided in the country before Dec. 30, 1998. Some were told they had to prove they had not traveled outside the United States since the day they had arrived.
Not only were the demands illegal, the lawsuit charges, but the agency ignored a legal obligation to issue temporary permits so that applicants could get jobs while their files were being processed.
"Temporary protected status is nothing new -- it has been used with dozens of countries," said Charles Wheeler, a lawyer at the Catholic Legal Immigration Network in San Francisco. "The I.N.S. has never requested this level of documentation."
Most of the Hondurans who applied for the temporary protected status are in the country illegally, immigrant advocates said. They may be unemployed or working at black-market jobs for low wages. A work permit would give them a chance to earn more and send more to their families, Mr. Wheeler said.

HEADLINE: THE TRADE DEAL: THE PROSPECTS;
White House and Business Groups To Push Congress on China Pact

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
The Clinton administration and business groups prepared an intense campaign today to win approval in Congress for China's entry into the World Trade Organization, facing opposition from conservatives who object to almost any dealings with China and liberals who say the trade pact would be bad for workers.
Members of both parties said the deal would most likely be approved in the House, the more difficult of the two Congressional battlegrounds, based on the solid bipartisan majority that granted China a one-year extension of favorable trading terms earlier this year. The Senate tends to be more supportive of free trade measures than the House. 
 But neither the supporters nor the opponents were taking the outcome for granted, given the volatility of the relationship between the United States and China and the political sensitivity of trade issues heading into an election year.
"It's going to take an awful lot of work," said Representative David Dreier, a California Republican who is chairman of the House Rules Committee and a leading advocate of bringing China into the trade group.
Congress would not vote on the agreement itself, but on whether the United States should permanently grant China normal trading privileges, which is in effect a condition of the deal. Since 1974, Congress has had to vote annually on whether to retain a normal trading relationship with China, a process that critics of China have used to express their displeasure with Beijing.
Eager to win greater access to the huge market in China -- and stung by criticism that they had been ineffectual in rallying support for past trade votes -- business groups promised an all-out campaign to get the deal enacted.
"We were asked by the administration if we could deliver the votes," said L. Craig Johnstone, senior vice president for international economic and national security affairs at the United States Chamber of Commerce. "We said we could and we will."
Many industries -- commercial banking, auto and aircraft manufacturing, farming and food processing, investment banking, electronics, money management, filmmaking -- hailed the agreement today as an opportunity to expand rapidly into the giant Chinese market. Business groups had complained to the administration last spring when the president rejected an earlier deal with the Chinese. Mr. Clinton had walked away from the proposal fearing that he would have been unable to secure sufficient support in Congress.
Republican Congressional leaders have been generally supportive of a deal with China, but were cautious in their reaction today. Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said that there were still "significant questions" about the deal's effects on human rights, religious freedom and the economic relationship between the two countries, and that he was reserving judgment until he could study the agreement.
Even if, as expected, the Republican leadership ultimately joins the White House in pushing for the agreement, the proposal is still sure to set off a bitter debate uniting some of the most conservative Republicans and the most liberal Democrats against centrists in both parties.
Citing what they said were human rights abuses, the spread of nuclear and conventional arms, a lack of concern for environmental issues and the prospect that increased trade would result in some American workers' losing their jobs, a spectrum of groups said they would try to block or modify the agreement.
John Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., called the deal "a grave mistake," and said it was "disgustingly hypocritical" of the administration to claim to be keeping the interests of working people in mind even as it negotiated with a regime that routinely violates human rights.
Opposition to the deal by human rights advocates could also give an opportunity to conservative Republican candidates like Steve Forbes and Gary Bauer to win support from the right wing of their party, whose leading candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, supports the deal.
Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican from California, said the agreement was a "raw deal" for workers and consumers because it would institutionalize tariff advantages held by China.
"On top of that, we'd be putting our stamp of approval on having a gangster regime coming into yet another international body and thinking that in some way that body is going to civilize the regime," he said, "when in fact it's more likely that the organization itself will be corrupted by having the world's worst human rights violator in its midst."
Administration officials said they would press hard to get the deal approved, probably in the first few months of next year.
Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, told reporters in Turkey, where President Clinton was traveling today: "I believe that when Congress has an opportunity to study the terms of this, recognize the tremendous benefits to American industry and American workers around the country, and the protections that we obtain for import-sensitive industries in this agreement, that there will be broad support for it."
The administration won support today from Human Rights Watch, an advocacy group that said China's entry into the trade organization "could increase pressure for greater openness, more press freedom, enhanced rights for workers and an independent judiciary."
But the White House is primarily counting on business groups. Administration officials have consulted with business lobbyists to gauge support for a deal in Congress and to plan strategy for winning approval.
The Business Roundtable, which represents the country's largest corporations, has readied a plan to tout the benefits of the deal in 71 key Congressional districts. In Iowa, for instance, the group has hired a political organizer, Bill Menner, to get businesses and interest groups working on behalf of the agreement.
Mr. Menner said he planned to turn to groups like the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation and other employers in the state, like Diamond V Mills, a soybean processor in Cedar Rapids, and the headquarters of Roto-Rooter in West Des Moines, to make a public case for the deal and call their members of Congress.
The Business Roundtable also plans to run newspaper advertising in Iowa emphasizing the economic benefits the deal would bring to farmers and other groups.
"We hope that when push comes to shove," Mr. Menner said, "the case we can make about the benefits of trade with China will carry the day."

HEADLINE: Employees From Microsoft Give Gore an Icy Reception

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: REDMOND, Wash., Nov. 15

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore stepped into the lion's den today, facing down hundreds of Microsoft employees smarting from the judicial finding that their company had bullied its rivals and stifled competition. And he told them just what they did not want to hear: that competition is fundamentally a good thing.
With 300 people packing an auditorium on the computer giant's campus, the vice president talked about "unfair use of market dominance in one sector to stifle innovation in another sector." He added, "If competition is valuable, which I think it is, then antitrust laws have a place in embodying the values of our country." And at another point, he said, "The values that are inherent in the antitrust laws are ones that are sound, in my opinion." 
 Mr. Gore was virtually echoing the heart of the federal government's case against Microsoft, and the atmosphere here in the company auditorium went icy at his words.
Mr. Gore trooped out to Microsoft as just another candidate for president. He was following in the footsteps of several of his rivals, including former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, his sole Democratic challenger, and several Republicans, including Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Senator John McCain of Arizona.
But Mr. Gore had the added burden of representing an administration that has ferociously pummeled Microsoft in court. Complicating his task as a candidate is the fact that, as one questioner pointed out, Mr. Gore is probably the most "technologically savvy" candidate ever to run for president.
And he had the misfortune to have had an earlier meeting here rescheduled so that today's visit came just 10 days after Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of Federal District Court found in a devastating assessment that the company had monopoly control over PC operating systems and that it wielded that power in ways that hurt American consumers.
Mr. Gore tried at first to avoid commenting on the case. But he was relentlessly questioned about his views. Isn't government interference more of a threat to consumers than Microsoft? he was asked. Isn't it a dangerous invasion of privacy when the government can cull and regurgitate someone's e-mail messages to use against him in court?
Perhaps most pointedly, one employee told Mr. Gore that he shared his Democratic social values and wanted to vote for him but felt deeply conflicted because of the administration's "favorable reaction to a ruling that says we're harming consumers."
William Kovacic, a law professor specializing in antitrust cases at George Washington University, said afterward that Mr. Gore had put himself in "an extraordinarily difficult position." But, Mr. Kovacic said, "the issues the case raises are so fundamental to the future of the company and of innovation that it's perfectly reasonable for people to ask what his views are."
Mr. Gore has a precedent for commenting on such cases. When Boeing acquired McDonnell Douglas in 1997, Mr. Gore went to the home of Boeing in Seattle and said the United States would fight efforts by Europe to block the merger. Mr. Kovacic said Mr. Gore's stance in favor of Boeing's monopoly, and in favor of the American company's pre-eminence in the aircraft sector, stood in contrast to the administration's opposition in the case of Microsoft.
"Microsoft has a lot of domestic enemies, and a lot of them are in Silicon Valley, and they have thrown a lot of cash at both parties, but in particular to the Democrats," Mr. Kovacic said. "Microsoft has a legion of enemies who hold it in contempt. And that's a tricky issue for the White House. Do you attack the pre-eminent symbol of American information technology success or safeguard the interests of their Silicon Valley opponents?"
Mr. Gore turned the conversation to one of values, mentioning support for research and development, dealing with inequality and then said: "And yet another value that I think is important in our country is competition. And competition can be stifled both by unwise and unhealthy government action and also by private action on the part of companies that want to unfairly use market dominance in one sector to stifle innovation in another sector."
Despite this grim judgment, Mr. Gore has tried to portray himself as a friend of the high-tech industry, going so far earlier this year as to call himself the father of the Internet. He has promoted tax credits for research and development, and today he threw around terms like quantum computing and Moore's Law with abandon.
He also noted that one of his daughters, Karenna, had worked briefly at Slate, Microsoft's online magazine. And one of his former employees, Ginny Terzano, once Mr. Gore's press secretary, has just been hired by Microsoft to head its lobbying office in Washington, D.C.
But it is not clear what kind of affinity William H. Gates, the Microsoft chairman, may have for Mr. Gore. Mr. Gates was not on hand for today's visit, having a prior commitment at a conference.
There has been considerable debate over Mr. Gates's political leanings and speculation that he wants to drag out the lawsuit until a new president takes office and appoints a new chief of the Justice Department's antitrust division.
Microsoft gave $1.3 million last year to candidates in both parties. Microsoft employees have been more generous to Republicans this year than to Democrats. They gave $29,000 to Mr. Bush and $13,000 to Mr. Gore.
Several employees who attended today's session with Mr. Gore reflected the computer industry's stance that electoral politics had little to do with their success. A cluster of employees, who declined to give their names, said they were more interested in Mr. Gore's views on education and on health care than on the antitrust case because, as one put it, "the administration doesn't have much say in the overall economic growth of the last 15 years."
But Mr. Gore's comments did not appear to win him many friends. "I appreciate him being honest," one employee said. "But I'm not encouraged. He was on the side of the government."

HEADLINE: New Battles Erupt In A.T.M. Fee War As Banks Retaliate

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: SANTA MONICA, Calif., Nov. 15

 BODY:
Lashawanda McCullom, a 30-year-old nurse, put her credit union's cash card into a Bank of America automated teller machine here, punched in her secret code and requested a withdrawal. The machine spit out her card and flashed a message: "Due to a recent vote by the Santa Monica City Council, the convenience of this A.T.M. is now available to Bank of America cardholders only."
Ms. McCullom, who expressed mild frustration at being denied her cash, was caught in the cross-fire of a skirmish over A.T.M. surcharges that now seems to be breaking into a full-fledged war. Suddenly, the fact that it costs an extra $1.50 or so to get money out of a cash machine seems to have tapped into some deep well of public resentment -- or at least politicians believe it has. 
 This oceanside suburb of Los Angeles last month passed the nation's first local ordinance banning banks from charging noncustomers for using their A.T.M.'s. San Francisco voters approved a similar measure earlier this month. California's two largest banks, Bank of America and Wells Fargo Bank, retaliated by closing off noncustomer access to their machines, which is why Ms. McCullom could not get her money Friday. And late today, a federal judge in San Francisco issued a preliminary injunction barring both cities from enforcing their ordinances.
The ruling by Judge Vaughn Walker could slow down but not derail efforts in other cities and states to enact similar bans. The New York City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said today that he planned to propose such a law and the Los Angeles City Council has instructed the city attorney to study the city's authority to enact a ban.
The Department of Defense has also proposed a ban on such surcharges on all military bases. Connecticut and Iowa already ban such surcharges under pre-existing laws and three other states -- Wyoming, Arkansas and Mississippi -- have price caps on the surcharges.
"Consumers just find the surcharge sort of the fee that broke the consumer's back, so to speak," said Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general of Connecticut, which is now battling the banking industry in court. "Consumers see no reason for it. They regard it almost as a personal insult. It has evoked an emotion that is quite astonishing."
How widespread the bans will become remains to be seen. Santa Monica and San Francisco are both liberal, not typical cities. Consumer groups have failed to get any state to enact such a ban and Alfonse M. D'Amato, when he was senator from New York, never got very far with his attempt to legislate a nationwide prohibition. Representative Bernard Sanders, an independent from Vermont, re-introduced a bill this month that would ban surcharges, and another bill that would authorize cities and states to outlaw the fees.
Critics say it is unreasonable to charge consumers for access to their own money.
"Banks are basically holding our money hostage," said Jon Golinger of the California Public Interest Group. The United States Public Interest Research Group found that 93 percent of banks surveyed impose such a surcharge, up from 71 percent in 1998 and 15 percent in 1996. Nationally, such surcharges appear to generate about $2 billion to $3 billion a year or more for A.T.M. operators.
Critics also say that in many cases consumers are being charged twice for each withdrawal. If a Wells Fargo customer, for instance, takes money out of a Bank of America machine, Wells Fargo charges that customer $2 for using a "foreign" A.T.M., about 50 cents of which goes to reimburse Bank of America. But Bank of America itself charges $1.50 for use of its machine by a noncustomer, bringing the total fee for retrieving as little as $20 of one's own money to $3.50.
The Santa Monica and San Francisco ordinances, as well as the regulation in Connecticut, bar only the $1.50 surcharge levied by the A.T.M. owner, not the fees imposed by a bank on its own customers.
Part of the frustration over the surcharges stems from what is a general proliferation in banking fees in an era of deregulation and from the fact that A.T.M. use was once free. "People see the way banks are trying to charge for everything under the sun," said Walter L. McCaffrey, a New York City councilman from Queens who is helping draft the proposed legislation there. "The original position was that A.T.M.'s were not a profit center."
Banks say it is their right to charge for services. If consumers do not want to pay they can use their own bank's A.T.M.'s. Without surcharges, they said, there would be fewer A.T.M.'s and less convenience for consumers.
"You're not going to find too many people who are willing to give the service for free," said Terry E. Zink, senior vice president in charge of A.T.M.'s for Wells Fargo. "The biggest issue is whether or not consumers have the right to pay for services they want."
What is perhaps most unusual about this battle is that only a few years ago, the forces were on the opposite sides. The banks, through two major networks that link A.T.M. machines, prohibited the surcharges. Legislators in 15 states enacted laws overriding the prohibition.
Banks initially shunned fees to encourage people to use the machines. They viewed A.T.M.'s not as money makers but as cost-savers, a way to cut down on the number of tellers.
But then some banks as well as some nonfinancial companies began realizing that charging customers would make it economical to put A.T.M.'s in remote locations and away from banks themselves. Moreover, the prohibition on surcharges raised antitrust issues because it made it difficult for nonbanks to be in the A.T.M. business because there would be no way to recover their costs. This led to the state laws allowing the fees and to the decision in 1996 by two major national A.T.M. networks -- Visa's Plus and Mastercard International's Cirrus -- to lift the prohibition on surcharges.
Since then the number of A.T.M.'s has nearly doubled to 227,000 from 123,000 in 1997, according to the American Bankers Association. Most of the new machines are not at banks and savings and loans but at supermarkets, malls, airports, amusement parks and other so-called off-premise locations. Indeed, slightly more than half of all A.T.M.'s are now off premise, according to Bank Network News, a Chicago based newsletter.
Moreover, about half of all new A.T.M.'s -- including most of the off-premise ones -- are owned by companies other than banks, saving and loans or credit unions, according to Speer & Associates, an Atlanta consulting firm. These companies include Electronic Data Systems, the computer services company, the Publix Supermarkets chain and smaller companies that have gone into business just to provide A.T.M.'s. Many retailers own their A.T.M.'s, but some merely collect a fee from A.T.M.'s in their stores that are owned by others.
The San Francisco and Santa Monica laws allow these nonfinancial institutions to levy the surcharges, under the theory that they do not gain savings from having fewer tellers. The Connecticut rule, however, bars surcharges on all machines. The New York ordinance has not been drafted yet but could be similar to the California ones.
While consumer groups say that bank fees are well in excess of what it costs for an A.T.M. transaction, some bankers say they are losing money on A.T.M.'s even with the surcharges. And they say prohibiting surcharges will force closure of many A.T.M.'s.
"Without the surcharge, there's no way a lot of off-premise A.T.M.'s can be profitable," said Robert E. Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, who studied the matter for the American Bankers Association.
Evidence on this question is mixed. Connecticut has only about two-thirds of the number of A.T.M.'s per million people as the nation as a whole, according to Bank Network News. But Iowa has almost as many machines per capita as the nation as a whole and more than some states that allow the surcharges.
In the preliminary ruling in San Francisco today, Judge Walker agreed with the arguments of Bank of America, Wells Fargo and the California Bankers Association that local ordinances are pre-empted by federal regulations. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a federal regulator, has intervened in the case on the side of the banks.
Banks have won decisions on these grounds in Iowa and Connecticut, but the ban on surcharges in those states remains while the decisions are being appealed. But a 1990 decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers California and other Western states, found that a federal law does allow some room for states to regulate A.T.M.'s.
Critics of the surcharges say they favor the big banks under the theory that consumers, to avoid the fees, will put their accounts in banks that have the most machines. "When a business can gain customers by raising prices, that's not what competition is all about," said Adam Radinsky, deputy city attorney for Santa Monica.
Some smaller banks and credit unions have pushed for free A.T.M. use or have banded together to offer free use to one another's customers, to better compete with bigger banks. Still, many smaller banks impose the surcharges.
Even in Santa Monica, some people think the whole controversy is overblown.
"I think Santa Monica is overstepping its rights trying to impose business practices on the banks, and I think the banks are being vindictive and hasty in trying to make a statement back to the city of Santa Monica," said Katrina Osio, a 33-year-old marketing director of an Internet company. "I just think it's childish."

HEADLINE: Opening China's Markets

 BODY:
The Clinton administration appears to have salvaged the trade agreement with China that it could have concluded in April if President Clinton had not rejected it. The new agreement, announced yesterday in Beijing, paves the way for China to join the World Trade Organization, committing it to obey rules that apply to all other major trading partners.
Zhu Rongji, the Chinese prime minister, offered much the same terms seven months ago on a visit to the United States. Mr. Clinton's last-minute rejection, based on his fear that Congress would not go along, embarrassed Mr. Zhu and gave his domestic critics time to build opposition to an arrangement that would have accelerated China's push toward freer markets. Since April the administration has scrambled to correct its blunder. Yesterday it succeeded. 
 The new terms appear about as bold as the old ones. China promises to cut tariffs below those of many of America's other trade partners. It agrees to end export subsidies, give American exporters the right to distribute goods and open up Chinese markets to American farmers, banks, insurance, telecommunications and Internet companies.
By one calculation, the agreement will do little for the Chinese economy because its exports already enjoy unfettered access to American consumers. One exception is textiles and apparel. The new terms grant the Chinese an important concession -- the United States will phase out quotas on Chinese goods as fast as it phases out quotas on textiles from other trade partners. This provision will not hurt American manufacturers, since Chinese apparel sales mostly come at the expense of other third world exporters.
But by a second calculation, the impact on the Chinese economy could be profound. By joining the trade organization, China's market advocates now have the weight of international law on their side. Mr. Zhu expects trade accords to tilt domestic debate over economic reform in his favor.
There are critics who say that China will not live up to its trade promises, and that the trade organization is incapable of forcing it to do so. Perhaps. But with China outside the organization, the United States has no real leverage. With Chinese membership, the United States can marshal international sanctions for violations. Besides, the imposition of the rule of law on trade might strengthen the hand of domestic forces fighting for the rule of law for the rest of Chinese society.

HEADLINE: United States May Yet Lose Its Vote in U.N. General Assembly

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Appropriating nearly $1 billion in back dues and assessments to the United Nations might not be enough to prevent the United States from losing its vote in the General Assembly next year, United Nations officials say.
A senior United Nations official estimated that the United States must come up with at least $350 million by the end of December to avoid forfeiting its vote. But legislation worked out by Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, and Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, would initially pay only $100 million. 
 The possibility of the United States' losing its vote is real because the United Nations charter says that any country falling two years behind will be stripped of its right to vote until it repays the debt. Usually only nations mired in poverty fall sufficiently behind to lose their votes.
But a senior Clinton administration official expressed confidence that the gap could be covered by pooling the first payment with funds being appropriated in a bill for the Departments of State, Commerce and Justice.
The Helms-Biden legislation authorized $926 million in payment over three years. But it also attached the following conditions, which other countries are likely to challenge:
* The other 187 member countries must accept the $926 million as payment in full and agree not to keep billing for the remaining arrears. The United Nations says Washington owes nearly $1.6 billion, using different calculations and counting expenses that the United States has refused to pay for political reasons.
* The United States' share of the United Nations budget must be trimmed to 22 percent from 25 percent, which Washington has been paying for years.
* The United States' share of peacekeeping costs must be cut to 25 percent from 31 percent.
* The United Nations budget cannot include any growth in spending, even allowing for inflation. The budget has not risen in dollar terms since since 1994, said Catherine O'Neill, the director of the United Nations office in Washington.
The United States is the biggest contributor to the United Nations but also its biggest debtor, accounting for more than 60 percent of the total owed by member countries.
Losing the General Assembly vote for nonpayment would not affect the United States' seat and vote in the Security Council or its veto power as one of the council's five permanent members. But the loss of the assembly vote would be a setback to the nation's prestige and influence in the organization, which has been declining as the arrears pile up.
The debt was on the minds of a group of lawmakers who visited the United Nations headquarters today.
"I think it is tragic that we will have not paid our dues up to this point," Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, said. "I'm very embarrassed about it."
Representative Sam Gejdenson, Democrat of Connecticut, said the effect of the new legislation would not be seen until it was in draft language. "My understanding from conversation with folks in Washington is that we will be able to fulfill our obligations," he said. "It would be truly outrageous that after all this time we still don't pay our bills."
The senior administration official said some provisions in the Helms-Biden legislation, like reducing the United States' share of the United Nations' cost, might be possible once Washington offered the money. "If we have a check in hand," the senior official said, "the climate for reforms will be greatly improved."
