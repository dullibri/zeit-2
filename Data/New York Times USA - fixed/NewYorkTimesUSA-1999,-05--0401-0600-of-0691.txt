HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Goldman Sachs tries something new: promoting itself to the public as a brand worth knowing.

BYLINE: By Joseph Kahn 

 BODY:
GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, which went public earlier this month when it sold shares, plans to go public again, this time with its first global advertising campaign.
Beginning with ads this week in print outlets worldwide, Goldman intends to define itself as the blue-chip investment bank that listens -- and never gives the same advice twice to its corporate clients. All its advertising will carry the same tag line: "Unrelenting Thinking." 
 The campaign will not catch competitors flat-footed. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Merrill Lynch & Company, Citigroup, J. P. Morgan and many others heavily outspend Goldman to market their brands. Indeed, many of these firms have recently introduced new ad programs.
Goldman, however, has long been a happy enigma, known by its clients but largely inscrutable to outsiders. Visitors have to look hard to find the Goldman name on its headquarters at 85 Broad Street in downtown Manhattan. Like all investment banks, Goldman promotes deals it is involved in with staid print ads, known as tombstones, in the financial press. But rarely has it tried to define itself publicly or reduce its mission to a pithy phrase.
Goldman executives insist that the timing of the campaign is purely coincidental with the stock offering earlier this month. But both are part of the firm's plan to emerge from its shell. It faces increasingly tough competition from investment banks that often have more capital and much bigger ad budgets.
"With all the noise out there, it's good to remind people who we are and how we do business," said David W. May, Goldman's vice president for global marketing. "We need to have a consistent presence for the brand regardless of market conditions."
Goldman declined to comment in detail on the campaign, citing Securities and Exchange Commission rules about seeking publicity just after a public stock offering.
As might be expected for a firm where employees have only recently begun to wear blue Oxford shirts instead of the once uniform white, Goldman's ads are tame and understated. By Madison Avenue standards, the message is subtle.
One print ad features identical twins. The caption reads: "If we ever find two companies that are exactly alike, we'll offer two recommendations that are exactly alike."
Another shows a wide-eyed man at a hair salon examining his pointy coiffure. The text: "An honest opinion. Extremely rare when asking about a future spouse, a new haircut, or whether you should sell your company."
Goldman will spend about $10 million on the campaign this year, according to industry experts. The ads, designed by Ammirati Puris Lintas of New York, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, will appear in publications like The Financial Times of London, The Economist, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and Business Week.
"The firm does not have a client base of 50 million people like some of our competitors," Mr. May said. "It has a very small target audience."
Most other Wall Street firms are also scrambling to put out a fresh message, especially after a series of mergers that reduced some well-known independent firms, like Smith Barney and Dean Witter, to subsidiaries of giant corporations.
Merrill Lynch, one of the financial industry's heaviest marketers, introduced a campaign in March that plays down its historic symbol, the bull, in favor of the abstract theme, "human achievement." Merrill plans to spend $75 million on that campaign alone.
And Morgan Stanley now uses as its corporate slogan "We measure success one investor at a time" -- the ad line of the old Dean Witter, the retail brokerage firm it merged with in 1997. The firm's overall ad spending is estimated by industry experts at more than $200 million.
Even Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, a smaller investment bank that is controlled by AXA's Equitable Companies, plans a significant marketing push after it sells shares in its on-line brokerage subsidiary, DLJ Direct, that would dwarf Goldman's outlay.
Brett Shevack, chief executive of Partners & Shevack/Wolf, an advertising agency in New York owned by the Wolf Group, said that Goldman needed to respond to the brand-building efforts of its rivals.
"They really need to pre-emptively brand the company vis a vis the competition," Mr. Shevack, whose agency does not represent any of the companies discussed here, said. "They're trying to communicate with a rarefied business population. But otherwise, it's no different than Tide. You have to distinguish yourself."
He said Goldman had an opportunity to achieve that while other firms are consolidating. Some well-honed brands, Mr. Shevack said, are getting lost in the merger mix.
"Many of the other firms are worried about how to maintain the equity they built up in their brands, while Goldman can approach it with a clean slate," he said.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: BEIJING;
Bombing May Have Hardened China's Line

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 17

 BODY:
China's leaders are continuing to condemn the United States in harsh terms as seeking global domination in the wake of the NATO attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, reflecting what may be an important shift in China's view of global politics.
A front-page commentary in today's People's Daily, the official newspaper of the governing Communist Party, said NATO's air assault in Yugoslavia was part of an American "global strategy for world hegemony." It charged that the United States was engaged in "a new form of colonialism," using pretexts like human rights to turn other countries into dependents. 
 The article called the air campaign an "aggressive war" that was "groundless in morality or law," part of a plot by the United States and its partners to destroy Yugoslavia, expand eastward and control all of Europe.
That portrayal of American intentions comes as China tellsthe student demonstrators against the United States to get back to work and urges Western companies to keep investing here. It contrasts with the more nuanced views expressed by leaders here in the last two years, before NATO began its air attacks to halt the persecution of Kosovo Albanians.
Previously, President Jiang Zemin praised President Clinton and said China was pursuing a "strategic partnership" with the United States despite disagreements over human rights, Taiwan and trade.
Even before China's embassy was attacked by mistake on the night of May 7, causing an outpouring of anti-American rage here, China strongly condemned NATO's military campaign.
NATO had bypassed the United Nations, where China has veto power -- a sign to China that its views were not respected. China also sees the bombing in Yugoslavia as a dangerous precedent for possible foreign involvement in Taiwan or Tibet.
In the last few days, China has said it hopes to continue building commercial ties with the United States despite the anti-Americanism in evidence last week as students stoned the American Embassy here. And life has returned to normal in Beijing.
But today's article and continued praise of a speech Mr. Jiang made last Thursday suggest that China may adopt a more assertive stance on international political issues.
Chinese defense experts are depicting the embassy bombing in Belgrade as the latest in a series of American steps intended to obstruct China's rise as a major power.
"The eastward expansion of NATO in Europe, the strengthening of the U.S.-Japanese military alliance in the Asian and Pacific region and the launching of the current aggression against Yugoslavia," People's Daily said, "all constitute an important step in the United States' strategy for world hegemony."
Thursday night, after eulogizing the three newspaper and news service employees killed in the Belgrade embassy as "revolutionary martyrs," Mr. Jiang made a statement that officials have since been instructed to study.
He pledged to stay on the path of economic reforms. But he also said, "The United States continues to pursue hegemonism and power politics, and wantonly interferes in the internal affairs of other countries."
Diplomats here are debating whether Mr. Jiang has had a true change of heart or is seeking to pre-empt military leaders and other hard-liners who feel that China has been too friendly with the United States. In either case, the official line on the United States has changed.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Shares End Mixed, With the Dow Dropping 59.85 Points

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock prices were mixed yesterday, in large part because of an afternoon rally in technology shares. But with Federal Reserve policy makers scheduled to meet today to discuss a possible increase in interest rates, investors were reluctant to make new commitments.
"Volume was low, as it should be when you don't know what you are looking at," said Michael Clark, head of United States stock trading at Credit Suisse First Boston.
Concern about interest rates rose significantly on Friday after the Government reported that consumer prices rose at their fastest clip in nine years during April.
The report sent stocks sharply lower on Friday, and broad-based selling continued when markets opened yesterday.
While stocks sensitive to the interest rate, like banks and financial service companies, suffered throughout the session, reports that Hewlett-Packard and Dell Computer were set to post better-than-expected quarterly earnings helped to stem the decline during the afternoon.
At the closing bell, the Dow Jones industrial average, down by 167 points at one point, stood at 10,853.47, a loss of 59.85 points, or six-tenths of a percent.
Broader indexes did better.
Bolstered by strong gains in Microsoft, America Online and Dell, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which had also been lower for much of the session, reversed course and closed up 1.69 points, or one-tenth of a percent, at 1,339.49. And the Nasdaq composite index gained 33.98 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,561.84.
"The technology stocks really turned things around," said Michael Molnar, a managing director in retail sales and trading at Salomon Smith Barney.
Despite the rally, most stocks had a tough day. Almost two stocks fell for every one that rose on the New York Stock Exchange, and 61 of the S.& P. 500's 89 industry groups declined.
On the Big Board, volume was light, at 679.7 million shares. On the Nasdaq market, 788 million shares changed hands.
Few analysts expect the Fed to raise interest rates today, but many think the central bank will signal that it is leaning toward a rate increase in the near future.
Most traders and analysts see a rate increase as an unqualified negative for the stock market. But Mr. Molnar said it could be beneficial.
"I don't think the market would necessarily view it as a negative," he said. "The selloff in the bond market has been so substantial that a surprise move by the Fed now might be seen as being preemptive. If anything, a pre-emptive move has more appeal than more waiting."
Financial services stocks, which are most sensitive to changes in interest rates, were losers yesterday. And auto stocks slumped after a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst said sales might have peaked.
Citigroup fell 1, to 70. J. P. Morgan slumped 4, to 135 15/16. Bank One declined 1 3/4, to 60 5/16. And Merrill Lynch lost 1 11/16, to 79 1/16.
Ford Motor was the biggest loser in the S.& P. 500, dropping 3 1/16, to 57 11/16. And General Motors, a Dow component, declined 2 13/16, to 80 5/16.
Rumors of a strong earnings report helped to send Hewlett-Packard's stock higher. The stock rose 4 9/16, to 88 3/4. After the close, the world's second-biggest computer maker reported quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street estimates.
Dell, which is expected to report its results today, was another good performer. It rose 2 1/16, to 43 1/4.
America Online was the most actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange, jumping 10 1/16, to 136.
Concern that the combination of U S West and Global Crossing will be closely scrutinized by regulators caused prices of both companies to fall yesterday.
U S West fell 4 1/8, to 58 1/8. Meanwhile, Global Crossing slipped 1 1/8, to 60 1/4.
Other long-distance companies gained. Qwest rose 6 1/8, to 90 7/8 and Level 3 Communications gained 3 15/16, to 88 1/2.

HEADLINE: Houses With High Ceilings;
Home Prices and Demand Soar, as 'For Sale' Signs Dwindle

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

DATELINE: WESTPORT, Conn., May 12

 BODY:
Jeri Kelley had a home buyer coming in 10 minutes. She tapped the customer's price range into the computer -- $450,000 to $480,000 -- to see what was available in this genteel town on Long Island Sound, home to Paul Newman, Martha Stewart and other luminaries.
"That's a disaster," she murmured to herself as listing after listing flashed on the screen. "That's a disaster. That's newer construction. That's a disaster." Quickly, she flipped through descriptions of seven houses, most apparently in bad condition and none fitting her client's idea of a dream house. 
 The annual spring mating dance between home buyer and seller is well under way, and the suburban real estate market is shaping up to be even more sizzling this year than last. Like the Dow Jones Industrial Average, home prices keep pushing into new territory. Brokers catch themselves describing an $825,000 house as "sweet," while reports of a $2 million-plus spread selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars above the asking price have lost their shock value.
For agents like Jeri Kelley, the combination of escalating prices and disappearing for-sale signs has made this season especially frenzied.
Many houses sell within hours of coming on the market, and there is big money to be made. Ms. Kelley, a Midwestern transplant with wintergreen eyes, sold $10 million worth of houses last year, her best ever. To celebrate, she treated herself to a BMW Z3 roadster, the zippy sports car made famous by James Bond in "Goldeneye." This year is looking even better.
The overheated atmosphere is intensified by the fact that inventory -- the industry's term for the availability of houses -- is the lowest it has been in recent memory. That situation can force a panicky buyer to pounce on a house that is not quite right. It can turn an otherwise honorable person into a dishonorable seller, one who accepts a higher offer after having agreed on a lower price. And it has made Ms. Kelley's already competitive world even more cutthroat, with realtors zealously guarding leads about new listings.
"It's a mean market -- it really is," she said.
But Ms. Kelley handles the pressure just fine. For the last two years, she has been the "top producer" among the 27 realtors affiliated with Country Living Associates in Westport. (Simply translated, she raked in the most money.) She achieved that, she says, by working six and sometimes seven days a week and keeping in touch with hundreds of former customers who often become future customers.
Many days find her in the midst of a high-wire act, like the Monday earlier this month when a $2.5 million sale hung in the balance. Twenty-four hours earlier she had shown several houses in Westport to an English couple with seven children. They were crazy about one of them, a seven-bedroom Mediterranean priced at $2.5 million.
The couple offered a respectable $2.2 million, but there were two other offers on the table, and the listing agent, the one representing the seller, told Ms. Kelley to tell her clients that they had 24 hours to come up with their "highest and best" offer. Ms. Kelley phoned the couple and suggested that they give the sellers their asking price and toss in $25,000 for good measure. The couple jumped but not quite that high. They met the list price and added an extra $10,000. They lost. "He said, 'Oh, my God,' " Ms. Kelley recalled. "They really wanted this house."
Today, Ms. Kelley had something of a breather from the bidding wars that have grown so commonplace. But she was in overdrive nonetheless, her day parsed into tight half-hour appointments. One of her less glamorous stops was the Weston Town Hall, where she darted into the tax assessor's office to make sure a house she hoped to market was in good standing.
Earlier in the day, she had been laboring at her computer in her office. One of the most powerful weapons in the real-estate business is knowledge of the market, and to that end Ms. Kelley makes notes in her computer after every listing she sees. When something comes back on the market, as it is bound to do, she can look up the address in her file to jog her memory. Over the years, she has amassed 1,395 entries for Westport alone.
The style of her notations sound like that of typical real estate ads. But often the content is unlike anything one would see in the classifieds. One entry for a $479,000 house on the market in 1996 read: "A joke at the price. Nasty rambling ranch." A notation about a current listing for $389,000 was more haikulike: "Smells, mess, not on riverside."
Next on her itinerary was an 8,900-square-foot Colonial, brand new but built to look old, with paneled wainscotting, six fieldstone fireplaces, seven full baths and an emergency generator. "I could live in the laundry room," Ms. Kelley cooed. The price: $3,995,000. She knows a couple from New Jersey who might like it, but she needed to make sure the three-acre property offered enough privacy.
She had already whisked the couple through seven houses, ranging in price from $800,000 to $2.3 million, but nothing had clicked. "The husband said, 'Find me a house that needs work, and I'll put in $2 million, or find me a house that's ready and I'll pay $3 million,"' she recalled. "It drives you crazy because there's so much you can show them."
A while later, en route to her office, Ms. Kelley passed the builder of the mansion, Michael Greenberg, whose work she describes as the best in Fairfield County. "Is it still available?" she called from her car window to his. "Barely," he said, with a slight grin. "We're negotiating."
For the last several years, the real estate market both in Manhattan and in its suburbs has grown stronger each spring, with low-interest rates and the buoyant economy receiving most of the credit. Real estate agents also cite an uptick in company transfers, a relatively mild winter and changes in the Federal tax law that benefit home sellers.
From Westchester County to Long Island, the story is the same: home sales were up in the first three months of this year, as were average sales prices, but availability was sharply down. "The inventory declined by the double digits again," said P. Gilbert Mercurio, executive vice president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors. "It's at historic lows. People are not putting properties on the market fast enough to replenish what has been sold."
In Nassau County, the number of homes for sale plummeted to 3,806 in the first three months of this year from 6,003 during the same period last year, according to the Long Island Multiple Listing Service.
In Westchester, where home sales increased by 13 percent over the previous first quarter, there were 4,869 residential listings during the first three months of this year, compared with 6,598 during the same period last year and 8,641 in 1997. In Fairfield, where countywide statistics were not available, local real estate boards reported similar trends.
With so few properties on the market, realtors are in a race to get their customers on the phone after touring open houses, events that represent their weekly opportunity to scope out new listings. On Tuesday, Ms. Kelley had seen a dozen houses in four hours, and, as always, she moved fast.
"You call from the car, from your home, wherever you can, and you say to your client, 'I have a great house but you need to get out here right now and see it,' " she explained. "But 600 other brokers are doing the same thing for their clients."
Many of her clients are couples in their 20's and early 30's in search of a house in the $800,000-and-up range. The husbands typically work in the financial industry; half the wives work outside the home. What amazes Mrs. Kelley is how many young people are also looking in the $2 million price bracket.
Unlike buyers who purchased homes during the real estate boom of the 1980's, she said, couples today seem to be less concerned about the possibility that they are buying at the peak of the market.
"People are more willing to go out there and buy something they like whereas investment was more key a decade ago," she said. "I remember husbands would look at their wives and say, 'Now don't get emotional. This is just an investment.' I don't hear that now."
Applying just the right amount of pressure can be tricky. Ms. Kelley knows her customers will lose the house if they dilly-dally. She also knows they will have buyer's remorse if they act rashly.
One couple earlier this spring saw a house in Weston in the morning, made a bid on it in the afternoon and had their bid accepted a few hours later. But by nightfall, their whispering doubts about the yard were shouting, and they called Ms. Kelley to renege.
"It's like walking into Lord & Taylor and you see a dress on a mannequin and you buy it," she said. "Then you get home and you try it on and say, 'Oh, God, this is the pits.' "
This afternoon, Ms. Kelley took out a teacher from southern Westchester County who was in search of a new house that offered more land and lower taxes. A few days earlier, the woman, who asked that her name not be used, had fallen for a $439,000 Cape Cod in Norwalk, with a pool and a pond. She and her husband, a banker, had made a low bid by today's standards, meaning they did not meet the asking price. But it had been their first time house-hunting in the area, and the teacher was eager to get a better sense of the market.
After seeing five houses in the $450,000 to $480,000 range, she still liked the Cape best, and she was figuring out a way to raise their offer.
As the shadows started to lengthen, Ms. Kelley headed back to the office to check a few things before calling it a day. "I usually go home and tell my husband that he can take me out to dinner," she said.
But restaurants are not the relaxing places they once were. This spring, while Ms. Kelley and her husband were talking shop over dinner, a couple who was eavesdropping suddenly butted in. "They asked me if I knew anything about Westport," she said. "They were looking to buy something. I gave them my card. You never know."

HEADLINE: General Dynamics to Acquire Gulfstream

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
The General Dynamics Corporation, a military contractor that specializes in making nuclear submarines, surface ships and tanks, announced yesterday that it would acquire the Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, a maker of corporate jets, for $5.3 billion in a deal that returns General Dynamics to a business it once shed.
The Gulfstream acquisition, a one-for-one stock swap that would give General Dynamics shares to Gulfstream shareholders, would add a new and potentially cyclical business to the General Dynamics line, which is heavily laden with armaments that are steady cash generators. 
 It would also move General Dynamics back to the aerospace industry, a business it stepped away from in the early 1990's when it sold Cessna Aircraft, a maker of business jets, to Textron and when it sold its F-16 fighter jet operations to Lockheed Martin as well as its missile division to Hughes Electronics.
The deal for Gulfstream elicited a mixed reaction on Wall Street. General Dynamics tumbled nearly 10 percent, or $6.1875, to $65.25, after having traded as low as $63.25 by midday. Still, while many on Wall Street were skeptical about the deal, others said Gulfstream would add a strong cash generator to the company, even if it took General Dynamics in a new direction.
"The deal makes a lot of sense from a financial perspective," said Pierre Chao, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "General Dynamics is adding a company with a solid background and great cash flow, which will allow them to fuel further defense acquisitions." He said the market was forgetting that General Dynamics used to be in the aerospace business.
Nicholas D. Chabraja, General Dynamics's chief executive, said Gulfstream "is well within our core competencies and one of the strategic areas where I said we would move."
He added that the company still had executives responsible for efficiencies in aircraft "and can help Gulfstream with its internal plans."
"This company hit us right in the gut as a very nice opportunity and a very fine company," he said.
Skeptics, however, wondered why General Dynamics would consider taking on a business-jet company at what may be the top of a decadelong business expansion. But, they acknowledged that a trend in the business-jet business toward fractional ownership, or a type of corporate time-share, should protect Gulfstream from the next economic downturn. Gulfstream currently has a $4 billion backlog of orders.
"General Dynamics's business may be boring, but they make a lots of cash," said Jon Kutler, president of Quarterdeck Investment Partners, a Los Angeles-based aerospace advisory firm. "Gulfstream is a commercial business that is being acquired near the top of a business cycle. It's a lot more volatile, although less volatile since the advent of fractional ownership. This is one that investors are scratching their heads over. But I think extremely highly of the General Dynamics management team, so you are willing to give them the benefit of the doubt on this one."
Gulfstream was bought for $825 million by the New York leveraged buyout firm of Forstmann Little & Company, which took the company public in 1996 and still owns 23 percent of the stock. The firm expects to gain a total of about $3 billion in cash and General Dynamics stock from the deal, which is expected to close in 90 to 120 days, assuming it gets shareholder and regulatory approval, as expected.
The current value of the Gulfstream acquisition was based on last Friday's closing price. The final price will be based on General Dynamics share price on the day the deal closes. The deal can be canceled if General Dynamics shares fell below $63 a share in the 15 days before the deal's closing.
"General Dynamics is not a company that makes ships, it's a company that makes money, and it will diversify into those areas that add to that," said Loren Thompson, an industry analyst at the Lexington Institute, an Arlington, Va., research firm. "Gulfstream has a superior backlog of orders; it's an area where General Dynamics has a long history and a lot of current management talent and, with the anticipated expansion of Pentagon spending, General Dynamics is not buying it at the top of its own business cycle."
Earlier this year, the Government blocked an attempt by General Dynamics to buy Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. for $1.4 billion, citing antitrust grounds. Mr. Chabraja of General Dynamics said of the two deals, "They were both perking along at the same time, and we were fully prepared to do both."
General Dynamics, based in Falls Church, Va., which earned $364 million last year, or $2.86 a share, on sales of $5 billion, said Gulfstream would increase 1999 earnings by 25 cents a share and 2000 earnings by 35 cents a share. Gulfstream, based in Savannah, Ga., earned $225.3 million in 1998 on revenue of $2.4 billion.

HEADLINE: Merger Is Set By Makers of Farm Machines

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 17

 BODY:
The deal that was struck today to combine the Case Corporation and New Holland N.V., two of the world's largest makers of farm and construction equipment, is just the latest effort to consolidate an embattled farm industry.
Although the United States economy remains robust, the sharp drop in commodity prices that began just over a year ago has jolted nearly every company in the agriculture business, and many have chosen to combine in mergers that promise to cut costs and bring renewed hope to investors. 
 The deal making, of course, has raised concerns among some farm organizations that fear the long-term effects of a highly concentrated industry in which corporate farms dominate and smaller farmers have fewer and fewer choices.
But a host of companies tied to the agriculture market -- from seed and fertilizer concerns to tractor makers and farm cooperatives -- are rethinking the way they do business and finding ways to team up.
In the last year alone, DuPont, which has been moving aggressively to establish a position in the life-sciences business, has acquired Pioneer Hi-Bred, the world's largest seed company; Cargill and Continental Grain, the two largest grain traders, agreed to merge in November. And just last week, Farmland Industries and Cenex Harvest States, two of the nation's largest food cooperatives, agreed to join forces, creating a company with $20 billion in revenue.
Today, it was Case and New Holland officials saying that new synergies and productivity gains would create an awesome combination with the kind of global heft that would make the new entity a strong rival to Deere & Company, the world's largest maker of farm equipment.
Case and New Holland had been suffering, like other farm equipment makers, through what analysts say is a nearly 25 percent drop in the sales of farm equipment the last year, with little expectation that the farm economy would improve much this year. Profits are down substantially from a year ago, and the stocks of both companies had been sharply depressed in recent months.
So today's deal, one that calls for New Holland, which is 71 percent owned by Fiat of Italy, to pay about $4.3 billion, or $55 a share, for Case suggests that restructuring at a time when globalization is all the rage was simply not enough for the farm equipment makers, according to analysts. There needed to be a bigger company to restructure.
The new company, which had combined sales of nearly $12 billion in 1998, will be based in Racine, Wis., where Case is now based. Jean-Pierre Rosso, the chief executive at Case who will head the new company, said at a news conference here that he expected the company to save up to $500 million annually within the next four years. The company will sell both the Case and New Holland lines of tractors, combines and construction equipment. But administrative and other operations will be fused and financial services outfits united in a company that will soon be renamed.
"This is all about cutting costs," said Lisa Shalett, who covers the farm equipment industry for Sanford C. Bernstein. "This is a huge deal, but we won't see one of these for a while; this was the last stroke in an evolutionary consolidation of the farm equipment industry."
Wall Street analysts say that because the agriculture industry is already so highly concentrated and because the Justice Department is scrutinizing this concentration, it is unlikely there will be other such deals.
Bold moves by Monsanto, DuPont, Cargill and several meat packers, including IBP, have also raised concern among farmers in recent years.
"We have very grave concerns about this whole concentration trend because when there is that kind of concentration, those with power exert more power," said Gene Paul, president of the National Farmers Organization in Ames, Iowa. "There are that many fewer buyers that we can buy from."
Mr. Paul said that his organization is most concerned about grain companies and food processors, but that the general trend is troublesome and one that farmers organizations are pushing the Justice Department to look into.
Todd J. Duvick, a food industry analyst at Bank of America, said the deal between Case and New Holland might be seen in its broadest context as a result of a farm economy that could remain depressed for some time because of a weak outlook for commodity prices around the globe and changes related to the Freedom to Farm Act.
Low commodity prices and pressures from big retailers are squeezing farmers and middlemen, thereby reaching suppliers of farm products and equipment. And that, he said, was what led to the Case-New Holland deal, which was brokered by Credit Suisse First Boston, Goldman, Sachs and Lazard Freres.
"All of this is tied together," Mr. Duvick said. "This is a new era in agriculture, one in which we've already seen a major consolidation of the industry."

HEADLINE: Winnick Weaves Single Trans-Atlantic Cable Into Communications Empire

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 17

 BODY:
Two years ago, Gary Winnick, a financier with little experience in telecommunications, undertook a project to lay an optical fiber cable across the Atlantic Ocean.
Overnight, Mr. Winnick has become the telecommunications industry's newest, and by far one of its richest superstars. 
 With its announcement today that it is merging with U S West Inc., Mr. Winnick's company, Global Crossing Ltd. has entered the ranks of the nation's major telecommunications companies.
And Mr. Winnick has parlayed his initial personal investment of $15 million in the trans-Atlantic cable into a roughly 25 percent stake in Global Crossing worth more than $6 billion. That will make Mr. Winnick, 51, the largest shareholder in the company formed by the merger.
The stunning rise of Mr. Winnick and of Global Crossing is at least partly a result of investor frenzy for anything related to the Internet. Global Crossing's stock, which was priced at a split-adjusted $9.50 when first offered to the public Aug. 14, closed today at $60.25.
But Mr. Winnick, a former aide to Michael R. Milken, has been quick to seize upon the opportunity provided by the soaring stock to build an empire through mergers, not only with U S West but also with the Frontier Corporation, a long-distance company that Global Crossing agreed to acquire in March.
"I think he'd be the first to say he didn't envision what you see today," said Lodwrick M. Cook, the co-chairman of Global Crossing with Mr. Winnick. But he added: "He saw the opportunity to build quickly. He's the driving force behind the whole thing."
Mr. Winnick, who prefers to operate behind the scenes, agreed. "Sometimes things happen," he said. "But you need to get to the plate to have things happen."
Mr. Winnick is described by those who know him as a master salesman with a quick wit. He is also driven, even conducting evening business meetings while exercising on the treadmill in his Beverly Hills office, with company executives sitting around him. While Global Crossing is supposedly based in Bermuda, its executives work in Beverly Hills in the same building used by Pacific Capital Group, Mr. Winnick's investment firm.
He has been willing to spread the instant wealth his company has generated in order to quickly do mergers and recruit experienced executives. "He's actually one of those businessmen who does go for the win-win situation," said an investment banker who has worked with him. "He's not looking for the last nickel on the trade."
Mr. Winnick grew up in Roslyn, N.Y., and earned a degree in economics from C. W. Post College in Greenvale, N.Y. He worked in New York as a bond salesman for a predecessor of Drexel Burnham Lambert, and then transferred to the company's Los Angeles office in the late 1970's to become a close aide to Mr. Milken, who pioneered the market for junk bonds.
Mr. Winnick left Drexel in 1985, several years before the firm's collapse, to start his own investment fund, Pacific Asset Management. Mr. Milken was an investor in that fund, but he is not in Mr. Winnick's current company, Pacific Capital Group. Mr. Winnick was ordered by a court to testify in Mr. Milken's case in exchange for immunity from prosecution, but Mr. Milken, charged with violating securities laws, reached an agreement with prosecutors before the testimony took place.
Until Global Crossing, Mr. Winnick was a low-profile financier with mixed results. A furniture chain and a mattress company he bought in the late 1980's both declared bankruptcy within weeks of each other in 1991. He had more success with Ornda Healthcorp, a hospital company he sold to the Tenet Healthcare Corporation, and with Optel, a company that provided cable television service to apartments and was sold to Le Groupe Videotron. Mr. Winnick also owns a 27 percent stake in Playa Vista, a real estate development in Los Angeles in which Steven Spielberg's Dreamworks SKG will be building its studio.
Mr. Winnick said he was drawn to the trans-Atlantic cable project that became the seed of Global Crossing because deregulation and new technology are opening the telecommunications industry to new players.
Pacific Capital turned to CIBC World Markets, part of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, to finance most of the $750 million needed for the project. Funds associated with CIBC now own about 94 million shares in Global Crossing, worth $5.66 billion, making the transaction "without a doubt" the most profitable investment the company has ever made, said Dean Kehler, managing director and co-head of the high-yield group at CIBC World Markets.
Most undersea cables had been installed by consortiums of big telephone companies. With less bureaucracy, Global Crossing was able to move quickly, and finished the cable in time to catch a huge spurt of demand generated by the Internet.
"There was a huge pent-up demand and there was not enough capacity to meet it," said Michael Ruddy, a fiber optic analyst with Pioneer Consulting in Cambridge, Mass. Global Crossing fashioned itself as a carrier's carrier, selling capacity to telephone companies, not to end users. With the success of that first cable, still the only one the company has in operation, Mr. Winnick decided to turn that one project into a company and to build a worldwide network of trans-oceanic and terrestrial fiber optic cables linking the world's major cities.
Its agreements to merge with Frontier and U S West move Global Crossing toward becoming a full-fledged telecommunications carrier, serving both the retail and wholesale markets. That could add risks because other carriers, now its competitors, will be more reluctant to buy transmission capacity from Global.
Mr. Winnick has positioned Global to be a major telecommunications player by hiring a team of experienced executives, all of whom have become wealthy. Mr. Winnick has given stock to everyone in the company and to others close to him, including his housekeeper. Former President George W. Bush accepted stock in lieu of an $80,000 fee for making a speech at a Global Crossing event. That stock is now worth millions of dollars.
Mr. Cook, who had retired as chief executive of the Atlantic Richfield Company, was brought on early as vice chairman. Earlier this year, Mr. Winnick recruited Robert Annunziata, who had founded and built Teleport Communications, a company acquired by AT&T for $12 billion last year.
The recruiting has made Global Crossing top heavy by conventional standards, with two chairmen, two vice chairmen, a chief executive and a separate president. Mr. Winnick has been content to let others have the titles, knowing that he is the owner. But those involved in the company say there is little doubt about who is in charge.
Indeed, Mr. Winnick will not have an executive position in the company after it merges with U S West. Mr. Annunziata and Solomon D. Trujillo, the head of U S West, will be co-chairmen and co-chief executives. Mr. Winnick would not comment on his role in the combined company, but others say he will be on the board and remain a power behind the scenes.
"I don't think he'll ever turn his back on Global," Mr. Cook said. "He will do other things, yes, but he will be involved in Global."

HEADLINE: THE ISRAELI VOTE: THE OVERVIEW;
ISRAELIS CHOOSE A NEW LEADER AND REMAKE THEIR PARLIAMENT

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Tuesday, May 18

 BODY:
Israelis overwhelmingly elected Ehud Barak, the Labor Party leader, as their Prime Minister on Monday, rejecting the tumultuous leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, whose galvanizing character has dominated Israel for three years.
In a complete reshuffling of the political deck, Israelis also remade their Parliament: The right wing withered as the center grew with four new parties, changing the balance of power. 
 Because Mr. Barak can now assemble a large bloc of secular parties, he could form a Government without any ultra-Orthodox representation. The ultra-Orthodox appear to have lost their exclusive role as a swing vote between left and right; instead, Russian immigrants and other centrists may exercise that power.
By this morning, with 99.9 percent of the ballots counted, Mr. Barak had 56 percent of the vote, to Mr. Netanyahu's 43.9 percent. Today was the second time that Israel had elected a Prime Minister directly. Mr. Barak now has 45 days in which to form a Government.
A highly decorated former general, Mr. Barak, 57, is a dovish hawk in the image of his assassinated mentor, Yitzhak Rabin, and the vote is a resounding call for a revival of the languishing peace effort between Israelis and Palestinians.
"If Yitzhak is looking down on us from where he may, he knows that we together will fulfill his legacy," Mr. Barak said in his victory speech. "We need to strengthen our country's security by moving forward to peace agreements."
Mr. Barak also sounded a call for unity. "It is my intention to be everyone's Prime Minister," he said. "All of Israel is part of each of us, and we extend a courageous hand to all, to secular and religious, to those of Ashkenazi and of Sephardic background, to those who immigrated from the former Soviet Union and from Ethiopia, to the Arabs, the Bedouins and the Circassians."
Within 35 minutes of the first television exit polls, before Mr. Barak made any comment, Mr. Netanyahu not only conceded defeat, American-style, but stepped down as the leader of the conservative Likud Party.
In the West Bank and Gaza, Palestinian officials gloated over the political demise of a leader whom they considered hostile. The Israeli radio reported open celebrations in the office of Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, who called to congratulate the new Israeli Prime Minister.
"Netanyahu fell into the trash bin of history," Fraih Abu Meddien, the Palestinians' justice minister, said in an interview in Gaza. "He will be gone forever and good riddance. He's a racist and no other Israeli leader will ever be as bad as he was. The Palestinian people were patient for three years through his arrogance. We helped bring him down. We are the ones who made this statue fall."
Shortly before midnight in Tel Aviv, a huge celebration erupted in Yitzhak Rabin Square, the site of the Prime Minister's assassination. With mixed emotions, tens of thousands of mostly young Israelis both cheered Mr. Barak's victory and lighted candles in a release of pent-up sorrow over Mr. Rabin's death in 1995.
"Rabin, we have won!" they shouted repeatedly into the balmy evening air, crying and hugging each other.
At the Tel Aviv Hilton Hotel, a few miles away, Mr. Netanyahu, a fixture in Israeli politics for 15 years, strode off the political stage quickly, cleanly, and with cordial congratulations to his opponent. Flanked by his wife, Sarah, and by a grim Ariel Sharon, his Foreign Minister, Mr. Netanyahu addressed weeping supporters with a seemingly serene look on his face.
"The nation decided and we respect that decision," Mr. Netanyahu said, stunning his audience, which is unaccustomed to the sight of their Prime Minister conceding anything. "That is the way it has to be in a democracy."
Mr. Netanyahu possibly chose to step down as party leader before he is pushed by several rivals. His Likud Party, traditionally one of the two major parties, suffered from his collapse: In 1996 Likud held 32 seats of the 120 seats in Parliament, but won only 19 this time.
Many defectors left for Shas, the ultra-Orthodox Sephardic party. In a stunning gain, Shas seems to have garnered six new seats in Parliament, giving it about 17, making it the third largest party after Likud and Labor, which lost seats, election analysts said.
But a larger representation for Shas does not mean more power. "Shas is in for four lean years now," Shahar Ilan, a religion reporter for the newspaper Haaretz said today, "whether it is a barely wanted coalition partner or whether it remains outside."
While Shas had endorsed Mr. Netanyahu, it has swung between left and right governments before as a supporter of the peace effort.
But in these elections and probably in the new Parliament, Russian immigrants, who seem to have split their ballots between the two candidates, represented the swing vote.
"We resisted all efforts to take sides," Natan Sharansky, leader of the Russians' Yisrael Baaliyah Party, said in an interview. "We were the party of the new immigrants, but now we can be considered simply as the one real moderate force, like a bridge between secular and nonsecular, left and right."
He added, "Look, I'm sorry for Bibi, we're old friends." He said the defeat of Mr. Netanyahu was "mainly personal, not ideological."
But part of Mr. Netanyahu's defeat did appear to be a rejection of the right wing's agenda on the peace effort, which is widely perceived as obstructionist. Most Israelis not only endorse the peace effort but also accept that a Palestinian state is inevitable.
According to a beeper message from the Prime Minister's office, President Clinton sent him a message: "I appreciate the hard work you did. You're a strong man with a strong historical awareness and we all believe you will be back." Mr. Netanyahu responded, "Thank you very much, but I'm taking a long vacation."
Reporters joked that it took Mr. Netanyahu's resignation to get Mr. Clinton, whose Administration has been critical of him, to call.
The people were less restrained. Many Israelis drove through the nighttime streets beeping their horns. "As soon as Bibi said he was resigning, the champagne came out, as did the pistachios, cake and popcorn," said Lisa Feinmesser, 51, an administrative assistant in Jersualem. "We're so sick of the man."
Looking drawn and defeated, Gila Gamliel, a 24-year-old Likudnik who lost her bid for Parliament, said, "Despite the great accomplishments of the Government, everyone was against us and against the Prime Minster out of personal hatred."
Mr. Barak, a kibbutz-born Israeli who spent 35 years in the army and retired as Chief of Staff, is brainy and complex. He has a centered confidence in his own judgments, which are based, like those of any serious military strategist, as much on input as on intuition.
He has conducted his campaign like a military exercise. Building on a network of army buddies, he revitalized the Labor Party's aging infrastructure with a far more professional campaign on the ground. In the last month, "One Israel" banners and workers have been far more highly visible than those of Likud.
Mr. Barak also relied on layers of American consultants, including two top American pollsters, who field-tested every question raised by Mr. Barak about the mood of the Israeli public and the sectors within it.
He personally sought to commandeer a remake of the Labor Party, which is traditionally both leftist and elitist in a peculiarly Israeli combination, into a party of the center. He ran at the head of the One Israel coalition, forged with Meimad, a moderate Orthodox group, and the Sephardic Gesher Party of David Levy, the Moroccan-born former Foreign Minister for Mr. Netanyahu.
As a moderate at the helm of the left, Mr. Barak sees himself following the lead of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. His political advertising has stressed his military background, which includes a string of derring-do missions that are an integral part of Israeli legend. His campaign has repeatedly broadcast images of him as his troops liberated a Sabena airplane from Palestinian terrorists in 1972, for instance.
He has said he would move quickly to kick-start the moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace effort, to plan the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon and to reopen negotiations with Syria over Lebanon and the Golan Heights.
Before the elections, many Israelis said they considered Mr. Barak and Mr. Netanyahu to be cut from the same cloth, as Ashkenazi members of the elite who both served in the same military unit and both studied in the United States. The Israelis said they were confused about what differentiated the men's stands on peace, since both said they supported a tough peace with security.
Mr. Netanyahu's Government was dissolved in December, and the peace effort was frozen and important economic and governmental decisions were deferred.
The two men hold very different views about Israel's position:
Mr. Netanyahu believes Israel to be in a constant state of threat from its Arab neighbors, approaches them with suspicion and has refused to make concessions until concessions were given.
Mr. Barak, on the other hand, sees Israel as the strongest country in a tough neighborhood, negotiating from an advantage of greater military might, higher economic standing and a sounder, more democratic political system. He says that peace agreements must be reached before conditions are perfect.
"I want to give a new momentum to peace agreements," he said in an interview in April. "I'm not going to compromise any of our vital interest. I will definitely fight against terror: I did it all my life. But I learned during many years -- decades -- of fighting that the right way to bring about personal security to Israelis and overall security to Israel is through peace agreement with our neighbors."
Israelis cast two ballots, one for the direct election of the Prime Minister, the other for one of 31 parties running for the Parliament.
Four and a quarter million Israelis voted, almost all the adults in the country. Voter turn-out is always high here. Official statistics put it at 80 percent this time but, given that about 10 percent of the population lives abroad and there are no absentee ballots, the figure is closer to 90 percent of eligible residents.
All the passion that has been missing from the campaign poured into the streets today. Election Day is a holiday, and it was festive, like a summer block party. At every junction, children held plastic banners, and balconies across the country were strung with huge photographs of Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Barak.

HEADLINE: The Latest in Automotive Fashion Calls for Mix and Match

BYLINE: By JIM McCRAW; Jim McCraw is a freelance automotive writer based in Detroit.

 BODY:
HORTICULTURISTS have given us better-tasting tomatoes, more beautiful, hardier roses and more prolific varieties of corn by creating hybrids -- marrying the best traits of two or more strains again and again until the desired result is achieved.
But now the hybrid has come to the automotive industry. We're not talking about hybrids with diesel-electric, gasoline-electric or fuel-cell engines. These are new vehicles with regular gasoline engines, many of which are already in showrooms. 
 The first true hybrid was the American minivan, invented by Chrysler in 1984 as a combination of a front-wheel-drive car, a delivery van and a station wagon. Shorter and smaller than a delivery van and easier to load, it drove as a car did and acted in the manner of a station wagon, without the suburban-family, wood-trim baggage. Now this hybrid is as mainstream as a sedan.
Perhaps the best example of a forthcoming new-age hybrid is the Lincoln Blackwood, arriving on the market in a year or so. It has the face and the front two-thirds of a Lincoln Navigator four-door luxury sport utility vehicle. There are four leather bucket seats inside, lots of expensive and exotic wood trim and all the usual Lincoln amenities. But behind the second row of bucket seats are a solid steel wall and a rear window, a pickup-truck bed with a hydraulically operated bed cover and, at the end of the bed, a pair of Dutch doors instead of a tailgate. The Blackwood is lower than the Navigator because it has only two-wheel drive.
So it's not a sport utility and it's not a luxury sedan (even though, on the inside, it looks just like one), and it's not exactly a pickup truck that you can just throw a load of bricks into. It's somewhere in between, a luxury utilitruck.
Another recent hybrid is the Chrysler PT Cruiser, which will be offered for sale later this year. It's essentially a 2000 Plymouth Neon front-drive sedan chassis with a retro, late-1930's, four-door sedan body adapted to it. Five inches shorter in length but seven inches taller, the PT Cruiser offers almost 17 cubic feet more interior space and a flat rear hatch. It has a multifunctional interior the size and shape of a minivan's.
It's not a Neon; it's not a hot rod, and it's not a van. It's somewhere in between, a neo-van.
There are still other hybrids coming onto the market. Ford has shown its Explorer Sport Trac, a four-door sport utility with a pickup bed in place of the third seat, and Nissan has shown its S.U.T., or Sport Utility Truck, a truck/sport utility hybrid very similar in concept to the Sport Trac. Both will serve the market that wants full-size seating for four or more people, plus four-wheel-drive and storage space in back.
Too small to be called crew-cabs (large pickups with four full doors and a full bed), but packing plenty of space and utility, these are sport utilitrucks. They will be joined later this year by the Dodge Dakota four-door pickup truck.
Then there are the small, boxy sport utilities built up from front-wheel-drive passenger-car platforms. These include the Honda CR-V, the Subaru Forester and the Toyota RAV-4, which use the Civic, Legacy and Camry platforms, respectively, to make trucks out of cars.
They aren't cars, though they have passenger-car underpinnings, and they're not true sport utilities because they don't offer the extra equipment for tough going off-road. But they do have four-wheel-drive, tall bodies, roof racks and rear cargo room. They could be called sport-cutes, mini-utes or utilicars.
Isuzu, the Japanese subsidiary of General Motors, has a pair of very interesting hybrids, one on the market and one in the concept stage. The first is the 2000 VehiCross, so named because it is a cross between a three-door sport utility vehicle, a sporty coupe and a gigantic running shoe.
Driven by design rather than function, it has enormous B-pillars (the pieces of metal between the front and rear side windows), trapezoidal rear side windows and polypropylene panels all the way around the bottom half, with a big plastic grille section to match. It looks very different from the average compact sport utility. It's difficult to enter or exit the rear seat, and difficult to see through the rear window. One expert calls it "the Camaro of sport utilities."
The other, more dramatic Isuzu hybrid is the VX-O2, which was shown for the first time last month at the New York Auto Show. The VX-O2 has an upper half that looks like that of a 50's two-seat sport roadster, including streamlined headrests, and a bottom half that is a VehiCross four-wheel-drive S.U.V. It looks like a sports car, but it has only two doors, no rear hatch for cargo and no roof rack. So it's not a sport utility; it's an off-roadster, something in between a roadster and a sport utility.
AUTOMOTIVE manufacturers are interested in hybrids because they may attract new, in-between customers who are not in the market for the original or source vehicle, like the Navigator, and whose needs are better served by the hybrid. This way, manufacturers can say, "Yeah, we have that," no matter how idiosyncratic the request.
Hybrids are also relatively inexpensive to produce. The pricey engineering and development have already been done on the source vehicle, and the new parts, like the sheet metal and pickup beds, can be adapted from existing models or made cheaply. They can be built in low volumes on existing assembly lines from many existing parts, providing economies of scale and thus good profit margins.
ED MOLCHANY, the Explorer Sport Trac brand manager at Ford, the company that sells more sport utilities than any other, says of the forthcoming Sport Trac: "We're always researching what customers want, and we think we've found something, a demand that's not being met out there right now. The Sport Trac will broaden the whole S.U.V. segment. A lot of people don't want to haul dirty things inside their S.U.V.'s, or they can't carry tall things. It's a little bit different need. We're trying to focus on needs more than just demographics."
Not everyone buys this argument. Jim Hall, the vice president of AutoPacific Group, a consulting firm in Detroit, says these so-called hybrids aren't adding units to the sales total; they're just different versions of vehicles already for sale. "Ford is making the truck market far less profitable," he said, "because they're niching the truck market with variations and permutations. The more of those you add, the less profit there is per unit. Initially, they may be able to price at a premium for them, and that's fine when you're the only player, but if you start to niche the market and other manufacturers respond, you may all be fighting over 50,000 units a year."
Mr. Hall said the Ford Sport Trac and Nissan S.U.T. are just scaled-down versions of vehicles already on the market: full-size crew-cab pickups with four doors and seating for six. He says they have limited utility because their shortened pickup beds will not carry a 4-by-8-foot sheet of plywood.
"These products, while they may have some market, ultimately combine the worst characteristics of sport utilities and pickup trucks," he said. "They don't have the secure storage area of a sport utility. Everything you carry is exposed to the elements, like a pickup truck, but they have the limited load space of a compact sport utility. If you're carrying manure, they're fine. These things aren't well thought out."
Mr. Hall added: "The manufacturers are all trying to find The Next Big Thing, and The Next Big Thing has never been a cross between two ideas. It has been a unique idea that stands on its own."

HEADLINE: CARS AND THE ENVIRONMENT;
Can Motor City Come Up With A Clean Machine?

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
WILLIAM C. FORD JR., the new 42-year-old chairman of the Ford Motor Company, became an environmentalist the way many baby boomers did. As a boy, he loved to hike, fish and go camping; he hated to revisit a spot only to find that someone else had made a mess of it. In high school, he volunteered to spend afternoons picking up trash along a nearby river. At Princeton University, he read books by radical environmentalists and stayed up late discussing how to save the earth.
Then he joined the family business as a vehicle-planning analyst in 1979, and got a shock when he tried to raise environmental concerns. "Coming to an old-line auto company, people looked at me like I was a Bolshevik for bringing it up, for even asking the questions," he said. 
 Whether the problems were air and water pollution from factories, or tailpipe emissions from the cars that came off the assembly lines, managers then had no interest in taking action, Mr. Ford said. As Ford's director of business strategy in the early 1990's, he sent out a memorandum calling a meeting on environmental policy -- only to be warned immediately by the company's lawyers that even writing the memorandum, much less holding the meeting, could be used against Ford in an environmental lawsuit.
On several occasions, Mr. Ford said, he reached the point where he told his wife that he was going to leave the company to form an environmentalist group. "My friends and my wife always convinced me that the impact I could have would be far greater if I stayed," said Mr. Ford, sitting in the same conference room where he had held his meeting on environmental policy over the lawyers' objections. "And they were right, ultimately, but they were more patient than I was."
After decades of often vociferous hostility toward the environmental movement, Ford Motor and the rest of the auto industry are beginning to show some interest in improving their records on pollution. While car makers are still capable of rousing the ire of environmentalists, notably by increasing their output of gas-guzzling but high-profit sport utility vehicles, attitudes within the industry are slowly but perceptibly changing.
A new generation of auto executives is taking charge, one that views environmental values as part of mainstream American life. Some, like Mr. Ford, are relatively young; some are older executives who have moved into the auto industry from other businesses, like detergent manufacturing, that came to terms with environmentalists long ago. While a few foreign auto makers, notably Honda, have touted their environmental records for years, domestic auto makers are just starting to see theirs as a marketing strength, giving them a financial incentive to compete on who can be greenest.
"Market survey after market survey tells us environmental issues are increasingly important to our customers," said Harry J. Pearce, the vice chairman of General Motors.
Until recently, virtually all of the auto industry's improvements were forced by Government regulation and were bitterly fought at every turn. To some extent, that is still the case; the industry fiercely opposes any tightening of fuel-economy regulations, for example, despite evidence that gasoline consumption contributes directly to global warming.
Yet now, many auto makers are also beginning to look for ways to clean up their factories and the vehicles they sell without waiting for regulators to step in. The main example so far has been Ford's decision, beginning with the 1999 model year, to make all its sport utility vehicles roughly as clean as cars, instead of continuing to exploit a loophole in Federal regulations that allows the off-road vehicles to emit several times more pollution per mile than cars do. Ford is also buying junkyards, with a plan to reuse more auto parts instead of letting them clog landfills.
Other auto makers are also taking voluntary steps. All of Honda's American-made Civics and Accords now meet California's strict emissions standard, and its Odyssey minivan and Passport sport utility vehicle have very low emissions, although the CR-V sport utility does not. DaimlerChrysler is working on a host of initiatives, like working on low-pollution synthetic diesel. And General Motors has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to develop and market an electric car, while helping the Nature Conservancy to buy and then preserve the habitats of rare species.
Perhaps most surprisingly, the auto industry did fairly little lobbying against the Clinton Administration's proposal earlier this month to require much lower tailpipe emissions, particularly from sport utility vehicles and pickups. Instead, it demanded, and got, new Federal regulations requiring oil companies to sell much cleaner gasoline -- a decision that will make it easier to produce clean-burning cars, but enraged the oil industry.
Environmentalists are divided on how much credit to give the auto makers. Some, like John DeCicco, the transportation program director at the Washington-based American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, are fairly generous. "The management of the auto industry is part of our American society, which has internalized environmental values over the last three decades," he said.
OTHERS are more dubious. One is Daniel Becker, a vocal critic of the auto industry for nearly a quarter-century, first as an aide to Ralph Nader, and now as the Sierra Club's director for energy policy and global warming. Mr. Becker said that Ford's decision to clean up its sport utility vehicles was the only significant, voluntary step that Detroit had taken in recent decades to improve the environment, and he questioned whether other steps would come soon.
The auto industry still bankrolls various groups, like the Coalition for Vehicle Choice, that criticize Federal fuel-economy rules and international efforts to limit global warming, Mr. Becker noted. Auto advertising executives continue trying to persuade Americans that relatively unregulated, high-profit sport utility vehicles are appropriate substitutes for cars, he said. Indeed, with profits on full-size sport utility vehicles running at $12,000 or more apiece, auto makers have increased production and sales in this category more than sixfold since the early 1990's. "In terms of policy decisions, in terms of product lines," Mr. Becker said, "I don't think the change has started in a dramatic way."
Auto industry leaders say they deserve more credit. John G. Smale, a marketer of soaps and detergents who became the chairman of Procter & Gamble and then of General Motors, said car makers had caught up with other businesses in understanding that environmental issues were important to consumers.
"I think G. M. was slower than P. & G., certainly in coming to that realization, but I think that's true of the rest of the industry too," said Mr. Smale, who is now chairman of the G. M. board's powerful executive committee. "I think, by and large now, the industry sees it the same way."
Nobody disputes that the sheer size of the auto industry makes it tremendously important to the environment. G. M., Ford and DaimlerChrysler are the world's three largest companies in terms of sales; their closest rivals are trading companies and retailers, which do not actually make the products they sell, followed by big oil companies. For all the attention that Internet and software companies receive, G. M. still has 11 times the sales of Microsoft and 22 times as many employees.
Without question, the most dramatic shift in environmental stance recently has been at Ford. Alexander Trotman, the company's chairman and chief executive until the end of last year, led auto industry criticisms of the efforts to limit global warming, questioning the scientific basis for environmentalists' concerns. He was also skeptical of moves to further reduce tailpipe emissions. The decision to build cleaner-burning sport utilities was led by another top Ford executive, Jacques Nasser, a 51-year-old ally of Mr. Ford's.
Mr. Trotman retired early this year, and Mr. Nasser replaced him as the company's chief executive; Mr. Ford became chairman. A great-grandson of Henry Ford's, he won the family's confidence to run the company, even though he was one of the younger members of the Fords' fourth generation. A nephew of Henry Ford 2d's, he had not grown up as heir apparent at the family-controlled company.
Mr. Ford and Mr. Nasser share a strong interest in the environment, although not necessarily the same interest in nature. The differences are apparent even in their offices. Mr. Ford's looks like a greenhouse: while one wall is a floor-to-ceiling window with a 20-mile view across metropolitan Detroit, most of the vista is obscured by potted ficus trees. More plants festoon the desk, coffee table and conference table, while the long shelf behind his desk is covered with peace lilies under special growing lights. "I need a machete," Mr. Ford quipped as he walked in.
MR. NASSER'S office next door is, by contrast, a desert. A single, small plant sits incongruously on the floor in front of a gigantic window as big as Mr. Ford's. The plant, which has coiled leaves that resemble spikes, does not look happy.
Nicknamed "Jac the Knife" because of his cost-cutting measures in Ford Motor's European operations during the early 90's, Mr. Nasser never mentioned camping or rivers or great books when asked how he became interested in the environment. Instead, he plunged into an 11-minute soliloquy on the importance of brands and how their images were formed in the public mind.
In an increasingly global economy, Mr. Nasser said, consumers increasingly turn to a few well-known brands, like Volvo's small but famous car-making division, which Ford Motor bought earlier this year. At the same time, the rise of the Internet and other forms of communications has made it possible for information about a company's activities in any city to spread quickly all over the world. So to have a popular, global brand that consumers will seek out, a company must be a good corporate citizen everywhere, Mr. Nasser concluded.
"Brands are becoming more important, and corporate image is becoming more important on a global basis," he said. "And it's very difficult, I think, in today's environment to have a global image that is substantially different from your local image."
In other words, car makers can no longer put big, polluting factories in out-of-the-way communities and hope no one will notice. Nor can they make particularly dirty vehicles and hope no one will notice. Rival auto makers estimate that Ford's cleaner sport utility vehicles are costing the company at least $100 million a year, mainly for bigger catalytic converters, an expense Ford says it is not passing on to consumers. While a few other S.U.V.'s are being cleaned up, most are not, and rival executives are criticizing Ford for taking action.
Bernard Robertson, DaimlerChrysler's senior vice president for engineering, said Ford had to do something in response to criticisms of its huge Ford Expedition sport utility vehicle and its even larger Ford Excursion, which will go on sale this autumn. The Excursion will be the world's largest S.U.V., taller than Michael Jordan and weighing as much as three Ford Escorts; with its 44-gallon gas tank and a fuel economy as low as 10 miles per gallon, it has been dubbed the "Ford Valdez" by the Sierra Club. "With the Expedition and Excursion, Ford has gone to the extremes of consumption," Mr. Robertson said.
Mr. Ford said that he understood the criticisms of the Excursion. But he maintained that some auto maker was inevitably going to build such a giant vehicle, and at least Ford was designing it to be as clean as most cars.
SUCH excuses do not satisfy Mr. Becker of the Sierra Club, who said that while he believed that Mr. Ford genuinely cared about the environment, he doubted that such views had spread widely through the company. "This is a very large ship, and he's a small rudder so far," Mr. Becker said.
Mr. Ford has also shifted his company's position on global warming, but not as much as environmentalists would like. He said there was a scientific basis for concern, but that any international agreement to limit the problem would have to include developing nations. Many environmentalists believe this to be politically impossible.
Some environmentalists also fault the auto industry for not having sold many alternatives to the gasoline-powered car. All of the big auto manufacturers are spending heavily to research alternative technologies, like electric cars, which use batteries or, more recently, fuel cells, which generate electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen without combustion. Yet alternative-fuel cars have become a chimera that has receded ever further into the future for most of this century. Regulators in California and New York required a decade ago that electric cars be widely available by now. They retreated from that goal, however, as technological advances proved inadequate and as gasoline-powered cars became steadily cleaner.
G. M. has actually put an electric vehicle, the EV1 coupe, on the market in California and Arizona. But its limited range and small passenger compartment have made it a marketing failure, with only 289 leased in 1997 and 264 last year, many by environmentalists and image-conscious celebrities. Mr. Smale said G .M. had learned some valuable technological lessons from the EV1, including how to develop better batteries for electric cars.
Ford sells most of the alternative-fuel vehicles in the United States, but these are mainly electric and natural gas-powered pickup trucks and vans purchased by utilities and Government agencies. Honda and Toyota plan to appeal to the public soon by selling small cars powered by a combination of a gasoline engine and an electric battery.
AMERICA'S small-car market is shrinking, however, and both companies plan to ship limited numbers of their vehicles here. They will also have to sell them below the high cost of manufacturing them.
Despite lavish Federal subsidies and numerous promises by auto makers to put high-mileage cars on sale by 2004, there is little sign of continuing public interest in fuel economy. This is probably linked to the fact that gasoline is still cheaper than bottled water in most of the country, even though gas prices recently rebounded.
The 10 most fuel-efficient cars on the market now account together for less than 1 percent of sales in the United States, while auto makers no longer even bother putting fuel-economy statistics in their advertisements. They have found that such information does not draw customers.
BARRING another energy crisis, the main environmental issue in the United States is likely to remain the ever-growing fleet of gasoline-powered cars being driven ever more miles, thereby contributing to smog and global warming. Alternative-fuel vehicles are most likely to be introduced in Europe and East Asia. That's where gasoline costs $4 a gallon and up, and where people are more willing to accept small cars that are suitable for city driving but less so for the highway, said Robert C. Purcell, G. M.'s executive director of advanced technology vehicles.
G.M., in particular, used to have a grim reputation for refusing to acknowledge that environmental problems even existed. David Lewis, an automotive historian at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who worked as a speech writer for two G. M. presidents from 1959 to 1965, said company policy then was to insist it was the oil refineries and other businesses, not cars, that caused air pollution.
"If we were accused of contributing to air pollution, we would simply say nothing had been proved," Mr. Lewis said.
Not only did G. M.'s cars pollute the air, but so did its factories. Trying to show that the river next to one of its assembly plants was clean in the early 1960's, G. M. officials dumped in live fish in front of television cameras, which filmed the fish as they swam around. The next morning, after the cameras had left, Mr. Lewis said, workers returned to scoop out the fish, which were by then floating belly up.
G. M. has recently begun improving its efforts regarding the environment, with John F. Smith Jr., the company's chairman and chief executive, joining the board of the Nature Conservancy, following the lead of Mr. Smale, a longtime member of the conservancy's board.
Having seen customers avoid detergents that included phosphates in the early 1970's, Mr. Smale came to the chairmanship of G. M. in 1992 with a strong appreciation of the risks for companies tarred as environmentally insensitive. He began lecturing G. M. managers on the importance of the issue. The company's current executives, he said, "realize that a lot of people in the country care about environmental responsibilities."
Until the last few months, some of the strongest criticisms of environmentalists have come from the former Chrysler Corporation. Robert J. Eaton, the company's chairman, and Robert A. Lutz, the vice chairman, were outspokenly skeptical of claims that global warming might be a problem. A brilliant car designer who resents any criticism of his industry, Mr. Lutz published a business-advice book last year in which he briefly compared "environmental extremists" to Communists, saying that both sought to eliminate the public's freedom to travel.
Mr. Lutz retired last year -- he now runs a car battery company; Mr. Eaton, now a co-chairman of DaimlerChrysler A.G., is expected to retire soon. Since Chrysler was acquired late last year by Daimler-Benz A.G., a leader in research on fuel cells and other environmentally sensitive technologies, the combined company has shown more enthusiasm for cleaner vehicles.
To the constant irritation of Detroit auto executives, foreign auto makers have had relatively little trouble with American environmentalists. Most top-selling foreign cars are fairly fuel-efficient because they were designed in countries where gasoline is expensive. During the 1970's, Japanese auto makers came up with cleaner engines for their small cars at a time when American auto makers were still contending that low-emissions technology was unfeasible.
But while foreign cars may be ubiquitous in coastal cities like New York and Los Angeles, they remain less common in the Midwest. G. M. still sells more cars and other family vehicles in the United States each year than every Japanese and European auto maker combined.
The harmony between foreign auto makers and American environmentalists may yet fade, as the foreign companies have begun to sell larger vehicles. Toyota, in particular, has been moving aggressively into the market for S.U.V.'s, while setting a fairly slow timetable for reducing their emissions. But after decades of hostility toward Detroit, most environmentalists still focus on auto makers based in Michigan.
The younger American auto industry executives want to change this pattern. They insist that as an older generation of leaders continues to retire, environmental progress will continue.
Mr. Ford said that during his 20-year ascent through the company ranks, he was often struck by how many other young managers were worried about the company's environmental performance. They were thwarted from doing much, Mr. Ford said, because "there were a few people in key management positions that didn't want to hear of it."
The growing number of environmentally committed people moving into positions of responsibility in the auto industry will enable further initiatives to clean up the world's air and water, Mr. Ford said.
He added, "I'm not sure, if I were chairman 10 years ago, that the world would have been ready for my views."

HEADLINE: CARS AND THE ENVIRONMENT;
Even in Cleaner-Running Machines, Looks Will Count

BYLINE: By JOSEPH GIOVANNINI; Joseph Giovannini is an architecture critic and an architectural designer in New York.

 BODY:
The vroom is gone, or going. So is the heft of steel and the muscular body. Made of magnesium, aluminum and plastic composites, powered by sustainable-source fuels, the coming generation of pollution-conscious cars is ultraquiet and ultralight. They promise to change the rules of how a car feels, looks and operates, as well as how it affects the environment.
The transition from combustion to alternative power parallels the shift a century ago, when the carriage dropped the horse on its way to becoming an automobile. What is the next leap forward in the evolutionary chain? Will there be funky Hush Puppy designs that wear their greenness on their fenders? Streamlined designs that slip through the air like a Brancusi? Conventionalized models that reassure buyers about the new technology? 
 In July, the Museum of Modern Art will exhibit the tip of the iceberg to come in "Different Roads: Automobiles for the Next Century," a show of eight energy-efficient cars more environmentally benign than their predecessors. Christopher Mount, a curator in the museum's department of architecture and design, has selected a range of modestly priced cars already on the road, in production or in prototype.
A departure for MOMA, the exhibition does not display cars primarily as works of art, but as a preview of environmental issues relating to the potentially earth-devastating effect of the car in the next century, when developing countries develop. "What happens when everyone in China gets a car?" Mr. Mount asks.
Two forces are driving the current redesign. The first is the new, alternative fuel-source technology itself. Smaller engines mean shorter or nonexistent hoods. Improved fuel efficiency demands lighter, more compact cars, including two-seat cars designed just for commuting. Because they don't have to be cooled, electric engines require no grille. But they do need no-nonsense streamlining to reduce drag and to maximize miles between recharge.
The second force is market demand and design vision. "Folks may be interested in the environment, but they're not willing to sacrifice for it themselves," said Robert Q. Riley, a car designer who wrote "Alternative Cars in the 21st Century" (Society of Automotive Engineer, 1994). "Environment is a secondary benefit. Buyers still need to be seduced, and you don't do that by taking a conventional car and making it small and cheap. Environmentally friendly autos need to be friendly and fun in themselves; they have to be a new toy."
Gerhard Steinle, the former president of Mercedes-Benz Advance Design of North America, in Irvine, Calif., agreed. "If you take the roaring engine away, and people don't get anything besides that humming turbine sound, they'll be disappointed," said Mr. Steinle, now the president of Prisma Design International, a car design consultant in Irvine. "So you have to create something exciting to create that 'wow' effect for the neighbors."
He suggested that a compensatory kind of "entertainment" might be "an incredible audio" and telecommunications system, including a hands-free telephone, a navigation system and E-mail and Internet access integrated into the dashboard.
Mr. Steinle added: "When you create a small vehicle, you have to be careful that it doesn't look too babyish or cartoonish. It can't be a baby Benz. It has to have its own character, so that a serious businessman doesn't look like he's driving his daughter's car on Saturdays."
The surprise of this summer's MOMA show is that the eye already accepts these cars. But then, Mr. Mount said, "People aren't going to buy new technology in a wild-looking new car -- you have to put it in a shape they recognize."
Many other factors are at work conventionalizing the design of these new cars: existing safety requirements, basic human ergonomics and strong financial incentives to adapt existing bodies and off-the-shelf parts and components to the new cars.
The Ford Ka, which resembles Volkswagen's New Beetle and is already on the road in Europe, is one of the more charming cars in the show. The Ka, a very-high mileage gasoline-powered vehicle, is a persona car that changes the subject from its diminutive size to its character. Friendly, bulbous, lovable, the Ka has the appeal of a pet. But its rounded headlights and other refinements stop it from becoming an oversimplified cartoon character on wheels.
"There is a quality in the vehicle that moves you away from the idea of performance, but not toward cheapness or sacrifice," Mr. Riley said. "The New Beetle has made designers think that a dramatic shape breakthrough can excite the public."
Besides, Mr. Steinle noted, "Persona doesn't cost anything."
The Fiat Multipla, an offbeat minivan also in the show, is modest in size and charmingly awkward, designed with an upright passenger cab with lots of glass, within which seats can be removed for transporting goods. Powered by a clean-burning engine available in several forms (one can use a combination of gasoline and methane), the Multipla was conceived from the inside. It makes no visual attempt at muscle or even stealth, but shifts design rules toward the pokey end of the spectrum: it's a car with an idea -- versatility.
But then all the cars that will be parked in MOMA's garden this summer are surprisingly unassuming -- especially when compared with the sculptured studs of the 1952 MOMA show, like the Aston-Martin model D.B.2. These cars are economy cars; none are flamboyant or visually radical.
Mr. Riley warned: "If you just downsize a four-wheel car, you create a cheap car that nobody wants. The idea is to define something that in the minds of consumers is not a traditional automobile. People look at the list of features through different eyes, so they don't expect leather upholstery and electric windows. This allows you to downsize or downweight a vehicle and create a marketable car."
He thinks of them as efficiency cars as against "cheap" econobox minicars. "Think in terms of entirely new transportation products that give consumers the intangible benefits they want," he said.
Mr. Riley, who heads Robert Q. Riley Enterprises, Product Design and Development, in Scottsdale, Ariz., is himself working on the XR-3, a three-wheel suspension car akin to the Mercedes F300 Life Jet concept vehicle, and the Project 32 Slalom. All are three-wheel hybrids with the cornering dynamics of a motorcycle and the safety and comfort of a car. "When you break into a three wheel," he said, "you naturally say that this is a different kind of vehicle, which allows you to define new standards for what to put into a car."
Or on it. Mr. Steinle, for example, said that some of his design students, pursuing a more radical "Earth-shoe" approach, have proposed high-efficiency cars clad with rusting metals.
"You always have to be honest," he said. "You can't make an electric vehicle, for example, look like a muscle car." But, he said, the EV1, another car in the show, boasts a sleek dynamic shape because "that's a necessity for an electric vehicle."
Mr. Riley added: "We don't know what the technology is finally going to be, so we're not going to know for the next 10 years where design is going. We're in a state of transition. It's hard to envision the future when you're on this side of change."

HEADLINE: CARS AND THE ENVIRONMENT;
Clearing the Air In the Land of Smog

BYLINE: By BRUCE NEWMAN; Bruce Newman, who covered motor sports for Sports Illustrated, is a freelance writer living in Venice, Calif.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
IN the summer of 1943, a year and a half after the attack on Pearl Harbor, people were still nervously scanning the skies here to see if anything was going to materialize above the horizon.
Something did. 
 The Japanese never came, but that summer, for the first time, the sky itself attacked. With visibility reduced to three blocks and residents reporting difficulty breathing, nausea and stinging eyes, local officials decided the mysterious cloud had resulted from a "gas attack" and blamed a nearby chemical plant. But when the plant was shut down, the cloud did not go away.
It never would.
Now when people study the skies here, it is often to measure the smog. The problem grew so much worse as the number of cars in California quadrupled over the next three decades that, in 1977, the worst year on record, smog alerts warning people with respiratory problems to stay indoors were issued on 121 days in Los Angeles.
"The air has been visible for a long time out here," said David Roe, a senior lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund, a New York-based research and advocacy group.
This meant that when state officials finally declared that the sky was falling, you could see it coming down. In the mid-1970's, birds, overcome by pollution, routinely fell from the sky above the San Diego Freeway, and the state began to devise a plan to reduce emissions without disempowering its voters or its motors.
Californians hold strong views on the environment (they are in favor of it), and even stronger views on cars (anyone trying to remove them from their vehicles will have to pry the steering wheels from their cold, dead hands). "You've got a very high majority of people who want clean air, and care about it," Mr. Roe said, "and a 99 percent majority who want to stay in their cars."
This situation accounts for the polarized debate here on how to clean up car and truck emissions, the source of two-thirds of the state's air pollution. "It's very hard to run a debate when one side says you're killing our children, and the other side says you're killing the economy," said Peter Passell, an economist at the Milken Institute, a nonprofit economic research organization in Santa Monica, Calif. "People on both sides have tended to say outrageous things and then settle for whatever they could get."
The two sides seemed to fall willingly into their roles of white-hatted environmental heroes and evil polluters, hats blackened with soot. It was customary for car makers to send an expert witness to the state's hearings on environmental regulations to announce that whatever it was, auto companies were against it.
"That's usually the position you're put in," said Kelly Brown, Ford Motor Company's director of environmental and safety engineering. "Some of the early guys from Detroit said, 'If you make that a law, and I don't have a clue how to do it, you could put me out of business.' I think they believed it. So it started in kind of a contentious way. We've learned to be more artful."
When the California Air Resources Board in Sacramento adopted new low-emission vehicle regulations in 1990, the state assumed the role of technical and legislative laboratory for the nation. The Environmental Protection Agency, with plenty of other messes to clean up, voluntarily ceded a large measure of its authority to California.
"E.P.A. has historically allowed things to be tested in California, proven to be viable and then has adopted them as the law for the rest of the country," said Barry Wallerstein, the executive officer of the powerful South Coast Air Quality Management District, based in Diamond Bar, Calif.
Among the results: The catalytic converter, which is now standard equipment on all vehicles made in the United States, was required first by California in 1975, and auto makers have moved almost exclusively to fuel-injected engines because they could not meet California emissions standards using traditional carburetors.
WHILE there is a long way to go -- California still has the dirtiest air in the nation -- the initiatives have nevertheless reduced the state's air pollution to one-third its level in the mid-1950's. When cleaner-burning gasoline was required by the state in 1996, it reduced pollutants by 20 percent. Because Californians use, on average, more than 400 gallons of gas a year, this was the equivalent of taking 3.5 million cars off the road.
The switch in fuels met some initial resistance from the petroleum industry. That faded, however, when other technologies bubbling in the California laboratory -- fuel cells, gas and electric hybrids, even improved battery-powered cars -- began to threaten the market share of the century-old internal-combustion engine.
Experiments with alternative fuel technologies, though widely publicized, have met with mixed success. In the first round of low-emission vehicle regulations, auto makers were required to make 3 percent of the vehicles they sold in California zero-emitting by the end of 1998.
"The only way you could really meet that," Mr. Brown said, "unless you wanted to consider sails or rubber bands, was with an electric vehicle of some sort."
General MOTORS soon began leasing its battery-powered EV1 car through Saturn dealers in California, but the car's range was limited. With the drumbeat growing for fuel-cell cars and other hybrid-powered ultra low-emitting vehicles and super ultra low-emitting vehicles, the electric car looked like an expensive dead end.
More than a year ago, Ford and DaimlerChrysler formed a partnership to develop fuel-cell cars; recently, G. M. and Toyota formed an alliance to do the same. Ford and DaimlerChrysler have vowed to have a demonstration fleet of 30 fuel-cell cars and 15 buses on the streets by next year -- in California, naturally.
Despite this progress, there have been detours. Last year, smog in Los Angeles crept back up to levels unseen in more than a decade, and the cause was easy to identify.
With the first set of low-emission vehicle standards, California created a loophole large enough to drive millions of small trucks through, and that is precisely what happened. Sport utility vehicles were permitted to pollute at two and a half times the rate of passenger cars, just as Detroit was recognizing their potential to deliver wide profit margins. The American passion for these vehicles became the Frankenstein of the California emissions laboratory.
"The fact that you could sell them legally without very expensive control standards was certainly something the industry took advantage of," Mr. Roe said. By the time regulators woke up to what was going on in California, sport utility vehicles constituted nearly 60 percent of vehicle sales.
Last fall the state's Air Resources Board imposed new regulations treating sport utility vehicles and most pickup trucks as passenger cars. The move delighted environmental groups, who considered it overdue, and dismayed auto makers, who again insisted it would be nearly impossible to meet the new standards in five years, as required. But the board fit two Ford Expeditions with larger catalytic converters that brought them into compliance.
In fact, Ford had already improved the performance of its sport utility vehicles nationwide so that they could nearly meet today's auto emissions standards, prompting California to tighten its rules. "A lot of people in the industry say it was Ford's fault," Mr. Brown said. "It makes you the skunk at the picnic at an industry meeting."
But for all its apparent zeal, California has occupied the regulatory fast lane largely because the Clean Air Act pushed it there, while the E.P.A. has followed the state's efforts from a politically safe distance.
"One of the difficulties of moving programs along at the Federal level is that there are large parts of the country where smog is just not perceived as a threat," said Mary Nichols, an E.P.A. administrator from 1993 to 1997 and, earlier, the head of California's Air Resources Board under Gov. Jerry Brown. "There is sort of a delicate interplay in terms of how far and how fast you can actually push the industry, and in California they are willing to push harder and faster than the Feds are."
ROBERT STAVINS, a professor at the Harvard University Kennedy School of Government, said California has led not so much by example as by mistake. The first mistake, he explained, was allowing the air in its most populous cities to get so bad that it brought about the second mistake: forcing the rest of the country to scrub its air as expensively as Los Angeles.
Auto makers "were not particularly attracted by the idea of producing two kinds of cars," he added, meaning one for California, which accounts for 10 percent of the domestic car and truck market, and another for everywhere else. While the auto industry resisted regulation "as if it were essentially the Great Depression being brought to America in the 1990's," in Professor Stavins's words, once it lost those early battles, the war was effectively over. It was no longer even a question of whether it was desirable to set the same standards for Sioux Falls, S.D., as for San Francisco, but how quickly to implement them.
"The reality is that from an economic perspective, a uniform, nationwide standard doesn't make sense," Professor Stavins said, "because the damages associated with air pollution, and the costs of achieving the standards differ tremendously, depending on whether you're stuck in the Los Angeles basin or in the middle of the Great Plains. But many people are upset about the political issue of different standards. They believe that there ought to be the same standards for everyone for fundamental things like clean air."
In California, there is always something in the air; these days it is as likely to be an idea as a particulate. "When the Clean Air Act was adopted in 1970, it required huge cuts in emissions and set very tough deadlines," said Gail Ruderman Feuer, a senior lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which is based in New York. "Everyone said it was impossible. Then lo and behold, they found catalytic converters. That was a technology-forcing act. That's how we have clean cars today."

HEADLINE: CARS AND THE ENVIRONMENT;
Muscle, Muscle Everywhere

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
TAIL FINS went, round headlights gave way to square ones, and then chrome all but disappeared. But the biggest change in cars over the last few years is not cosmetic. It is under the hood: the engine is on steroids.
Year by year, cars and light trucks have undergone a remarkable transformation, through a host of changes in engines and transmissions. The typical family vehicle of the late 1990's has turned into something that in the 1970's would have qualified as a mean street machine. And more changes are waiting in the wings that will make cars more muscular yet. 
 The Environmental Protection Agency, which has kept track since 1975, says in a draft report that for the 1998 model year, the average car had 160 horsepower, up 60 percent from 1981. Light trucks, including sport utility vehicles, which now make up almost half the market, were at 190 horsepower, also up 60 percent. A family that bought three cars in 1981 and replaced them with two new ones in 1998 would have more horsepower in the driveway now.
These days, it is not uncommon for performance cars like the Lexus GS 400 to contain more power than some heavy trucks -- 300 horsepower for the sedan to 275 for a number of Mack Truck's 18-wheelers -- and more than the engine of the typical four-seat passenger plane.
"The horsepower race is on -- it's never been off," said Thomas W. Asmus, the senior research executive for DaimlerChrysler in Auburn Hills, Mich. "With the strong economy, people are willing to spend money on all kinds of automobile features that in less good times they're not willing to spend money on. Vehicle performance has great market appeal."
But not everyone is so happy. "The traditional horsepower war certainly shows no sign of abating," said John DeCicco, the transportation program director at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. He, too, agreed that consumers are getting what they ask for, but, he added, "We are seeing automotive technology running amok."
For Mr. DeCicco and other environmentalists, the growth of engine efficiency is a case of the road not taken. Manufacturers have three choices when it comes to engine innovations that get more work from a gallon. They can give cars smaller, lighter engines that will maintain performance while cutting fuel consumption. Or they can increase weight while keeping performance constant. But almost without exception, they have used the gains to make cars faster -- and sometimes heavier as well.
The E.P.A. estimates that if auto makers had kept constant the car's weight and number of seconds it takes to accelerate to 60 miles per hour, but continued to add the same improvements to engines and transmissions, then 1998 cars would have averaged 33.5 miles per gallon, and trucks 25.7 miles per gallon. In both cases, this would have been about 5 miles per gallon better than the average for vehicles actually sold.
INSTEAD, the application of advanced technology to engines is driving performance ever higher, even though the other big determinant of acceleration, vehicle weight, has been rising. According to the E.P.A.'s draft report, the Light-Duty Automotive Technology and Fuel Economy Trends study, since 1981 the average vehicle has gained more than 550 pounds, reaching 3,760 pounds in 1998, from 3,201. Even with that extra heft, the time it takes a car to accelerate to 60 miles per hour from a stop, the most widely used measure of performance, has gone from 14.4 seconds in 1981 to 10.8 seconds in 1998.
Cars are only half the story, almost literally, since they accounted for about 55 percent of sales in 1998, down from 81 percent in 1975. Light trucks have shown a similar increase in performance, despite their larger size.
Acar with 100 horsepower was once a common, respectable model, but of 200 models in Consumer Reports' 1999 auto issue, only four had less than 100 horsepower.
Behind the trend in engine innovations are several refinements, most of which began in high-end cars and are working their way down to the "econobox" end of the market. A number of the new developments have made engines work better by making it easier for them to breathe.
One is the switch to four valves per cylinder from the traditional two. Valves control the flow of gases into and out of the cylinder, a space about the size of a small can of peanuts. The valves, which control openings varying in size from a quarter to a half dollar, let the fuel-air mixture in as the piston goes down, and let the exhaust gases out as the piston rises. Every bit of friction that these gases encounter, on the way in or the way out, is power that does not go to the wheels. As engine speed increases, and more gas has to be moved through the valves, adding valves lets air in and out more easily, increasing the range of speeds at which the engine can operate efficiently.
And that, in turn, has allowed engines to get slightly smaller, because a small engine operating at 6,000 r.p.m. can produce as much power as a slightly larger one operating at 5,000 r.p.m. Engines not only move weight, but they're also heavy themselves. And for every pound that engine weight is reduced, designers can cut at least another pound from the car's suspension and frame. With each pound lost, the number of horses per 100 pounds of weight rises, and the car can accelerate faster. All of this weight loss -- and more -- has been eaten up by fatter bodies.
Other engine refinements are still in their infancy, including variable valve timing, in which intake valves stay open longer and exhaust valves open sooner, depending on engine speed, and electronic controls or multiport fuel injectors, which smooth out the flow of fuel to the cylinders, to reduce friction.
Of course, there remains the question of when exactly extra horsepower is truly needed. Lexus introduced its powerful sport sedan, the GS 400, with the advertising theme "Something Wicked This Way Comes." To environmentalists, the whole trend adds up to Something Wasteful. "They advertise these things with people driving up Pike's Peak, or whatever, but 95 percent of the people who buy these things don't do that," said Ann R. Mesnikoff, an global warming specialist at the Sierra Club.
Cars ran fine 15 years ago when the average engine was 60 horsepower smaller, she said, adding, "How much performance do people need?"
 
In Valves, Timing Is Everything
SOME of the most promising engine improvements are still in the development stage -- variable valve timing, for example. Honda does this now with a mechanical system, but more flexible, capable mechanisms are on the way.
Today, almost all engine valves open and close in lock step with the turning of the crankshaft, like a cuckoo in a clock that pops out precisely when the minute hand reaches the 12. With variable timing, valves would stay open longer, or shut later, depending on engine speed.
When the engine is running fast, the fuel-air mixture flowing into the cylinders has a lot of momentum. Keep the intake valves open an extra fraction of a second, and that momentum will fill the cylinders extra-full, giving the engine more power. And if the exhaust valves open slightly early in high-speed operation, that prevents the cylinder from repressurizing in the exhaust stroke, which would cut power.
A number of companies are working on systems using valves operated hydraulically or by electric impulses through solenoids.
A related improvement would be to use the intake valves, rather than the throttle, to control the amount of fuel and air going to the cylinders. Closing the throttle increases air friction, reducing efficiency; closing a valve early to limit fuel doesn't.
Engineers have found other ways to cut friction, including electronic controls that make the car run smoothly at low engine speeds and multiport fuel injectors thateven fuel flow to the cylinders.
One step on the drawing boards is an engine with a variable compression ratio that would produce a burst of extra power by briefly allowing extra fuel and extra air into the cylinder.
If a car needed a 160-horsepower engine but could perform adequately most of the time with 150, then a manufacturer could substitute the lighter, more fuel-efficient engine. When the car needed an extra 10 horsepower -- say, for merging onto a busy expressway -- an engine with a variable compression ratio could provide it on demand.

HEADLINE: From One Platform Many Models Grow

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

 BODY:
CAR buyers love choice. Car makers love low production costs.
Believe it or not, there is a way to fulfill these competing goals: build cars that share components under the skin but are as different in size as the Toyota Supra coupe and the Lexus RX300 sport utility vehicle, and in look, feel and price as the $17,000 Volkwagen New Beetle and the $40,000 Audi TT roadster. 
 The key word in this legerdemain is "platform," the term for the basic building block in car manufacturing. It includes the chassis and under-body parts like the floor pan, rails and wheel housings. All vehicles built from a single platform have the same welding points, allowing them to share a single assembly line.
Of course, the idea of saving money by using a limited number of platforms is not new: Henry Ford sold 15 million Model T's. But intense and increasingly global competition and cost pressures have led auto makers to find new ways to produce more models -- some in small volumes -- to appeal to market niches.
Some platforms serve as the bases for a whole family of vehicles. At the same time, manufacturers have grown more successful at making each one more distinctive, not just in looks, but in interior design, engines and driving character, as well as in marketing position and price. The auto makers are becoming like the home builder who uses the same basic foundation and floor plan throughout a neighborhood, but constructs houses that are a mix of contemporary, Colonial and Tudor styles, at various prices.
"The chassis is the most expensive part of the vehicle, so if you can take the basic foundation of a vehicle and spread it across more volume, you can lower the per-unit cost," said Christopher Cedergren, the owner of Nextrend, an automotive research firm in Thousand Oaks, Calif.
The savings can amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, making it easier to shift production to follow market trends. "The break-even on the next model is lower because it takes engineering time and cost out and requires no change in equipment," said Ron Harbour, president of Harbour & Associates, a manufacturing consultant in Troy, Mich.
Savings to the car companies and savings to consumers, however, are two different matters. The desire to attract a certain kind of customer seems to influence the price of an automobile as much as the actual cost of manufacturing it. The Lincoln Navigator and the Ford Expedition, for instance, share the same platform, but the Navigator sells for about $10,000 more.
Although sharing platforms is now popular, the earliest attempts by contemporary car makers failed miserably. In the 1980's, for instance, a now-famous Fortune magazine cover pictured four burgundy mid-size automobiles made by General Motors. Parked side by side, they were indistinguishable from each other. Yet G. M. sold virtually the same car as different models through Buick, Chevrolet, Oldsmobile and Pontiac dealers.
That kind of platform-sharing was derisively known as "badge engineering," because little beyond the name badges differed from vehicle to vehicle. While that still happens, especially among American manufacturers, auto makers are increasingly shifting to a more sophisticated form of platform-sharing.
To date, there have been some successes.
"Common worldwide platforms are relatively new to most car companies, and the proof is yet to be seen," said James Hossack, a senior consultant with Auto Pacific, an automotive marketing research firm in Newport Beach, Calif.
Mr. Harbour said success "depends on how creative they are in designing and engineering the platform to be adaptable to a wide range of vehicles."
Experts consistently cite Volkswagen AG, which sells cars under the Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and Skoda nameplates worldwide, as the most successful at shared platforms thus far. In 1993, Volkswagen sold vehicles built from 16 car platforms. Today, Volkswagen has four platforms, which serve as the basis for half of the company's mass-produced cars; by the end of 2001, nearly 100 percent of its vehicles will have shifted to these four platforms. Yet, while Volkswagen has reduced the number of platforms, it has increased the number of models it produces. The auto maker now sells 51 models, compared with 38 in 1996.
The same platform that spawned the phenomenally successful Volkswagen Beetle, for instance, is shared by the Volkswagen Golf and Jetta (sold as the Bora in Europe), the Audi A3, the new Audi TT sports car convertible and coupe, the Skoda Octavia and the Seat Toledo. The family of vehicles from Volkswagen's so-called A platform includes coupes, roadsters, sedans and station wagons. Similarly, the Volkswagen Passat and Audi A4 and A6, available as sedans and station wagons and with front-wheel or all-wheel drive, come from a single platform.
While some critics, including Mr. Hossack of Auto Pacific, complain that Audi and VW models still look too much alike, the company's sales are running at record levels.
Experts also praise Toyota for a commendable job in developing worldwide platforms. Its Corolla ranks as one of the best-selling vehicles of all time, and its Camry platform is among the most flexible in the industry.
The United States version of the Camry sedan, for instance, is wider than those sold overseas, though they both come from the same platform. So do the Camry Solara, the longer and roomier Avalon and the near-luxury ES300 sedan. The Toyota Sienna minivan and Lexus RX300 sport utility trace their origins to the Camry platform as well.
"The genius behind Toyota is the flexibility in its system," Mr. Harbour said.
Honda is moving in a similar direction with its Accord, which is sized differently for the United States and overseas and is the basis for Honda's wildly popular new minivan, the Odyssey, as well as Acura's TL sedan and CL coupe. Mr. Harbour said Honda had managed to make big changes in vehicles with minimal changes to components by using techniques like putting inserts into the platform to make it longer or wider.
MEANWHILE, Ford, the pioneer of the original world car, has seen mixed results with its most recent attempts.
The Ford Mondeo, developed in Europe and sold in the United States as the Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique sedans, was an extensive $6 billion program, which involved a new platform as well as new engines and transmissions. The Mondeo sold well in Europe, but its counterparts here proved too small and too expensive for American buyers. Then Ford introduced the Mondeo-based Mercury Cougar, a sporty coupe using Ford's New Edge design theme of sharp edges defining the sculptured body; it has done well in the United States and Europe. A Mondeo-based sport utility is in the works now.
An even smaller Ford platform in Europe has generated three successful and critically acclaimed vehicles, all vastly different from one another: the Fiesta economy car, the economical but innovative Ka and the sporty Puma, which ride as well as the Courier pickup sold in Brazil. Still, the platform has not been used in the United States, so it can't be called a worldwide platform.
Perhaps the greatest test for Ford will be its new worldwide platform for luxury cars. The Jaguar S-Type, which is to go on sale this month, the Lincoln LS sedans due out in the fall and the forthcoming Ford Thunderbird and Jaguar X400 will be built from the new platform.
"We haven't seen proof yet of Ford's success with the world car platform," noted Mr. Hossack of Auto Pacific.
SIMILARLY, G. M., which is developing worldwide platforms for the next century, has yet to prove its concept. Its Sigma platform, for instance, will be used as the base for Cadillac's entry-luxury Catera, its flagship Seville, its new Luxury Activity Vehicle and possibly the Evoq roadster, along with luxury cars sold in Australia.
Mr. Cedergren of Nextrend contends that the winner will be the auto maker that can offer vehicles of various sizes and different body styles from a single platform, while insuring that they have distinct brand personalities. These personalities are shaped not only by the sheet metal, but also by careful selection of engines, tuning of suspensions and choice of interior materials.
"The manufacturer must be able to dial in a distinctive brand DNA or attitude," Mr. Cedergren said. "They have to be able to have the chassis shout out, 'It's a Jag,' 'It's a Volvo,' 'It's a Beemer' or 'It's a Mercedes.' "
The auto consumers of the new generation -- primarily aging baby boomers and Generation X'ers -- increasingly base automotive-buying decisions on attitude and image, he said; the cars are viewed as extensions of their personalities and wardrobes. "They are looking for the emotional high you get when you drive it," Mr. Cedergren added.

HEADLINE: Starts of New Homes Fall To Lowest Level in a Year

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
New-home construction starts fell in April to their lowest level in a year after surging in the first quarter.
Starts fell 10.1 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.574 million houses, the Commerce Department said today. The decline came after a one-tenth of a percent drop in March and was widespread, with starts falling in all regions except the West. 
 Analysts had expected April starts to fall to a 1.744-million-unit pace.
Warm weather in January pushed starts that month to a 12-year high and "there was no way that the pace could be maintained," said Joel Naroff, chief economist of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.
That helps explain why the industry remains confident this year will be one of the best on record. While April's starts were the lowest monthly level since May 1998, the pace, if it holds up for the year, would be the second strongest since 1987.
In the first four months of the year, builders started work on 515,000 homes, on an unadjusted basis, which is 9.6 percent more houses than in the corresponding period last year -- evidence that "demand for housing is still strong," said Tim McGee, chief economist at Tokai Bank Ltd. in New York.
It probably will not get much better, said Marilyn Schaja, a money market economist at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities in New York. The statistics show "that housing will not be a major contributor to growth during the next few months, although the industry remains at a high plateau," she said.
Also, a rise in mortgage rates means "housing won't be supercharged any longer," said David Orr, chief capital markets economist at the First Union Corporation.
The benchmark 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose last week to 7.10 percent, the highest level since mid-March. After the Labor Department reported on Friday a larger-than-expected seven-tenths of a percent rise in April consumer prices, fears of rising inflation drove market-based interest rates higher. That means higher mortgage rates, too.
By region, housing starts fell 6.8 percent in the Northeast, to an annual rate of 138,000 -- the lowest level since April 1998. They dropped 14.6 percent in the Midwest, to a rate of 328,000 units, and 14.5 percent, to 702,000 in the South, the slowest pace since April 1998. Starts rose 2 percent, to 406,000 units, in the West.
Starts of single-family homes fell 11 percent in April, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.244 million units, the lowest level since May 1998. Starts of multifamily homes fell 6.5 percent in April, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 330,000.

HEADLINE: The Fed Edges Toward Action

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's decision yesterday to leave interest rates unchanged but to warn that it was thinking of raising them in the future reaffirms how unsure the policy makers are about the state of the economy.
The Fed cut rates three times late last year when it believed that the financial panic following the Russian default would slow American growth and might bring on a world recession. In retrospect the Fed seems to have overreacted, although the cuts appeared prudent at the time. Now, with the United States' economy growing far more rapidly than expected, a world recession seemingly unlikely and with some signs of a rebirth of inflation, a modest increase in rates could easily be justified. 
 That the Fed did not dictate such an increase, but instead announced a "bias" in favor of raising rates in the future, probably reflects a continued argument within the Fed's open market committee about the extent to which inflation is a threat. Some believe that thanks to increases in productivity brought on by computers, the economy is now able to grow much faster than in the past without any appreciable threat of inflation. But it is also possible that inflation has been held down by overseas weakness that is now reversing. The Fed should be vigilant about inflation, and may rightly conclude next month that a rate increase is wise.

HEADLINE: Text of Statement by Fed

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Federal Open Market Committee said it had left interest rates unchanged but had adopted a stance to raise borrowing costs in the future:
While the F.O.M.C. did not take action today to alter the stance of monetary policy, the committee was concerned about the potential for a buildup of inflationary imbalances that could undermine the favorable performance of the economy and therefore adopted a directive that is tilted toward the possibility of a firming in the stance of monetary policy. 
 Trend increases in costs and core prices have generally remained quite subdued. But domestic financial markets have recovered and foreign economic prospects have improved since the easing of monetary policy last fall.
Against the background of already-tight domestic labor markets and ongoing strength in demand in excess of productivity gains, the committee recognizes the need to be alert to developments over coming months that might indicate that financial conditions may no longer be consistent with containing inflation.

HEADLINE: U.S. Unveils Plan to Aid 68 Species in Everglades

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: BOCA RATON, Fla., May 18

 BODY:
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt unveiled an ambitious plan today to save more than 68 endangered and threatened species in South Florida, taking a regional approach to disappearing wildlife that the Clinton Administration hopes will become a national model.
Speaking to a forum of scientists involved in the restoration of the Florida Everglades, Mr. Babbitt called the plan "an unprecedented, pioneering effort." 
 The 2,400-page document, which looks a bit like a wildlife encyclopedia, lays out a blueprint for restoring natural habitat across 26,000 square miles in southern Florida, and saving dozens of threatened species, including the manatee, the American crocodile and plants like Small's milkpea and the deltoid splurge.
Mr. Babbitt said the Government's hope was to depart from the piecemeal approach of adopting harsh legal tactics to save each species as it nears extinction, sometimes to the detriment of other species and often at the cost of economic development.
"What we have learned is you can't do these issues one species at a time," Mr. Babbitt said. "That's the significance of this plan today."
Under the plan, Federal authorities would work with developers and local governments to reach agreements on setting aside habitats for endangered species before construction projects get under way, rather than suing those developers and governments to stop projects after they are started. In most cases, the developers would then be released from the obligation to protect endangered species on the land designated for development.
Federal wildlife officials said the idea was to shape development in a way that set aside and preserved habitats for all species, rather than fighting politically divisive battles in court over a single species of bird or fish.
"I believe we are doing it right this time," Mr. Babbitt said. "We are putting it up on the front end. We're not going to sit back and take the dog-in-the-manger stance, saying, You go and do your thing and then let us say, 'No!' "
Federal officials have tried similar tactics with considerable success in the old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest and along the coastal sage lands of Southern California. But Mr. Babbitt said the Florida plan was the largest initiative of its kind ever tried, and the first to deal with a vast aquatic ecosystem like the Everglades and adjacent Florida Bay.
The health of the Everglades has been deteriorating for decades. The flood control system the Army built in the 1950's drained thousands of acres for farmland, splintered the marsh prairies with dikes and canals, and severed the wetlands in the south from Lake Okeechobee in the north, thus stopping the slow, shallow flow of water that was the lifeblood of the system.
Today's announcement comes as Congress is preparing to debate a $7.8 billion public works project this summer intended to restore the Everglades to ecological health. That project, known as the Restudy, involves building dozens of large reservoirs, both above and below ground, and revamping the canals and dikes to restore the natural flow of water to the wetlands and into Florida Bay.
Some conservationists said the public works projects going to Congress in July would be much more important to stopping the decline of threatened species than Mr. Babbitt's plan. Unless the erratic flow of water into the Everglades can be fixed, there is little hope that many of the endangered species will survive.
Charles Lee of the Florida Audubon Society, said, "If we can't put the water back in the Everglades, and we are not able to re-establish the natural flow of water, then the steps recommended in the recovery plan are not going to be sufficient."
But other ecologists said Mr. Babbitt's approach was a breakthrough in environmental policy. In the past, they said, conservationists had been forced to sue to protect a single species under the Endangered Species Act in order to save the larger ecosystem. Naturalists championed the survival of the spotted owl, for instance, to protect the old growth forests of the Northwest, and the fight over the snail darter was in reality a battle over the future of the Little Tennessee River.
It remains unclear precisely how the wildlife recovery plan will be implemented as the state and Federal governments move ahead with the larger effort to restore the Everglades. Several projects intended to restore the marshes have become bogged down for years in local political battles and disagreements among Federal agencies.

Pulp Friction

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
Coke promotes its "secret formula" for achieving uniformity of taste from Tulsa to Timbuktu. Pepsi scoffs, saying its product is just plain better and boasting that its market appeal gives it a big advantage over its archrival.
Nothing new in any of that -- except that the soft-drink giants are both talking about orange juice. 
 After Pepsico bought the Tropicana juice maker from the Seagram Company last July for $3.3 billion, the spillover of the cola wars to America's breakfast tables was inevitable. The Coca-Cola Company has owned Minute Maid, the nation's No. 2 juice maker, for more than 35 years, and now the two companies have a new testing ground for their marketing arsenals.
Some analysts wonder whether the companies are indulging in overkill. Tropicana and Minute Maid are spending heavily to blast consumers with advertisements and promotions and are sniping at each other in the best Coke-Pepsi tradition. In February, Minute Maid trumpeted growing sales of its Minute Maid Premium even as "the Tropicana Season's Best line registered the largest decline in sales -- down nearly 32 percent -- of all value brands." Not to be outdone, Tropicana has issued news releases comparing the taste of juices made from concentrates unfavorably with its "natural" brands.
All this, skeptics ask, for a market that is essentially stagnant? Indeed, the juice market, at about $3 billion last year, represents only a small corner of the companies' beverage empires -- a small and highly volatile corner.
"There's very little synergy in terms of the economics," said Jennifer Solomon, a beverage analyst for Salomon Smith Barney and one of the early doubters about the wisdom of the Tropicana acquisition. "Pepsi now has to deal with refrigerated rail cars and perishable products. It's a whole level of complexity that you don't have in the soft-drink business."
Still, the Tropicana-Minute Maid clash makes for one of the more interesting side battles of the cola wars; Pepsi's purchase of Tropicana may have forced Coke to hold on to Minute Maid against its will, for example. And with orange juice, the tables are turned: Pepsi, the perennial No. 2 to Coke, has the best-selling brand for a change.
Coke and Pepsi argue that orange juice is a crucial element of their respective corporate strategies. And since both beverage giants are using the same basic techniques to sell orange juice that they use to market cola, any sudden reversals of fortune for Minute Maid or Tropicana could act as an early warning sign for the future of their other brands.
As does Coke, Minute Maid wants to convince consumers that no matter where they go, it will always give them the same familiar flavor. That is because both products are distributed as concentrate to all points of the globe.
"One of the hallmarks of a brand is consistency," said Ralph Cooper, Minute Maid's president and a former Coca-Cola president in Europe. "What we are trying to do with Minute Maid is make the taste the same everywhere. That was a conscious decision we made related to the brand building we are doing."
Minute Maid, based in Houston, adopted its concentrate-only policy in 1996 as part of an image overhaul that included the change of its name from Coca-Cola Foods. Along with a new package and a new name, the company also contended that it had come up with a formula to reproduce the taste of "biting into a fresh, ripe orange."
This was achieved, it said, through careful mixing of the orange juice, along with other "parts of the orange," that it buys from the United States, Brazil and other countries.
"It's a bit of secret formula," said Joe Scalzo, Minute Maid's marketing director, evoking the heart and soul of Coca-Cola, which still will not reveal how its cola is made. "The way we process orange juice gives us the ability to tweak the formulation such that you can naturally enhance some of the taste aspects of the product."
Taking a jab at Tropicana, Mr. Scalzo said consumers do not give a hoot how a product is made as long as it tastes good. "Our competition's approach is that they squeeze the orange juice during the season and then store it, either in tanks in Florida or frozen in big blocks," he said derisively. "We process the juice the same way, year round. They are forced to vary the process based on the season."
In essence, the reconfiguration of Minute Maid mimics the model at Coca-Cola: Make a product that can be shipped worldwide, make people aware of your brand and drive demand for it through advertising.
Tropicana, of course, says Minute Maid's strategy is all wet, or rather, not wet enough. To the Pepsico unit, it seems self-evident that consumers will prefer juice that is packaged just as it was squeezed out of the orange. And there is no longer any question that it can promote its not-from-concentrate juice as a premium brand or that consumers will pay another 10 cents a quart for it.
"Tropicana is the Michael Jordan of orange juice," said Emanuel Goldman, a global consumer-products analyst for Merrill Lynch. "That's why Pepsi bought it."
But Tropicana's real competitive advantage might be its parent company's extensive delivery networks. Pepsico plans to put Tropicana products in places they are not in right now -- like additional convenience stores, airports and food-service companies. The company just introduced a 20-ounce Tropicana container, hoping to prod higher consumption with the large single-serving package.
Essentially, Pepsico wants to weld Tropicana with the other two components of its packaged-food empire: soft drinks and Frito-Lay snack foods. Pepsi senior managers, who have begun sitting in on strategy meetings at Tropicana's Bradenton, Fla., headquarters, believe the combination of the three lines creates a marketing appeal to both consumers and retailers that it calls "the power of one."
"We believe this is Pepsico's most important strategic initiative," Ms. Solomon of Salomon Smith Barney wrote in a recent report. "In test markets, Pepsico has found that Pepsi/Frito sales aisles have resulted in 30 percent sales increases." At a recent food show in Chicago, Pepsi displayed combined soft drinks and snacks in various formats, clearly indicating this was the future.
In the first quarter of this year, Tropicana's sales grew $15 million, or about 3 percent, from a year earlier, to $499 million, and its profits rose 29 percent, to $35 million, from $27 million in 1998. "Tropicana frankly had a terrific quarter," Pepsico's chief financial officer, Michael D. White, told analysts in a conference call. "We have seen the benefit of the shift to Pure Premium and the reduction of our overhead costs."
The news at Minute Maid was even better: sales grew by 5 percent over the same period, and the company turned in the best showing of any Coca-Cola unit in a quarter when Coke's volume worldwide declined by 1 percent. Minute Maid does about $2 billion in sales annually, which includes products other than orange juice.
For all the impressive results at both companies, and for all their portrayal of their products as thirst-quenchers supreme, demand for orange juice remains lackluster. Only one in five Americans drinks it for breakfast. And both Tropicana and Minute Maid constitute tiny fractions of their parent company's total revenues: $22.3 billion at Pepsico; $18.8 billion at Coke.
"We've learned that it's in the refrigerator," Minute Maid's Mr. Scalzo said, sounding a little frustrated. "How do we get them to bring it out?"
It is not just Coke that feels his pain. Tropicana does, too. "The big challenge, is to get that segment of the population that is not starting their day with orange juice," said Brian Cornell, until recently Tropicana's senior vice president for sales and marketing and now president for Europe and Canada, "and, two, to get them to continue to drink orange juice on a regular basis."
The means to such an end, both juice makers believe, is adding more products. With its eye on young families, Minute Maid has begun packaging calcium-fortified juice in single-serving boxes for snacks and lunch boxes and is marketing new flavor mixes, also with added calcium. It has introduced an orange-passion fruit juice, Mr. Scalzo said, with "a more sophisticated taste" that is supposed to appeal particularly to older women.
Tropicana is leaning heavily on the calcium-added concept, with calcium-enhanced grapefruit juice as well as orange. There is also an orange juice with extra vitamin C, vitamin E and other additives. Marketing messages include comparisons between orange juice and bananas. "Few people recognize that a glass of orange juice has as much potassium as a banana," declares Mr. Cornell, the sales chief. And another thing: bananas may not be available in your local vending machine. Tropicana ads, with their "Perfect" slogan, are aimed at, among others, older women, whose worries about losing bone-mass because of menopause tend to be more urgent than those of other groups. Other ads focus on men and children.
Still, even if orange juice is fortified to the point that it packs all the wallop of an energy bar, consumers have dozens of other choices for a breakfast drink or midday pick-me-up, from competing juice blends to endless varieties of teas and coffees. Not to mention colas.
"You're not going to be able to sell orange juice like you sell Pepsi -- price it low and stack it high," said Kevin Murphy, the chief operating officer for Ocean Spray, which has sued Pepsi, its distribution partner, over the Tropicana acquisition.
But it is not impossible to give old products a fin de siecle spark. "Look at milk," said Bob Vosburgh, who follows the business for Supermarket News, a trade publication. "There's a whole new aura for milk with these resealable single-serve jugs that were introduced by one of the big dairies. It's helped rejuvenate the whole milk category, even though it's the same thing in a new package."
Whether orange juice can pull off the same feat is unclear. "Everyone always points to what Quaker did with Snapple," Mr. Vosburgh said, referring to the cereal giant's purchase of Snapple for $1.7 billion and subsequent, humiliating sale of the beverage maker for $300 million. "What happens with Coke and Pepsi and orange juice remains to be seen."

HEADLINE: Stocks and Speeches Fatten Wallets of Presidential Contenders

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
Their bottom lines expanded by a booming stock market and lucrative speaking fees, six of the candidates for President reported assets of more than $1 million, according to financial disclosure forms filed this week.
Leading the way was Steve Forbes, the publisher, who reported assets worth more than $19 million, much of it in stocks and three properties in his hometown, Bedminster, N.J. Mr. Forbes, a Republican, also received more than $644,000 last year from 24 speeches. 
 Former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who is challenging Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination, reported assets of at least $5.7 million and income of more than $2.6 million last year, most of it from speaking fees.
Mr. Gore has reported assets of $1.4 million to $1.7 million.
Elizabeth Dole, the former president of the American Red Cross who is seeking the Republican nomination, reported assets of more than $6 million. Mrs. Dole received $1.6 million from speeches over the past 17 months, but gave $1.1 million of that to a charity, the Elizabeth Dole Charitable Foundation.
Lamar Alexander, the former Tennessee Governor who is also running for the Republican nomination, reported assets worth more than $6.8 million and nearly $1 million from the merger of a company he helped start in 1987 with an investment of $6,300.
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and his wife, Cindy, reported assets of more than $9.7 million, which includes his investments in a Phoenix beer distributor and several other businesses in his home state. Mr. McCain also reported donating a $70,833 book advance to charity.
Four other Republican candidates, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the conservative activist Gary Bauer, former Vice President Dan Quayle and the commentator Patrick J. Buchanan have been given 45-day extensions to file their reports.
Mr. Bradley reported owning several million dollars in stocks and bonds, including more than $1 million in the BankAmerica Corporation. He received $1.6 million for 64 speeches, $171,042 for lectures at Stanford University, the University of Maryland and the University of Notre Dame, and $126,953 in pension payments from the National Basketball Association and the United States Senate.
He also received $431,250 as a consultant, mainly on international economic issues, to the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, J. P. Morgan Services and the Gartner Group of Stamford, Conn. Mr. Bradley has ended his relationship with the three companies, an aide said.
Mr. Bradley reported owning property in Athens 80 acres of unimproved land in Nova Scotia, Canada, and a house in Washington, part of which he rents.
Mr. Forbes, who is expected to self-finance much of his campaign, reported receiving $42,007 from a family farm in Bedminster and a $2.2 million salary from Forbes Family Holdings, the family's publishing company, of which Mr. Forbes is president and editor in chief. He also reported liabilities of more than $4.5 million.
Most of Mrs. Dole's assets were in stocks and bonds, including more than $1 million in a Riggs Prime Money Market Fund. Her husband, former Senator Bob Dole, reported that his consulting company, Bob Dole Enterprises, was worth more than $1 million.
Mr. Alexander reported receiving $970,000 from the merger last year of Bright Horizons Family Solutions, a Cambridge, Mass., company that provides day care services to businesses, which he helped start in 1987.
He received $420,000 from stock options he was given as a board member of the Learning Company, a company in Cambridge, Mass., that produces educational software, according to the report. And Mr. Alexander received $235,000 for serving as a director of three other companies, $88,000 in legal fees and $76,000 in speaking fees last year.
In addition to his home, he reported owning two rental properties in Knoxville and a vacation house on 35 acres in Walland, Tenn.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. in Congress to Cut Domestic Spending by $26 Billion

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
Republicans in Congress completed a plan today to cut domestic spending by tens of billions of dollars next year. Their leaders warned that it would cause "sticker shock" and political pain. The White House called it "a blueprint for political chaos."
Cutting domestic spending by 11 percent might seem strange at a time of budget surpluses and economic prosperity. But in 1997, Congress and the White House agreed to spending caps to force down Federal spending. They are now chafing under the restraints they embraced. 
 The cuts will come in spending categories covering education, job training, housing, health and human services, environmental protection, medical and technological research, diplomacy and foreign aid, among other Federal programs. These follow $53 billion in cuts in domestic spending since the Republicans won control of Congress in 1994.
"We all knew this was going to be painful," the House majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, said today.
Mr. Armey said there would be "sticker shock now in realizing just how difficult it will be" to stay within the spending caps.
On Wednesday morning the House Appropriations Committee will slice up a $538 billion budget pie -- what is left of the $1.75 trillion budget after paying for mandatory programs like Medicare -- for its 13 subcommittees. Under the committee's plan, the Defense Department will receive about $270 billion, more than half the money. Every other Government agency would receive an aggregate of about $268 billion.
The committee's final spending draft for the fiscal year 2000, which will be formally approved on Wednesday, contains $26.3 billion in cuts for domestic spending, about 11 percent less than what Congress meted out for this year, and a $18.9 billion increase for the military, up about 7.5 percent, committee members said.
Members of Congress are moaning, " 'Oh, oh, oh, we can't live up to that,' " said the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi. "It's tough, but it ought to be done."
White House officials, along with some Republicans and Democrats in Congress, warned that the plan could lead to political confrontation and Presidential vetoes. Some predicted a repeat of last year's spending stalemate, which ended in a frenzied, last-minute omnibus spending bill larded with $21 billion in extras. Others remembered the standoff that led to a partial shutdown of the Government in 1995.
"The Republican budget is a blueprint for chaos," said Jacob J. Lew, the White House budget director. "These allocations are a sign of that. They would have unacceptable consequences."
Democrats say the caps have shrunk domestic nonmilitary spending to its smallest share of the national economy since 1962. They also helped create a budget surplus, but at a cost. Not all Republicans agree that they still make sense.
"There's hardly a member of Congress that doesn't realize the caps will be lifted," said Representative John Edward Porter of Illinois, a senior Republican on the Appropriations Committee.
But lifting the caps could violate promises made by Republican leaders. It could result in more spending taken from surplus Social Security funds, and it could blunt Republican plans for tax cuts, splintering two of the biggest planks in their political platform for the 2000 campaign.
Mr. Porter is one of 13 House Appropriations subcommittee chairmen -- they are called Congress's "college of cardinals" -- who will divide the $538 billion in discretionary spending on Wednesday.
Mr. Porter's subcommittee, which oversees labor, education and health programs, would receive nearly $11 billion less than last year. The subcommittee overseeing the Veterans Administration and the Department of Housing and Urban Development would take a $5.8 billion cut; the one overseeing the Commerce, State and Justice Departments, a $2.8 billion cut; the Interior Department, $2.7 billion; foreign operations, $2.4 billion.
The subcommittees must figure out how to divide their allocations and pay for their programs under the caps before the current fiscal year ends next Sept. 30.
Tonight, at least, the caps were irrelevant.
By a vote of 269 to 158, with 152 Republicans and 117 Democrats voting in favor, the House tonight passed an emergency spending bill of nearly $15 billion, twice what President Clinton requested, financing NATO's air war in Yugoslavia, relief for refugees in Kosovo and aid for disaster victims in the United States and Central America, along with billions in military projects.
About $13 billion will come from surplus Social Security funds. That money is designated as an emergency appropriation, meaning it does not count under the spending caps. Most of the rest will come from food stamp and low-income housing funds designated as surplus and unlikely to be spent this year.
The Senate will take up the bill on Thursday. The President has indicated he will sign it.

HEADLINE: Between the Feuding Rudys;
Parents Like Giuliani and Crew, but Fear for the Schools

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
Like countless other New York City parents, Nancy Gasparino and her husband, Frank, a firefighter, have considered moving from their home in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, to the suburbs. But over the past few years, with crime falling and the economy booming, they have made their fragile peace with the city.
These days, however, the thought of fleeing New York is creeping back into her head. 
 This time around, she is not worried about making ends meet or learning that one of her four children has been mugged. Rather, she fears that the feud between Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani threatens the future of their education.
"I think that Mayor Giuliani has done a really commendable job in changing the city," said Mrs. Gasparino, a Parent Teacher Association president at Public School 185, as she whipped up onion dip for an expedition to the park with her brood. "That's one of the reasons we're staying in the city. I think the schools are going in the right direction. But I'm saddened by this division between the two of them. The end result is the children are the ones getting hurt."
For parents throughout the city, whether their offspring attend thriving middle-class schools in Manhattan or failing schools in the Bronx, the feud between the two Rudys is more than idle political sport or yet another municipal soap opera. For them, it is a worrisome, even ominous, sign that the public schools -- typically the strongest, most personal tie that connects parents to the city -- have once again become a political battleground. They are angry that the two leaders most responsible for the viability of the school system are fighting rather than working together to improve education. And they fear that their children will suffer.
In dozens of interviews over the past few days, parents had trouble articulating the educational agendas of either Dr. Crew or Mr. Giuliani. But most said they had a sense that the fortunes of the schools rose and fell with those of the city and that there is more reason for hope now than in many years. When Dr. Crew and Mr. Giuliani were getting along, they said, many schools could focus on what really counted, namely, teaching and learning.
Amy Schwartz, an economist, said she feels more optimistic about the schools than at any time since the oldest of her three children entered P.S. 41 in Greenwich Village six years ago. The number of small, innovative middle schools in District 2 has mushroomed, she said, and she thinks that her fifth-grade daughter has many choices that equal those available in private schools.
She is not sure, however, whether Dr. Crew deserves the credit. "As a parent, it's hard to disentangle that," she said. But she believes that the schools have flourished in part because of the stability that came from his close relationship with Mr. Giuliani.
"It worries me that Crew might leave," Ms. Schwartz said. "I think that uncertainty and change and upheaval is not good for fledgling schools. Is there somewhere out there a better chancellor? Maybe. But I personally would be happy to stay the course for another couple of years. Maybe what we need is for somebody to stay in here long enough to get past the baloney."
Few parents had patience for the larger ideological issues -- like vouchers and mayoral control of the schools -- that have dominated the dispute between the Mayor and the Chancellor. Even those who favored vouchers, for instance, saw them as largely irrelevant to their lives.
"How is it going to help the New York City public school system to take some kids out and put them in private schools?" asked Louise Russo Chin, whose three children attend school in Bayside, Queens, the city's top-scoring district in reading and math. "That's like saying, I don't want cavities, so therefore I'll take out my teeth, rather than prevent it."
Even Mr. Giuliani's strongest supporters said they would prefer that the schools not be under the direct control of City Hall. Cecilia Soranno of Bensonhurst said she had voted for Mr. Giuliani twice and would do so again if he could run for a third term. And she said she did not think much of the Board of Education. Nonetheless, she would be leery of replacing it with mayoral control.
"I'm not saying the Board of Education has done a great job," she said. "But I think it's too much for one person. He's running the Police Department. He's running this, he's running that. Maybe if you have 48 hours a day."
Parents in poor and minority neighborhoods took a more cynical view of Mr. Giuliani. Many suggested that he has an abrasive, take-no-prisoners style that makes him a poor advocate for children.
"He's a good Mayor, but he's too dictatorial," said Nancy Walker Thompson, whose son, Mark Elijah, attends first grade at P.S. 199 in Sunnyside, Queens. The Mayor's greatest strengths, she believes, involve dealing with municipal issues like garbage, traffic and crime. "They have nothing to do with children," she said. "You can't treat a child like a rapist."
While parents had strong opinions about the Mayor, their impressions of Dr. Crew were fuzzier, although they generally believed that he was committed to public education and was trying to improve the schools against considerable odds.
"I think the Chancellor is doing the best he can," said Sonia Monsalvo, the mother of a fifth-grader at P.S. 1 in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Like many parents, Ms. Monsalvo suggested that Mr. Giuliani and Dr. Crew talk less to each other and more to parents.
Several parents complained that neither Dr. Crew nor Mr. Giuliani had ever visited their children's schools. One parent, Maria Ortiz, said Dr. Crew had recently visited her daughter's school, P.S. 165 on the Upper West Side, but only for a staged event at which he spoke English to a roomful of Spanish-speaking parents, most of whom did not understand what he was saying.
Parents in poor neighborhoods, whose children attend struggling schools, were more critical of Dr. Crew than those in middle-class neighborhoods with better schools.
"As an African-American, I expect him to do more," said Stephanie Porter, 27, whose son, Joshua, is a second-grader at P.S. 199 in Sunnyside. P.S. 199 is the anchor of the neighborhood, a mixture of blacks, Hispanics and immigrants from Mexico, India and Asia, where mothers stand outside in the morning after dropping off their children, drinking deli coffee and comparing notes on teachers and homework. "I feel he has gotten so caught up in his own self-image, and fighting to promote himself, he is not fighting to help the children."
If there was one almost universal complaint, it was not about what happens at City Hall or Board of Education headquarters at 110 Livingston Street in Brooklyn, but about what happens in the classroom. Parents throughout the city complained that their children were not being sufficiently challenged. The debate over ending social promotion -- the practice of promoting children who are failing -- misses the point, they said. Instead, the Chancellor and the Mayor should insure that teachers teach effectively the first time around, whether it takes smaller classes, better trained teachers or a stronger curriculum.
"Teachers are spending too much time disciplining and not enough time teaching," said Jeanne Barnwell, whose two sons attend schools in Bayside. Mr. Giuliani and Dr. Crew "keep talking about all these changes," she said, "but they wouldn't need all these remedial programs if they had smaller class size."
Gisela Veras, a parent from Hunts Point in the Bronx, said her son, Jazz, is failing second grade, but she does not want to put him in summer school, under a plan the Mayor has advocated. When he went to summer school last year, she said, the class spent most of its time on field trips. "If my son did not learn nothing in nine months, how is he going to learn it in two months?" she asked.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Higher Rates May Not Hurt Foreign Recoveries

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
A jump in interest rates in the United States -- which the Federal Reserve indicated yesterday was likely -- would raise the risks for the world's emerging markets just as they begin to recover from a financial crisis that began almost two years ago.
"The prospects for recovery in many of these countries are now going to be called into question," said Jose M. Barrionuevo, director of global market strategy at Lehman Brothers. 
 Even so, yesterday's announcement by the Fed, which said it now leans toward increasing rates to curb inflationary pressures, could prove to be more of a long-term benefit for these markets than the first headlines might suggest.
"If interest rates stay around here, it is not going to be devastating for emerging markets," said Jose Luis Daza, managing director for emerging markets at J. P. Morgan Securities. If rates rise much higher, though, emerging markets could suffer troublesome declines in exports and higher borrowing costs.
One positive sign yesterday was that both United States and emerging markets took the Fed announcement in stride. The Dow Jones industrial average initially plunged almost 150 points on the news but largely recovered, finishing the day off 16.52 points at 10,836.95. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose slightly while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.88 percent.
In Brazil, meanwhile, the Bovespa stock index initially fell but rebounded to finish up 1 percent on the day.
Investors hope the Fed's new bias toward higher rates may be the kind of pre-emptive strike that calms fears about inflation, a fear stoked on Friday with the news that the Consumer Price Index jumped seven-tenths of 1 percent in April. If so, rates may not rise much more.
An interest rate increase soon could also help guide the United States economy to the "soft landing" that Fed officials would like. A soft landing means a slowing of growth here. But it avoids a sharp decline, or even a recession, which would be much more damaging for emerging-market countries, many of which depend on Americans to buy their exports.
And even if the Fed does raise its short-term interest rate target, economists are not expecting a big move, such as the one that occurred when rates rose three full percentage points in just a year starting in February 1994. The forecast among many economists and market strategists calls for a total rise of three-quarters of a percentage point in the Federal funds rate between this summer and the first half of next year.
That kind of move, said Jay Pelosky, the global emerging markets strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, "is not a sufficient condition for derailing the new investment cycle in the emerging markets."
Mr. Pelosky also argued that the Fed move is "good for emerging markets because it will provide a pause or pullback for markets that have risen rapidly." Since October, the Morgan Stanley Capital International index of emerging markets has jumped more than 60 percent in dollar terms.
The immediate reaction to big news often deceives investors about the trend for the longer term. But the emerging financial markets that were open yesterday when the Fed made its announcement did not panic -- signaling that investors had already anticipated the move, as shown by the surges recently in interest rates in the United States and in emerging markets. It may also mean that investors are not that concerned about the consequences of any future Fed move.
The spreads between interest rates offered by emerging-market nations and those for Treasuries rose modestly yesterday. But the move came early in the day and did not widen after the Fed announcement, according to indexes kept by J. P. Morgan Securities.
The Fed also seemed to express confidence in the outlook for emerging markets. Past comments by Fed policy makers suggest that they would not have taken this step if they thought it would undermine global financial markets. The economic data on Brazil -- which shrank just 1 percent in the first quarter from a year ago -- and on Mexico -- which grew 1.9 percent -- have been pleasant surprises.
While a modest move by the Fed would not devastate emerging markets, it would still curb their recoveries. Mr. Barrionuevo at Lehman Brothers noted that Mexico, which sends 80 percent of its exports to the United States, would be hurt if American demand slowed. And even moderately higher interest rates -- a move, say, to more than 6 percent for long-term rates -- would make it harder for nations like Argentina and Venezuela to borrow. Venezuela is now weighing a major global bond issue.
Plenty of uncertainty remains. Until it is clear how serious any inflation threat in the United States actually is, speculation about when the Fed will raise rates and by how much will keep emerging markets volatile.
Desmond Lachman, director of emerging-markets research for Salomon Smith Barney, summed up the outlook this way. Referring to the Fed's new bias toward higher rates, he said, "Clearly, it is not good news for emerging markets."
But, he added, "we are not expecting the Brazil rebound to be derailed."

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
After years of battling with President Clinton, House Republicans are shifting their sights to Vice President Al Gore and using ridicule as their weapon of choice.
The office of the House majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, has become an unofficial clearinghouse of anti-Gore press releases and activity, with Mr. Armey mocking Mr. Gore over his pronouncements on air travel, the Internet and traffic congestion. 
 On Wednesday, House conservatives plan to enter the fray. Four or five members of the "Conservative Action Team" are to go to the House floor after the day's business and with television cameras running, give readings of what they consider to be the most provocative, or perhaps most inscrutable, sections of "Earth in the Balance," Mr. Gore's 1992 book on the environment.
The readings will come after another slap at Mr. Gore. A bill authorizing programs for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, scheduled to be voted on by the House on Wednesday, has been stripped of money for the Triana project, Mr. Gore's proposal to have a live video image of the Earth spinning in black space transmitted 24 hours a day on the Internet.
The Republicans have shifted the $32 million into medical research.
"If we're just going to put satellites up and look at Earth, that's silly," said Representative George Nethercutt, Republican of Washington. "It just happens to be a bad project dreamed up by Mr. Gore. It doesn't matter to me who came up with the nutty idea; it's a nutty idea that should go."
Mr. Armey, trying hard to stay deadpan, today distributed to reporters a list of Web sites that already carry pictures of the Earth.
The focus on Mr. Gore, the leading candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination, is a sign of how Presidential politics is seeping into Congress a full year and a half before the election. This is traditionally the time when partisan passions are running less strongly and serious legislation has more of a chance. But Congress has moved directly from the bitterness of impeachment to the passions of the 2000 campaign.
Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Mr. Gore, said today that Republicans were going after the Vice President because they "recognize this guy is an extremely strong candidate and they want to derail a compelling story." Mr. Lehane also accused the Republicans of lacking an agenda.
"They have no message of their own that's an affirmative message or a positive message," he said. "If they spent one-tenth of the effort they spend attacking us on doing some positive things, you might actually see some positive legislation coming out of the Hill."
For their part, Republicans complain that the President is devoting himself to the election of Mr. Gore and a Democratic-led House instead of seeking common cause with Republicans on issues like Social Security and Medicare.
For years Congress ran multiple investigations of Mr. Clinton. But with Mr. Gore, Republicans are betting that well-timed ridicule can be more devastating than any inquiry. In essence, they are trying to do to him what Democrats tried to do to former Vice President Dan Quayle: make him the foil for comedians on late-night television.
"On the Republican side, we are more sensitive to this, having watched what happened to Quayle," said Representative David M. McIntosh of Indiana, a former Quayle aide who is one of the organizers of the readings from Mr. Gore's book. "You can't make somebody funny when they are not providing the material," Mr. McIntosh said, adding that Mr. Gore "provides a lot of it."
So when Mr. Gore proposed a Federal traffic hot line, Mr. Armey said: "Next we'll have traffic reports from Air Force Two and a sports ticker on the White House lawn. Why should anyone have to call Washington to get their local bus schedule?"
Mr. Gore's assertion recently that he had been instrumental in creating the Internet provoked jokes not only from Mr. Armey and Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, but also from the House Science Committee. "Delusions of Grandeur: Vice President Gore Takes Credit for Creating the Internet," said a statement from the committee.
And when Representative John T. Doolittle, Republican of California, took to the House floor just before Earth Day last month, he gave a preview of what the conservatives would sound like on Wednesday. Mr. Doolittle read from the Vice President's book an assertion that the century's two world wars, the Holocaust, nuclear weapons and "global environmental crisis have led many of us to wonder if survival, much less enlightened, joyous and hopeful living, is possible."
Mr. Doolittle said: "Does any reasonable person really sit here and wonder if survival is even possible? I mean, this is unimaginable."
If anyone in Congress runs short of lines, the Republican National Committee puts out a regular fax and E-mail feature called "The World According to Gore."
Mr. Lehane, the Gore spokesman, was dismissive of the mockery, saying, "We can stand after six and a half years and say we have a stronger economy and cleaner environment and that absolutely terrifies the Republicans."
And Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, said, "This is petty politics as opposed to grand politics."
Some of the disputes do involve policy. Mr. Gore has put particular emphasis on his environmental record and is pushing for preservation of open space, a reduction of traffic congestion and easier commutes.
The House Republicans came into office determined to roll back regulation, much of it related to the environment. Many of them see Mr. Gore's initiatives on suburban sprawl as an infringement on property rights. Mr. Armey's aides are preparing a memorandum for Republicans to take with them over the Memorial Day recess telling them how to talk about Mr. Gore's anti-sprawl initiatives. They might say, for example, that people might have to ride a bus to work instead of a car.

Fed Leaves Rates Alone But Hints at Increase Later
The Federal Reserve left interest rates steady but put investors and consumers on notice that it might raise them in coming months if it continued to see signs of increasing inflation.
The shift in stance by the central bank's policy-making committee -- from neutral to leaning toward higher rates -- was subtle but signaled a clear change in the Fed's outlook from last fall, when it cut rates three times in response to the global financial crisis. Page A1. 

The Fed's announcement sent stock and bond prices tumbling, but they recovered much of their losses. The Dow industrial average fell 16.52 points, to 10,836.95. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 6.17 points, to 1,333.32, and the Nasdaq composite index declined 3.48 points, to 2,558.36. C13.
 
Loehmann's Files for Bankruptcy
Loehmann's, the Bronx-based retailer that offers designer apparel at bargain prices, filed for bankruptcy protection. The company said the filing would not have an effect on the day-to-day operations of its 69 stores. A company spokesman, however, said, it was too early to say what will happen to either the stores or Loehmann's 2,500 employees. C2.
 
The Rise of Big Computing Centers
In the engine rooms of the Internet, like a huge data center run by I.B.M. in Illinois, row upon row of powerful computers manage the Web sites and electronic commerce operations of giant companies and organizations -- a seeming reversal of the last two decades' emphasis on individual personal computers. A1.
 
J. C. Penney Announces Initiatives
J. C. Penney reported lower first-quarter earnings but announced two initiatives that could raise as much as $6 billion in revenue. The company said it was looking to sell its credit card business and also said it planned to sell a 20 percent stake in Eckerd, a fast-growing drugstore chain, to the public as a tracking stock. The news sent the company's previously lagging stock price up 9.7 percent. C5.
 
Dell's Profit Matches Expectations
Dell Computer posted first-quarter earnings that matched analysts' estimates, but the results disappointed some investors and sent shares lower in after-hours trading. C2.
 
Calpers Agrees to Rise in Premiums
In the first sign that the cost of health care insurance could rise 9 percent to 11 percent next year, the California Public Employees Retirement System, the nation's second-biggest buyer of health benefits, said that it had agreed to an average increase of 9.7 percent in premiums for government workers. C12.
 
Where DaimlerChrysler Smarts
Eight months after its introduction, the snub-nosed Smart, or as the little car is known informally, the "Swatchmobile," has become a billion-dollar headache for its parent, DaimlerChrysler. The two-seat "city car" was intended to be safe, maneuverable and spacious, but customers have complained it slides on snow and ice, and sales have lagged. C8.
 
Microsoft and Xerox in Alliance
Xerox and Microsoft announced an alliance aimed at bridging the worlds of paper documents and computers. Microsoft will license a Web-surfing technology developed by Xerox, and Xerox will incorporate Embedded NT, a version of Microsoft's Windows NT operating system, in its high-end copying systems. C5.
 
GTE Shareholders Approve Deal
GTE shareholders approved the $52.9 billion merger with Bell Atlantic, whose shareholders are to vote today. The deal, as does the one between U S West and Global Crossing, focuses on regulatory challenges to the Bells. C9.
 
Big Canadian Copper Mine Shut
Canada's largest copper mine, the Highland Valley mine in south-central British Columbia, has been closed indefinitely after the unionized work force's rejection of a cost-cutting contract. The mine accounts for 1.5 percent of global output and is considered one of the world's highest-cost producers. C9.

HEADLINE: Ganderkesee Journal;
Mulching the German Mark

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: GANDERKESEE, Germany

 BODY:
Into a stinking mixture of potato peels, apple cores, animal excrement, grass, wilting cabbage and rotten carrots, Gerald Vollmer-Heuer casually tosses about 100,000 German marks, or $57,000.
He smiles, asks a visitor to excuse the stench and watches the long-prized symbol of Germany's economic virility disappear into a heaving mound of refuse chugging along a conveyor belt. Nothing more natural in the world, for this corporate director, than the notion of turning Europe's most trusted currency into compost. 
 "The mark will enrich our soil, as it once enriched our lives," he said. "It contains carbon and cellulose that are good for my production process. Waste tends to be damp, and the paper absorbs the dampness."
These are trying times in Europe. A war in the Balkans is being prosecuted, with unhappy results, by a group of leaders who spent their youths denouncing war as wrong. The buoyant American economy amounts to a daily dose of depressant for a lethargic continent. Young people cannot find jobs. A man could be forgiven for going mad.
But for all his hilarity as he sprinkles marks into muck, Mr. Vollmer-Heuer is sane, disposing of bills that have been shredded because, like most countries in the 15-member European Union, Germany has decided to eliminate its money by 2002 in favor of the nascent common currency, the euro.
That plan has raised the question of what to do with 2,600 tons of German mark bills.
That may seem a simple question. Burn them. Shred them and dump them in a landfill site. Sell them to some American collector as souvenirs of Germany's stunning reconstruction after World War II. Recycle them as toilet paper or official stationery for the European Central Bank in Frankfurt.
But no. This being ecological, earnest Germany, nothing is quite that simple.
The bills contain oils and waxes that make them water-resistant but also make them impossible to recycle. Landfill sites are expensive. The Bundesbank does not want the onetime pride of Germany ending up on souvenir stands in Forida. And burning is wasteful.
So the notion of the mark-asmanure has emerged, and nobody, as yet, is being sniffy about it. Indeed, it is being viewed with great seriousness.
"Of course, if you think of the smell and what goes into compost, it is not that nice," said Karl Schnitzler, a spokesman for the Bavarian State Central Bank, the institution that will decide on the mark's fate. "But if you think that compost is a stimulus to growth, then it is quite a nice symbol."
Perhaps. Still, it is mildly shocking, and more than mildly nauseating, to watch the famous bills -- shredded into 800 pieces each before 60 million marks ($34.2 million) were given to Mr. Vollmer-Heuer's Environmental Protection North plant in this northern German town on a trial basis -- sitting like confetti on a sea of putrid filth.
The money consists of old bills that are being withdrawn from circulation.
A man with a mask over the lower part of his face pulls impurities like glass and plastic from the muck. "You wouldn't believe the things we pull out," Mr. Vollmer-Heuer said. "Dead dogs, dead cats, old spades. People are crazy."
Crazy is the word that Dirk Adolf, the technical director of a waste recycling company called G.F.U., thinks appropriate for the mark-to-compost proposal. He has another idea that came to him while treating labels from bottles.
These labels, he found, are useful for making tiny bullet-like pellets about 10 millimeters long and 3 millimeters thick.
Now what, it is legitimate to ask, is the use of tiny bullet-like pellets made from discarded bottle labels? Well, Mr. Adolf is able to sell them to the construction industry, which puts them into bricks. As the brick is fired, the pellets inside burn -- creating a lighter brick with unusual insulation qualities.
Pellets made of bottle labels could equally well be made of billions of dollars' worth of shredded marks. That, at least, is Mr. Adolf's proposal. "Compost is a lousy end for the mark," he said. "It is cheap, it is degrading, it is smelly. What I propose is something clean, useful and solid."
At the Bavarian State Central Bank, the marks-to-bricks idea is also getting appropriate consideration. If compost, at a stretch, can symbolize growth, bricks are an obvious symbol of stability, the very essence of the mark during its postwar life and the most desired quality for its successor, the euro.
"The stability of bricks is very interesting to us," Mr. Schnitzler said. "This is a useful idea. We will make a decision on the two proposals by the end of the year. Of course, we could give some to compost and some to bricks."
Such a fudge would, of course, have the advantage of symbolizing growth and stability, both much needed in Europe these days. But Mr. Vollmer-Heuer is determined to get the entire load.
After it emerges from sorting on the conveyor belts, his refuse is stored and periodically churned for at least two weeks in tunnel-like containers where the humidity is 100 percent and the temperature about 125 degrees.
Further sifting follows, and after about 12 weeks a fine, odorless compost is ready.
"At a ratio of 10 percent of shredded bills to other waste, our typical sack of compost will contain bills worth about 200,000 marks," he said. "That is rich stuff and it is good for Germany."
But what Germans now believe will be good for Germany is a solid euro. Having fretted over the loss of the beloved mark, they now give it little thought.
"Building pellets or manure, the question is secondary," said Mr. Schnitzler of the Bavarian State Central Bank. "The mark will soon be history, and what matters is the stability of the currency in use."

HEADLINE: O.E.C.D. Says Worst of Crisis In World Economy Has Passed

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: PARIS, May 18

 BODY:
The world economy has survived the worst of last year's crises and growth should be close to 3 percent next year as Europe makes up for a slowdown in the United States, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said today.
In a semiannual report, the research group, representing leading economies, said here that South Korea and other battered Asian nations were recovering faster than expected and that the threat of Asian trouble spilling into Brazil and the rest of Latin America had been limited. 
 Europe, it said, is showing signs of an upturn after a dip late last year and is expected in 2000 to become the strongest of the three leading economic blocs, while Japan is still struggling against recession.
The organization predicted global growth of 2.4 percent in 1999 -- up from a 2.1 percent forecast last fall when world financial turmoil was greater. And it projected 2.9 percent growth for next year.
"The economic situation for the world and the O.E.C.D. area as a whole now looks more favorable than it did six months ago," the report said.
The organization estimated 3.6 percent growth for the United States this year, doubling previous forecasts and illustrating the extent to which American economic resilience has confounded experts.
It predicted a natural slowdown next year and 2 percent growth after eight years of expansion, and the group's chief economist, Ignazio Visco, said there was probably no need to raise interest rates. The report was released on a day the Federal Reserve said it was changing its bias in favor of future rate rises.
The organization predicted 2.4 percent growth for European Union countries next year, after 1.9 percent in 1999. The smaller euro currency zone was expected to fare better, with 2.6 percent growth next year and 2.2 percent this year.
Japan's economy is likely to shrink again in 1999, by nine-tenths of a percent, according to the report. But while predicting no more than zero growth in 2000, the O.E.C.D. said there were signs that Japan, the second-largest national economy, could halt its slide. In the long term, though, Mr. Visco said, Japan is unlikely to get back to growth rates of 4 percent to 5 percent it once knew.

HEADLINE: Federal Reserve Leaning to Rise In Interest Rates

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve put investors and consumers on notice today that it might raise interest rates in coming months if it continued to see signs that inflation was brewing.
Although it voted to hold rates steady for now, the central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee dropped its neutral stance on monetary policy, under which it considered the possibility of rate cuts or rate increases to be equal. Instead, it said it was now leaning toward imposing higher rates. 
 The shift was subtle, but it signaled a clear change in the Federal Reserve's outlook from last fall, when it made three reductions in interest rates in response to the global financial crisis.
In a statement, the Fed said it was "concerned about the potential for a buildup of inflationary imbalances that could undermine the favorable performance of the economy."
Investors and economists, who considered the odds of such a shift to be roughly 50-50, were well prepared for the announcement, which came just after 2:15 P.M. It rattled Wall Street, but only briefly. Stocks, which had been up modestly, turned down before recovering most of their losses. Bond prices fell, and the dollar dipped slightly. Page C1.
"The Fed took a step without tightening policy and signaled to investors in an orderly fashion where they think the risks lie," said Joel Prakken, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisors, a consulting firm. "They're saying the economy is going too fast, given how low the unemployment rate is."
Analysts said the move was also intended to show that the Federal Reserve was no longer so worried about a global downturn or a credit squeeze in the financial markets. Rather, the central bank is increasingly concerned that strong domestic growth at a time of low unemployment could set off a worrisome increase in prices and wages.
"The odds are high, although far from 100 percent, that an upward move in interest rates is coming," said Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Primark Decision Economics, a consulting firm in Boston and New York. "Quite properly and early, the central bank has shifted focus to a potential inflationary buildup in the U.S."
The move came on the heels of Friday's report that the Consumer Price Index had risen seven-tenths of 1 percent in April, the biggest monthly jump since 1990. And it came just two weeks after Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned in a speech that inflation remained a threat despite the tremendous economic gains stimulated by huge investments in new technology that have occurred during the course of a business expansion that is now in its ninth year.
In announcing and explaining the move after its meeting today, the Fed was employing for the first time a policy of immediately disclosing shifts in its intentions. Before the policy was adopted last fall, the Federal Reserve, except when actually raising or lowering interest rates, had kept changes in its policy stance secret until after the subsequent meeting of the committee.
The new disclosure policy was adopted partly in response to longstanding calls from Congress and investors for the Fed to be more open. But it also gives the Fed more flexibility in preparing Wall Street and the public for rate changes, perhaps avoiding sharp, destabilizing swings in stock prices.
Economists said that the Fed could raise rates as soon as its next policy meeting at the end of June, especially if there were further signs of inflation or a further drop in unemployment from its current rate of 4.3 percent. But they said that if the economy began to cool on its own, the Fed might well hold off.
The main short-term rate controlled by the Federal Reserve, the Federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks, stands at 4.75 percent, where it has been since Nov. 17. The discount rate on loans made to banks from the Federal Reserve system is 4.5 percent.
The American economy has been defying predictions of a slowdown for several years; it grew at a robust 4.5 percent pace in the first quarter. Until now, however, the economy has generated almost no concrete signs of incipient inflation despite a longstanding low unemployment rate. In many ways, the spike in consumer prices last month was an anomaly, because prices at the producer level, wage increases and indicators of potential bottlenecks in production have shown few or no worrisome signs.
The situation has set off a debate about whether the economy can now grow for sustained periods at higher rates without generating the rise in inflation that traditional models would suggest. Mr. Greenspan has been among those who have made the case that technology-driven increases in productivity -- the output generated per worker -- have improved the economy's ability to grow without serious inflation and have allowed the Fed to avoid rate increases, with one exception, for more than four years.
But Mr. Greenspan has made clear that his faith in productivity improvements does have its limits, and he is apparently reaching them now.
Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues on the policy committee -- some of whom have been far less sanguine about inflation -- also confront a reviving world economy, and a domestic stock market that has left people from all walks of life feeling affluent and willing to spend. As a result, consumer demand is likely to remain strong or intensify while pressure for higher wages could grow.
The Fed is also facing a rebound in oil prices, which had been falling or depressed for several years, helping to contain inflation.
In its statement today, the Fed acknowledged that "increases in costs and core prices have generally remained quite subdued," even considering last month's jump in consumer prices.
"But domestic financial markets have recovered and foreign economic prospects have improved since the easing of monetary policy last fall," the statement said.
There are clearly dangers for the Fed in raising rates, especially if the increase is seen as precipitate. Without any clear evidence of inflation, a rate increase could fuel political criticism of the Fed and bring protests from parts of the economy, like heavy manufacturing and agriculture, that lately have been missing out on the general prosperity.
A rate increase could also drive the value of the dollar higher against other currencies, making imports more attractive in price and making it harder for American exporters to compete abroad. That could make the trade deficit, which has been expanding rapidly, even deeper.
The Fed also has to be careful not to unsettle the stock market too much. Although Mr. Greenspan has been clear for several years now that he thinks stock prices may be too high, Fed officials are well aware that if higher rates puncture the market in a way that leads to a steep drop, it could pinch off consumer spending and risk putting the economy into a stall.
Still, the committee's statement seemed clearly intended to dispel the notion that has become popular among some economists in the last few months that Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues are less inclined to strike at inflation before it takes root and more likely to wait until they have concrete evidence of its return before raising rates.

Yugoslav Forces Prepare For Possible Ground War
Yugoslav Army brigades have been deployed along the likely attack routes from Macedonia or Albania and are trying to fortify the border, in anticipation that NATO may eventually launch a ground offensive, allied officials say. A1 

NATO is examining new clues to try to determine whether Yugoslav forces may be digging up mass graves and individually reburying the bodies to hide evidence of war crimes against Kosovo Albanians, an allied spokesman said. A11
 
President Clinton said that he would not rule out the use of ground troops but that he was hopeful that diplomatic efforts with Russia would be successful. A10
 
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan criticized the United States for taking military action without Security Council blessing and China and Russia for having ignored the ethnic purging that made NATO's bombing "necessary." A11
 
Kosovo Update A11
 
Barak's Next Challenge
Israel's newly elected Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, has the delicate task of forming a coalition government out of the newly realigned Parliament of 15 parties. Taking either of the two large opposition parties into his government would strengthen his standing when negotiating a deal with the Palestinians. A1
 
Palestinians from the senior leadership to the streets of Ramallah welcomed the vote that ousted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel but stopped well short of embracing Mr. Barak. A12
 
Jewish settlers began digging foundations for a new housing complex in an Arab neighborhood of East Jerusalem, laying down a challenge to Mr. Barak a day after he was elected Israel's Prime Minister. A13
 
Hong Kong Appeals to Beijing
Hong Kong said that it would ask the Chinese Government to overturn, in effect, a court ruling that granted Hong Kong residency to more than a million people as the Government is desperate to stem a possible flood of migrants from the mainland. A3
 
Japan Acts Against Child Porn
The Japanese Parliament enacted a tougher law against child prostitution and child pornography. A6
 
Gandhi Remains Resolute
Sonia Gandhi stayed behind the high walls of her heavily guarded compound and firmly refused the pleas of senior Congress Party leaders that she change her mind about resigning as president of the party. A3
 
Russian Wants Confidence Vote
Russia's Acting Prime Minister, Sergei V. Stepashin, told Parliament that he would demand a vote of confidence in his new Government if lawmakers refused to enact economic reforms on which Western lenders have conditioned billions of dollars in new loans. A5

Shot by Mother, Woman Wins Court Approval to Die
A Florida judge ruled that a 43-year-old woman on life support will be allowed to die, as she wishes, but not until she helps prosecutors build a murder case against her mother, who shot her in the spine. A1
 
DNA Test Saves Illinois Inmate
Prosecutors in Cook County, Ill., dropped a rape and murder case against an inmate awaiting execution after DNA tests revealed that he could not have been the source of semen found in the victim. It was the 12th time in the last 12 years that an inmate on Illinois's death row has been spared by evidence showing a wrongful murder conviction. A14
 
Racial Tension in Detroit
The beating death in Detroit of an unarmed black man by Arab-Americans has brought to the surface simmering racial tensions there. A14
 
Laureate to Seek Life in Cosmos
NASA gave new prominence to its search for extraterrestrial life by appointing a Nobel laureate to head its new Astrobiology Institute. A16
 
Campaign Charges Reinstated
In a victory for the Justice Department's campaign finance investigation, a Federal appeals court panel reinstated charges against a Democratic fund-raiser that had been thrown out in district court. A16

Federal authorities have accused Alastair Duncan, a former consultant to Christie's auction house who has advised the F.B.I., of conspiring to buy Tiffany windows from a grave robber and offering the glass for sale overseas for hundreds of thousands of dollars. B1
 
Hartford Chief Talks of Racism
With racial tensions rising in Hartford, Conn., after the fatal shooting last month of an black youth by a white police officer, the city's white police chief said that he had become convinced that his force was infected with racism. B1
 
Silver Sends a Message
For five years as the Speaker of the New York Assembly, Sheldon Silver has struggled, often against a torrent of Republican criticism, to deliver this message: his Democrats are not the party of taxes, and they are not solely the party of New York City. In Monday's Assembly vote to repeal the commuter tax in New York, a levy on residents of the suburbs who work in the city, Mr. Silver saw a perfect opportunity to put some muscle behind the message.

Louima Witness Cites Screams
A Brooklyn teen-ager who was in a holding cell next door to the police station restroom where prosecutors say Abner Louima was tortured by officers testified that he heard banging and screaming at the time. B3

Fed Warns It May Raise Rates
Although it will hold rates steady for now, the Federal Reserve put investors and consumers on notice that it might raise interest rates in coming months if it continues to see signs that inflation is brewing. The shift was subtle, but it signaled a clear change in the Federal Reserve's outlook from last fall. A1
 
Military Contractors Rebound
After a decade in which Washington slashed arms spending 70 percent, military contractors expect to see an increase in outlays for weapons. The spending will go far beyond the $12.2 billion in emergency funds for the Kosovo conflict currently before Congress. C1

HEADLINE: Abolish High School? Let the Market Decide

 BODY:

To the Editor:
You report that the New York City teachers union will spend $2 million to develop a core curriculum to raise standards and help stave off attacks on public education (news article, May 16).
There go more of my (coerced) union dues down the drain. It is the Board of Education's job to develop curriculum. The union should represent teachers. 
 New York City's teachers are underpaid and face deplorable working conditions. As an economics teacher at a high school on the Lower East Side, I teach 150 students a day and don't have my own classroom. In my department 20 teachers and a chairman share a tiny office.
Instead of trying to fix "the system," the union should get me a pay raise and a tax deduction for my home office, where I spend endless hours preparing, correcting and grading.

HEADLINE: Ex-Councilman Wins Philadelphia Primary

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, May 19

 BODY:
A long and often nasty Democratic primary campaign ended Tuesday when John F. Street, the former City Council president and Mayor Edward G. Rendell's chosen successor, defeated five other candidates to win the party's nomination.
In November, Mr. Street will oppose Sam Katz, a financial consultant who is seeking to become the city's first Republican elected mayor since 1947. Mr. Katz, who lost a mayoral primary bid in 1991 and a 1994 bid to become Pennsylvania governor, faced no opposition in Tuesday's Republican primary. 
 Mr. Rendell, a Democrat who is is barred by law from seeking a third four-year term, has been credited with revitalizing Philadelphia's finances and spirit. His strong support and early endorsement of Mr. Street, along with that of the city's three main newspapers, helped Mr. Street keep atop of most polls.
With 97 percent of the ballots counted, Mr. Street had 100,308 votes, or 35 percent, to defeat Marty Weinberg, a former high-level aide to the late Mayor Frank Rizzo. Mr. Weinberg had 88,297 votes, or 31 percent, better than expected.
While the campaign began with thoughtful discourses on issues like crime, education and economic development it became dominated by attack advertising as the candidates spent record amounts, more than $12 million.
Mr. Weinberg, who is white, made no secret of the fact he was counting heavily upon a high turnout among white voters, especially those from the working-class and middle-class neighborhoods where Mayor Rizzo enjoyed widespread support during his divisive tenure as mayor.
In a series of advertisements, Mr. Weinberg showed 18-year-old film footage of Mr. Street, who is black, as a young, boisterous member of the City Council, shoving a television reporter in one instance and throwing water in someone's face in another.
Mr. Weinberg also ran advertisements that cited Mr. Street's history of personal financial problems, including two bankruptcy filings, as a way to raise questions about his ability to manage the city government.
Mr. Street, who served seven years as Council president through last December, vowed throughout his campaign to continue the progress of the Rendell Administration and avoided the mud slinging.
But he was finally drawn in last week, running commercials that condemned Mr. Weinberg for injecting race as an issue. The Street advertisements quoted newspaper endorsements of Mr. Street that chided Mr. Weinberg for exploiting racial tensions.
But in the end, it was probably Mr. Street's working partnership with Mr. Rendell that cemented victory. Over the years, they worked closely to turn around Philadelphia's financial status, from near bankrupt in 1992 to robust in more recent times. In particular, the downtown area has enjoyed a surge in economic development as Philadelphia enhances its attractiveness to tourists.
In the rest of the primary field, John F. White Jr., the city's former public housing director, received 22 percent of the vote, followed by Happy Fernandez, a former member of the City Council; Dwight Evans, a state legislator for the last 18 years, and Queena R. Bass.
While Mr. Street will undoubtedly be considered the front-runner in the fall campaign, owing in large measure to the greater number of registered Democrats over Republicans, about 7 to 2, in the city, Mr. Katz has an unusually large pool of Democrats to approach -- the majority of those who voted Tuesday for candidates other than Mr. Street.
 Mr. Katz has already been involved in the Democratic skirmishes, attacking the two candidates his campaign aides conceded he feared most, Mr. Weinberg and Mr. White.
Mr. White was the target of several efforts to discredit his candidacy. Months ago, a bogus White website appeared on the Internet, which contained inflammatory racial comments. An aide to Mr. Evans was found responsible for it.
Just days ago, city voters reported receiving anonymous telephone calls in which a voice said Mr. White "seriously mismanaged" day-care operations and the city's public housing agency. Mr. White blamed Mr. Weinberg for the calls but provided no proof.

Pratt Retirement Offer

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Pratt & Whitney, the aircraft engine maker, has reached a deal with the Machinists union to increase the number of its Connecticut employees who are eligible for early retirement.
As the Asian economic slump continues, Pratt is looking for ways to trim its work force. It announced last fall that it planned to cut about 1,000 jobs, largely through retirements. Some 920 of the 6,600 workers at Pratt plants in Cheshire, East Hartford, Middletown, North Haven and Rocky Hill qualified for the original retirement offer. 
 Under the arrangement with the union, 260 more workers would become eligible. Among them are workers who were not previously eligible but would have qualified for the offer by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: Citizens' Electronic Inquiries Get Governments' Attention

BYLINE: By RITA BEAMISH 

 BODY:
GOODBYE, phone-menu torment. Adios, disembodied operators taking calls in the order received. A revolution in customer service is emerging on the government pages of the Web.
Those daunting Web sites containing volumes of government data, images and icons are moving beyond the standard fare of search engines, links, forms that can be downloaded and the like. Now government officials actually accept questions via E-mail. And, more important, they send answers. 
 Looking for information on a rare disease? The United States Department of Health and Human Services (www.hhs.gov) invites inquiries through its healthfinder .gov, which the site calls "a free gateway to reliable consumer health and human services information."
Wondering whether a neighbor's drainage will affect your drinking water? The Environmental Protection Agency (www.epa .gov) has two dozen librarians fielding as many as 1,500 such E-mail questions each month, with a typical response time of fewer than five days.
Tax policy questions? The Internal Revenue Service (www.irs.gov) awaits your E-mail. What about gulf war illnesses or military base closings? The Department of Veterans Affairs (www.va.gov) and even the Pentagon, with its chock-full site at www .defenselink.mil, are churning out E-mail replies.
"Agencies are learning how to use this tool to answer questions and to provide information," said Greg Woods, an Education Department official who is chairman of the Government Information Technology Services Board, part of Vice President Al Gore's initiative on reinventing Government.
With an estimated 6,000 home pages just for Federal agencies, and countless others for state and local governments, the potential for E-mail assistance is vast. Of course, most sites have search engines that can be used to zero in on information. But for some people, search engines are not the best option -- search terms may be hard to divine, or the results may be hard to interpret.
So some consumers wanting information are finding that, though it may take a day or it may take weeks, specialists from the government are, in some cases, able to give direct answers to inquiries, point out material already on their sites or refer questioners to other government resources.
When Lee Bergamini's mother-in-law was moving to Connecticut from Florida, he needed to notify Federal pension officials who deposit her benefit check in her bank. Mr. Bergamini found the Federal Technology Service's site at www.usgold.gov, which is in the process of publishing on-line directories of all Federal agencies and workers. He found the E-mail address of Jack Finley, director for electronic messaging at Federal Technology Service.
Mr. Finley was able to furnish Mr. Bergamini with the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation's phone number and mailing and on-line addresses.
Susan Glickman, a Florida political consultant, got stuck when looking for a comprehensive mailing list of state legislators. She fired off an E-mail message to the Florida Legislature's site (www.leg.state .fl.us), which sent her precise instructions on how to find and download it.
Robert Bickner of Madison, Wis., and Linda Powell of Wilmington, Del., both researching family history, sent E-mail inquiries to the National Archives and Records Administration (www.nara.gov) and received replies telling them how to get the records they sought. The National Archives agency expects that half of its queries from the public will be by E-mail or fax by 2007, said Jennifer Nelson, the Webmaster for the agency.
Mr. Bickner, a professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, said: "With very little effort, I got the records I have been looking for. I was so impressed that I sent a message back and said, 'Thank you for putting this very user-friendly feeling on things.' "
Ms. Powell, a bookkeeper, said: "The best part is you're not on hold for half an hour. You send it and it's done."
But before everyone stampedes the government sites, there is something of a catch with the E-mail approach: the agencies' policies are inconsistent and clearly evolving. Some agencies would rather you called their toll-free numbers, or wrote to them, or searched the Web site yourself before sending any E-mail queries. Yes, many post an E-mail address, but some make it a challenge to find it on their sites.
For instance, the "contact information" button on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration home page (www .osha.gov) leads to a directive to use the phone, not E-mail, to reach the agency in emergencies and to call regional offices for policy or regulatory questions. Some hunting turns up a "suggestion box" page that solicits comments or ideas but bars inquiries about policy or regulatory issues.
"The ideal Web site is to answer as many questions as possible, so the last option is to send an E-mail which requires a person to intervene and answer a question," said Rich Kellet, division director for Emerging Information Technology Policies at the General Services Administration. "E-mail is a difficult issue because of the volume and the potential for huge volume. So agencies are still working on how to answer those issues."
In another development related to government information on line, the Government's National Technical Information Service and Northern Light Technology announced a fee-based search engine for Federal Government Internet sites and documents on Monday. But the Commerce Department has had second thoughts and has decided to make the service available without a fee, at least until there is a decision on whether charging fees for cross-agency search services would conflict with the Clinton Administration's policy on unrestricted access to Government information.
Still, many government agencies are independently struggling with ways to provide information and assistance for free, officials said.
Henry Lai, director of General Services' Center for Emerging Technologies, which oversees the agency's site at info.gov, said his staff generally directed people to the agency's information specialists who answer a toll-free number at the Federal Information Center. "We don't encourage people to send E-mail," Mr. Lai said.
Many agencies, including the Social Security Administration (www.ssa.gov), use a "feedback" link. But Social Security's site specifies that feedback means comments about the Web site, not requests for information. The agency fields 70 million telephone calls a year on its 24-hour toll-free lines. Even so, the agency manages to respond to 55,000 E-mail messages a year, officials say, and its New York regional home page, for one, does invite E-mail questions.
Over at the notoriously sluggish Immigration and Naturalization Service, there is a reason why the site www.ins.usdoj.gov contains no E-mail addresses. Greg Gagne, a spokesman for the agency, said incoming messages "would be astonishing because of the huge demand" on a site visited by 430,000 users a month. "What may seem quite simple is quite often not so simple, and it takes an extraordinary amount of work to answer," Mr. Gagne said. Even so, the agency plans to revamp its Web site and include E-mail capability by the end of the year, he said.
The welcome mat is already out at the Internal Revenue Service, where chatty language and animated cartoon figures throughout the site are chipping away at the agency's stodgy image.
At www.irs.gov, the agency promises: "We'll help you cut through the clutter. Now just tell us what else you need." Its E-mail flow has grown to a projected 300,000 questions this year from 13,000 in 1996, said Dave Medeck, national director of the telephone operations division. Two hundred revenue agents and audit staff members answer the E-mail, handling general policy questions but not individual tax cases, Mr. Medeck said.
The mere fact of a personal reply is satisfaction for some who send E-mail queries, and actually getting solutions can be empowering.
Linda Scott-Aughtry contacted a Social Security branch in Baltimore by E-mail and was able to resolve a months-old delay in payment of her benefits.
"I quit school when I was in 10th grade," Ms. Scott-Aughtry said. "I've been working ever since. For me to go into the computer and accomplish that, it really made me feel great."
 
The On-Line Data Trail
Coming Across Agencies With Facts to Share and Pleasant Manners
IT was like having a personal government staff. I needed some research on past Presidential Cabinets. I could have plowed through library books, but I knew the National Archives and Records Administration would have my answer in its millions of pages of documents.
I logged on to www.nara.gov. My information wasn't there, but an E-mail address was. I sent off my query, and 12 days later I received the precise information, complete with citations and details, in an E-mail message that was as chipper as a happy-face sticker. This was the most gratifying use of my tax dollars since the Park Service began building bike paths.
So when tax season came along, I visited the Internal Revenue Service on line (www.irs.gov). My E-mail query requested the agency's standard for reimbursable mileage costs, and back came the reply: 31 cents per mile. It was a softball, but I was still impressed that I got a reply in less than two days.
Perhaps most impressive was my on-line encounter with the California Environmental Protection Agency (www .calepa.ca.gov). I wanted to know whether the air quality was improving in parts of my home state. The agency replied to my query in three days, stating that my message had been forwarded to the Air Resources Board. The same day, the ombudsman's office of the Air Resources Board came through with several Web addresses for air quality information.
The specialist who wrote to me, Jon Pederson, also offered to mail an article on "clean air pockets" from The Los Angeles Times. The article arrived a few days later. Another delightful experience.
But at some point, even E-mail information seekers must do a little work. Asking the Census Bureau (www.census .gov) for specific economic information a while back brought an E-mail response a month later listing several Census reports that I could order for $10 to $150 apiece. Then I'd have to search the pages myself for my data. I passed on the offer.

Business inChina: Longer-Term Worries

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, May 19

 BODY:
When anti-American demonstrations erupted in Chinese cities 10 days ago, executives at several United States companies went into crisis mode and evacuated employees. In Beijing and Shanghai, some Americans felt trapped inside their homes, fearful that angry students could turn into unruly mobs.
As scary as the demonstrations looked, calm returned in a few days, and there was little violence. Despite official and popular anger aroused by the accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by United States aircraft under NATO auspices, no Americans were seriously injured. And though some companies have postponed advertising plans or delayed executive visits, the palpable impact on American business here has been moderate. 
 Chinese officials have sought to reassure executives that their operations are safe and that economic reform policies will continue. Yet the true damage may not be physical as much as psychological.
The long-term effects of China's recent surge of nationalist emotion trouble many American businessmen. It may be too early to tell exactly how the business environment will be affected, but the politically radical language that has dominated China's official media -- an indicator of internal political struggle -- signals a slowing of some reforms and greater uncertainty.
"The same guys who are telling us everything is O.K. are going out and encouraging students to take to the streets," said the chief representative of a multinational corporation, who works in Beijing. "How much confidence does that give you?"
Communist Party politics still dominate policy-making in Beijing, where decisions are highly secretive and nationalism is an unwieldy trump card. Yet market economics have become steadily more entwined in Chinese politics over the years, and today, foreign investment is a major concern because it has proved a critical ingredient in the nation's locomotive-like economic growth over the last decade.
Foreign investment is falling this year, principally because Asian neighbors hurt by the regional economic crisis have scaled back operations. Chinese officials are concerned that too sharp a drop could affect China's growth rate, with a target of 7 percent his year, slightly lower than the 7.8 percent last year.
China's Foreign Trade Ministry announced today that foreign direct investment fell 12.6 percent in the first four months of the year to $10.24 billion, compared with the similar period of 1998. Over all, foreign investment is expected to fall to about $30 billion this year from $45.6 billion in 1998.
American enthusiasm for investing in China has gone in cycles, with waves of interest inevitably followed by cycles of disillusionment. The almost immeasurable size of China's market, and the romance of an exotic culture, has sometimes obscured the perennial problems of corruption, interference by local officials and unenforceable laws.
"It's a bit scary," said Benny Chiu, a China research analyst for HSBC in Hong Kong, referring to the recent unrest. "But once everything calms down, other problems look much more serious."
Some American business executives are eager to counter what they feel was an exaggerated depiction of recent events.
"There has been a limited impact," said John Sullivan, vice chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing. "A handful of companies suspended operations for a day or so, but that was it."
Mr. Sullivan complained that television coverage of the demonstrations in Beijing created the impression that the whole city was under siege, while the rock-throwing was actually limited to the diplomatic quarter in one section of town, and had only a moderately negative effect on business.
Two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in the southern city of Changsha were wrecked, but 308 other KFC outlets in 70 cities around China were undamaged. United Airlines, the UAL Corporation unit, suffered a wave of cancellations by scared tourists, as did many hotels, although several reported recovering bookings this week.
In Shanghai, senior officials met with foreign investors early last week to try to ease concerns. Mayor Xu Kuangdi traveled to General Motors' $1.5 billion plant where Buicks are assembled, while a vice mayor met with several representatives of leading American banks.
"Shanghai will continue to welcome foreigners to make investment in this city," said Xia Zhongguan, a senior official at the Shanghai Foreign Investment Commission. "Politics should be separated from business and trade. The bombing is one thing; foreign investment is another."
Despite the efforts of Mr. Xia and others to be reassuring, as an American lawyer in Shanghai noted, it is precisely because some aspects of China remain so politicized that officials are talking about the need to separate politics from business. "This is clearly being played as a political card by some factions in the leadership," the lawyer said. "It has economic, political and psychological effects that are hard to measure. This kind of campaign hasn't happened here in 25 years."
Several executives said it was not physical danger that concerned them, but the unknowns created by a politically volatile landscape. In a country where courts, every level of official policy and even nongovernmental organizations can be affected by a shift in political mood, little is certain.
Many business people said they were surprised by student calls for boycotts of American goods. But virtually no such boycotts materialized in an organized way, perhaps in part because American goods are most popular among young people here.
Tony Chen, director of public affairs for Tricon Global Restaurants Ltd., which operates 310 Kentucky Fried Chicken and 40 Pizza Hut restaurants in China, said that efforts to organize boycotts fell flat in part because local KFC managers told demonstrators that 95 percent of their food was locally produced. Altogether, KFC employs more than 23,000 people throughout China.
Mr. Chen said sales were down about 10 to 15 percent last week, but were expected to be back to normal this week. "Over all, the impact was marginal," Mr. Chen said, adding that plans are proceeding to open several dozen more outlets this year, expanding KFC's presence in China to 96 cities from 70.
In an unexpected turn, Mr. Chen also said, officials of many cities became more available to Kentucky Fried Chicken employees than they are normally, apparently because they were ordered to do so by the central Government. Ordinarily, many businessmen complain, local officials in Chinese cities are notoriously inaccessible.
"In a couple of cities, they told us not to hesitate to contact them," Mr. Chen said. "That has never happened before."

For New Party, the Man of the Hour Is . . . a Man

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: KLERKSDORP, South Africa, May 18

 BODY:
In a field of professional politicians, Louis Luyt stands out. There isn't another fertilizer magnate turned beer baron turned rugby czar in the running.
His slogan is "We Mean Business." An American pollster working here calls him "South Africa's Ross Perot," and the word from his spokesman is: "As he says, Exxon has four times the G.D.P. of South Africa, and if Exxon can be run like a business, this country can." 
 But ask Mr. Luyt what voters see in him, and he says bluntly, "They're looking for a man."
A man?
"A man who will stand up to adversity. A man who will stand up for their rights."
Mr. Luyt (pronounced late) entered the race only seven months ago, but he was already a household name -- not always uttered in admiration -- and doesn't shirk from spending money.
He drew only 120 listeners to the civic auditorium of this farming city on Tuesday night, but pollsters say he is close to the 1 percent of the national vote that would assure his new Federal Alliance Party of seats in Parliament after the election on June 2.
The party has a full list of candidates -- most of them conservative white defectors from the National Party -- but it is clearly a one-man bandwagon. All its posters show only his face -- the gray hair and narrow, slightly suspicious eyes of a millionaire executive, the remarkably thick neck of a former rugby lineman -- and the word "Vote."
"It's subliminal," Mr. Luyt joked.
"Looking for a man" may seem a fusty concept, especially compared with the modern I-feel-your-pain ethos of American politics, but to judge by the listeners arriving on Tuesday night, Mr. Luyt, 66, knows his audience.
"He's a strong leader," said Ria van Wyk, a retired teacher. "A good leader -- a go-get-'em type," said Henry de Korte, a college student. "Someone who could pull the country together," said D. P. Badenhorst, a retired farmer.
A quarter of the small crowd was black, as Mr. Luyt says 60 percent of his supporters are -- which is surprising, considering that a year ago, he was the embodiment of rugby's refusal to let the Government pressure it to put black players on the national team before coaches judged them ready.
The league forced Mr. Luyt to resign as its president because he sued to stop a Government inquiry into corruption and racism in the sport and his lawyers forced President Nelson Mandela to spend two humiliating days on the stand.
But to blacks disappointed in the African National Congress Government, and particularly its failure to curb crime, Mr. Luyt has some appeal.
"Africans, African men especially, like a man who is big and strong, who has authority," said Nomavenda Mathiane, a black reporter who watched Mr. Luyt campaign in black townships like Soweto and Alexandra. "They might not vote for Luyt, but they respect him."
A black Klerksdorp resident, a 40-year-old storekeeper who declined to give his name, saying he feared being attacked, came because "I read his manifesto -- fighting crime is his priority No. 1. My friends are disillusioned with the A.N.C., and most like Louis Luyt."
On the issues, Mr. Luyt calls himself a liberal. But he favors chain gangs for criminals, the return of the death penalty, rapid deportation of illegal immigrants, the establishment of a Christian state, prayer in public schools and Parliament, an end to abortion except in rape cases and merit hiring in preference to affirmative action.
Liberalism in South Africa is often about race; Mr. Luyt does not defend apartheid and mocks the idea of a volkstaat, a separate Afrikaner homeland. In 1988, seeking an end to the international sports boycott, he defied the old apartheid Government to meet the African National Congress in exile and cut a deal to desegregate rugby.
No one doubts his business prowess. A former captain of the Orange Free State rugby team with degrees in law and business, he founded Triomf Fertilizers, which he said became one of the largest fertilizer companies in the world.
In 1971, he founded Louis Luyt breweries and captured 16 percent of the market in one year. Since 1986, he has turned the debt-ridden Golden Lions rugby team and Ellis Park, a stadium in Johannesburg, into a franchise richer than all the country's other teams combined -- an accomplishment that has endowed him with a higher cash/humility ratio than George Steinbrenner.
Asked about reports that he had spent 2 million rand of his own on the race --about $300,000 -- he scoffed. "I spent 3 million last week." He declined to name the total; "my bank manager would kill me."
He turned snide on being told a popular political analyst had estimated that he would spend $6 a vote to get 50,000 votes ("the average rugby crowd," the analyst had cattily noted). He was spending far more than "that failed journalist turned political analyst" knew, he said, and would win 20 of the 400 seats in Parliament -- a bold prediction, since polls he dismisses suggest he might get four.
Though sometimes bombastic for television cameras, he is no rabble-rouser. His subdued speech here was almost wistful for "this beautiful land of ours" that he said had been turned over to majority rule too precipitously and was being mismanaged; five more years of A.N.C. Government, he said, "and you'll be sitting in poverty wondering what might have been."
The applause was polite. At the end, he almost begged for questions; no one had any.
When Mr. Luyt declared his candidacy in October, he hoped to unite all the opposition parties against the African National Congress, which is expected to win the election handily. That union never happened. But he doesn't regret the effort.
Unlike an endless American campaign, "it hasn't been miserable," he said. "It's been expensive! But not miserable."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Investors Send a Vote of Confidence to the Fed

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Rates on short-term Treasury securities held steady yesterday, while longer-term rates fell sharply, as investors seemed to send a vote of confidence -- at least for now -- to the Federal Reserve.
On Tuesday, Fed policy makers said that they were leaning toward raising rates to slow economic growth and curb inflation. Although they did not actually raise their interest rate target, which is now 4.75 percent, the warning is now official. 
 The threat of a rate increase by the central bank had been one of the reasons for the recent bond market selloff that sent long-term rates up to 5.92 percent, their highest in a year. But by yesterday, traders and strategists said, investors were concluding two things: that the selloff had probably gone too far, and with the Fed ready to move, the inflationary threat was less serious.
"I think it's more confidence in the Fed," said Thomas Connor, head government trader at J. P. Morgan Securities. "They've got their eye on the ball here."
The price of the 30-year bond, which is very sensitive to inflationary expectations, rose 1 2/32, to 92 7/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.80 percent, from 5.88 percent on Tuesday. The recent high, 5.92 percent, was Friday, when inflationary fears were heightened by the report that the Consumer Price Index jumped seven-tenths of 1 percent in April, the largest monthly increase in eight and a half years.
The yield on the two-year note was unchanged at 5.43 percent, and the yield on December futures on the Federal funds rate, which is the Fed's target rate, slipped to 5.15 percent from 5.17 percent.
This does not mean that investors think the Fed can avoid raising interest rates to curb inflation. In fact, the yield on the December futures indicates they expect as much as half-a- percentage-point increase by then.
But if interest rates hold the line, it would show that investors expect the Fed to succeed in curbing inflationary pressures without having to raise interest rates significantly.
Richard Berner, the chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, is forecasting a jump in the Fed funds rate of half a percentage point by the end of the year.
Mr. Berner said bond investors might have been heartened by the recent decline in commodity prices, especially oil. Yesterday, the price of oil for June on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 23 cents, to $16.88, its first dip below $17 since mid-April. Some industrial metal prices, including copper, have also declined recently, after strong rallies this spring.
Mr. Berner added that the dollar's new rally against the yen might be a signal that more Japanese investors would resume buying Treasury bonds, which would help alleviate the upward pressure on rates.
But rates are sure to bounce around for a while as new data on growth and prices are released. Oil prices could turn around again, as some analysts are predicting. And a revival in global economic growth could send other commodity prices up again. Any indication that inflationary pressures are increasing will probably push rates higher, as investors speculate on when the central bank will finally pull the trigger.

Central Bank Resolve to Fight Inflation Helps Send Dow Up

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks rose on optimism that the Federal Reserve's resolve to fight inflation will accelerate gains in the market.
"The Fed's willingness to act pre-emptively and address these issues is a major positive" for stocks, said John Bartlett, a senior portfolio manager for Commerce Funds, a unit of Commerce Bancshares Inc. in St. Louis. "Low and stable inflation and interest rates create the optimal environment for corporations' economic activity." 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 50.44 points, or five-tenths of a percent, to 10,887.39. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 10.91 points, or eight-tenths of a percent, to 1,344.23. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 19.04 points, or seven-tenths of a percent, to 2,577.40. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners, 1,762 to 1,270, on the New York Stock Exchange.
General Electric rose 3 3/4, to 108, contributing most to the gains in the S.& P. 500 and the Dow after its GE Capital unit said it would increase earnings, revenue and assets in Europe by about 15 percent this year as it forms more joint ventures. It also agreed to take over the Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Company's life reinsurance operation, acquiring a business that had $105.5 billion in policies last year.
Some stocks gained on acquisitions. Raychem, a maker of telecommunications cables, was the biggest gainer in the S.& P. 500 after Tyco International agreed to buy it for $1.4 billion in cash plus stock and assumed debt, or $37 a share, a 19 percent premium to Raychem's closing price on Tuesday. Raychem rose 5 1/8, to 36 1/4, and Tyco gained 4 1/8, to 93 1/2.
Healtheon soared 24 3/8, to 80 1/4. The Internet health care claims processor is in talks to merge with the closely held WebMD.
The market overcame a drop in computer shares set off when Dell Computer reported a second consecutive quarter of slowing sales growth. Dell slid 4 1/4, to 39 13/16, and I.B.M. fell 2 5/8, to 235 7/8.
Airline stocks fell after a monthly industry report showed a bigger-than-expected drop in April business. UAL, the parent of United Airlines, led the decline, falling 5 7/8, to 74 11/16. Delta Air Lines slipped 3 3/16, to 61 1/2; U S Airways Group fell 2 3/4, to 52 1/8, and AMR , the parent of American Airlines, lost 2 1/8, to 69 3/16.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Little Latin Area Effect Seen From Fed's Alert

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, May 19

 BODY:
The possibility of an increase in United States interest rates, as suggested by the Federal Reserve this week, is unlikely to undermine the steady improvement in Latin America's economic outlook, forecasters said today.
Although fear of higher American rates was partly responsible for drops in Latin American stock markets, it was seen as a knee-jerk reaction. More important, economists said, is the strengthening momentum of Brazil, the region's largest economy, and the benefits such strength can carry over to others. 
 Reduced capital flows, the greatest concern facing Latin nations if the Fed were to raise rates, did not fan fears at Brazil's central bank, which continued cutting interest rates today, this time to 23.5 percent from 27 percent. The reduction is the seventh since the devaluation in January of Brazil's currency, the real, and reflects growing confidence at the bank that the nation can withstand volatility generated from abroad.
"The new currency regime allows us to absorb external impacts in a better way," said Octavio de Barros, chief economist here for Banco Bilbao Vizcaya.
Mr. de Barros contrasted the situation of Brazil with that of Argentina, where a system that fixes the value of the peso to the dollar limits the Government's use of monetary policy to react to foreign shocks.
Indeed, most analysts agree that Argentina is the Latin American country most susceptible to an increase in rates in the United States, since it borrows so much abroad.
Mexico, the second-biggest Latin country, is largely shielded from a United States rate increase for the same reason as Brazil, since the Government mainly borrows on domestic bond markets. Yet Mexico, with nearly 90 percent of exports going to the United States, could be hurt by weaker American demand for its goods.
By contrast, only about a third of exports from the Mercosur trade bloc, which comprises Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, go to the United States.
Countries such as Chile would be insulated from higher American rates, largely since they are considered safer investments by debt-rating agencies, said Walter Molano, chief Latin America economist at BCP Securities in Greenwich, Conn. And Venezuela, which has sent mixed signals to investors since President Hugo Chavez took office in February, is partly protected from a rise in American rates because of recent increases in the price of oil, the country's main export.
"A rise in U.S. rates would probably get lost in the detail," said Arturo Porzecanksi, global head of fixed-income research for ING Barings in New York.
But he said that an increase could end up hurting Argentina the most, since the Government there is so dependent on international capital markets for its borrowing needs. "More than 90 percent of Argentina's debt is denominated in currencies they cannot print and cannot tax," Mr. Porzecanski said.
On Latin stock markets today, Argentina's benchmark Merval index registered the deepest decline, falling 4.3 percent, partly because of rumors that it would scrap the system that links the peso to the dollar. The Government denied this.
In Mexico City, the Bolsa index dropped 2.1 percent. Here in Sao Paulo, Brazil's financial center, the Bovespa index declined 1.2 percent. Stocks were also down in Chile, Venezuela, Colombia and Peru.
Latin American equities become less attractive to foreign investors when interest rates rise in the United States because of improved returns on securities such as American Treasury bonds.
While Brazil's central bank showed today that there is ample room for it to stoke a recovery, there are still concerns over the country's dependence on foreign capital flows. For instance, the estimate for this year's trade surplus has fallen to about $4 billion from $11 billion, an illustration that the currency devaluation has not done as much as once hoped to increase exports. And the ability to finance debt would be made more difficult if American rates rise.
"Brazil is an importer of capital so any increase in U.S. rates is negative," said Jose Scheinkman, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago. "The only way to attack this problem in a long-term way is for the Government to curb spending."
Although Brazil has made substantial progress in narrowing it budget deficit, before payments of interest on debt are taken into account, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso was dealt a minor setback this week in efforts to limit pension spending, when congressional pressure led him to withdraw a decree creating a minimum retirement age for some workers.

HEADLINE: Car Transporters Confronted By Threat of Teamsters' Strike

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 19

 BODY:
In a move that would likely limit the selection of vehicles available to consumers, the teamsters' union is threatening a strike by drivers against the trucking companies that carry new cars to dealerships. But such a move would not affect the economy as much as a strike at an auto factory.
Earlier this week, the drivers voted overwhelmingly to authorize their leaders to call a strike if a new national contract with the trucking companies cannot be negotiated before the current four-year contract expires on May 31. 
 This contract was concluded only after a 32-day strike in 1995 against the leading car-transport company at the time, Ryder System Inc. in Miami, and many in the auto industry are concerned that another strike may be likely.
With auto sales running at the fastest pace ever through the first four months of this year, a strike could quickly disrupt supplies to dealerships. "Everyone would have a problem," Jacques Nasser, the Ford Motor Company's chief executive, said earlier this week.
But the problem would not be as serious as last summer's 54-day strike by General Motors auto parts workers in Flint, Mich. That strike forced G.M. to close virtually all of its North American assembly plants.
Auto makers were able to keep their factories operating during the 1995 strike, shipping new cars and light trucks by rail whenever possible and storing other finished vehicles in empty lots. G.M., the auto maker most reliant on Ryder, continued shipping cars by rail to its 50 regional distribution centers and invited dealers to send employees to drive the new cars from the centers to the dealerships.
State laws allow vehicles to be sold as new even if dealers and their employees have had to drive them to their point of sale. Since the last strike, Ryder has sold its car-transport business to Allied Holdings Inc., based in Decatur, Ga.
A strike could be much more significant for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and its new president, James P. Hoffa, than for the auto industry. While the teamsters now represent workers in many industries, the union has its roots in trucking, where much of the organizing was done by Mr. Hoffa's father, James R. Hoffa. These negotiations offer Mr. Hoffa his first chance to show whether he can win bigger gains for drivers than his predecessors.
If negotiators for the teamsters and trucking companies are unable to reach a deal by May 31, the drivers would not necessarily strike immediately though they have threatened to. The union made a similar threat in 1995 but waited until September.
Some auto assembly plants close for weeks at a time in June and July to install new equipment for the building of the next model year's vehicles. The teamsters would be able to put more pressure on the transport companies for a settlement if the union waits until factories resume weekly production of hundreds of thousands of new cars.
If the drivers struck, dealerships would most likely run out of popular models that are in short supply. Inventories are now lowest for full-sized sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks and for Japanese-brand minivans like the Honda Motor Company's Odyssey.
The Flint strike last summer led to the layoffs of nearly 200,000 workers at G.M. and thousands of employees at its suppliers, significantly slowing economic growth in the United States in the second and third quarters.

HEADLINE: Alvin Rockwell, 90; Lawyer Helped Mold A Postwar Germany

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Alvin John Rockwell, a prominent San Francisco lawyer who as a Government attorney helped to draft the legal system for a democratic postwar Germany, died yesterday in San Francisco, where he lived. He was 90.
In 1945 he was posted to Berlin as legal adviser to Gen. Lucius D. Clay and director of the legal division of the Military Government in the American-occupied parts of western Germany and Berlin, where he helped rebuild the legal system as one rooted in both the traditional German code law and democratic principles. 
 Working with his French and British counterparts, he helped shape what is now the legal structure of the Federal Republic of Germany. He also reached the German public directly in speeches and on the radio to discuss the distinctions between democratic and totalitarian systems.
Born in Kalamazoo, Mich., he graduated from DePauw University in 1929 and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He studied for a year at the London School of Economics and received a law degree at Harvard Law School in 1933.
He briefly practiced in Boston before moving to Washington to serve as a labor lawyer. He worked in the Solicitor General's Office as special counsel to the Attorney General and as a trial examiner and general counsel to the National Labor Relations Board, for which he successfully argued cases before the Supreme Court.
He moved to San Francisco in 1948 to become a partner in the firm of Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison. He specialized in litigation and headed its executive committee in the 1970's; he had been of counsel to the firm since 1979.
He was a lifetime trustee of DePauw and a past trustee of the San Francisco Law Library.
Mr. Rockwell's wife, Anna Hayward Rockwell, died in 1983 after 50 years of marriage. He is survived by a son, John S., of Manhattan, editor of the Arts & Leisure section of The New York Times; a sister, Gladys Osborne of Delray Beach, Fla., and a granddaughter.

HEADLINE: World Bank Delays Aid So Indonesians Can't Use It to Buy Votes

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
Top Clinton Administration officials said today that they had pressed the World Bank to make sure that more than a billion dollars in aid to Indonesia was held up for several weeks so that the country's Government could not use it to buy votes in the first free election there in more than 40 years.
Today the agency announced that Indonesia had "voluntarily" agreed to a freeze in use of the money until the June 7 election is held, even though several hundred million dollars will be deposited in the next few days in an account under Indonesia's control. 
 The agreement reflects the depths of Washington's fears that the ruling Golkar party, dominated by President Suharto until his resignation a year ago, would use the money to remain in power.
Mr. Suharto's handpicked successor, President B. J. Habibie, is hoping to hold on to the presidency after the parliamentary election, the first step in a lengthy process to select a president.
Today Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin told a subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee that "Europe, the United States and others" felt that the aid to Indonesia "ought to be held up until after the election."
After Mr. Rubin's testimony, Treasury officials corrected his remarks, saying that some portion of the loans -- by some accounts more than $400 million -- would be made available almost immediately. Most of that money is to help Indonesia manage its water resources, and World Bank officials said several safeguards would enable them to track the money and make sure it was going to approved projects.
But the remaining $1.1 billion, about half of which was originally to have been sent to Jakarta's accounts on Tuesday, has been held up. Much of that money is for what the World Bank calls "general budget support" to stimulate the economy, meaning that it would go directly to the Government's main coffers.
As one American official said today, "The worry is that it would end up in little envelopes" in a country where corruption is endemic, and at a time when Mr. Habibie's party is suffering at the polls, partly because of the continuing disclosures of corruption and cronyism during the Suharto era.
Even without the World Bank money, much of which is to help provide a safety net for those who lost their jobs or fell below the poverty level during the Asian financial crisis, Jakarta has plenty of ways to lubricate the election process with cash. It could, for example, simply print more rupiahs, the nation's much-devalued currency, but Treasury officials say there is no evidence it is doing so.
The delay also gives the World Bank and the Clinton Administration some breathing room to assess the outcome of the election. There are fears in Washington that if the Habibie Government tries to rig the results, violence and political chaos could follow.
The fate of the Indonesia loans is considered particularly sensitive because the World Bank has acknowledged that much of its aid to the country has been misused or illegally diverted over the years. Critics of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have pointed to those diversions to press their argument that the United States should not be using taxpayer dollars, even indirectly, for such programs.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
You can call an airline a bird of prey, but can you make it stick?

BYLINE: By Michael M. Weinstein 

 BODY:
THE Justice Department's antitrust suit against American Airlines accusing it of predatory behavior is easy to mock.
Predation -- by which a dominant company takes unprofitable actions such as cutting prices below costs to drive competitors out of business, then raises prices to recover earlier losses -- rarely occurs. Historians debate whether predation has occurred more than a handful of times the last 100 years. And even when it does occur, it can be nearly impossible to prove. 
 Yet, says Prof. Robert Willig of Princeton University, it would be premature to dismiss the potential importance of the Government suit. Though a consultant on predation issues to airlines in recent years, Mr. Willig nonetheless calls the complaint "courageous and sophisticated."
 "It makes smarter economic arguments than plaintiffs have made in the past, bringing the Government's philosophy of predation closer in line with the sound economics," he said. Mr. Willig remains agnostic about the merits of the case because "beyond coherent arguments, there must also be hard evidence; we haven't seen any, yet."
Upstart carriers are vulnerable to predatory behavior because an incumbent airline can flood markets with low-cost service merely by switching planes from one route to another. That is what the Government contends American, a unit of the AMR corporation, did to Vanguard Airlines, Sun Jet and Western Pacific flying to Wichita, Kan.; Kansas City, Mo.; Long Beach, Calif., and Colorado Springs from Dallas-Fort Worth.
In these cases, the complaint says, American drastically cut fares and added many flights to routes when the upstart began operations. Later, after the upstart's business shriveled or disappeared, American reversed course, cutting service and raising prices. The Government says it will prove predatory intent by showing that the extra revenue generated by American's extra flights failed to cover the extra costs. American denies the contention.
Mr. Willig points to a novel part of the Government's case. It will argue that American incurs a cost, beyond operating expenses, of using airplanes it already owns to add flights to Wichita and the other cities. Those planes could have been used somewhere else, so the revenue lost by not flying other routes should be treated as a cost of expanding service to Wichita. The courts have not yet embraced this way of calculating costs even though it conforms to standard economic analysis.
However enlightened some of its arguments, the Government's case is also riddled with problems.
Start with its focus on American's yo-yo price-setting and scheduling in the face of entry and exit by upstarts. That could reflect predation. But it could also reflect simple competition. Incumbent airlines are allowed to cut fares to match competitors' prices and sell extra seats as consumers respond to the price cuts.
The Government's contention that American sacrificed profits by cutting its fares and expanding services to Wichita and the other cities will be hard to prove. Attributing specific costs to specific routes is arbitrary where some costs go to general overhead. Economists generally argue that the Government must prove a "but for" argument -- proving that American's price cutting and flight increases would make no financial sense but for their role in driving rivals out of business.
In other words, the Government must prove that the low fares and extra flights would be financially ruinous if continued indefinitely. To make the argument stick, the Government will have to prove that American could reasonably expect to recover its losses by raising fares after Vanguard or Sun Jet exits the market -- confident that its higher fares would not attract new upstarts.
Dennis W. Carlton, an economist at the University of Chicago, points to other problems with the Government's case. He helped prepare a report by Lexecon, a consulting firm in Chicago, on behalf of United Airlines that calls into question the Government's contention that predation is a big problem. The data show, he says, "that upstarts are about as successful in establishing new routes as are the major carriers."
Mr. Carlton pokes a more profound hole in the Government's case. On many lightly traveled routes, there is room for only one carrier. When an upstart takes on an incumbent, they are likely to engage in a price war until only one survives. In this situation, Mr. Carlton asks, "Does it make sense for the Government to tie the hands of one of the competitors -- and not necessarily those of the low-cost competitor?"
But even if Mr. Carlton is generally correct, it does not mean that American did not engage in predation at Dallas-Fort Worth. To make that judgment requires examining the Government's data, which it has not released. Based on the past, the odds are not stacked in the Justice Department's favor. But at least it has issued a complaint that gives American fair warning that the level of sophistication that it will bring to the courtroom will far exceed anything seen in the past.

HEADLINE: Ernst Seeks Large Subsidy To Move to Times Sq. Tower

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Ernst & Young, one of the country's largest accounting and consulting firms, has asked state and city officials for a $65 million subsidy to move to an expensive new office tower in Times Square, according to public officials and real estate executives.
If a deal is struck, the company would move to a proposed 40-story building at the southwest corner of 42d Street and Seventh Avenue, where the state has already granted the developer $236.4 million in property tax breaks over 20 years. The site, which is controlled by the developer, Boston Properties, is now occupied by a Walt Disney Company retail store and sits next to the New Amsterdam Theater. 
 In what has become a well-worn ritual for the city's major corporations, Ernst & Young has threatened to move some of its 4,000 employees in New York City to Jersey City if it does not get the subsidy, although real estate executives on both sides of the river doubt that the company has any such intention.
Some economists, urban planners and politicians said that the potential $301.4 million subsidy deal to develop the property for Ernst & Young would unnecessarily subsidize a profitable company and bail out a developer who may have overpaid for the land. With rents rising in Manhattan and space tight, they said the tax breaks would insure that private developers with nonsubsidized projects could not compete, because they would need higher rents.
"This number sounds excessive," said Mark Green, the city's Public Advocate. "Instead of competing in the zero-sum game of selective tax giveaways, government should invest public dollars in our poorly maintained subways, schools and housing. The risk is that government has become an A.T.M. machine for any major company that can call City Hall."
Last year, Ernst & Young hired Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate broker, to scour the city for a new location. According to real estate executives, the firm is now negotiating a lease with Boston Properties for the Times Square site.
Under the terms of the deal, the accounting firm would occupy all of the proposed 1.1 million-square-foot tower, except for retail space in the basement and ground floor. At the same time, Disney, whose retail store has the highest sales of any operation outside its theme parks, is debating whether it wants to rent space in the proposed new tower.
Boston Properties declined to discuss the deal. Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, did not return calls requesting comment.
"It is our policy not to confirm or deny potential transactions," said Robert E. Selsam, senior vice president of Boston Properties.
The location is one of four office development sites within the state's 42d Street redevelopment project, which seeded each parcel with an extraordinary level of tax breaks. Douglas Durst, the developer, is completing a 48-story tower across the street that will house Conde Nast Publications and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Another developer, William Rudin, and Reuters have begun work on a tower at the northwest corner of 42d Street and Seventh Avenue. Boston Properties has a contract to buy control of the other two sites.
"We continue to look at a number of alternatives, both in and out of Manhattan," said Leslie C. Zuke, a spokesman for Ernst & Young. "No decision has been made at the present time."
The company's current base is at the Equitable Tower, at 787 Seventh Avenue at 52d Street, where its lease expires in 2002. It also has employees in four other buildings in Manhattan.
The firm, which expects to add up to 2,500 jobs in the coming years, has acknowledged that it would benefit financially from consolidation to a single location in Manhattan, according to city and state officials. But, they say, the company also argued that it would get tens of millions of dollars in state and local tax breaks from New Jersey if it moved part of its work force into a new tower at Newport Center in Jersey City. One official noted that Ernst & Young already has 1,200 employees at offices in Lyndhurst, N.J. "We're negotiating," a senior City Hall official said. "It's all preliminary."
But a New Jersey developer who has talked with Ernst & Young representatives in recent weeks expressed skepticism about the company's intentions. "The word is they're focusing on their New York options," the developer said.
Despite giving billions of dollars in tax breaks to communications and financial companies, the city has long had a policy against granting incentives to accountants and law firms, which they say, must be near their clients.
The Giuliani administration, however, has not been shy about giving more than one helping of tax breaks in Times Square to some of the city's most prestigious companies. In 1996, city and state officials gave Conde Nast a $10.7 million incentive package to move to 4 Times Square, a project that already had property tax breaks worth about $6 million a year. A year later, they gave Reuters up to $26 million in subsidies for a headquarters at 3 Times Square, which already had tax breaks valued at at least $36.9 million over 20 years.
Boston Properties signed a deal with Prudential more than a year ago to buy control of the last two office sites in Times Square for $330 million. Unable to find a tenant willing to pay its asking rent, Boston Properties later negotiated a discount on the deal, agreeing to pay $312.3 million and give Prudential a stake in the project. With large blocks of office space increasingly rare in midtown, Boston Properties eventually opened talks with Ernst & Young.

HEADLINE: WASHINGTON AT WORK;
Insider Bemoans What He Wished For

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
As Republican national chairman, Haley Barbour designed his party's campaign to cut the growth of Medicare. Now he has taken on a new assignment. As a lobbyist for a dozen large nursing home companies, he pleads with Congress for relief from the law he helped write.
In 1995-96, Mr. Barbour told anyone who would listen that the explosive growth of Medicare threatened to bankrupt the program. He worked hand in glove with Speaker Newt Gingrich on legislation to rein in Medicare spending. Now he complains that Medicare is spending too little. 
 "Underspending by Medicare for skilled nursing homes is having serious effects in the real world," Mr. Barbour said in an interview today. "Close to 20,000 caregivers have been laid off. There's concern that nursing homes will close. It's resulting in harm to senior citizens."
People outside Washington might see some inconsistency between Mr. Barbour's earlier support for Medicare cutbacks and his work as a lobbyist now. But his advocacy raises few eyebrows in the capital, where dozens of people pass through the revolving door between government and industry every year, where politicians do battle by day but share cozy dinners in the evening, where legislators can switch their votes overnight because of public opinion.
More than any other recent chairman of the Republican National Committee, however, Mr. Barbour shaped the party's agenda, and influenced legislation, through frequent meetings with Republican leaders on Capitol Hill.
Mr. Barbour, whose four-year term as chairman ended in January 1997, said today that he was retained by his nursing home clients last month and had since discussed their problems with about 15 members of Congress, mostly Republican senators.
He said the Clinton Administration could take steps of its own to relieve the burden on nursing homes, without waiting for Congress to act. But he has not talked to Administration officials. As a rock-ribbed Republican, he said, "I'm probably not the best person for that assignment." (Vic Fazio, a California Democrat who served in the House for 20 years, said he was lobbying the Administration on behalf of the same group of nursing homes.)
Mr. Barbour has not yet filed the required forms with Congress to disclose the amount spent lobbying for nursing homes on Capitol Hill. Asked how much he was being paid, he said, "Not enough," and laughed.
He confirmed that his clients included the Sun Healthcare Group of Albuquerque, N.M.; Vencor Inc. of Louisville, Ky.; the Mariner Post-Acute Network Inc. of Atlanta; Beverly Enterprises of Fort Smith, Ark.; HCR Manor Care Inc. of Toledo, Ohio; Genesis Health Ventures of Kennett Square, Pa., and Extendicare Inc. of Markham, Ontario.
Mr. Barbour said he saw no contradiction between his old and new roles. The Medicare cuts, he said, have been much deeper than either he or Congress expected under the entirely new method of reimbursement established by the 1997 law. In the first half of the current fiscal year, he noted, Medicare actually spent less than in the first half of the prior year. In the last week, three of Mr. Barbour's clients have reported quarterly losses, due in large part, they say, to the Medicare cuts.
"What's ironic," Mr. Barbour said, "is that this Administration is spending so much less on Medicare than Congress intended when it passed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. It's the same Administration that in 1995 and 1996 constantly clobbered Republicans" for proposing Medicare cuts that would have been less severe than those that have actually been realized.
The nursing home industry has long been a potent force in Washington and many state capitals. Alan D. Solomont, former finance chairman of the Democratic National Committee, was chief executive of the largest nursing home company in Massachusetts and just last month was host at a Democratic fund-raiser attended by President Clinton.
The industry's political action committee made campaign contributions of more than $900,000 in 1997-98, according to data filed with the Federal Election Commission and tabulated by Public Disclosure Inc., a nonpartisan research group.
Mr. Barbour, a seventh-generation Mississippian, has been in and around Washington since 1985, when he became director of the White House office of political affairs under President Ronald Reagan.
He blends his political insights with an exceptionally detailed knowledge of health care policy. Like a true policy expert, he refers to sicker people as "high acuity patients," meaning that they have acute illnesses. And he speaks knowledgeably of RUG's, the "resource utilization groups" into which patients are classified according to their medical condition and need for care.
Mr. Barbour suggests two specific ways to relieve the financial distress of nursing homes: Medicare, he says, should provide a more generous allowance for inflation, based on the market basket of goods and services used by nursing homes. In addition, he says, it should increase its payments for sicker patients.
Mr. Barbour estimated that his clients were receiving an average of $270 to $285 a day for each Medicare patient. By contrast, he said, when the budget law was signed in 1997, nursing homes had been getting $360 a day or more for each Medicare patient, and expected to get $310 to $320 a day in 1999.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, met recently with Mr. Barbour and has requested more financial data. Before rushing to bail out any companies with taxpayers' money, Mr. Grassley said, he wants to know whether they have been mismanaged, whether they grew "too large too fast" and whether they took on more debt than they could handle.
In any event, he said, they must not solve their problems by evicting patients or reducing the quality of care.

HEADLINE: Sticking to Issues Pays Off for Philadelphia Mayoral Primary Winner

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, May 19

 BODY:
In winning the Democratic primary on Tuesday to succeed Edward G. Rendell as Mayor of Philadelphia, John F. Street held tightly to his issue-oriented message in the face of personal attacks that nearly defeated him.
While other candidates in the crowded field used attack advertising in their campaigns, Mr. Street tried to ignore the barrage and emerged with a slim victory over his most aggressive opponent in the race, Marty Weinberg. 
 Mr. Street, 55, who resigned as City Council president to run for mayor, captured 100,902 votes, 35.4 percent of the total, to 89,041 votes, or 31.2 percent, for Mr. Weinberg, an aide to former Mayor Frank L. Rizzo who was making his first run for elective office.
John White Jr., a former head of the city housing agency and the state welfare department, finished third with 61,816 votes for 21.7 percent. Happy Fernandez, a former City Council member and the first woman to run a credible race for mayor of Philadelphia, won 17,952 votes, 6.3 percent. Dwight Evans, a state legislator, had 13,290, 4.6 percent, and Queena R. Bass, a community organizer, had less than 1 percent.
Fewer then 30 percent of the city's 980,000 registered voters turned out, about the average level of participation for a primary in Philadelphia, a city of 1.47 million people, about 40 percent black.
"I am enormously pleased about the way I conducted my campaign," Mr. Street said today at a victory lunch with Mr. Rendell and other city leaders. "But as the winning candidate, I now have to do what I can to bring the party together, not just for me but for the city of Philadelphia."
Much of Mr. Street's success on Tuesday flowed from his smooth working relationship with Mr. Rendell, a popular Democrat who is barred from seeking a third consecutive four-year term. Over the years, they worked together closely, pulling the city back from a fiscal abyss in the early 1990's with programs of economic austerity that led to budget surpluses and urban renewal throughout many parts of the city.
It came as no surprise that Mr. Rendell gave Mr. Street, one of four black candidates in the primary, a hearty endorsement. But in the November general election, Mr. Street will face a Republican opponent who also played a major role in the city's turnaround, Sam Katz, who ran unopposed on Tuesday. As an expert in municipal finance, Mr. Katz, 49, was one of the first consultants Mr. Rendell sought out to stabilize the city's finances.
Mr. Katz ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 1991 and for governor of Pennsylvania in 1994, and in a city where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by almost 4 to 1, it might appear that he has a difficult task ahead.
But aides said his campaign strategy for the general election would be to attract Republicans and the considerable number of Democrats who did not vote for Mr. Street in the primary, including many black voters. It is a calculation that strategists for Mr. Katz helped bring about through the unusual decision to inject him into the Democratic advertising wars. Mr. Katz ran commercials that attacked the two Democrats he least wanted to face in the fall, Mr. Weinberg and Mr. White.
In effect, the aides said, Mr. Katz preferred a showdown with Mr. Street, whose political fervor through years as a black community leader most sharply contrasted with his own. To bolster Mr. Street's chances in the primary, Mr. Katz ran advertisements that questioned Mr. Weinberg's and Mr. White's credibility and management skills.
In addition, Mr. Katz said in an interview, Mr. Street's close relationship with Mr. Rendell provided him an opening to portray Mr. Street as a status quo candidate who is resistant to bolder solutions to the city's most intractable problems. As examples, Mr. Katz said, he favors school vouchers to offer children alternatives to troubled public schools and a faster reduction of the city wage tax as a means to stimulate economic development. Mr. Street opposes vouchers and favors a slower reduction of the wage tax.
Yet to make his case that more drastic measures are necessary, Mr. Katz pointed out that for all the progress in the Rendell-Street years, the city had lost 150,000 residents and 40,000 jobs since 1991.
Mr. Weinberg, meanwhile, focused most of his attacks on Mr. Street, the campaign front-runner who won glowing endorsements from the city's three leading newspapers: The Inquirer, The Daily News and The Tribune, which has a mostly black readership.
Playing largely to the same middle-class and working-class white voters who supported Mayor Rizzo, Mr. Weinberg used television commercials that showed 18-year-old images of Mr. Street shoving a reporter and throwing water in the face of a City Council staff member, Mr. Weinberg's way of suggesting to voters that Mr. Street might be too unstable to lead the city government.
Other Weinberg advertisements cited financial problems Mr. Street once had, including the two times he filed for personal bankruptcy.
For his part, Mr. Street did not respond in his commercials until late in the campaign and then only to admonish Mr. Weinberg for attacking him and injecting an element of race in the campaign.
Rather, Mr. Street focused on issues like seeking more state revenue to improve public schools and expanding economic development as a way to aid some of Philadelphia's neighborhoods, where residents are suffering from substandard housing, joblessness and high crime rates.
"Out of working together, Philadelphia has become a can-do city, and it's important for us to continue that work," said Mr. Street, who would become the city's second black mayor, after W. Wilson Goode, who preceded Mr. Rendell.
"The first step is to make sure we heal the wounds of the primary. I'm sure all the candidates will do their fair share to bring the party and the city back together."

HEADLINE: Some Abandon Water Cooler For Internet Stock Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
In Florida, a young dentist tracks stocks between patients, sometimes even between an X-ray and a filling. In Washington State, a freight-company manager logs on to a financial Web site for four to six hours of his workday. A designer at a California architectural firm gets so absorbed in the market that his productivity falls 25 percent.
The long bull market and cascading advances in technology have combined to drive capitalism's main numbers game into the heart of the American workplace, with millions of wage earners, managers and entrepreneurs obsessing about Wall Street. Their obsession, in fact, far eclipses the speculative 1920's, when elevator operators and bootblacks were a chief source of what passed for information. 
"Two years ago I would have never thought I'd be into doing this," said the dentist, Norma Victores, 30, of Hialeah, Fla., who follows the market on the Internet and has bought part of her portfolio of 21 stocks and mutual funds on line. "I used to think it was just for the big-timers."
While much of the early concern about workday Internet abuse focused on pornography, the lure of the stock market has overtaken it, some specialists said. The Internet is making a lot of information available to small investors that was once accessible only to professionals.
"That's where employees are really wasting their time," said Jonathan Penn, an analyst at Giga Information Group, a firm that advises companies on information technology. "I'd definitely put that first," he added, ahead of sports, personal E-mail, chat rooms and pornography.
The flick-of-the-finger ease with which office workers and others can research, monitor and trade stocks -- often able to return instantly to their assigned tasks -- is a growing concern for employers.
Most of the people willing to discuss the issue were self-employed or worked for small companies where Internet abuses could be dealt with amicably. Larger corporations, while acknowledging the potential for abuse, generally denied that employees were using company time to trade stocks. Some devotees in the workplace said the activity could be addictive, but most simply found it a practical method for earning extra income.
So far, the Government has not been able to measure any economic effect. Michael Harper, the acting associate commissioner for productivity and technology at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, suggested that the time spent by workers on the stock market was not unlike water-cooler discussion of football or movies and might even be a partial substitute for it.
"We don't know whether they would be working or doing something else" if there was less absorption in the market, Mr. Harper said.
But according to Media Metrix Inc., a New York company that meters Internet use much the way Nielsen Media Research does television, 22.8 million Americans used Web sites on company time in March. Some 8.2 million people visited Yahoo Finance, CBS Marketwatch, Schwab, E*Trade and other financial sites at work, up from 6 million just three months earlier, the company said.
About 25 percent of all corporate Internet traffic, much of it surreptitious, is considered unrelated to work.
The stock market "is becoming a huge distraction," said Victor Woodward, a vice president at Content Technologies, which develops programs to help companies create and enforce policies for Internet use. He said corporate demand for help in curbing stock-related Web use had quadrupled in the last year. And companies face growing competition for the attention of their employees: Internet gateways like Yahoo, Go and Excite, eager to attract advertisers, use their home pages to tempt Web browsers to check stock quotes.
On-line trades account for as much as 30 percent of all buying and selling by individual investors, surveys show.
"I can't imagine that this is not a problem in the workplace," said Jill Munden, who oversees Silicon Investor Inc., the biggest financial discussion forum. She said 50 percent of Silicon Investor site visits, which averaged 20 minutes each, came during regular working hours and that "you have to believe most people don't divulge trades and research to their boss or co-workers."
The Web site for Charles Schwab, the broker accounting for more than a quarter of Internet transactions, now averages 33 million visits a day, up from 24 million in the fourth quarter of 1998, according to Daniel Hubbard, a spokesman. And actual transactions, which take only a couple of minutes, are outnumbered 26 to 1 by typically longer sessions for researching companies or mutual funds or to review portfolios.
Schwab's busiest periods, Mr. Hubbard found, coincide with the opening and closing hours of the New York Stock Exchange -- from 9:30 to 11:30 A.M. and 3:30 to 4 P.M., which falls during the workday for most people on the East Coast.
Take the case of Dean Hatfield, 36, the designer, for whom earning between $5,000 and $15,000 a month from on-line trading for much of last year began to threaten his day job.
"Instead of billing, say, 37 hours during the week, as I should have, I was billing perhaps 28," said Mr. Hatfield, who works at KRJ Design in Burlingame, Calif. "It became an issue because the revenue just wasn't coming in." Mr. Hatfield's superiors took away his Internet access, so now if he wants to go on line he must walk to another terminal, his activities easily visible. He likens it to "getting your hands caught in the cookie jar." Now, he says, "I do it on the phone or from home -- but it's not day trading anymore."
At American Fast Freight, a company in Kent, Wash., that bundles shipments into bigger units and then arranges for overseas transport, the official in charge of computers, Jeff LePage, is still struggling to find a way to "put the kibosh" on a manager who is routinely logged onto a financial site for most of the day.
"I hadn't really focused on this until it became chronic," said Mr. LePage, who has noticed a gradual decline in the unit's performance for which he blames the employee, a peer he is reluctant to confront.
Mr. LePage has switched off the employee's financial site, but the employee appears to be logging on to other people's computers. "The battle goes on," Mr. LePage said.
Then there is John Alexandrou, a 43-year-old salesman in Foster City, Calif., who said that for the last three years he has spent 30 minutes to an hour of working time a day on the market. "The adrenaline of trading options, that's got me completely hooked," Mr. Alexandrou said, adding that the fraternity of on-the-job market devotees is very large, especially in Silicon Valley. "You're not going to find very many people in this Valley who are not distracted by the stock market," he said. He insisted, however, that despite his on-the-job trading, he never failed to make his business quotas.
On-the-job Internet stock activity has been a particularly visible problem in the high-technology community on the West Coast, where much of employees' pay is in stock options and it is common for even those of low rank to have an equity stake.
None of this necessarily means that investors pay less attention to their jobs. Ross Brown, vice president of MSI Consulting, a Seattle-based management and marketing adviser to high-technology companies, says he often spends less time tending to his portfolio -- worth in the mid-six figures -- than when he used to phone orders to a broker, a process he said can mean "you've chewed up an hour of your day."
Still, the market is seen as an increasingly serious time eater by many employers, who have only recently begun to monitor Internet activity in earnest. A survey by the Society for Human Resource Management in Alexandria, Va., found 76 percent of members not bothering to monitor activity as recently as 1997.
Moreover, employees seem to have little trouble avoiding detection from casual observation.
"One second I was in E*Trade," said Mr. Hatfield, the California designer, who for a time was making more money trading than in salary. "And the next second I was doing design in Autocad," a tool of his trade.
"I could hide the day trading quite easily," he said.

HEADLINE: Rights Groups Say Logbook Lists Executions by Guatemalan Army

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON and MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: GUATEMALA, May 19

 BODY:
Lucrecia Vasquez wavers from one day to the next about whether her brother is dead or alive.
The last time she saw him was in April 1984, a few months before he was to have finished medical school. The telephone rang, she recalled, and a moment later the brother, Omar Dario Vasquez, was rushing out the door. He yelled something about a medical emergency and said he would be back soon. But Mr. Vasquez, 23, was never seen again. 
 This week, his sister received what may be the first real evidence about his fate. A logbook that human rights officials said was taken from secret Guatemalan military files explains that Mr. Vasquez was "captured on 7th Avenue, in front of the Hotel Dorado Americana" here.
Nine days later, on May 6, the book said, Mr. Vasquez was killed. His death, human rights investigators said, is noted on the document in military code, using the overseas shorthand that transposes months and days, "06-05-84: 300."
The logbook is to be released on Thursday by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, as well as the National Security Archives, an organization that works to declassify Government papers, and Human Rights Watch and the Washington Office on Latin America, human rights groups. Investigators from the agencies, who have been studying the document for two months, said they had concluded that it describes the activities of a secret unit that kidnapped, tortured, and executed Guatemalans in the early 80's in a violent army campaign against leftists suspected of subversion here.
The deaths and disappearances occurred at a time when the country of 11 million people was being ravaged by civil war between a right-wing military government, supported by the United States, and leftist guerrillas. The war, which ended three years ago, was the longest and bloodiest in Central America. About 200,000 people were killed. Human rights advocates in Guatemala and the United States said the logbook of detainees bound in a tattered plastic binder was the most detailed document about military abuses ever obtained from Guatemalan army sources. Human rights investigators who participated in an independent truth commission, formally the Historical Clarification Commission, had unsuccessfully asked the military for such documents in its 16-month investigation.
Government officials who reviewed the book said although it could be a genuine military intelligence document, it was not something that could be found in the official military archives.
Human rights officials disagreed, saying it proved that similar documents had to exist. "It is about the best evidence we have ever gotten about the cold-blooded, deliberate, calculated strategy that the military used to pick people up one by one," said Kate Doyle, a Guatemala expert for the National Security Archives who led an inquiry on the document. "There must be more documents like this. And now we can press harder for the Guatemalan Government to release them."
Ms. Doyle refused to divulge the source of the document. She said only that human rights agencies had bought it for $2,000 from a former "low-ranking" military officer.
Although almost the entire book is typed in dry shorthand, with no signatures nor military seals, the investigators said they were confident it was genuine.
Dozens of those listed had been reported missing in human rights records and press accounts from the period, Ms. Doyle said, and the dates and detention details about many prisoners also match human rights reports from the period.
After having briefly reviewed the document, Government officials said they could not dispute that contention without conducting their own investigation. A spokesman for President Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen suggested that the logbook be turned over to Guatemalan courts that have been established to investigate allegations of abuse against the military.
The spokesman said that the Government had never tried to keep documents about military abuses hidden but that such documents were not part of "official" military archives.
Defense Minister Hector M. Barrios refused to comment on the book, saying he had not had an opportunity to study it. He noted, however, that "apocryphal documents" had circulated in the past.
General Barrios insisted that the military had turned over "all the information possible" to the truth commission. "We cooperated in everything we could," he said. "But somebody always thinks that there is a great vault with documents. Such a thing does not exist."
Former members of the Historical Clarification Commission said the logbook confirmed their suspicions that the military had kept detailed records of people who were detained, tortured and executed outside the law. The panel found that the military was responsible for 93 percent of all documented human rights violations in the war.
"We asked them for reports on specific cases of people who had disappeared or who were killed on the street, and they told us that such documents did not exist," said Otilia Lux de Coti, a former commissioner and a leading spokeswoman for the Indians here. "That was always their argument. But we knew that an institution like the military that takes such pride in its history had to have more than what they were giving to us."
Ms. Lux de Coti scanned the document and said: "We asked them if they had lists of people who disappeared, and they told us, 'No.' This shows that they did not tell us the truth."
Separated into four main parts, the document has surveillance studies on reportedly subversive organizations, lists subversive safe houses that had been raided with the contents of each house and lists organizations described as "facades for the service of subversion," including the Association of University Students, the Democratic Front Against Repression and Amnesty International.
The most chilling section is the chronological log of detainees. Numbered 1 through 183, each entry lists a prisoner's name and reported pseudonyms, date and location of capture, affiliations with suspected subversive groups and any suspicious activities, including travel to Cuba, meetings in their houses and participation in demonstrations.
Glued beside each entry is a wallet-size photograph of the detainee. Some relatives recognized the photos as coming from Government-issued ID cards. At the end of each entry is a line that describes the prisoner's fate. A few dozen of those on the list were released, some on the condition that they serve as informants for the military unit and help turn in their associates.
More than 100 people on the list were executed, the investigators said. Their deaths were described by the code "300" or the phrase, "He was taken away by Pancho."
Although codified and at times ungrammatical, the book is suspenseful reading. Its entries, some a few lines long and others a half-page each, tell of doctors and shoemakers, labor leaders and students, mechanics and economists who were suspected of participating in efforts to overthrow the military government of Brig. Gen. Oscar Mejia Victores, according to the investigators.
They were abducted in shopping areas, restaurants, movie theaters, on the way to work or in their houses. Sometimes they resisted, the document said, they were shot, and "300."
One entry tells about an attempt to capture Edwin Rogelio Rivas Rivas here.
"When they wanted to take " the book said, "he tried to flee on a motorcycle, which made the necessity to shoot, falling gravely wounded. It was tried to revive him on the H.M., but it was impossible. 300. And he was left on the side of the road."
Many of those detained, the book said, were members or supporters of suspected subversive groups like the Guatemalan Workers Party, the Guerrilla Army of the Poor and the Revolutionary Organization of People in Arms.
Rather than criminal charges, the book listed only suspicious activities.
Prisoner No. 1, Teresa Graciela Samayoa Morales, the book said, "traveled to Cuba." No. 17, Orencio Sosa Calderon "is in charge of taking foreign journalists to film different guerrilla fronts," another listing said. And No. 52, Prudencio de Jesus Carrera Camey, 15, an entry said, was a member of the Guatemalan Workers Party "apparatus responsible for painting cars."
For the families of "the disappeared," the dry shorthand provides information denied over 15 or more years. In interviews with relatives of two men and a woman listed as dead, family members said they had ached to know what happened to their children and siblings and, if killed, to be told where to look for the remains.
Only when they are able to mourn and bury their dead, the family members agreed, would prosecutions of those responsible for the killings be a concern.
"First I want to know if he died and where to find him," Ms. Vasquez, 36, a lawyer, said. "Then I want to know who did this? Why?"
She broke down in sobs as she talked in the office of the Group of Mutual Support, an organization of families of the disappeared that has more than 25,000 cases in its files.
"There's no worse thing than uncertainty," she said. "You imagine that he went through the worst. My father thinks he is in another country. He always talks in the present. 'Omar must have kids by now,' he says. My mom is more realistic. She sometimes thinks he was killed."
The relatives confirmed dates of disappearances and other information in the book. Ms. Vasquez confirmed that her brother had belonged to both the Revolutionary Movement of the People and the Revolutionary Organization of People in Arms, a main guerrilla group. The information appeared on the log sheet next to his name, along with "doctor and surgeon."
"He'd tell me: 'Let's fix the world,' Ms. Vasquez recalled. "I'd reply, 'Let's fix it.' "
Shown a page that read "06-05-84: 300" under a photograph of Lesbia Lucrecia Garcia Escobar, her father, Efrain Garcia, 66, made a quick calculation. If she disappeared on April 17, 1984, Mr. Garcia said, that meant that she had been kept alive for 20 days.
"During that time they were torturing her and getting stuff from her," he said without a trace of doubt.
The book said Ms. Garcia Escobar had shared a house with a guerrilla where weapons, grenades and "propaganda" were found. Mr. Garcia, a retired doorman at the Health Ministry, said his daughter, then 29, had been abducted after a man walked into the restaurant where she was dining with a girlfriend and told her that her boyfriend was waiting outside. When she walked out, the girlfriend later told Mr. Garcia, two men pushed her into a waiting car.
A witness gave Mr. Garcia the number of the license plate of a motorcycle that he was told escorted the car, a number that he continues to carry on a scrap of paper. He said he went to the police with it, but was told that the plate did not exist. After that, he recounted, two men began following him, leading him to abandon his search, stay indoors for three months and eventually move.
Ms. Vasquez said she started searching for her brother only after the peace accords of 1996 because family feared that if she pressed for information she would risk danger.
But others, like Jesus "Chusita" Palencia, 70, who is looking for the oldest of her 10 children, have pressed and pushed the whole time. Ms. Palencia said that for 15 years she has sent telegrams to the National Palace, looked at hundreds of bodies in morgues and joined in protests, occupations of public buildings and other demonstrations by human rights groups.
Since the disappearance of the son, Alfonso Alvarado Palencia, a former labor leader shown in the logbook as dead by March 1984, she has also asked the Roman Catholic priest at her parish several times to hold a Mass for her son's return.
"I told the priest to pray for my son's reappearance, but he always says Mass as if my son were dead," Ms. Palencia said.
"It gets worse and worse as the years go by," she said of the Government's silence. "Just a few months ago, I dreamed that someone had knocked on the door, and it was him, dressed in a white shirt. I ran to tell the others, 'Look, children, here is your brother.' And then I woke up.
"If my son is dead, I want at least his little bones."

An Upstart Unveils Rival to the Game Boy

BYLINE: By Michel Marriott 

 BODY:
With millions of Game Boys sold worldwide, Nintendo has practically owned the handheld computer amusement market for a decade. At the recent Electronics Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, SNK, a game maker best known for its presence in video arcades, unveiled its effort to end Game Boy's reign.
Called the Neo Geo Pocket Color, the 16-bit, processor-based game machine is smaller, lighter and faster than Game Boy players, SNK said, and it can display "nearly three times as many colors as Nintendo's Game Boy Color." The Neo Geo system, housed in a sleek horizontal case (Game Boy's case is vertical), is capable of rendering 146 colors simultaneously on its 2.6-inch display screen, compared with Game Boy's slightly smaller display, which can show 52 colors at the same time. The Neo Geo Pocket Color machines also have a thumb-friendly, built-in joystick, rather than the four-point directional game controller that Nintendo uses on its portable and console machines. 
 Neo Geo Pocket Color machines will cost $69.95, $10 less than a Game Boy Color. Beginning on June 1, they will be sold on line through the company's Web site at www.snkusa .com and later in the year in stores. Ten Neo Geo games are available, with 10 more expected later this summer, Ms. Sujishi said. At last count, Game Boy Color can play 450 original titles, including those made for black-and-white Game Boys.
But Jeremy Schwartz, a senior analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., is skeptical of any newcomer's chances of dislodging Game Boy as a favorite among players.
"Game Boy is so entrenched at this point, with so many people making so many well-known game properties for it, these guys are going to have a very hard time getting any widespread consumer acceptance of it," said Mr. Schwartz, an expert on games. He said there was a long trail of other gaming machines crushed by Game Boys. "They're the master," he said.

HEADLINE: China Trade Group Ready for Business

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 19

 BODY:
China may be angry at the United States after the bombing of its embassy in Belgrade, but it is still open for business.
That was the message carried by the first Chinese trade delegation to visit the United States since NATO's accidental bombing earlier this month set off a diplomatic dispute.
A delegation of about 150 business and government leaders from Jiangsu province, one of China's fastest-growing regions, sounded an upbeat note on economic ties despite a no-show by the province's Governor and his deputy.
"The Governor, Lieutenant Governor and myself have been very dismayed at the incident committed by U.S.-led NATO," said Ye Jian, director general of Jiangsu's Economic Relations and Foreign Trade Commission.
"But I deal with the economy and trade, so I must come," Mr. Ye told a news briefing in Los Angeles on the second day of his 12-day visit.
"Our arrival signals that our policy of opening up to the outside world has not changed," Mr. Ye said. "We want to develop friendly cooperation with American entrepreneurs and people, and develop more trade and investment. This has not changed."
The United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, said today that trade talks aimed at getting Beijing into the World Trade Organization would resume soon. "I do think negotiations will resume," Ms. Barshefsky said in an interview with CNBC. "We are in contact with the Chinese and will soon be setting a date for resumption."

HEADLINE: A Guaranteed Job

 BODY:

To the Editor:
While your look at Project New Hope, the Milwaukee experiment with guaranteed jobs for low-income people, offered a reminder that there is no single remedy for inner-city poverty, it understated the effectiveness of New Hope's job guarantee for those otherwise unable to find work (front page, May 15). 
 Among those not already working full time, New Hope cut the rate of persistent joblessness to 12 percent from 22 percent during participants' first year in the program. The proportion who were not employed over the course of their first two years fell by more than half: to just 6 percent from 13 percent. If we achieved similar success nationally, finding or creating jobs for roughly half of the 1.2 million adults who are unemployed for an entire year because they cannot find work, I don't think we would consider this progress to be modest.

Living-Wage Ordinances

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Ralph Nader's criticisms of the increase in corporate tax subsidies and his ideas to use Federal and local legislation to stem their expansion are exactly on target, but may be a long time coming (Op-Ed, May 15). In the meantime, local activists have been applying a useful tool to counteract the increase in corporate welfare: living-wage ordinances. 
 In 35 cities, including Boston, Detroit, Los Angeles and Minneapolis-St. Paul, companies that receive tax abatements from the city must pay their workers at least a living wage. These wage levels are set by local ordinance, and are usually in the neighborhood of $7 to $10 an hour. That's not the most glamorous neighborhood, but it's enough to lift full-time working families above the poverty line.

HEADLINE: A World Of Choices To Plug In To the Net

BYLINE: By TINA KELLEY 

 BODY:
CONSIDER the Internet service provider. Depending on your on-line habits, it can be the home of your familial interactions, the envelope for your business memorandums, the conduit of your deepest desires. It can get about as much intimate use as the lenses of your glasses or the pages of a journal. It is the choice of a way to view Web pages and to send E-mail, and as such it should not be approached without proper introspection and circumspection.
Or should it? For many Internet users, new and seasoned, that choice depends on what start-up disk appears in a mailbox or cereal box on any given day, which provider an employer chooses or which program for an Internet service provider, commonly called an I.S.P., shows up on a new desktop computer. 
 "Based on the correspondence we've received, and its emotional content, choosing an I.S.P. seems to rank somewhere between selecting a long-distance phone service and choosing a caterer for a bar mitzvah," Dr. Dawn McGatney, a Maryland pediatrician and Webmaster, said via E-mail. Dr. McGatney runs a site called Compleat Guide to an I.S.P. You'll Enjoy Using (dogwolf.seagull .net/isp.html). "But we hear from many folks who are now on their fifth or higher I.S.P.," she added. "Once you switch one to two times, it's obviously easier. There is a bit of fear of the unknown here."
Millions of people have decided they would rather switch providers than fight suboptimal service. As of January, 36.7 percent of home Internet users had changed their I.S.P.'s at some point and lived to tell about it, according to the Strategis Group, a Washington-based research company that studies patterns in telecommunications use. It's not an easy decision, but taking that step can be liberating, people who love their new Internet services say.
The scope of the choice is formidable, with 4,500 Internet services available across the country. According to Forrester Research, America Online has 39.4 percent of all home accounts (with Compuserve, which AOL owns, the total is 41.9 percent); AOL's 17 million subscribers worldwide are a group larger than the combined daily circulation of the top 20 daily newspapers. Other large services, like AT&T, Earthlink, MSN and Prodigy, collectively share 15.3 percent of the market, while small I.S.P.'s -- those with less than 2 percent of the market, like Sprint, Erols and the local Bell telephone companies -- serve 41.3 percent.
Internet services compete fiercely for new Internet users and for people who have been on line for years.
AOL is the 800-pound gorilla in the middle of the information superhighway and the new user's magnet. Its simple-to-install software and ubiquitous distribution are the keys to its success. Andrew Shepherd, a Forrester Research analyst, said that as of January, AOL had captured 54 percent of all users who had been on line for less than six months and half of all users who had been on line for less than a year. It has also garnered its share of criticism, as have other large and small I.S.P.'s, for slow service, busy signals, the prevalence of spam and concerns about members' privacy. But Kathy McKiernan, an AOL spokeswoman, said that the company was experiencing its fastest growth and lowest turnover rate ever.
Another service provider, Earthlink Network, based in Pasadena, Calif., is competing for customers by, among other things, marketing its Get Out of AOL Free plan and offering promotions like a free month of service or free setup. Earthlink can transfer Favorite Places Web sites from AOL to a new browser and will send E-mail to everyone in a new customer's electronic address book to notify them of the change of address.
Taking cues from AOL, Earthlink has created easy-to-use software that features a friendly on-screen guide, named Lisa. "She'll say: 'Hi, welcome to Earthlink. I'll walk you through step by step. Click here,' but you can also shut her up," said a company spokeswoman, Kirsten Kappos.
Other Internet providers, particularly smaller ones, win new subscribers in more personal ways. Paul Budlong of Seattle, for example, chose his small I.S.P., based in Seattle, after receiving E-mail from someone who used it.
"I liked the name," he said of Drizzle.com, and found it appropriate to local weather conditions. He switched from a provider in Portland, Ore., to Drizzle, which serves the Puget Sound region. He was frustrated by his old service's busy signals (it could take up to 20 attempts to get through) and "complete technomorons at tech support who were incapable of speaking plain English." He found the smaller local provider to be more helpful.
"They E-mail back, they call back, they explain things in simple terms, they're friendly, on the ball and very patient," said Mr. Budlong, who has an old 386 computer with software that could best be described as quaint. The support staff even downloaded a huge program for him that would have taken him hours to do on line. "I went downtown, knocked on the door, and they didn't even charge me for the disks," he said. "It was very cool."
But the smaller I.S.P.'s are particularly vulnerable to mergers and acquisitions, so they are less likely to remain stable.
People who find an I.S.P. they like might hesitate to rave about it because that might encourage others to join, leading to busy signals all over again.
"I had a friend who wouldn't tell anybody when he'd find an I.S.P. he liked," said David Cassel, editor of the AOL Watch newsletter, which is distributed to an E-mail list of 42,000 readers. "You really want a small service no one has ever heard about."
The search for the perfect fit can be traumatic. While any other company that hung up on customers several times a day could expect a quick pink slip, an I.S.P. is harder to dump. Switching providers could mean forfeiting prepaid Internet service, spending hours rejiggering modem strings and software interfaces, losing old E-mail messages and printing new business cards and resumes with the new E-mail address.
"The No. 1 reason that folks stick with an I.S.P. that they hate -- and they can get truly emotional on the subject -- is that they've prepaid a year or two in advance and stand to lose hundreds of dollars by leaving," Dr. McGatney said. "The trick here is always to read the I.S.P.'s terms of service before subscribing. Be sure that the I.S.P. offers a prorated refund for those who cancel early. The No. 2 reason would be the pain of notifying all your friends that you have a new E-mail address, though many I.S.P.'s will forward your E-mail forever at no charge." Mail sent to a closed AOL account, she said, bounces back with a note that the mail could not be delivered.
Jason Catlett, president of the Junkbusters Corporation, an on-line privacy advocacy group in Green Brook, N.J., said switching often required reconfiguring the user's computer. "That's probably a traumatic experience for many people," he said.
Chris Sherman, a Web search guide at the Mining Company site, said some Internet patterns were hard to break. His parents started out with AOL and resisted a move to Mindspring, he said. "Even though Mindspring is so easy, they were comfortable with AOL," he said. "It's an inertia issue more than a branding issue."
When choosing a provider, a computer user should decide whether one goal is to get broad-bandwidth Internet access, which allows Internet connections at speeds faster than the current standard consumer maximum, 56 kilobits per second on a conventional telephone line. These faster access routes to the Internet have many advantages: they can be open as long as the computer is on, there is no waiting for dial tones, and there is little waiting for Web sites to load.
Internet service through a cable TV provider, which is available in some places, can typically download one megabyte of data in less than 8 seconds, compared with digital subscriber lines, or D.S.L. lines, at 15 seconds or a fast telephone modem, operating at 56K, at two and a half minutes. (Actual speeds can vary.)
Cable Internet service connects a house through cable television wires, with, in most cases, the cable company acting as the Internet provider. D.S.L. connects a computer to the Net through existing phone lines but the computer must be within limited a distance -- a few miles -- of a phone company switching center.
"You can pretty much count on the fact that the larger I.S.P.'s are in heavy-duty competition to roll out high-speed access," Mr. Sherman said. "The question is just when."
Cable companies can now reach only about 23 million households. Their Internet service costs about $40 per month, said David Eiswert at the Strategis Group. D.S.L. lines are available to about six million households for about $50 a month, compared with a cost of about $20 a month for traditional dial-up services.
"That's in some ways going to be one of the things that allows dial-up I.S.P.'s to really fight off cable in the short term," said Mr. Shepherd, of Forrester Research. "They're providing service at half the cost."
Some people decide not to pay for any I.S.P. and rely on free Web services instead.
"People can take half-steps -- get a Geocities Web page and Juno E-mail account and access the Web through a machine at work or the local public library if they don't want dial-up service," said Mr. Cassel, of AOL Watch. Juno, Hotmail and Alta Vista mail are examples of free E-mail services that a user can log onto from a computer at a public library or Internet cafe. Free Web pages are available at sites like Geocities and Tripod.
Many Web surfers, however, want Web access from home. Some choose their I.S.P.'s based on particular needs -- a frequent traveler might want to have access to the Internet service while overseas, for example, or a biology buff might need a large space on the Web to post a special page on the naked mole rat. Other customers choose a service like AOL because it provides something like a roped-off section of the larger Internet for children.
There can be advantages in switching providers. "Changing your E-mail address periodically and auto-notifying the sender to the old address with a message is a great way to get off of every spam list in the world," Dr. McGatney said. "Each time we've moved, our junk mail dropped to zero for the next several months."
 
Choices and Defaults
 
Don Ho
Entertainer (through his Internet director, Christopher Soares).
"We picked a local service provider based on price, service, tech support, dial-ups and personalized service, not necessarily in that order, mind you. We were with a local company. One of the partners, whom we started with, split and formed his own I.S.P. called Maikai.net (www.maikai.net). So now we're with them. Because I know the service will remain excellent! We've found that the larger I.S.P.'s are of little or no help when they're done setting you up with a D.N.S."
 
Linus Torvalds
Creator of the Linux operating system.
"I've never had to choose; I've always gotten a free Internet connection through my work (or my studies back when I was at the university)."
 
Jason Catlett
President of Junkbusters, an on-line privacy advocacy group.
"At the time I started using ISDN, Eclipse Internet was the only I.S.P. with ISDN-capable modems in my local calling area. Now many others do, but I haven't bothered to shop around. Also, I like the fact that they're comparatively small because of the rumors that some of the big national I.S.P.'s are considering deals where they sell details of their customers' surfing activities to advertisers."
 
Isabel Wang
Co-founder of I.S.P.-Check, which helps users find Internet service providers and Web page hosts.
"I was with Bell Atlantic for a long time. They claim they support 56K, but I was always connecting at 28, and there were busy signals on weekends and evenings. I'd get kicked off every five minutes. I switched to Starpower, which is good. It was really easy. Most I.S.P.'s can set you up the same day or the same minute when they have you on the phone."
 
Pattiann Rogers
Poet, whose ninth book, "The Dream of the Marsh Wren, Writing as Reciprocal Creation," will be out in June.
"There was an article in a computer magazine that gave Mindspring a very high rating. I couldn't always make connections reliably on Compuserve so I switched to Mindspring because of its rating and because I wanted service for a Web site. I've been with Mindspring several years now and am satisfied."
 
Talking Points
Questions to Ask Before Buying Internet Service
 
Whether you are finding your very first Internet service provider or looking for the perfect one after seven false starts, choosing an I.S.P. is challenging. Here are some questions to ask when shopping around:
 
HOW COMMITTED DO I HAVE TO BE? -- Extra points go to providers offering trial memberships. Beware of those that tie you down to years of service if you want a good rate. Find out if you can get money back if you switch later.
 
CAN I GET CONNECTED? -- Try dialing the phone numbers of a prospective I.S.P. during peak times and make sure you hear a modem screech (good) instead of a busy signal (very bad). Ask about the service's user-to-modem ratio, and find out if there are any guarantees about how easy it will be to connect to the Web.
 
WILL MY I.S.P. KEEP UP WITH TECHNOLOGY? -- Find out if your prospective provider plans to offer broad-band technology like D.S.L. for speedier access to the Internet. If you are particularly fond of playing games, shopping or trading stock on line, make sure that the service has sufficient bandwidth to accommodate those activities easily. Talk to customer service or sales representatives to see if the provider has partners for D.S.L. service in your area or plans such partnerships. Or find out whether you could continue with the provider if you got a cable Internet connection; some I.S.P.'s offer discounts for people gaining access to the Net through cable modems.
 
IS THE PRICE RIGHT? -- If you don't choose unlimited access, make sure you can afford the often-steep hourly rates if you exceed your monthly minimum. You should find out if the provider has hefty setup fees.
 
IS THERE FREE, 24-HOUR TECH SUPPORT? -- You will most likely need it. To check out customer satisfaction with a provider, talk to other people who use it. If you can't find someone off line, try searching newsgroups on line for comments from the Web world at large.
 
IS ACCESS AVAILABLE ON THE ROAD? -- If you need access while traveling, your provider should have a wide range of local numbers in the areas you tend to visit or offer 800 numbers. If you decide on cable or D.S.L. service, make sure that you can connect in other cities through your provider when you are limited to a phone line on the road. With Web TV, you need a box unit to get on line from the road.
 
WILL I HAVE PRIVACY ON THIS I.S.P.? -- You should ask if the I.S.P. will sell your name to marketers or bombard you with spam. It is also wise to find out if you can post what you want on your Web page, including commercial material, if applicable.
They say that breaking up is hard to do, but there are ways to soften the separation anxiety when changing I.S.P.'s. "Don't get wedded to your I.S.P.," said Jason Catlett, president of the Junkbusters Corporation, an advocate of on-line privacy. "They should be a commodity service, and you should be able to switch easily if they raise prices or start invading your privacy." Mr. Catlett noted that E-mail tended to tie people to their I.S.P.'s. He suggested breaking that link by using an E-mail forwarding service (like Pobox.com, Ziplink or a college alumni group that offers lifetime E-mail addresses). That way you can keep one E-mail address, regardless of how many times you change providers. TINA KELLEY

 CORRECTION:
A table in Circuits on Thursday comparing Internet service providers referred incorrectly to one service, Erol's. The RCN Corporation acquired Erol's last year and now serves Boston, Philadelphia, New Jersey, Delaware, Rhode Island, Virginia, Maryland, New Hampshire, New York and Connecticut as RCN.com; the service does not operate under the name Erol's in those areas. The Erol's service covers only the Washington and Baltimore metropolitan areas. The number for service outside Baltimore and Washington is (800) 746-4726.

Chart: "Top On-Ramps to the Web: Comparing the Features"
Here are the Internet service providers with the highest number of United States households, according to Forrester Research, as of the first quarter of this year. (All information below is for the United States unless noted otherwise.) In the I.S.P. business, change is the status quo because of mergers and innovations -- remember what your Web access was like five years ago. Promotional deals abound, so consumers should ask if there are any introductory offers. Also, some people will want to ask whether an Internet service provider can now deliver or accommodate Internet access faster than the current standard consumer maximum of 56 kilobits per second on a conventional phone line, or plans to do so soon (and is likely to deliver on that promise).

HEADLINE: Acting Is in Their Blood, Blood Is in Their Eyes

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER

 BODY:
Quentin Tarantino has already blasted himself a niche in cinema history, but his full impact on the gross national product may not be measurable until the last of his filmmaking disciples has exorcised the demon that impels them to imitate ''Pulp Fiction.''
 The latest of these bloody black comedies is ''Frogs for Snakes,'' written and directed by Amos Poe. It tells the story of a group of lower Manhattan lowlifes circulating in the malign milieu of a corpulent loan shark who also happens to be a bit of a theatrical impresario. And all of his associates, lovers, ex-lovers, children and their friends yearn seriously to act. 
 So here's the joke that is repeated throughout the film: for all of these people, killing or maiming is simply business. What really stirs their blood is the thought that someone else in this circle might get a part they covet or have the gall to choose a monologue in an audition or acting class that they regard as theirs. These are people who would literally kill for a role.
 Mr. Poe has assembled a fine cast, led by Barbara Hershey as Eva, and including people like John Leguizamo, Robbie Coltrane, Justin Theroux, Ron Perlman, Harry Hamlin, Debi Mazar and Lisa Marie. But in the end, after the oral sex monologue and the bouncing shotgunned head and the gallons of blood and the diner that have their ''Pulp Fiction'' counterparts, ''Frogs for Snakes'' remains derivative.
 Although surely not for delicate sensibilities, the film nonetheless maintains a consistent sense of macabre humor and delivers vivid performances. Ms. Hershey as the ex-wife of Al (Mr. Coltrane), the mother of their little boy, a sometime hit woman and occasional waitress, is the best actor of the lot but eager to escape to a better life. ''I don't kill people,'' she says to one of her targets. ''I maim them.''
 Her determination is intensified after her lover, Zip (Mr. Leguizamo), is gunned down by Al's wheel man, U. B. (David Deblinger), whose zeal is heightened by his desire for a role in Al's next production, David Mamet's ''American Buffalo.''
 ''Frogs for Snakes'' begins intriguingly, but thereafter it is mostly recycled ''Pulp.''
 ''Frogs for Snakes'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It contains bloody violence, coarse language and simulated sex.

FROGS FOR SNAKES
Written and directed by Amos Poe; director of photography, Enrique Chediak; edited by Jeff Kushner; music by Lazy Boy; production designer, Michael Shaw; produced by Phyllis Freed Kaufman; released by The Shooting Gallery. Running time: 92 minutes. This film is rated R.

WITH: Barbara Hershey (Eva), Robbie Coltrane (Al), Harry Hamlin (Klench), Ian Hart (Quint), John Leguizamo (Zip), Lisa Marie (Myrna), Debi Mazar (Simone), Ron Perlman (Gascone), Justin Theroux (Flav), David Deblinger (U. B.) and Clarence Williams 3d (Huck).

HEADLINE: ON THE ROAD;
Cosmopolitan Makeover for a Tidewater Backwater

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: NORFOLK, Va.

 BODY:
Hampton Roads, the natural harbor where the James River and several lesser streams meet Chesapeake Bay, has had a balcony seat for history.
It was into these waters that Capt. John Smith and his companions sailed in 1607 after their first landfall at Cape Henry, on their way to establish Jamestown. It was near here that the French admiral Francois de Grasse turned back a British relief fleet in 1781, sealing the fate of Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown. 
 Here Commodore Perry set sail for his voyage to Japan in 1853, here the Monitor fought the Merrimac, heralding the age of the ironclad that revolutionized naval warfare, here the American invasion force set out for North Africa during World War II. Here American warships have been built and the powerful Atlantic Fleet has long been based.
But until recently, much of Tidewater, as the locals call the region, was a backwater. The writer William Styron grew up in Tidewater, and in his early novel "Lie Down in Darkness" (1951), he wrote feelingly of "the low, sorrowful beauty of tideland streams winding through marshes full of small, darting, frightened noises and glistening and dead silent at noon, except for a whistle, far off, and a distant rumble on the rails."
You still find such places. One is the little county seat of Surry, across the river from Jamestown, where a Confederate memorial bears the bittersweet inscription, "Our Heroes." Life there is lived legato.
They are no longer typical, though. Hampton Roads -- composed, for our purposes, of the cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth, Virginia Beach, Hampton and Newport News, plus the towns of Jamestown, Yorktown and Williamsburg -- has long since overtaken Richmond as a metropolitan area. Its population now exceeds 1.5 million, roughly a quarter of the state's total, and Virginia Beach, of all unlikely places, is the Old Dominion's largest city, with 393,000 people.
On a long weekend here recently, my wife, Betsey, and I were flabbergasted by the transformation. As a schoolgirl 40 years ago, she used to take the train to Buckroe Beach in Hampton on swimming outings, and as a draftee 40 years ago I was based at sleepy Fort Monroe, nearby, writing speeches for Gen. Bruce C. Clarke, one of the lions of the Battle of the Bulge, and sometimes for Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor, a D-Day hero.
What happened? I asked my brother-in-law St. George Pinckney, a Richmond man through and through. Simple, he said: "The foreigners and the come-heres" did it.
"In the last 25 years, Europeans at the NATO headquarters in Norfolk, people at the military bases, civilians from all over the country whose companies moved them into the area, all helped break through the crust of insularity," he said. "In Richmond, that never happened."
The benign climate helped. This may not exactly be the Sun Belt, but snow is about as common in these parts as Russian submarines.
 
The Fleet's Really In
The military remains the economic prime mover, despite a lot of recent diversification. People here work in a Ford assembly plant and a Budweiser brewery, for the mail-order queen Lillian Vernon and Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network.
But one in every four workers in Hampton Roads -- like Los Angeles County, it is politically subdivided but economically united -- takes home a paycheck from Uncle Sam, and total defense spending here in 1997 totaled $6.92 billion. In terms of active-duty personnel, seven of the nation's 60 largest military installations are located in Hampton Roads.
The Army has Fort Eustis, its transportation center, and Fort Monroe, the only moated installation still in active use, where Jefferson Davis was imprisoned after the Civil War. The Air Force has Langley Air Force Base, the oldest active air base in the country. Near that is NASA's big Langley Research Center, established in 1917, where the astronauts learned the Right Stuff for the pioneering Mercury and Apollo space shots.
Norfolk, of course, is a Navy town par excellence. All along its western flank rise the fearsome gray superstructures of aircraft carriers, cruisers and other vessels -- fighting machines catching their breath between missions. The Norfolk Naval Base is the largest in the world, home to more than 100 major ships and 27 squadrons of aircraft. More than 75,000 people work there. More than 25,000 other people work at the Little Creek amphibious base and the Oceana Naval Air Station, both in Virginia Beach.
But Norfolk is no longer the brawling liberty town of World War II. It was once as disorderly and disreputable a place as you could find on the East Coast, and Main Street, a young man we met there told us, "used to be nothing but bars, cathouses, tattoo parlors, and more bars." Now it is lined with gleaming modern buildings, including hotels, a world trade center and bank towers, as well as Nauticus, a Disneyesque maritime museum.
Norfolk has yet to attract a big-league sports franchise; this must be one of the largest metropolitan areas in the nation without one. But the New York Mets' Triple-A farm team, the Norfolk Tides, play their home games in Harbor Park, a spiffy stadium close to the waterfront.
Most surprisingly, perhaps, Norfolk's metamorphosis has included its emergence as a cultural center of note, with the Chrysler Museum of Art and Virginia Opera in the vanguard. Both rank among the outstanding institutions of their size in the South and, for that matter, the nation.
It was Walter P. Chrysler Jr., son of the founder of the Chrysler Corporation, who enabled Norfolk to join the late 20th-century revolution in which museums have helped to power the revival of struggling cities. Married to a Norfolk native, he lifted a provincial collection into the top rank in 1971 with the gift of 30,000 objects that "any museum in the world would kill for," as John Russell wrote on one occasion in The New York Times.
In 1989, the museum was deftly enlarged, modernized and reorganized by the Washington architects George Hartman and Warren Cox.
A series of rooms just to the right of the main entrance contains two of the museum's treasures. A collection of Art Nouveau furniture by Majorelle and Colonna, accompanied by Tiffany and Galle accessories, fills the first. Then comes a feast of glass, unmatched on this continent except in the glass-making towns of Toledo, Ohio, and Corning, N.Y.: room after room of Favrile vases and Tiffany lamps, dozens of major pieces of Lalique, Steuben and Wiener Werkstette glass, Sandwich glass, Amberina, Murano glass.
Upstairs, in the picture galleries, my eye was caught by a precise profile portrait of a man in a red turban, attributed to Domenico Veneziano, Piero della Francesca's teacher, whose surviving works are exceedingly rare; Georges de la Tour's pensive St. Philip; a brassy, recumbent blonde, "Mlle. Monna Lils," by the Dutch modernist Kees van Dongen, and a mural by Thomas Hart Benton, painted for the original Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, which vividly embodies the breakneck pace of modern life.
An elaborate parcel-gilt silver cup in the shape of a pineapple, made in London in 1610, testifies to the civilization the Jamestown settlers left behind three years earlier for a rude life in the wilderness.
Until fall, in the largest of the Chrysler's galleries, a giant, golden Dale Chihuly glass sculpture, "Laguna Murano Chandelier," has joined Venetian masterpieces of another era by Veronese and Tintoretto. At the far end of the room, Bernini's great, wide-eyed "Bust of the Savior," which the Baroque master originally intended for Queen Christina of Sweden, "finally has something to stare at," as a curator irreverently remarked to us.
More Chihulys, some of them so dazzling they made me weak in the knees, are on show for three months at the Contemporary Art Center of Virginia in Virginia Beach, magnificently installed and brilliantly lit.

The Music Man
The Virginia Opera has had but one general director in its quarter-century existence, a Brooklyn-born violist named Peter Mark. He has put it on the musical map in not one but three locations. The company's principal residence is the Harrison Theater in Norfolk, a smashing post-modern conversion (by the Boston architect Graham Gund) of a seedy former U.S.O. theater and wrestling arena. Completed in 1993 on a budget of under $10 million, it eschews frou-frou to focus on comfort and capacity (1,600 seats).
Next season Virginia Opera will stage 46 performances of five operas, including a Handel rarity, "Rodelinda," here and in Richmond and northern Virginia. In addition, it will take its shows on the road, performing in various guises before a quarter-million Virginia schoolchildren, an unmatched educational touring program.
Mr. Mark, who also conducts, has given important early breaks to singers as important as Renee Fleming. Two dozen of his alumni are on the current roster at the Metropolitan Opera. The company has done "Don Pasquale" as a spaghetti western, no less, and it has presented acclaimed premieres of several works by Mr. Mark's wife, the Scottish composer Thea Musgrave, most recently her eighth opera, "Simon Bolivar," in January 1995.
"It was like picking up a live wire," Mr. Mark said of his arrival here. "In New York and L.A., people take things for granted. Here, people who want something better for their children realize they have to roll up their sleeves and create it."
The 75-year-old Virginia Symphony Orchestra, which plays for the opera's performances, has begun to burnish its reputation under its young conductor, JoAnn Faletta. This spring, the orchestra was featured during the wide-ranging third annual Virginia Waterfront International Arts Festival. The thoroughly professional Virginia Stage Company plays in the handsome old Wells Theater downtown.
Norfolk is a very old city, of course, and quite a few handprints of history have survived the free-swinging wrecker's ball of recent decades. Among the most notable are three grouped close together downtown: St. Paul's Episcopal Church (1739), shaded by towering magnolias, which has a Revolutionary cannonball lodged in its south wall; the Federal-style Moses Myers House, built in 1793 by the city's first Jewish family, who brought with them from New York portraits by Gilbert Stuart and Thomas Sully, which still hang in the house, and the gray-and-white Old Norfolk Academy (1840), designed in a rigorous Greek Revival style by Thomas U. Walter, who added the House and Senate wings and the cast-iron dome to the United States Capitol.

A General's Tomb
Another of Walter's local buildings, the domed Old City Hall, has been turned into a Napoleonic mausoleum for Gen. Douglas MacArthur, a tomb almost as grandiose as his ego. No fan of his, I gave it a pass and instead visited the Scope Arena, a soaring, saucerlike dome of interlocking concrete triangles, supported only by a system of massive buttresses outside. The work of the Italian Pier Luigi Nervi, this is engineering become art.
You have to climb into the car to see the three 17th-century brick buildings that lie beyond the city's perimeter. So far as I know, they are the only survivors of their kind in the country: the simple, story-and-a-half Adam Thoroughgood House in Virginia Beach (circa 1680), named for a man who came to Virginia as an indentured servant and made a fortune in tobacco, an early example of American upward mobility; Bacon's Castle (1665), near Surry, a two-story Jacobean manor house with a pair of triple chimneys and curvilinear gables, and the wonderful, cherry-pink St. Luke's Church (1632), near Smithfield, probably the only truly Gothic (as against Gothic Revival) structure remaining in America, with the stone buttresses, pediment, crockets and finials of the old-country models faithfully copied in brick.
If you come to Hampton Roads in springtime, you will encounter an intoxicating array of flowering shrubs and trees along most streets -- Bradford pears, wisteria, camelias, magnolias and azaleas. The very best show is at the excellent Norfolk Botanical Gardens, created by the W.P.A.

A Rolling Excursion
A 10-minute trip across the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel will take you to Hampton, the oldest continuous English-speaking community in America. Fort Monroe, once known as "the Gibraltar of the Chesapeake," stands at its edge. Burned twice, in the War of 1812 and the Civil War, the old town has little to show for its long history, with the notable exceptions of Hampton University, founded in 1868 as Hampton Institute to educate freed slaves, and St. John's Church, the oldest Anglican parish in the Western Hemisphere, dating from 1610. The present church dates "only" from 1728, but its lovely silver communion plate, made in England in 1618, is still in use weekly.
Newport News, which lies to the west of Hampton, is more of a 19th-century phenomenon. Collis P. Huntington, the railroad baron, chose it as the eastern terminus of his new Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad, with which he linked his Western lines to the Atlantic. He also established the gigantic Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, still the nation's biggest.
It was Collis's son, Archer, who contributed to the city the institution you're most likely to visit there, the Mariners' Museum. It has fabulous collections of ship models, from six inches to six feet long; ship's figureheads, including a 3,200-pound eagle from the U.S.S. Lancaster, built in 1881, and artifacts associated with the ill-fated liner Titanic.
Farther up the Virginia Peninsula, as the tongue of land between the James and York rivers is known, two towns a few miles apart witnessed the beginning and the end of Britain's colonial experience in America.
Yorktown is not nearly as interesting a battlefield as Gettysburg or Antietam, frankly, and the recreated Jamestown Settlement, despite impressive museums, has something of the theme park about it. The site of the original village, administered by the Colonial National Historical Park, includes the broken tower of the settlers' fourth church, finished in 1647, which stands amid lacy dogwoods -- "God's perfect trees," Betsey calls them.
But somehow neither the tower nor the reproduction huts at the Settlement proved as evocative for us as other features of the historic park, like the pitch swamp where the settlers struggled to survive, now inhabited most visibly by herons, or the simple list of the 104 settlers who stayed in 1607, and the 50 among them who died within six months.
It was fascinating, too, to put some flesh on the cardboard figure of John Smith, the colony's gutsy, imperious leader. Long before he reached the American wilderness, it turns out, he had fought in Hungary, been taken in captivity to Turkey, been sold into slavery in Russia, killed his master, escaped and made his way home to Britain. I guess he must have sailed for Virginia to inject some excitement into a humdrum life.

The Lure of Williamsburg
I have saved for last the area's premier attraction for tourists, Colonial Williamsburg, the reconstituted capital of Patrick Henry and George Washington, willed back into existence by the millions of the philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr.
There is no more need to describe it than to describe the Statue of Liberty. Suffice it to say that I went there as a kid, visited it often when I was at Fort Monroe and took my stepchildren there. I have never tired of it, especially the restored Governor's Palace, with its formal gardens, and the George Wythe House, which belonged to Jefferson's law teacher. This time, Betsey and I especially enjoyed a 10-minute midday prayer service at Bruton Parish Church, sitting in a box pew that belonged to St. George Tucker, whose descendant, another St. George Tucker, christened her. Fond of continuity, these Virginians.
Of course, it's the ensemble that counts in Williamsburg -- shops and taverns, houses and gardens -- plus two amazing museums. One houses Abby Aldrich Rockefeller's pioneering collection of American folk art; a special show of Edward Hicks landscapes has been mounted there this year. The other, designed by Kevin Roche and named for DeWitt Wallace, a co-founder of The Reader's Digest, houses a world-class decorative arts collection.
And more, always more: just down the road stands Carter's Grove, the Georgian plantation often described as "the most beautiful house in America," and all over Williamsburg there are daily re-enactments of turning points in colonial history, designed to involve vistors in the past.
These last were part of the recipe for Williamsburg's rebound after an attendance slump in the late 80's and early 90's, caused partly by theme parks and science centers.
"We felt we had to create a more compelling environment to tell the story of our country's ideals and values," explained Robert C. Wilburn, Williamsburg's outgoing president. "We needed more than antiques and gardens. This is no longer your mother's Colonial Williamsburg, and we're back to the busiest we've ever been."
 
A Region of Shipshape Hotels, Savory Marine Chow and Colonial History
Here is information about visiting the Hampton Roads area around Norfolk, Va.:
 
Where to Stay
 
COLONIAL HOUSES, 302 East Francis Street, Williamsburg, (757) 565-8440. This is Williamsburg's best-kept secret. It's hard to imagine a more charming place to spend a night or a weekend than one of the 18th-century houses or taverns in the colonial capital, with authentically creaking floors, fetchingly time-worn antiques, working fireplaces and modern plumbing. Ours, once occupied by Cary Grant, came with a quartet of well-mannered sheep across the street. Double room: $99 to $200 a night.
 
MARRIOTT WATERSIDE, 235 East Main Street, Norfolk, (757) 627-4200. An unusually well-managed chain hotel, Norfolk's best, with fascinating views over the ship-filled harbor from rooms on the upper stories. Right in the middle of the downtown area, near Waterside Marketplace, yet close to freeways. The 405 rooms are bright and immaculate if not luxurious. The good-humored clerks and bellmen act as if they enjoy what they do. Double room: $159 to $179 a night.
 
PAGE HOUSE INN, 313 Fairfax Avenue, Norfolk, (757) 625-5033. Four rooms, two suites, in a superbly refurbished Georgian Revival brick mansion, built in 1898, with the leafy streets of the Ghent district on the doorstep. This urban, urbane bed-and-breakfast is so close to the Chrysler Museum of Art that you could come back at midday to rest your feet for an hour or so if need be. Up-to-date gear, including cable TV, modems and in-room fridges. Double room: $116 to $185 a night.
 
WILLIAMSBURG INN, Francis Street, Williamsburg, (757) 229-1000. The region's premier establishment, owned by Colonial Williamsburg, is sedate and agreeably old-fashioned. The decor is pure 1930's, with quilted sateen bedspreads, swag curtains and flowered wallpaper, but the bathrooms and air-conditioning are 1990's and the sheets and towels are to die for. The staff is remarkably friendly and accommodating. Killer breakfasts. Double room: $365 a night.
 
What to Eat
 
FORD'S COLONY, 240 Ford's Colony Drive, Williamsburg, (757) 258-4100. Among his peers, David Everett is considered one of the South's standout chefs. No wonder. In a formal dining room overlooking a suburban golf course, he serves delicious, technically accomplished dishes like a four-story tower of tomatoes, blackened and spiced crabmeat and chopped cured salmon. The wines are superb; the service, alas, is a little pompous.
 
LUCKY STAR, 1608 Pleasure House Road, Virginia Beach, (757) 363-8410. Decorated with 1940's flea-market finds, this congenial spot is tucked into a strip mall halfway between downtown Norfolk and the beach. Butch Butt, once a fisherman, knows where to find the best local, seasonal raw materials, and his partner, Amy Brandt, cooks them simply and skillfully -- prime soft-shell crabs, from the Atlantic, not the Bay; wild rockfish, cherrystone clams from their place of origin, Cherrystone Creek on the Eastern Shore.
 
PIERCE'S PITT BAR-B-QUE, 137 Rochambeau Drive, Lightfoot, (757) 565-2955. You won't miss it on the highway near Williamsburg, not with its orange and red Day-Glo paint job. Pierce's is expanding again. But the pitmaster sticks to tradition: succulent ribs and pork shoulder, slow-cooked over oak and hickory logs. Pitt? A sign-painter's mistake that stuck.
 
SURREY HOUSE, Route 31, Surry, (757) 294-3389. A 50's roadhouse in a little courthouse town near the James River ferry, serving authentic, unadorned regional food: peanut soup, proper crab cakes, dynamite country ham cured by S. Wallace Edwards & Sons, just down the road, and lemon chess pie with a featherweight crust. Wanda, the waitress, has the sweetest smile and softest voice this side of heaven.
 
TODD JURICH'S BISTRO, 210 West York Street, Norfolk, (757) 622-3210. Norfolk's standout, an unpretentious room with paper tablecloths. Mr. Jurich is a wizard with Eastern Shore shellfish; try his mouthwateringly plump, juicy fried oysters or the irresistible oyster stew, flavored with slivers of country bacon. Some dishes have too many ingredients, but the wine list is exemplary and the prices are minuscule (no starter above $8).
 
TRELLIS, 403 Duke of Gloucester Street, Williamsburg, (757) 229-8610. Marcel Desaulniers is a noted cookbook author who specializes in salads (spicy shrimp with shaved parmesan and celery, marinated tuna with arugula) and satanically rich chocolate desserts. The main courses taste better than they read, especially the pan-fried chicken. More than a dozen Virginia wines, plus plenty of others; the wait staff is overstretched.

HEADLINE: ANTIQUES;
Irish Style: A 'Stepson' Gains Favor

BYLINE: By Wendy Moonan 

 BODY:
Ireland seems to be entering a golden age. There is the promise of peace. The country is in the midst of a boom: the so-called Celtic Tiger's economy is growing at a faster rate than Europe's. Many computer companies have large operations there, and Dublin has a new International Financial Services Center, where banks like Chase are congregating.
The new prosperity is fueling the market for houses, especially grand old mansions in the countryside, and the Irish art and antiques to fill them. All of which has been great news for auction houses and dealers in Irish antiques on both sides of the Atlantic. 
 "The property market in Ireland is red hot," said Graham Child, a furniture specialist at Sotheby's, which is holding an "Irish Sale" today in London. "A lot of the old, decaying houses are being pulled back. The economy has led to the creation of wealth and a desire to spend the wealth on national things."
The 405-lot Irish sale has some large 18th- and 19th-century mahogany dining tables, chairs and sideboards; a rare pair of oval mirrors with borders decorated with facet-cut studs of blue and clear glass (expected to sell for $8,000 to $11,200); a circa 1755 architect's table and a graceful mid-18th-century mahogany card table with a drawer and a typically Irish carved shell on the front (estimate: $3,200 to $4,000).
"A lot of Irish furniture and pictures are going back to Ireland," said Hugo Swire of Sotheby's London. "The people who are restoring the big Irish houses have limitless budgets. The problem is there's not an enormous amount of supply."
The golden age of Irish furniture-making began about 1720, when mahogany from the West Indies and South America reached Ireland, and ended about 1840. The most popular pieces are 18th-century Irish Georgian antiques. They can be distinguished by their weathered patina, dense grain, quirky dimensions and deep carvings of masks and hairy paw feet. Sometimes the furniture was blackened with polish to match the very dark bog oak, native to Ireland, that was commonly used in 17th-century furniture.
"Irish furniture is often considered the slightly crazed stepson of English furniture," said Clinton Howell, a Manhattan dealer with a shop at 19 East 74th Street. "I have Irish clients who fly over here every year looking for Irish antiques. Right now I have only one piece left."
It is a George II mahogany console table with a breche violette marble top. The apron has elegant gadroon molding and a carved acanthus; the cabriole legs have carved knees. Its price tag, $87,500, is hefty, but only last January Christie's New York sold an Irish George II mahogany side table, circa 1740, with a large lion mask for $96,000, against an estimate of $40,000 to $60,000.
"Almost all our Irish furniture is gone," said John Snead, of John and Patricia Snead, private dealers in McLean, Va., who specialize in Irish long-case clocks. "I recently sold a fine Dublin clock to an American collector for about $15,000."
But the surge in demand for Irish antiques is fairly recent.
"You couldn't sell Irish furniture for large sums five years ago," said Desmond Guinness, an Irish author and connoisseur of houses and antiques. "Now it's being avidly collected." In 1958 Mr. Guinness co-founded the Irish Georgian Society with his fellow Irishman Desmond FitzGerald, the 29th Knight of Glin, to rescue decaying Irish houses.
Last Monday Mr. Guinness gave a party for Kindel Furniture of Grand Rapids, Mich., at Leixlip Castle, his home in County Kildare. A passionate patron of all things Irish, Mr. Guinness agreed to let Kindel sell its reproductions of 22 fine Irish antiques in his Gothic gate lodge as a way for his organization to raise money to restore other Irish houses.
Chantal O'Sullivan, an Irish dealer with galleries in New York, Dublin and Kenmare, said: "For a long time no one wanted Irish antiques, and they were really collectible. When Irish things became more fashionable, they became harder and harder to find."
She is partly responsible for that. An American magazine recently photographed David Mlinaric, a top British decorator, at her gallery.
The Irish Government gives tax breaks to artists of all kinds: musicians, filmmakers, artists and writers. Ronnie Wood of the Rolling Stones, members of the band Simple Minds and actors like Jeremy Irons, Mia Farrow, Anjelica Huston, Daniel Day-Lewis, Liam Neeson and Miranda Richardson all have houses in Ireland now.
Ms. O'Sullivan, who has dined with President and Mrs. Clinton in Dublin and Washington, sells mostly through New York designers like Thierry Despont, Bunny Williams, Thomas Jayne, Mario Buatta, Scott Salvator, Glenn Gissler and David Anthony Easton. She currently has for sale an Irish mantelpiece made of Italian marble ($95,000), a 14-foot-by-5-foot mahogany library table (also $95,000) and an Irish Georgian mahogany blanket chest with carved shells and its original brasses, circa 1770 ($22,000).
Several of her tables have carved shells or masks. "The masks were carved in the likeness of the absent landlords of the house," Ms. O'Sullivan said. "That's why some have hairy faces. It meant the owner had thick whiskers. If he were mean, the face would be ugly, too."
A prominent Paris dealer, Ariane Dandois, said: "Everyone is interested in Irish furniture now. It's English furniture with fantasy. The shapes are extravagant. It's more macho than English furniture."
Mrs. Dandois offers a rare set of eight Irish Regency giltwood armchairs made in Dublin about 1820. The arched crest-rails are carved with lions drinking from a fountain. The armrests have eagle-head supports. She has attributed the chairs to a furniture-maker from Italy, James Del Vecchio Sr., who immigrated to Dublin in the 1790's.
When Mrs. Dandois, who normally sells 18th-century palace furniture to the richest clients on earth, starts selling Irish antiques, it is a clear sign that Irish furniture has joined the top ranks.
Dillingham in San Francisco and two New York dealers, the Newel Art Galleries and Philip Colleck, also sell Irish furniture.
There are two unrelated indications of Irish chic. On May 7, the actress Julia Roberts was one of about 250 people at a book party at Christie's to celebrate "West of Ireland Summers: Recipes and Memories from an Irish Childhood" (Roberts Rinehart, Boulder, Colo.), a new book by Tamasin Day-Lewis, sister of the actor. Ms. Roberts had such a good time with the Irish guests that she was an hour late for dinner with a major fashion magazine editor.
Clue No. 2: The Lower East Side Tenement Museum in Manhattan is adding an Irish immigrant family apartment to its Jewish and Italian ones. And this just six months after President Clinton declared the museum's tenement building a National Historic Site. Maybe he knew that the White House was designed in 1792 by an Irish immigrant, James Hoban.

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on page 8.
 
Now Playing
 
* "AFTER LIFE," starring Arata, Taketoshi Naito and Erika Oda. Written, directed and edited by Hirokazu Kore-eda (not rated, 118 minutes). Much of this transcendently compassionate, gently humorous Japanese film is set in a drab office building where courteous caseworkers welcome the week's new clients. The place turns out not to be a social service agency but a metaphysical way station where the newcomers are people of all ages and types who have just died and have three days to select one memory to take with them into eternity. Before they depart, those memories will be filmed. As they tell their stories and make their choices (those who can't choose remain at the processing center as caseworkers), the movie becomes a profound meditation on life's meaning and value and the relationship of movies, memories and dreams (Stephen Holden). 

* "COOKIE'S FORTUNE," starring Charles S. Dutton, Glenn Close, Patricia Neal, Julianne Moore and Liv Tyler. Directed by Robert Altman (PG-13, 118 minutes). What a treat. The sweet assurance and guerrilla wit of Mr. Altman's vintage ensemble films make a copacetic return with a Southern small-town black comedy. Seamlessly made and completely enveloping, it tells of the machinations set off when a wealthy old woman (Ms. Neal) outrages her diabolically genteel niece (Ms. Close) by committing suicide. As the old woman's dearest friend and the niece's unwitting nemesis, Mr. Dutton is rock solid and appealing. The entire cast works on a single wavelength as Mr. Altman makes the most of a well-woven screenplay by Anne Rapp (Janet Maslin).
 
* "THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS," starring Elodie Bouchez and Natacha Regnier. Directed by Erick Zonca (R, 113 minutes; in French with English subtitles). In this very special French film about two freewheeling young women, their turbulent friendship is frayed by sexual passion and economic realities. The weaker and more head-turning of the women (Ms. Regnier) falls for the advances of a rich nightclub owner, while her fiery friend, played with unforgettable immediacy by Ms. Bouchez, rages against what she views as imminent disaster. In the process, Mr. Zonca shows astonishing acuity in observing how the women's diverging values affect every aspect of their lives. A rare and wrenching drama (Maslin).
 
* "EDGE OF 17," starring Chris Stafford and Tina Holmes. Directed by David Moreton (not rated, 100 minutes). It's 1984 in Sandusky, Ohio, and Eric (Chris Stafford), a skinny, fresh-faced high school student who worships the Eurythmics and Culture Club, has his first homosexual experiences. This is not boy-meets-boy (Romeo meets Romeo and they fall madly in love) but boy is used and confused and tries to go straight by sleeping with his former girlfriend. The teen-age coming-out story is realistic but warmhearted, the best among the recent gay coming-out films (Holden).
 
* "ELECTION," starring Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 105 minutes). From the acerbically funny director of "Citizen Ruth" comes this caustic satire of the American electoral process in a high school setting. Its leading candidate, Tracy Flick, played tartly by Ms. Witherspoon, has a mother who sought tactical advice for Tracy from Connie Chung and Elizabeth Dole. Mr. Broderick plays the hapless good-guy teacher who thinks this wicked little front-runner needs to be stopped. And the hunky newcomer Chris Klein plays Tracy's reluctant opponent in a style best described as early Keanu. With a lovely ear for hypocritical conversation, the screenplay specializes in keeping all the characters a few beats off what they actually mean (Maslin).
 
"ENTRAPMENT," starring Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Directed by Jon Amiel (PG-13, 105 minutes). This glossy caper summons the days when being a thief was the profession of choice among debonair movie heroes. And heroines: as the great-looking insurance investigator who is supposedly investigating Mr. Connery's glamorous super-burglar, Ms. Zeta-Jones makes a smashing gymnast and heist expert in her own right. No need to believe the outlandish details of the story; there's enough verve and charisma to the stars to make the escapade easy on the eyes. The action sequence, in which the stars hang off the side of the world's largest skyscraper, is a vertiginous show stopper. And here's a nice bonus: nobody gets killed (Maslin).
 
* "LEILA," starring Leila Hatami, Ali Mosaffa and Jamileh Sheikhi. Directed by Dariush Mehrjui (not rated, 129 minutes). The devastating drama of a happy marriage destroyed by a monstrous mother-in-law is the latest cinematic gem from Iran. Think of it as a contemporary Islamic "Now Voyager" skimmed of suds, in which the tyrannical matriarch gets her way. On learning that Leila (Ms. Hatami), the wife of her only son, Reza (Mr. Mosaffa), is infertile, Leila's mother-in-law (Ms. Sheikhi) embarks on a campaign of intimidation to convince her daughter-in-law to let Reza take a second wife who might bear him a child. Although Reza claims not to want a child, the mother-in-law shames Leila into being her collaborator in the scheme. Minutely observed, beautifully acted, relentless (Holden).
 
"THE MATRIX," starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss. Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski (R, 120 minutes). The time-traveling story steeped in virtual reality will be all but incomprehensible to anyone but techno freaks. And the film borrows unapologetically from other sci-fi extravaganzas, with a big debt to "The X-Files" in the paranoia department. But the storytelling is intricately bizarre and the special effects are indeed special, notably when it comes to midair martial arts with a gravity-defying gusto. And Mr. Reeves shows that you can look like a Prada model while behaving like an action hero. One of the main stars here is Bill Pope, an inventive cinematographer. He and the Wachowskis provide a couch-potato epiphany: while the characters seem to be performing marvelous feats, they're often lying stock-still in the grip of virtual reality (Maslin).
 
"A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM," starring Kevin Kline, Rupert Everett, Michelle Pfeiffer and Calista Flockhart. Directed by Michael Hoffman (PG-13, 115 minutes). This is potluck Shakespeare, with a wildly uneven range of performances and no clear style holding them together. Rather than wonder why the actors are wrestling with bicycles in 19th-century Tuscany (a setting used much less enchantingly than it might have been), it's best to focus on the most comfortably Shakespearean performances and not wonder what Ms. Flockhart is doing here. Mr. Kline makes a perfect Bottom, Mr. Everett slinks seductively through Oberon's role and Ms. Pfeiffer makes an appropriately gorgeous fairy queen. The younger cast members are largely used as window dressing for the Leo-Does-Romeo set (Maslin).
 
"THE MUMMY," starring Brendan Fraser Rachel Weisz, Arnold Vosloo and John Hannah. Directed by Stephen Sommers (PG-13, 134 minutes). More like a video game than a movie, this incoherent spoof (very loosely based on the 1932 Boris Karloff horror classic), overloaded with cheesy special effects, suggests an unwieldy hybrid of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy" via "Night of the Living Dead." The intrepid adventurers who disturb an ancient Egyptian crypt that carries a fearful curse are Mr. Fraser (playing a swashbuckling American in the Foreign Legion), Ms. Weisz (as a plucky, wide-eyed English librarian) and John Hannah (as her twitty older brother). It's all played for laughs. The only scary moments involve swarming scarabs who burrow under the skin and do awful "Alien"-like things (Holden).
 
* "SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE" (the Oscar winner for best film, best original screenplay, best art direction, best costumes and best comedy score). Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow (the best-actress winner) and Judi Dench (best supporting actress). Directed by John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead," dares to imagine whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving we enjoy today and has great fun presenting the creation of "Romeo and Juliet," glitches and all. Mr. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
 
* "STAR WARS: EPISODE I -- THE PHANTOM MENACE," starring Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Jake Lloyd. Directed by George Lucas (PG-13, 132 minutes). Stripped of hype and breathless expectations, Mr. Lucas's first installment offers a happy surprise: it's up to snuff. It sustains the gee-whiz spirit of the series and offers a swashbuckling extra-galactic getaway, creating illusions that are even more plausible than the kitchen-raiding raptors of "Jurassic Park." While the human stars here are indeed reduced to playing action figures, they are upstaged by amazing backdrops and hordes of crazily lifelike space beings as the Lewis Carroll in Mr. Lucas is given free rein. The "Star Wars" franchise was funnier and scrappier when it was new. But it simply wasn't capable of this (Maslin).
 
"TEA WITH MUSSOLINI," starring Cher, Judi Dench, Joan Plowright, Maggie Smith and Lily Tomlin. Directed by Franco Zeffirelli (PG, 117 minutes). The screen divas (especially Maggie Smith) who give "Tea With Mussolini" a patina of class obviously relish chewing the scenery in this sudsy historical drama (adapted from a chapter of Mr. Zeffirelli's autobiography) about a circle of English expatriate women living in Florence on the eve of World War II. Ms. Smith, a quintessential British snob, is the leader of the pack, nicknamed the Scorpioni, whose comfortable lives are shattered when the Fascists rise to power and they find themselves carted off to another city where they are held under house arrest. Cher is her usual likable self as a free-spending, free-loving wealthy American heiress and art collector who befriends the group (Holden).
 
"THIS IS MY FATHER," starring Aidan Quinn, Moya Farrelly and James Caan. Directed by Paul Quinn (R, 120 minutes). Made with obvious sincerity, this story of a glum Chicago schoolteacher (Mr. Caan) in search of his more interesting Irish forebears (Mr. Quinn) involves a third Quinn brother as well. And Declan Quinn's cinematography adds warmth to an atmospheric, sentimental tale featuring stellar Irish actors (Stephen Rea, Brendan Gleeson, Colm Meaney) in cameo roles. Aidan Quinn's sturdy performance, as a lonely farmer in love with a fiery young lass from a prosperous family, does a lot to help the film override its hackneyed elements and keep it moving (Maslin).
 
* "THE WINSLOW BOY," starring Nigel Hawthorne, Rebecca Pidgeon and Jeremy Northam. Written and directed by David Mamet (G, 110 minutes). Terence Rattigan's play about the 1910 schoolboy's trial that created a furor in England has been artfully pared down to its essentials in this stately and deliberate adaptation. Played with unusually effective restraint by a fine, meticulous cast, it works as a precisely calibrated war of nerves in which the family of a cadet accused of theft is quietly staggered by the consequences of that accusation. Benoit Delhomme's cinematography is beautifully lucid and painterly. Ms. Pidgeon's defiantly arch acting style sets the film's tone and gives her suffragist character a sharp edge (Maslin).
 
Film Series
 
"ALFRED HITCHCOCK." Alfred Hitchcock's birthday doesn't arrive until Aug. 13, but that isn't stopping anyone from celebrating the centennial of the master of suspense (1899-1980). The tributes are already in progress. At the Museum of Modern Art "Alfred Hitchcock," with more than 50 features, shorts and documentaries, as well as an exhibition of posters, photographs and papers, is trumpeted as the most comprehensive Hitchcock film retrospective ever mounted in the United States. At 2:30 P.M. today and 5:45 P.M. tomorrow, the attraction is "Notorious" (1946), with a cast including Ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant and Claude Rains. Francois Truffaut said, "In my opinion, 'Notorious' is the very quintessence of Hitchcock." Continuing through June 15 at the museum, 11 West 53d Street, Manhattan, the series is free with museum admission: $9.50 for adults, $6.50 for students and the elderly; free for those under 16 accompanied by an adult. Pay-what-you-wish on Fridays from 4:30 to 8:30 P.M. Information: (212) 708-9400 (Lawrence Van Gelder).

TOUGH, TOUGH TOYS FOR TOUGH, TOUGH BOYS
By Will Self
244 pages. Grove Press. $23.
There has never been any question whether the flamboyant British writer Will Self had talent. The question was whether he would squander his manic imagination and tactile, hyperventilated prose on self-consciously nasty exercises in sophomoric humor ("Cock & Bull," "Great Apes") or create fictions commensurate with his copious gifts ("My Idea of Fun"). 
 Mr. Self's latest book, "Tough, Tough Toys for Tough, Tough Boys" represents his most disciplined storytelling yet. The tales in this collection demonstrate a new control and polish, without sacrificing anything in terms of inventiveness or plain weirdness. Like his 1994 novel, "My Idea of Fun," it attests to Mr. Self's ability to render even the most bizarre, "Twilight Zone"-like events with convincing verisimilitude while enthralling -- and often horrifying -- the reader with his scathing, Swiftean humor.
"Tough, Tough Toys" comes with an epigraph from Oscar Wilde -- "Life is a dream that keeps me from sleeping" -- and most of the characters in these stories realize that their lives have come to resemble a nightmare or hallucination. In "Flytopia," a Hitchcockian thriller that slowly morphs into a William Burroughsesque fantasy, a mild-mannered clerk enters into a strange pact with the insects infesting his house. In "The Rock of Crack as Big as the Ritz," a drug dealer named Danny discovers that there's a huge vein of crack cocaine running beneath the basement of his house. And in "A Story for Europe," a 2-year-old English child and a German businessman appear to exchange personalities.
The last of those stories, of course, is meant as a wacky commentary on the new, unified, economically interdependent Europe, and its sardonic humor recalls "My Idea of Fun," which satirized the go-go years of the 1980's by depicting yuppie greed as a Faustian pact with the Devil. An even more pronounced version of this sort of social satire can be found in the story "Caring, Sharing," which depicts a therapy-obssessed America in which people mate not with lovers but with "emotos" -- that is, giant manifestations of their own inner children. "The whole messy business of sexual and emotional entanglement" has been written off by these narcissistic Americans; what they want more than anything is "the absolute reassurance that an emoto would provide them with."
Though the remaining tales in "Tough, Tough Toys" are ostensibly more realistic, their characters fall prey to drug- and hormone-fueled fantasies that infect their day-to-day lives, undermining their sense of self and throwing into question their most basic assumptions about the world. The narrator of "Dave Too" -- arguably, the weakest story in this volume -- sees everyone around him turning into someone named Dave. The hero of the title story, a former psychiatrist named Bill, finds himself forced by a chance encounter with a hitchhiker to re-evaluate his entire self-indulgent existence. And Danny, the drug-addicted hero of "The Nonce Prize," discovers an unlikely new vocation as a writer, while serving time in prison for a horrific rape and murder he didn't commit.
Using his eye for detail to flesh out his oddest imaginings, Mr. Self does a nimble job of evoking the addled states of mind of these characters. The Dave man looks at his psychiatrist's window and thinks it looks like an egg: "If a fork like a prop for a Magritte painting were to be plunged through the window of Dr. Klagfarten's office," he tells himself, "a gush of yellow neurosis would undoubtedly ooze out."
During long drives, Bill the ex-shrink likes to imagine himself merging with his car, becoming part of the big machine as he cruises the long, twisty roads between London and the Orkneys. While he drives, he allows his mind to wander, musing that the landscape beyond his windshield is "a terrain in which a few triceratops and pterodactyl wouldn't have looked altogether out of place." His favorite fantasy involves a seraglio made up of all the women he hashad sex with: a Felliniesque dream sequence in which the younger women handle the bulk of the domestic work and the older ones spend their days in "idle conversation and hobby-style activities."
As for Danny, the former crack addict turned short story writer, he suffers from visitations of menacing spirits he calls "the Fates" -- "tall, wispy, indeterminate figures" who metamorphose, much like the ghostly special effects in "Raiders of the Lost Ark," into terrifying djinnlike creatures, "bearded, turbaned, wearing long gray-and-black robes, and carrying mutant, nine-foot-long Kalashnikovs."
In both this story and "Tough, Tough Toys," Mr. Self expertly orchestrates suspense: in the former by turning a simple drive home from a country house into a harrowing adventure in which every attempt to pass another car on the twisting road feels like a life and death confrontation; in the latter, by conjuring up a particularly gruesome crime -- the sexual torture and murder of a 6-year-old boy -- and the almost equally terrifying subculture of sex criminals in a prison.
Although the other stories in this volume may not be as thrilling as this pair of tales, they, too, attest to Mr. Self's ease and authority as a storyteller. His tendency displayed in previous books to force his tales into predictable shapes with obvious, italicized morals, has given way in these pages to masterfully shaped narratives that are both complex and unexpected, just as his earlier, adolescent preoccupation with sex has evolved into a more deeply felt interest in the mysteries of identity and emotional (dis)connection. Along with "My Idea of Fun," "Tough, Tough Toys" stands as Mr. Self's most powerful work yet.

MTV Is Buying TwoServices From TCI Music

BYLINE: By LISA NAPOLI 

 BODY:
Just weeks before it is to unveil a new on-line music venture, MTV Networks announced yesterday that it was acquiring music services on the Internet and on cable television.
MTV, a division of Viacom, will acquire Sonicnet, one of the first Internet sites dedicated to music, and the Box, a pay-per-view cable television music service. In exchange, MTV will give a 10 percent stake in its on-line service to the owner of the two properties, TCI Music, a company based in New York that provides audio and video music through cable, satellite and the Internet. 
 Tom Freston, chairman of MTV Networks, said the on-line music division would be spun off as a separate publicly traded company in the next 9 to 15 months.
TCI Music, a division of Liberty Media Group of Englewood, Colo., also announced that it would change its name to Liberty Digital. Liberty Media, a cable television programming distributor, is part of the huge cable company TCI, which was bought by the AT&T Corporation, although Liberty Media continues to operate independently.
In a phone interview, Mr. Freston called the on-line music business "ripe for consolidation" as the major music labels seek ways to distribute music on the Internet.
On-line commerce will be an important piece of MTV Networks' new on-line music venture, which is to be started next month. In addition, Mr. Freston said there were plans to create an interactive television channel selling tickets, music and other merchandise.
"Our strategy is anyone who can drive traffic is going to be in a position to sell a lot of merchandise, a lot of tickets," he said.
MTV's flagship music channel is available on television in 300 million homes around the world, and Mr. Freston said an expanded on-line presence was a logical next step. He spoke by telephone from Singapore, where MTV will start a Web site for the Asian market today.
Industry analysts said traditional media companies were realizing the power television has to send viewers to the on-line medium, as well as the power of the Internet to extend what they can offer viewers in the finite time permitted by television.
"On line can support strategies in ways broadcast can't," said Mark Hardie, a senior analyst for Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass. "You don't have the air time for all you're trying to air." An on-line presence allows television programmers to direct viewers to their computers for additional services, particularly electronic commerce and eventually, as higher-speed connections become more widely available, music videos.

HEADLINE: Fed Policy Makers Voted 11-0 In March to Hold Rates Steady

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers were unanimous in deciding not to change the overnight bank lending rate at their March 30 meeting and continued to take a wait-and-see attitude on what to do about rates in the future, minutes of the session showed today.
The Federal Open Market Committee voted 11 to 0 to leave the Federal funds target unchanged at 4.75 percent. 
 "The incoming data and prospects for sustained favorable economic performance did not support" a rollback in last year's three successive reductions in the overnight bank rate, the minutes said. The committee decided it "was in a position to wait for developments to unfold, especially given the absence of any evidence of an impending acceleration of underlying inflation."
The committee announced after its most recent meeting on Tuesday that it was leaning toward higher interest rates in the future, the first time the panel has immediately announced a change in its stance. At the March meeting, however, central bankers maintained a neutral bias -- suggesting that it was equally likely to raise or lower rates -- after dropping a stance toward lower rates at their meeting on Nov. 17.
"With little evidence of rising pressures on prices at early stages of production or on nominal wages, inflation should remain contained for some time," the minutes said.
The members indicated, however, that their patience would be limited once the first signs of accelerating inflation appeared. "Many of the members emphasized that in such circumstances the committee might need to act promptly to forestall a buildup of inflationary forces that could destabilize the expansion," the minutes said.
The March minutes showed that many committee members "believed that the next policy move would likely be in the direction of some tightening." At the same time, the minutes said, "the timing of the next policy action was highly uncertain." That uncertainty "argued for a cautious approach to any policy change, especially in light of an economic performance that had not conformed to historical patterns in recent years," the minutes said.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Barclays to Cut 10% of Jobs in Britain

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 20

 BODY:
Struggling against bloated costs and increased competition, Britain's second-largest bank, Barclays P.L.C., announced today that it would cut almost 10 percent of its 65,000-member British work force this year.
The reduction, aimed at saving an annual $320 million, was one of the biggest reductions of jobs in British banking. 
 Coming after months of uncertainty and seesawing stock prices, today's announcement lifted the price of Barclays shares nearly 4 percent, to 18.87, or $30.33, carrying other banking stocks with them.
In a statement, Barclays said it would record an accounting charge of $646 million this year to reflect the cost of reducing its staff, mainly in retail financial services, which employ 55,000 people, and in corporate banking, with about 10,000.
The cuts, which will be made through attrition, voluntary retirements and layoffs, follow staff reductions at the bank's Barclaycard credit card division and at Barclays Capital, the investment arm that had heavy losses in the Russian debt crisis.
While the job reductions announced today were limited to Barclays in Britain, executives did not rule out further cuts in the bank's widespread overseas operations.
"The announcement is very sad, but on a business level this is absolutely essential," said Sir Peter Middleton, the Barclays chairman and acting chief executive. "This is to produce a simpler structure for people to bank with us and reduce costs."
Sir Peter has been running the bank since the last full-time chief executive, Martin Taylor, quit last November in a board-room row over the losses at Barclays Capital. His American replacement, Michael O'Neill, a former Bank of America executive, quit because of a heart problem on the day he was supposed to start work in London in mid-April. His replacement has not been announced.
Coupled with the bank's emerging-markets losses and rising costs, Mr. O'Neill's withdrawal from the top job contributed to a sense among some market analysts that the bank was drifting and was ripe for a takeover. Others, however, say that Barclays and its management remain essentially sound.
"With or without a C.E.O., this is still a major bank with a major market share and it's going to remain a major player," said Alan Reid, a credit-rating analyst with Moody's Investors Service. "There's more to an organization than a single person, and that's very much illustrated by what the bank announced today."
Nonetheless, Barclays has acknowledged that its costs were spiraling and promised to contain them.
"In terms of costs, this has been a bit of an Achilles' heel year after year," said Nick Collier, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "This announcement provides more tangible evidence that they are a little bit more determined on costs."
Michael Trippett, an analyst at Schroders Investment, said the saving would bring Barclays closer into line with the most cost-efficient British banks. But, he said, the balance-sheet benefits would not show until 2001.
Essentially, the problems of Barclays stem from its slow response to a revolution in British retail banking over a decade that has seen 150,000 jobs disappear as some 4,000 bank and savings and loan branches closed.
The transformation of traditional mortgage companies into full-fledged banks, and a rush into the retail financial services market by supermarkets and other nonbanking concerns, has magnified the competition.
At the same time, technological advances -- first in automated teller machines, then in telephone, computer and Internet banking -- have forced banks to devise ways to reduce costs without losing customers.

EUROPE
 
IRELAND: NATO PARTNERSHIP EYED -- Ireland formally announced that it intends to join the Partnership for Peace, an American-sponsored organization of non-NATO countries that coordinates security policies with NATO. Prime Minister Bertie Ahern denied assertions that this would violate Ireland's tradition of military neutrality, which kept the country neutral in World War II, and virtually silent on NATO's air campaign in Kosovo. James Clarity (NYT)
 
TURKEY: REBEL DEPUTY GIVEN DEATH -- Semdin Sakik, the top lieutenant to the imprisoned Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, was sentenced to death for masterminding hundreds of deaths in Turkey in his Kurdistan Workers Party's bid to win autonomy for the Kurds. Turkey has not carried out a death penalty in more than a decade. (AP) 

GERMANY: EX-NAZI CONVICTED -- Ending what could be Germany's last major war crimes trial, a court convicted a 79-year-old former Nazi, Alfons Goetzfried, of assisting in the murders of 17,000 Jews at a concentration camp in Poland. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, but the court gave him credit for time served on similar charges in the Soviet Union, where he spent 13 years in a Siberian labor camp. (AP)
 
RUSSIA: JOSTLING FOR POWER -- Prime Minister Sergei V. Stepashin's first day on the job was marked by early signs of intense Kremlin politicking, after Aleksandr Zhukov, chairman of the Parliament's budget committee, said he would not join the Cabinet unless given a free hand to draft an economic program. Mr. Stepashin has 10 days to name a Government, whose members must all be cleared by President Boris N. Yeltsin. Celestine Bohlen (NYT)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
ISRAEL: AN ARAB WOMAN IN PARLIAMENT --The first Arab woman was elected to the Israeli Parliament. Husniya Jabara, from the Israeli Arab town of Taibe, will be seated as a member of the leftist Meretz Party, which gained a 10th seat in the final vote count. Deborah Sontag (NYT)
 
ISRAEL: 2 JOBS FOR BARAK -- Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak, a highly decorated former general, told the newspaper Haaretz that he intends to serve as his own Defense Minister for the first two years of his term in order to coordinate "the security-diplomatic momentum in the peace process." This would follow the model of his mentor, the late Yitzhak Rabin. Deborah Sontag (NYT)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
ARGENTINA: IMPEACHMENT REJECTED -- Congressmen aligned with the Government party have blocked a request by a federal judge to impeach Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella on charges he concealed evidence of illegal arms sales to Ecuador in 1995. A congressional committee said there was "no evidence to prove the minister was responsible." Mr. Di Tella has argued in his defense that his ministry passed on information to the Defense Ministry once it discovered that arms had been diverted illegally to Ecuador. Clifford Krauss (NYT)
 
MEXICO: PRIMARY ORGANIZER TAPPED -- Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, a legendary former head of Mexico's intelligence apparatus for much of three decades, has returned from semiretirement to head the committee within the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party that is to organize the party's Nov. 7 national primary election. Mr. Gutierrez's last post was as Interior Minister under former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Sam Dillon (NYT)
 
MEXICO: OPPOSITION SEEKS ALLIES -- Mexico's main leftist party, the Party of the Democratic Revolution, has invited other opposition parties to participate in a joint national primary election to elect a presidential candidate to represent an opposition alliance in July 2000 elections. It suggested a date, Oct. 31, one week before the presidential primary scheduled by the governing party. Sam Dillon (NYT)
 
ASIA
 
VIETNAM: PRESS CONTROLS TIGHTENED -- The National Assembly approved a hotly debated revised press law that will require newspapers to pay compensation to the subjects of critical stories and publish corrections even if the information they printed is correct. Critics said the law will hobble a long-running press campaign against official corruption. Seth Mydans (NYT)
 
MALAYSIA: MENDING FENCES WITH INDONESIA -- The leaders of Malaysia and Indonesia met on the Indonesian island of Batam in an attempt to ease relations that have been strained by issues that range from territorial disputes to logging rights to illegal immigration as well as an appearance of Indonesian support for the Malaysian political opposition. Seth Mydans (NYT)
 
MALAYSIA: MINISTERS NAMED -- Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad reshuffled his Cabinet, appointing three new ministers, apparently to strengthen his ruling party in advance of a general election that must be held some time in the coming year. Seth Mydans (NYT)
 
AFRICA
 
CONGO: REBEL MOVEMENT SPLITS -- Congo's main rebel group split in two after one faction rejected a major leadership shake-up announced by the other this week. Supporters of the ousted leader, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, said they would move their headquarters from Goma, on the border with Rwanda, to Kisangani, 350 miles to the northwest. (Agence France-Presse)
 
SIERRA LEONE: PRE-TRUCE FIGHTING -- Heavy fighting broke out around Sierra Leone's eastern diamond town of Kenema even though a cease-fire is to take effect on Monday. Witnesses reported explosions as rebels tried to break through defenses of Nigerian-led West African forces and their militia allies. The rebel push appeared aimed at gaining territory before the cease-fire goes into force. (Reuters)

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Rises Faster Than Forecast

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit reached another record in March, the Commerce Department reported today, providing fresh evidence that the American economy continues to absorb imports at a prodigious rate.
The deficit for March totaled $19.7 billion, the department said, up from a revised $19.1 billion in February and well above the $18.5 billion predicted by economists. It was the third consecutive month in which the deficit was at a new high. 
 Exports totaled $77.5 billion, up $700 million from February, the first increase in five months and a sign of possible recovery in key foreign markets for American goods such as Asia. But imports grew even faster, up $1.3 billion, to $97.2 billion, also a record.
The increase in import revenue was propelled in part by the higher cost of crude oil, which jumped in recent months after being depressed for a year or so.
But imports surged in other categories as well -- notably steel, autos and auto parts, as foreign producers looked to the United States as the vibrant market for their products at a time much of the rest of the world was in the economic doldrums.
Analysts expect the deficit to continue creeping higher in coming months, although probably at a slower pace than over the last several months. They said the deficit would not begin contracting until Western Europe, Japan and the developing nations of Asia begin enjoying a more marked rebound than they have had so far.
"The bottom line is that until the pace of economic growth in the U.S. slows and the rest of the world picks up, the deficit will continue to grow," said G. David Orr, chief economist at First Union Capital Markets.
Asked about the trade deficit during a Congressional hearing today, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said it should not be a problem in the short run because the dollar has been reasonably stable in value and others have been happy to invest the dollars they earn through trade back into the United States.
"There is no evidence that there is any immediate problem coming because of the fact that we are, as an economy, growing far faster than the rest of the world," Mr. Greenspan told the House Banking Committee.
But he said the deficit could become disturbing in the long run if it continued to grow, "creating a significant rise in debt or claims against us by foreigners, which could essentially destabilize our system."
Moreover, the trade deficit is often as much a political and diplomatic problem as an economic one. The United States' deficit with Japan, long a source of friction between the two countries, surged to $6.5 billion in March from $5.3 billion a month earlier, largely because of a sharp jump in imports. Washington has been pressing the Japanese, with mixed success, to do more to stimulate a moribund economy.
The deficit with China dropped to $4.1 billion from $4.6 billion. China has been the focus of the Clinton Administration's trade policy in recent months, as Washington and Beijing spar over the terms on which the Chinese should be admitted to the World Trade Organization.
The best news in today's report was the increase in exports. For years, the Administration was able to point to growing exports as evidence that its policy of opening markets to American goods was paying off in the form of domestic jobs and profits. But since the Asian financial and economic crisis began in mid-1997, the demand for American products in many foreign markets has been weak, hurting farmers and manufacturers.
The increase in exports in March was modest, and it still left the export level 1.8 percent below where it was a year earlier. But it reflected improved sales abroad of a variety of products as diverse as telecommunications equipment, generators, soybeans and chemicals.
Despite the growing deficit, the Administration has given no indication of abandoning its policy of keeping the dollar strong, a strategy that makes exports from the United States relatively more expensive but helps hold down domestic inflation by making imports less expensive.
Indeed, while the surge in imports could ultimately prove troublesome, it has benefited consumers by creating competition and forcing American producers to keep prices down. The announcement by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday that it would tilt in the future toward higher interest rates could lead to a further strengthening of the dollar.
The trade deficit is one of the few tangible ways in which the American economy has been affected by recent global economic turmoil. In part because the United States has weathered the problems well, policy makers here have urged caution in moves to change the world financial system.
Today, Mr. Greenspan and Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin repeated the message that tough monetary and fiscal policy choices, rather than a new financial architecture, were the most effective ways to avert problems in the international economy.
Appearing side by side before the banking committee, they outlined steps the United States has taken to reduce the likelihood of another global financial crisis, including encouraging nations to share more economic data with investors and to keep their currencies realistically valued.
As a way of insuring that developing nations are able to weather financial crises, Mr. Greenspan suggested that they keep enough foreign-currency reserves on hand to allow them to pay all their debts for one year without any additional borrowing. He said developing countries should not take on too much short-term debt and should keep the average maturity of their foreign debt at no less than three years so they do not find themselves squeezed by rapid-repayment demands.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
West Side Tower to Have Park Views

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Sales began last week for the 53 apartments at the Park Laurel, a 40-story tower at 15 West 63d Street that was conceived more than a decade ago. Preliminary site work is under way and the developer expects the building to be ready for occupancy in 2001.
So far contracts have been signed on 11 of the two- to five-bedroom units, including one two-story penthouse. Prices, which in the last week were raised an average of 5 percent, are $725,000 to $10.5 million, according to the Sunshine Group, the project's sales agent. Apartments range from 1,309 to 4,782 square feet. 
 While sales are proceeding, a legal challenge that has swirled around the project continues. Three community groups that oppose the project -- they contend that it will make a dense neighborhood denser -- are appealing a March ruling by the State Supreme Court in favor of the development. Though the court granted a temporary stay to stop construction, it was ultimately lifted.
The tower will replace the five-story building of the former McBurney School and will cantilever over part of the westerly portion of the adjacent 14-story Y.M.C.A. at 5 West 63d Street. The former school's interior has been demolished, though its landmarked Italian Romanesque facade is being preserved and will be incorporated into the new building. Last February, the Y.M.C.A., which owns the old school and has been pursuing plans to develop the site since 1986, sold the air rights over it to make way for the new tower.
It is being developed by the Vornado Realty Trust, a large real estate investment trust based in Saddle Brook, N.J. The project marks Vornado's first foray into Manhattan's luxury residential market.
"We opportunistically came in and took over a project that was waylaid by the real estate recession of the late 1980's because we think it is the single best site in Manhattan," said Steve Roth, Vornado's chairman.
The company secured a building permit from the city in March and at the same time had its offering plan accepted by the State Attorney General's office, which is the first step needed to start sales.
The 1986 plan to develop the site had also provoked a lawsuit, which was resolved in favor of the development. That plan was ultimately sidelined by the real-estate recession.
In 1997, with Manhattan's housing market robust, the Y.M.C.A. resurrected its plan to develop the site and after 18 months of negotiations sold the air rights to Vornado. The Y.M.C.A. received $9.3 million in cash and ownership of the 13 lower stories of the new building, valued at $10 million.
It will use those floors for its programs and for 65 rentals for low- and moderate-income tenants, said Rowena Daly, its director of community relations. The cash proceeds, she said, will be used to improve the existing Y.M.C.A. building.
The 14th through 40th floors of the new tower will contain the luxury condominium apartments, most of which will have Central Park views. The views distinguish the building from the crop of condominiums catering to prosperous buyers now being built, industry professionals say.
Yale Robbins Inc., a Manhattan-based publisher of real estate data, reports that six such buildings, totaling 337 large apartments, are taking shape above 59th Street. Meanwhile, prices continue to rise.
"Nothing is outrageous given the lack of new product to meet demand for large luxury apartments," said Henry Robbins, senior vice president of Yale Robbins.
On the Upper West Side, the average sales price per square foot for condominiums -- both new construction and resales -- is just over $800 for three-bedroom units and $1,050 for those with four bedrooms. These prices represent increases of 33 percent and 10 percent, respectively, from the end of 1998, according to Douglas Elliman, the Manhattan brokerage.
But the new luxury condominiums are pushing the market's upper limits. The average sales price per square foot at the Park Laurel is $1,320, which is expected to rise to $1,500 by the time all the units are sold, said Louise Sunshine, president of the Sunshine Group. She attributes $200 of that price to what she called the "park factor."
"Everyone wants a park view," she said.
Layouts of the apartments, designed by Costas Kondylis, a Manhattan architect, feature nine-foot-high ceilings and large windows to enhance park views.
The building's exterior was designed by Beyer Blinder Belle of Manhattan, an architectural firm, to complement the historic facade of the former school.
Planned amenities include a fitness center and a children's playroom. Monthly common charges will range from $989 to $3,164. Because of a 10-year tax abatement, real estate taxes are to range from $65 to $922 a month, eventually rising to $608 to $8,683.
On the legal front, the West 64th Street Block Association, One Lincoln Plaza condominium association and Landmark West, a preservation group, have filed a notice to appeal the State Supreme Court's March ruling. A hearing is expected in September.
Their lawsuit contends that the approval for the project, which was issued in 1989 and lacks an expiration date, should be invalidated because the city began putting four-year limits on such permits in 1995. It also said the project's environmental impact statement should be updated because buildings constructed in the intervening decade have made the neighborhood more congested, said Charles E. Knapp, a Manhattan lawyer representing the groups.
"Though the court agreed with our analysis that the lapse provision applied to the permit, it inconsistently allowed the city not to apply the law here," he said. "We are not antidevelopment, but we are concerned in trying to maintain a livable neighborhood."
Vornado views things differently. In a statement, it countered, "If the appeal is heard, it won't be for several months and in the meantime Vornado is going ahead with the building." The company said it would start construction on the new tower in July.

HEADLINE: Legislature Of Nebraska Votes Pause In Executions

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 20

 BODY:
Responding to concerns that the death penalty was being applied unfairly, the Nebraska Legislature voted today to impose a two-year moratorium on executions.
Although other states have considered such a suspension, Nebraska, where three prisoners have been executed in the last five years, is the first to send the proposal to the governor. The purpose of the moratorium would be to allow time for a study on whether the race or economic status of the defendant, or any other issue unrelated to the crime, plays a role in death sentencing. 
 But the legislation faces the likelihood of a veto by Gov. Mike Johanns, a first-term Republican who supports capital punishment and has expressed opposition to the moratorium. Still, the Governor said today that he would take a serious look at the measure, which he has five days to sign or veto. After that, it becomes law without his approval.
The vote in the one-house Legislature was 27 to 21, two more votes in favor than were needed for passage but three fewer than would be required to override Mr. Johanns's veto. And while the Governor could allow the bill to become law without his signature, he suggested today that he would not choose that path.
"I think I'm here to make difficult decisions," The Associated Press quoted him as saying.
A co-author of the measure, State Senator Kermit A. Brashear of Omaha, a Republican in a legislature that is officially nonpartisan, said he did not oppose the death penalty but was unconvinced that it was being applied fairly.
"If you love the law and you love justice, you must be committed to fairness," Mr. Brashear said. "And when I see 165 murderers in Nebraska prisons and only 10 are on death row, I want to know, Why are some of these people treated differently?"
Mr. Brashear said that while he did not believe that Nebraska itself practiced racism in its use of capital punishment, "there is clearly a racial component and a socioeconomic component nationwide" in death sentencing. Although accounting for only 13 percent of the country's population, blacks are 42 percent of the 3,600 or so prisoners on its death rows. In Nebraska, 3 of the 10 death-row prisoners are black or Indian.
Whatever the fate of the bill, opponents of the death penalty said, the vote today sends a heartening message.
Steven Hawkins, executive director of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, based in Washington, said Nebraska, a mostly conservative state, was not a place where such deep-seated reservations about executions might have been expected.
"There's a change in the public attitude on the death penalty," Mr. Hawkins said. "We're very encouraged by what we're hearing in the heartland. It says something about where Middle America stands."
Mr. Hawkins and other foes of capital punishment attributed that change to a variety of factors. One was Pope John Paul II's strenuous opposition to executions. Another was the concern over mistaken convictions that has been stoked by a series of cases in Illinois. In the last 12 years, a dozen men on death row there have been exonerated, one of whom, Anthony Porter, came within two days of being put to death last fall.
While Nebraska's legislators are the first to approve a moratorium, lawmakers in other states as well have begun taking a second look at the death penalty laws. In Pennsylvania, a bill has been introduced that calls for a moratorium on executions there. A resolution calling for a six-month moratorium was approved by the Illinois House in March, although the measure failed in the State Senate. Legislation recently enacted in Montana bars the execution of anyone who was a juvenile when arrested for the capital offense. Texas, which puts to death more prisoners than any other state, is considering a measure that would prohibit executing anyone mentally retarded.
That kind of activity in state legislatures, Mr. Hawkins noted, is the opposite of a trend that prevailed only three years ago, when politicians were looking for ways to give the death penalty broader reach.
Yet even as the states assess the use of capital punishment, the number of executions is soaring.
Forty-four prisoners around the country have been executed so far in 1999, said Mr. Hawkins, who predicted that perhaps 100 would be put to death by the end of the year. That would be a record for any year since 1976, when the Supreme Court allowed capital punishment to be resumed. Nebraska has executed three prisoners in the post-1976 period.

HEADLINE: City's Unemployment Rate Stays at Its Lowest, Reassuring Wary Economists

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
New York City businesses continued to add new jobs at a rapid pace in April and the unemployment rate remained near its lowest level in a decade, reassuring some economists who had feared that it would rebound after its sharp drop in March.
After adjustment for seasonal factors, the unemployment rate in the five boroughs edged up to 6.5 percent in April from 6.4 percent in March, according to data released yesterday by the State Department of Labor. Both figures are sharply lower than February's unemployment rate of 7.6 percent; a year ago, unemployment in the city was 8 percent. 
 "I'm glad to see it's down, I'm glad it didn't bounce back up," said Jim Brown, an analyst for the agency. Unemployment figures, which are extrapolated from a sampling of households, are traditionally volatile, he said.
Nevertheless, he noted, the underlying trend in the city has been for unemployment to decline for several years. In June 1997 the rate, which is the percentage of people seeking work as a percentage of all the people working or looking, was close to 10 percent.
The number of new jobs in the city rose in April by 14,000, according to state figures, which are derived from a survey different from the unemployment data. The gains were largest in construction, retailing and services to businesses and individuals. But while the number of jobs in the city rose, the number of city residents with jobs fell by about 29,000, according to state data. The unemployment rate stayed low because the number of people looking for jobs also fell, by almost 9,000.
Mr. Brown cautioned against assuming that the difference between the rising number of jobs and falling employment is caused by people commuting into the city to work, noting that many city residents also work outside the city.
Some economists suggest that the underlying data may be flawed in some way but it is not clear exactly how. In March, the number of people with jobs plunged by 50,900 and the number of city residents looking for work fell by 44,400, according to the city comptroller's office, which adjusted the numbers for seasonal factors. Both declines are unusually large for a single month.
A statement from the Comptroller's office expressed concern about the figures, which "suggest that even though there has been a steady increase in jobs, there has been a decline in the number of city residents working or looking for work."
Within the city, the lowest unemployment rate was in Staten Island, at 5.1 percent. In Manhattan, the rate was 5.4 percent; in Queens, 5.8 percent; in the Bronx, 7.5 percent, and in Brooklyn, 7.6 percent. None of these figures is seasonally adjusted.
Though it has come down sharply, the city's unadjusted unemployment rate of 6.4 percent remains sharply higher than the rate for the state over all of 4.9 percent and than the national rate of 4.1 percent.

HEADLINE: U.S. Aide Due in North Korea With Deal to Lift Sanctions

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
President Clinton is sending an envoy to North Korea next week with a proposal that the 50-year-old economic embargo against the country be lifted gradually in exchange for a series of major concessions, including an agreement that the North will end its long-range missile program, officials said.
Several current and former Administration officials expressed doubts that North Korea would accept the limits on military programs in the proposal, though an end to the sanctions would allow the famine-scarred nation to trade with the West. North Korea's sales of missiles in the Middle East and to Pakistan have constituted its only lucrative export in recent years. And any agreement to lift some of the sanctions would be subject to Congressional approval, which would be an uphill battle. 
 Still, the diplomatic overture represents the biggest change in Washington's approach to North Korea since the Korean War ended in 1953. Since that conflict ended in stalemate -- no formal peace treaty has ever been signed -- the United States has prohibited virtually all trade, investment and travel, and most communication with the Communist nation.
This is the first time that the United States has made a comprehensive proposal to lift those sanctions or offer the prospect of full diplomatic recognition, a matter of prestige for the isolated country that officials say the envoy, former Defense Secretary William J. Perry, will raise during his visit.
Administration officials have declined to detail the contents of the proposed deal that Mr. Perry hopes to present in person to North Korea's reclusive leader, Kim Jong Il.
Mr. Perry's trip is the first time a Presidential envoy has been dispatched to North Korea, although former President Jimmy Carter went there on his own to defuse a nuclear crisis in 1994. That trip ultimately led to an agreement by North Korea to freeze its nuclear weapons program, though American intelligence agencies believed that before the accord North Korea had extracted enough plutonium to produce one or two crude nuclear weapons.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright announced Mr. Perry's visit today in Congressional testimony, confirming reports that had circulated in Washington for several days. But she said nothing about the offer to lift sanctions in return for concessions by President Kim, who has ruled North Korea since the death of his father, Kim Il Sung, weeks after Mr. Carter's visit in 1994.
Mr. Perry's visit culminates a six-month review of North Korea policy that he began, at Mr. Clinton's request, after several years of what even some Administration insiders volunteer was a dangerous neglect of the country. The timing of Mr. Perry's trip was also closely linked to the start yesterday of the first American inspection of a huge, mysterious construction project under a North Korean mountain that American intelligence agencies feared was originally intended to house a secret nuclear processing plant.
It is unclear whether Mr. Perry, who is carrying a letter from Mr. Clinton, will meet with President Kim, which he had suggested earlier would be a precondition for a visit. "We certainly hope to meet with Kim Jong Il," a senior Administration official said today, suggesting that the North Koreans had provided winks and nods that such a meeting is being arranged.
But even if Mr. Perry convinces Mr. Kim that it is in North Korea's interest to give up the weapons program and curb its behavior, it is unclear that he can convince Congress that lifting sanctions is in America's interest.
Conservatives on Capital Hill have already charged that the Administration is pursuing a policy of appeasement. On Tuesday, Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, Republican of New York Republican, introduced a bill he called the North Korea Threat Reduction Act that would prohibit Mr. Clinton from lifting the sanctions -- some of which are imposed at the discretion of the President, others by Congressional mandate -- and will make it difficult to provide food aid to North Korea.
Mr. Perry has met with a number of members of Congress, and gave a classified briefing today to members of the Senate. He has also traveled repeatedly in recent months to Japan, South Korea and China, seeking their support for a new American approach.
The reaction has been mixed: South Korea's President, Kim Dae Jung, has pursued what he has called a "Sunshine Policy" of fuller engagement with the North and urged the United States to do the same. Japan has been far more cautious, especially after North Korea shot a three-stage missile over Japan on Aug. 31, a test that appeared intended to demonstrate that North Korea could hit any Japanese city and the tens of thousands of American troops based in Japan.
What Administration officials have declined to discuss is what advisers around Mr. Perry call Plan B: How to respond if North Korea decides not to trade its missile program for a gradual relaxation of the American economic embargo.
"This has been the hardest part, and I think it is the issue that has delayed the Perry report for so long," said Donald Gregg, the former American ambassador to South Korea, and a Central Intelligence Agency operative in the region during the cold war. "To be credible, this plan has to have a plan about how to deal with the North if they turn this down. For a while it looked like the recommendation would be benign neglect."
"But it is clear," said Mr. Gregg, who now heads the Korea Society in New York, "that if we leave them alone, they go back to building nuclear weapons and missiles."
In his few public comments while he has been putting together recommendations for a new policy, Mr. Perry has said that he thought it was important to "test the proposition that North Korea wants a more positive relationship" with the United States, but to be prepared to respond if it continued on its current path.
That path has been erratic. In 1993 and 1994 the United States and North Korea appeared veering toward a dangerous confrontation that Mr. Perry, the defense secretary in those years, has since said could have led to war. North Korea had taken steps that led American officials to believe it was about to harvest a load of plutonium at its nuclear facility at Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, the capital. Washington was prepared to seek sanctions at the United Nations, a move North Korea had hinted could lead to military reprisals.
Mr. Clinton was within hours of ordering additional troops to South Korea when Mr. Carter visited Kim Il Sung, the country's founder and its leader during the Korean War. Mr. Carter made the breakthrough that ultimately led to a freeze on production at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear reprocessing facility. Kim Il Sung died the next month, but the accord went ahead.
In return for the freeze, Japan and South Korea agreed to build two light-water reactors in North Korea for electricity production, and Washington agreed to provide fuel oil to help North Korea through its long winters. But Congress slowed those fuel shipments, and the construction of the plants has moved very slowly; financing is just now coming together.
So last year North Korea returned to some classic provocations. First there was the huge underground construction site. The Administration said little about it to Congress, and the revelations about its existence in mid-August led to Congressional protests against Ms. Albright, who some members charged had misled them. That was followed by the missile test over Japan. However, North Korea appears to have abided by the production freeze, which is under constant international monitoring.

HEADLINE: Easy Credit Demands Tough Laws

 BODY:

To the Editor: 
 I agree with Representative Henry J. Hyde (Op-Ed, May 18) that our bankruptcy laws need to be humane, and suggest that Congress stop allowing such usurious rates on consumer credit. I recently received a notice of revised terms to my credit card, and the interest on cash advances and outstanding balances if not paid on time was 26.99 percent. No wonder bankruptcies have increased so dramatically. Until our lawmakers put an end to such unconscionable greed, bankruptcies and credit problems will continue to plague the middle and lower classes.

HEADLINE: Met Opera Association Names President

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN 

 BODY:
Paul M. Montrone was elected president and chief executive officer of the Metropolitan Opera Association at its annual meeting yesterday. The association oversees the company's financial affairs, and although it has no direct artistic input, it is responsible for hiring both the general manager and the artistic director. The term of office is one year, with no term limit.
Mr. Montrone, 58, succeeds Bruce Crawford, 70, who was elected honorary chairman. Mr. Crawford was president of the association in 1984 and 1985 and general manager of the Met from 1985 to 1989. He has been president since he was re-elected to that post in 1991. During his tenure the company appointed Joseph Volpe as its general manager and installed Met Titles, a system that provides English translations on seat-back screens. 
 "The real strength of the Met today is a combination of artistic achievement and financial wherewithal, and today we're standing strong in both areas," Mr. Montrone said yesterday. "My job will be to maintain that momentum. None of this happens by itself.
"We have a budget of $170 million, of which we raise about $70 million in contributions, with almost nothing from the government. So we have a large job to be done each year, and to do it, we have an active board that is a mosaic of people from various fields."
Mr. Montrone joined the Met's advisory board in 1986 and its managing board in 1991. He has been a member of the executive committee since 1992. He is the president and chief executive officer of Fisher Scientific International Inc., which supplies products and services to research and clinical laboratories.
A native of Scranton, Pa., he graduated from the University of Scranton in 1962 and later earned a doctorate in economics and finance from Columbia University. He began his career as a systems analyst in the office of Robert S. McNamara when he was Defense Secretary.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 22, 1999, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the election of Paul M. Montrone as president and chief executive of the Metropolitan Opera Association referred imprecisely to the association's role in hiring. The association is responsible for hiring the Met's general manager. It is the general manager, not the association, who hires the artistic director.

HEADLINE: DIALOGUE: Two Views of the Commuter's Curse;
Isn't It Obvious? Cutting Taxes Helps the Economy

BYLINE: By George E. Pataki; George E. Pataki is the Governor of New York.

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
Higher taxes mean fewer jobs, lower taxes mean more jobs. That is why I am going to sign the bill that eliminates the tax on the state's commuters to New York City. Our rate of job growth now matches the national rate, thanks in part to our tax cuts. And in New York City, state tax and economic policy has helped the city regain all of the 350,000 jobs it had lost during the 1990-92 recession.
Getting rid of the commuter tax is part of a pattern. We've cut the income tax, the corporate franchise tax, the estate and gift tax, school property taxes, taxes on electricity and motor fuel, taxes on small business, taxes on real estate transactions, taxes on Internet commerce, and more. 
 Repealing the commuter tax will help the 450,000 New Yorkers who commute to the city and contribute to its economy in so many ways -- shopping, dining, visiting museums and theaters, investing on Wall Street and so on. Commuters spend plenty of money in the city. Cutting their taxes by $210 million will give them more to spend as they wish. That's good for the city economy and budget.
When I proposed large income tax cuts in 1995, there were those who said tax cuts would decimate the state's finances. But tax cuts have strengthened our economy, which has led to four consecutive large budget surpluses. That means more money for education and the environment.
New York has suffered for too long under a culture that said high taxes were a given and could never be reduced, a culture that responds to every tax cut idea by reflexively shouting, "You can't do that!" This culture believes tax revenues are the sole property not of the person who pays the tax but of government. In this environment, tax policy becomes a debate over how much a tax cut will "cost" government -- as if it were the government's money to begin with -- and not about wage earners' rights to their money.
This wrongheaded thinking made New York State and New York City the tax-raising, big-government capitals of America in the 1980's and early 1990's. Taxes in New York City were raised by more than $3 billion in the early part of this decade, directly contributing to the loss of nearly 350,000 private-sector jobs.
Across New York, we're changing this culture. Fiscal debates now center on cutting taxes, not raising them. In Albany, we've cut taxes 36 times. And we are fighting for even more tax cuts today.
This attitudinal shift has helped push New York back in the right direction, where jobs are growing, personal income is rising and our economy is improving. In Albany, we have more than reversed the $3 billion in tax increases on city residents and businesses by cutting many taxes. These initiatives included cutting the state income tax and using state money to require a 10 percent cut in the troublesome city income tax.
So why the commuter tax and why now? Given the city's $2 billion surplus, shouldn't some other tax be cut instead? The answer is, If there are other taxes people want to cut in the city, let's cut them, too. But the opportunity to repeal the commuter tax has arisen, and it must be seized. Both houses of the Legislature, including an Assembly Speaker who is from Manhattan, have passed a bill I can sign. It's clear that tax cuts work for all New Yorkers.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Computer SharesFall; Investors Shift to Small Companies

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday, led by computer-related shares such as the Microsoft Corporation, as investors shifted from large companies that gained the most in recent years to laggards, including small stocks and utilities.
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index slumped 22.09 points, to 2,520.14. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 37.46 points, to 10,829.28, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 8.54 points, to 1,330.29. 
 The Russell 2000 Index of smaller stocks rose 1.12 points, to 449.14, its fourth consecutive gain.
"A lot of people continue to take money from large-cap growth names, and are putting it into smaller names that look cheap," said Michelle Clayman, chief investment officer at New Amsterdam Partners L.L.C., which oversees $820 million.
While the average company in the Nasdaq 100 index trades at 54 times its estimated earnings per share for this year, Russell 2000 stocks trade at 23. The industrial equipment rental company Rental Service, with a market value of $578 million, gained 1 1/2, to 23 13/16 , while the stainless-steel maker Armco Inc., which has a market capitalization of $706 million, gained 7/8, to 6 1/2.
Six computer-guided buy programs and six sell programs had the net effect of adding 4.25 points to the Dow average, according to Birinyi Associates Inc., a research firm in Greenwich, Conn.
Concern is growing among some investors that price competition in the personal computer industry will slash profits in coming years. Already machines costing less than $1,000 are flooding the market.
Dell Computer, the direct seller of personal computers, slumped 15/16 , to 37 5/16 , and Compaq Computer fell 7/16 , to 25 1/16 . Dell, one of the top-performing stocks this decade, has returned just 2 percent this year, while Compaq is down 40 percent. International Business Machines , the world's biggest computer maker, fell 2 1/2, to 230 3/8.
The Dow Jones utilities average gained more than half a point, to 325.15, its third consecutive record, as investors sought shares that carry relatively high dividends. "It's safe-haven buying," said Wayne Nordberg, vice chairman of KBW Asset Management Inc., which manages $400 million. Reliant Energy gained 11/16 , to 30 7/8, and Consolidated Edison rose 5/8, to 48 1/16 .
Eastman Kodak fell 2 9/16 , to 73, after an analyst, B. Alex Henderson at Prudential Securities, said the photography company might face a second-quarter profit squeeze as its rival, Fuji Photo Film, cuts United States film prices heading into the busy summer season. That raised concern that Kodak would respond with price cuts of its own. The analyst said Kodak might continue to lose market share to Fuji, the No. 2 photo company.
General Motors and its Delphi Automotive Systems, the auto-parts maker, rose after Delphi was added to the Standard & Poor's 500 index. G.M., which still owns 82.3 percent of Delphi shares, will distribute about 0.7 share of Delphi for each G.M. common share outstanding next Friday. It is spinning off Delphi to let the parts company compete more effectively for business with other auto makers. G.M. rose 3 3/16 , to 83 5/16 . Delphi rose 13/16 , to 21 5/16 . Companies' shares typically rise when they join the S.& P. 500 because mutual funds that try to imitate the performance of the index must buy them. About $700 billion is invested in portfolios that try to match the index, S.& P. said.
Oil stocks gained, limiting losses in the Dow industrial average and the S.& P. 500 as crude oil for July delivery rose 34 cents, to $17.41 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange on reports oil exports would be delayed from Iraq, which accounts for about 2.5 percent of the world's oil.
Exxon gained 2 3/4, to 82 3/4; Mobil rose 3 3/4, to 103 1/8, and Texaco climbed 1 3/4, to 66 1/8.
Iraq has told shippers that sales would be delayed by at least a week starting Tuesday, when a new six-month round of exports in a United Nations program was scheduled to begin, news services said. The United Nations has yet to vote on renewing the oil sales agreement.
"Oil companies have done well in the last few months, mainly on the strength of oil prices," said Bob Christian, senior vice president of the Wilmington Trust Corporation, which oversees $27 billion. "Economic growth is picking up abroad and these are the companies that can benefit from faster economic growth in Europe and Asia."
Oil service companies also gained. Smith International Inc. rose 4 1/8. to 47 7/8; Cooper Cameron climbed 2 13/16 , to 39 5/16 , and Weatherford International gained 1 7/8, to 34 13/16.

HEADLINE: Vallone Sees Layoff Threat After a Tax Is Eliminated

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker, warned yesterday that the loss of up to $360 million a year in commuter tax revenue could force the city to lay off workers at some point in the next few years.
Speaking to a group of labor leaders, Mr. Vallone said the State Legislature's decision last week to abolish the income tax paid by nonresidents who work in the city had created a "perpetual hole" in the city's $35 billion budget. The impact could be more serious in future years, he said, when the economy might be weaker and the city might not have a surplus. 
 "The quickest way of saving money is not to hire," Mr. Vallone, a Democrat, told about 50 labor leaders, who had invited City Council members to a luncheon to discuss concerns about Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's spending plan. "And who gets hurt first? The little person gets hurt first."
After his speech, Mr. Vallone told reporters that the repeal of the commuter tax -- which was 0.45 percent of taxable income for most wage earners -- had forced the Mayor and the Council to reconsider their spending priorities as they figure out how to make up for the anticipated loss of revenue.
"Everything is back on the table," Mr. Vallone said, adding that Council members would discuss spending priorities today in a special meeting at City Hall. "We were able to get through the worst of times without laying people off, but we were never faced with this situation."
Later in the day, aides to both Mr. Vallone and Mr. Giuliani said layoffs in the coming fiscal year were highly unlikely, because the city had a record $2.1 billion surplus. A more likely strategy for dealing with the lost commuter tax revenue would be to abandon some of the tax cuts that the Mayor and the Speaker had proposed, the aides said. Mr. Giuliani has proposed $405 million in tax cuts, while Mr. Vallone has called for more than $800 million in cuts.
"This year there is a surplus, so we're just going to have to make some choices regarding the tax cuts," said Carolyn Daly, a spokeswoman for Mr. Vallone. "But in years where there is no surplus, those are the years where you will start considering layoffs."
Joseph J. Lhota, the Deputy Mayor for Operations, said Mr. Vallone was justified in worrying about the long-term effects of the commuter tax repeal, because the city anticipates sizable budget deficits in the next few years. The Giuliani administration is predicting a $1.6 billion budget gap in the 2001 fiscal year, and a $1.7 billion gap in 2002.
"Given the size of our out-year gaps, layoffs are an option," Mr. Lhota said. "It's one of the many things we will consider as we move forward to close the budget gaps."

HEADLINE: U.N. Lets Iraq Sell Oil for 6 Months; Sanctions to Remain

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 21

 BODY:
The Security Council voted unanimously today to extend the United Nations relief program for Iraq for six months amid calls to lift gulf war sanctions entirely.
The resolution allows Iraq to sell $5.26 billion worth of oil every six months to purchase food, medicine and other necessities for its people under crippling United Nations sanctions since Baghdad's troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990. 
 Benon Sevan, the United Nations Under Secretary General in charge of the program, expects difficulties in obtaining Iraq's agreement. "We have noted a certain increase in the stridency of statements regarding the future of the program, which may signal difficulties ahead," he told the Council.
During the last six months, Iraq sold about $3.8 billion worth of oil, about $900 million more than its previous high because of recovering oil prices and its ability to export an average of about two million barrels per day. If oil prices are sustained, Iraq could exceed the $5.26 billion in oil sales before Oct. 20.
Consequently, today's resolution promises to review the $5.26 billion limit on oil export revenues if Iraq reaches the ceiling before Nov. 20.
About two-thirds of the oil revenues go toward the purchase of relief supplies. The remainder is for costs of the program and to compensate victims of Iraq's 1990 occupation of Kuwait before United States-led troops expelled them in the 1991 gulf war.
The extension of the oil-for-food program came as Council members were considering proposals to ease or lift sanctions entirely. France had wanted some improvements to the relief plan in today's resolution, such as eliminating the ceiling on oil exports entirely.
But the United States, which made an identical proposal in January, only endorsed the possibility of raising the cap in meetings with diplomats.

30-Year Treasury Yields Decline to 5.75 Percent
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond declined this week from a 1999 high of 5.92 percent on May 14. It closed yesterday at 5.75 percent. Treasury bond prices held onto strong gains as jitters about emerging markets caused a flight-to-quality buying while the expiration of June options increased purchases of bond futures. 
 On Tuesday, Federal Reserve policy makers said that they were leaning toward raising interest rates to slow economic growth and curb inflation. Although they did not raise their interest rate target, which is now 4.75 percent, the warning is now official. Page C4.
 
Japanese Banks Report Big Losses
Japan's eight largest banks have reported steep fiscal-year losses. The poor performance largely reflected efforts by the banks to clean their books by writing off bad loans. The losses, however, were still larger than expected. The main reason is that the banks must follow stricter rules for evaluating bad loans and creating a deeper cushion of money in the event that good loans go bad. C2.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Flags of Inconvenience;
Union Campaigns Against Some Foreign Ship Registry

BYLINE: By RUSSELL WORKING 

DATELINE: VLADIVOSTOK, Russia, May 17

 BODY:
The Lakhta is a rusting hulk that usually hauls scrap metal to Japan, but since February the vessel has sat idle here in the largest port in the Russian Far East, her superstructure painted in Russian and English: "WE ARE ON STRIKE. WE WANT OUR MONEY!"
So when the Global Mariner sailed into Vladivostok's Golden Horn Bay recently, its crew pitched in $720 for the sailors on the Lakhta. The Global Mariner is a 13,000-ton freighter owned by the International Transport Workers' Federation, a union of sailors, truckers, longshoremen and others. Outfitted as a form of seagoing protest, the British ship is undertaking a round-the-world voyage to fight the registration of ships under "flags of convenience" -- countries other than the place of ownership. 
 Flying the flag of countries like Belize or Liberia allows them to avoid heavy taxes and hire crews from low-wage countries, cutting the cost of transportation. But the union says such vessels have poor safety records, frequently do not pay employees, and sometimes abandon sailors in distant ports when aging ships get too expensive to run. The Lakhta, the union said, represents everything it is fighting.
Once owned by the Far Eastern Shipping Company, the largest transportation fleet in the Russian Pacific, the ship was sold and reflagged in Belize. The sailors are a year behind in their wages, and the owners no longer provide food or water and once even tried to evict the crew at gunpoint. The ship is caked in rust, and even her basic seaworthiness is in question. The hatch covers over the cargo holds do not fully close, a problem that could swamp the ship in high seas, said Ulrich Jurgens, the Global Mariner's captain and a union inspector, after touring the Lakhta.
"If you have open hatch covers, it is basically a death sentence," he said. "This is one of the worst cases I have ever seen. What we're seeing here is inhumane. It shows less than no respect for the lives of the seafarers."
Of the world's 85,500 self-propelled cargo vessels of 100 gross tons or greater, some 16,000 are registered in the 27 countries that the union lists as flags of convenience. The practice of registering abroad began in earnest with Prohibition, when rumrunners hauled their cargoes under the Panamanian flag. But the practice has grown in recent years as shipping companies try to save money. In the eight years since the fall of Communism, 10 percent of Russia's fleet has been reflagged abroad to avoid the country's onerous taxes.
Costly regulations and high-wage workers in North America, Japan and northern Europe often make it profitable for shipping companies to reflag. For example, the United States levies a 50 percent duty on any repairs to American-flagged ships in overseas ports, said Rod Vulovic, vice president of Sea-Land Service Inc., a Charlotte, N.C., unit of the CSX Corporation.
Twenty-eight of Sea-Land's 63 ships are flagged overseas, saving up to $3.5 million a vessel each year, Mr. Vulovic said.
Mr. Vulovic rejects the union's charges that shipowners are cavalier toward workers and safety when their vessels sail under foreign flags. "You can have companies such as Mobil Oil that do a good job and are responsible citizens of the world," he said, "and they're put in the same bag as those who don't pay mariners and abandon ships."
But critics say foreign registries effectively allow countries to pick and choose which regulations to follow. Flag-of-convenience countries, taken as a whole, have a worse safety record than registries of ships based within a country, said Paul Lane, director of the Seafarers' Research Center of the University of Cardiff in Wales. Even more troubling, he said, is that sailors at sea are subject to the laws of the nations under which they are flagged, and maritime ministries do not effectively monitor working conditions. How well can states like Liberia or Cambodia, torn by civil strife for decades, oversee their national ships?
The International Transport Workers' Federation has fought reflagging since 1948. And last year, on the 50th anniversary of its campaign, it took its show on the road. The union bought an old freighter for $3 million. (It hopes to recoup this cost by selling the ship when her voyage ends early next year). The union spent an added $1.8 million refurbishing the ship as a floating museum. Workers decorated the Global Mariner's enormous holds with flags from "convenience" countries.
They covered the bare steel walls with billboard-sized pictures depicting what it says are the legacies of such fleets: abandoned or unpaid sailors, increased shipwrecks, maimed seamen, cockroach-covered food in a ship's galley. ("A seafarers menu," the caption states). In one hold, a film shows real footage from shipwrecks on flag-of-convenience vessels. Sirens blare as rescuers pull passengers' corpses from the sea. A man grabs a child by the hair and hauls him into the boat like a drowned seal pup.
The Global Mariner set out last summer on an 18-month voyage to take its message to the world. Its campaign will cost an estimated $9 million, money that comes from fees that shipping companies pay for union members, Captain Jurgens said.
The show has drawn crowds in ports ranging from Reykjavik, Iceland, to Vladivostok, with more than 300,000 visitors coming on board so far. In Vladivostok alone, 14,983 people came aboard during a four-day stay. (The Global Mariner belly-flopped, however, in New York in October: Only 100 visitors came aboard.)
The images of sailors sharing food with cockroaches can be particularly poignant in a port city like Vladivostok, where thousands of unpaid sailors work and scores of families have relatives who are stranded on vessels abroad. Maxim Pechevisty and Konstantin Strokin, both 21, are students at the Marine Academy, and they went through the Global Mariner's display twice, transfixed by the grim images of life at sea.
"This shows the real conditions aboard the ships under flags of convenience," Mr. Pechevisty said. "We have come across such problems ourselves."
Several crew members have sailed on Greenpeace vessels in the past, and the Global Mariner has employed similar tactics. The ship uses a high-powered projector to beam slogans onto ships run by owners it criticizes. In Louisiana the crew hung a 20-by-40-foot banner criticizing the United States Navy because of a union dispute at a shipyard in New Orleans.
But while shaming the Navy may cheer union members on the Mississippi Delta, Russia, with its crippled economy and fathomless corruption, is not so easily moved by the appearance of a union ship armed with a high-beam projector.
In the case of the Lakhta, the crew has not been able to figure out just who owes them the wages. After it docked in February, the seafarers tried to sue the Dellner Shipping Company of Vladivostok, which chartered the Lakhta from the Seattle-based Caribbean Maritime, for $82,423 in back wages.
Dellner, which took over the vessel in December, says it has paid its share -- 40 days' worth -- and the previous charter operator owes the rest.
When the dispute went to court, a judge threw out the sailors' case. On March 16, the court, at Dellner's request, sent a bailiff accompanied by 13 gunmen in black masks marching on board. Snipers scaled the masts, and the gunmen threatened the crew with Kalashnikov rifles, said a cook, Marina Popova, 36, and other crew members who were there. A Lakhta sailor managed to throw a matchbox onto the ship next door with a note begging for help.
After a lawyer and a television crew showed up, the gunmen left.
The union's Vladivostok inspector is representing the crew, and the Global Mariner donated boxes of food and invited the Lakhta seafarers over for dinner. (Ms. Popova declined the invitation; she was ashamed that the Lakhta was too poor to return the hospitality for the foreign seafarers.) When Russian border guards refused the foreigners access to the boat, the Global Mariner crew hopped a fence to check on their comrades.
The crew of the Lakhta was hoping the arrival of the Global Mariner would change their situation by drawing attention to their plight. But then the British ship sailed from port on May 3, and the Lakhta crew watched her go from their mooring in front of a heap of scrap metal on a pier in the commercial seaport.
Captain Jurgens, the Global Mariner's skipper, said he expected the Lakhta to eventually sink at its anchorage. But Mikhail Plyushchakov, Dellner's general director, remained optimistic that the Lakhta would again ply the Sea of Japan under the flag of Belize.
"We'll get a new crew on board," he said. "We'll fix all the problems port inspectors tell us to fix. And we will sail again."

HEADLINE: WAITING FOR RICHES: A special report.;
Living Off the Daily Dream Of Winning a Lottery Prize

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY

DATELINE: ORANGE, N.J., May 21

 BODY:
Inside Home Dairy, a sliver of a store that sells candy, cigarettes and newspapers here, people mill around all day searching for phantom riches: writing down numbers and scratching tickets in a nonstop frenzy that amounts to $14,400 in average weekly lottery sales.
Despite the store's name, only a few cartons of milk are sold each day. More customers come looking for "dream books," which sell for $3 to $5 and offer advice on what lottery numbers should be associated with a dream or daily occurrence. If a person dreams about a cat, one book advises, the number to play is 114. If the cat is black, the number is 244. And if a person buys a hat, the book recommends 815 or 816. 
 Standing in the store one evening, Dennis Dutton, a 36-year-old custodian who bets on numbers every day, explained how important a lottery jackpot was to his financial planning. Throughout the month, Mr. Dutton said, he intended to bet $15 each day on the number 898. At the time, his telephone was disconnected and he was hoping that hitting the number -- for winnings of about $2,750 -- would help pay his bills.
"I wish that 898 would come out," he said, "because it would solve all my problems." (It did not.)
In this working-class neighborhood, 18 miles west of Manhattan, as in similar areas across the country, the state-sponsored daily lottery is becoming so deeply woven into so many lives that it is a part of the social fabric. It is a pastime more popular than baseball, a ritual as routine as watching the nightly news, a practice far more common than voting.
With lottery machines as prevalent as cash registers in the 38 states with lotteries, instant-win tickets hanging behind store counters everywhere, and $35 billion bet each year across the country, the most prevalent purveyor of betting games in America is no longer the street corner sports bookmaker or the Las Vegas casino operator.
Instead, it is the state governments -- the same entities that for years outlawed gambling -- that are now leading the way in building widespread acceptance of gambling across the country. The impact that state lotteries are having on communities around the country has also been a focus of the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, appointed in 1996 by President Clinton and Congress to examine the social and economic consequences of legalized gambling in the United States.
The commission, which in June is scheduled to release a report of its two-year study, is expected to recommend that state lotteries curtail their advertising in economically distressed communities and that they be required to contribute some of their revenues to research and treatment for problem gambling.
It is in communities like Orange where the lottery is a dominant force and many poor and modest-income residents are devoted to an endless search for winning numbers and an unswerving belief that a jackpot waits for them.
 
The Players
The Best Customers Can Least Afford It
A close look at Orange and a computer analysis of lottery playing in New Jersey by The New York Times provide a compelling picture of just how vital the people who live and work in cities like this one are to the lottery business.
Far more than previously known, modest-wage earners, the poor and less educated people spend a greater percentage of their income on the lottery than do wealthier New Jersey residents, the Times analysis found.
Using 1998 New Jersey State Lottery data, the analysis found that in the ZIP codes where people with the lowest incomes live, the amount spent per $10,000 of income on lottery tickets was more than five times the amount spent on tickets by people who live in wealthier ZIP codes. The analysis was calculated from information on 48,875 lottery winners and estimates based on census data.
It found that for a chance to cash in on an instant-win scratch ticket, people living in the 100 lowest average-income ZIP codes in New Jersey spent $53 per $10,000 of their earnings. But in the 100 ZIP codes with the highest-average income, spending on instant-win tickets was just $12 per $10,000.
And for the Pick 4 game, which can pay as much as $2,788 for a 50-cent bet on the correct four numbers and which is one of the state's most popular games, people in the 100 lowest-income ZIP codes spent $29 per $10,000 income, compared with $5 per $10,000 income in the 100 highest-income ZIP codes.
In New Jersey, people who are less educated also spend far more money playing the lottery. In the ZIP codes with the lowest percentage of people with college educations, people spent more than five times as much per $10,000 of income than those in areas with the highest proportion of college-educated population.
The analysis is consistent with those in other states that have shown that as a percentage of household income, poorer people in cities and rural areas alike, spend much more on the lottery than do people in high-income brackets. Living from paycheck to paycheck, they are easily captured by the notion that the lottery can fulfill their basic financial goals.
And while these customers put far more money into the lottery, there is little evidence that they get more back.
The spread of lotteries nationally was propelled largely by the politically palatable promise to use the proceeds to help finance education. People might lose their money, the reasoning went, but they can feel all right about it knowing that it is going to a good cause.
In New Jersey, as in many other states, however, the proceeds from the lottery go to the state treasurer. Although those lottery dollars are indeed used to augment educational spending, studies have shown that lotteries have not increased the net amount spent on education but have only given the states a larger pool from which to allocate those funds. And areas of the state where large percentages of lottery revenues are generated do not receive a proportional amount of state aid in return.
"With all the money we spend on the lottery," Orange's Mayor, Mimms Hackett Jr. said, "I think we would be in much better shape if it was equated with the amount we get from the state."
Mary Lou Murphy, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Taxation, said that although the games might take a larger proportion of income from poorer people, playing was voluntary.
"The state does not usurp rights and privileges based on economic status," Ms. Murphy said. "Their chances of winning may not be very good, but it's an exciting thing."
 
The Numbers
So Many Chances, So Many Ways
The statistics come to life here in Orange, where up and down Main Street and all along the thoroughfares that intersect the city's thriving business district, the state lottery's familiar green and yellow four-leaf-clover logo is pasted on windows.
On some days, a local storefront psychic adviser hangs a sign out offering "lucky numbers." And each day inside a check-cashing store, customers line up in front of one teller to cash their payroll and Social Security checks, and then move a few steps to another teller to buy instant scratch tickets and daily lottery numbers.
With its ubiquitous advertisements and tickets on sale all around them, the lottery is always right there -- whispering in their ears, reminding them that it only takes one lucky drawing to finance their retirement, cover college expenses for their children, or buy the house they have always wanted.
"You notice in urban areas, there are a lot of people who have not made it to the top by a certain age," Mayor Hackett said. "The lottery becomes the only outlet for that dream. Success for a lot of people is predicated on hitting the number."
The numbers underscore the significant role that the lottery plays in Orange. New Jersey, where the median household income is $55,209, has 8.1 million residents and 6,000 lottery outlets -- about 1 lottery machine for every 1,350 residents.
But Orange, where the median household income is $37,529, has 30,000 residents and 33 stores selling lottery tickets, or about 1 machine for every 909 residents. And while weekly per capita lottery sales are $3.92 statewide, they are $6.87 in Orange.
With a population that is 70 percent black, 20 percent white and 10 percent Hispanic, the City of Orange Township, as this urban-suburban municipality is formally named, has homes that range from old, well-kept mansions to aging two-family frame houses and daunting public housing complexes. Bus drivers, office workers, nurses, police officers and janitors are among those who regularly line up for lottery tickets here.
In addition to the daily three-digit and four-digit drawings, residents buy tickets for a five-digit drawing that is held three days a week, a six-digit drawing held twice a week and a once-weekly matching game with 21 sets of four numbers.
Even more popular are the dozens of types of colorful instant lottery tickets, which sell so briskly that lottery officials have begun putting them in automatic vending machines and marketing them as special-occasion gifts -- with decorative envelopes and names like "Happy Birthday" and "Merry Money."
At the Majestic Barber Shop, where haircuts cost $10, all three barbers play the numbers every day. Between customers, one barber, Hilliard Kelly, runs to the corner deli to buy instant tickets. Mr. Kelly buys about four tickets a day at $1 to $2 each and spends about $10 on the daily number.
"I come out behind," he said, sitting in his barber chair, using a coin to scratch a ticket called 50 Grand. (It was a loser.) "But I keep going back. Once you get used to playing those rub-offs, it's hard to walk in a store with money in your pocket and not buy one."
 
The Players
A Way of Life For One Couple
Among the many people who play every day are Emmett and Mary Newsome. A full-time local bus driver by night, Mrs. Newsome spends her days operating the Top Chef restaurant, serving takeout soul food like pork chops smothered in gravy, collard greens, peach cobbler and sweet potato pie.
Mrs. Newsome has played the lottery for more than 20 years, spending about $12 a day each week to play numbers that correspond with family birthdays, home addresses or whatever might catch her attention.
"We play the lottery all the time," she said, standing behind the counter of the sparsely decorated restaurant.
Although she has never tallied her total losses against her winnings, she said she believed she had come out ahead.
"There's nothing like the lottery," she said. "You can always make a little money from that."
Mrs. Newsome is now seeking something that she is certain will increase her business: a lottery machine. She has applied to the state to become a ticket agent, and her application is pending. Agents receive 5 percent of their ticket sales.
Mr. Newsome, who works at a nearby powder-coating plant, applying protective coatings to metal products, has developed his own system of tracking past winning numbers to determine patterns.
In a ritual that is performed in the family's house each morning, Mr. Newsome rises at 4:30 A.M., puts on his robe and walks downstairs to the kitchen. After turning on a pot of water for his coffee, he sits at the table and in front of him he places several memo pads and worn file cards that have hundreds of three-digit numbers written on them.
Painstakingly, Mr. Newsome creates charts based on factors like which hostess on television picks the numbers on which day of the week. (New Jersey holds a lottery drawing every day except Christmas.)
Although the drawing is random, Mr. Newsome is convinced that there is a pattern.
"I see here that 994 has come out three times on Sunday," he said as he sat down to make his selections one recent Sunday morning. Lighting a cigarette and scooping four heaping tablespoons of sugar into a large mug of coffee, he predicted, "I think that 994 is going to come back today." (It did not.)
Based on the information he compiles each morning, he writes down his 20 favorite numbers for the day, and leaves a copy on the table for his wife. She decides which ones she will play.
It is hard to tally how much the Newsomes spend or win, because in addition to the game itself, there is a little gamesmanship between the two. A couple of months ago, Mrs. Newsome played one of the numbers her husband had suggested and she won more than $300. When Mr. Newsome asked her whether she had played it, she said no.
"I know he's hitting a lot of times and ain't saying nothing to me," she said.
Last June, according to Mr. Newsome's day planner, the couple won on four consecutive days, for a total of more than $1,000. "That was a good week," Mr. Newsome said. But throughout most of two months early this year, the Newsomes were playing every day and were not having any luck.
By the middle of one month, Mr. Newsome was growing anxious.
"We could sure use the money," he said one evening as he walked up to the counter at Home Dairy and played 172, 578, 198, and 574. (They were all losers; the winning three-digit number that evening was 416.)
 
The Suspicions
Black Winners, White Winners
Despite their devotion to the lottery, many players in Orange say they believe that the state lottery is rigged. While they have no proof, they constantly complain that most winners of big Pick 6 Lotto jackpots come from areas that are predominantly white.
"Most of the time when I win on rub-offs," said Mr. Kelly, the barber, "I bought my ticket from a white neighborhood."
Virginia E. Haines, executive director of the New Jersey state lottery, sighs with frustration when she hears of such suspicions. Everywhere Ms. Haines goes in the state, she said in an interview at her Trenton office, people complain that the big winners never come from their own region.
In fact, statistics show that the number of big winners from a particular region is commensurate with the number of tickets sold in that region. For example, Essex and Hudson Counties are among the those with the highest amount of lottery sales in the state. And since 1996, those two counties are tied for the most Pick 6 Lotto winners, at 14 each.
Furthermore, Ms. Haines said, the Lotto numbers are selected randomly, and the instant tickets are dispersed in a manner assuring that the winning tickets are randomly distributed. Still, even among the most experienced lottery players, the criticism persists.
"They don't put the Lotto winners in the black areas and they can't convince me otherwise," Myra Russell asserted, speaking of the "quick picks," in which a player lets a computer select the numbers.
Nevertheless, Ms. Russell, who lives in Orange, has played the New Jersey lottery since it became computerized in 1975. Back then, she worked at an Orange liquor store, operating the lottery machine every day.
"I started with them and I know," she said as she bought her daily tickets inside a local check-cashing store. "To me, the New Jersey lottery is a big joke," she snapped -- all the while stuffing her tickets into her pocket.
Although modern-day lotteries have been legal in New Jersey for just 29 years, people in and around Orange were betting on illegal lotteries long before that. As in many other poor and working-class cities around the country, the illegal numbers, which were known as policy, had flourished for decades. People could play for pennies, and the daily three-digit number was determined by the total amount of money bet at a specified horse race track that day.
Until whites began moving out in the 1970's, Orange was largely populated by working-class people of Italian and Irish descent, and John J. Kunz, an Orange native and general manager of Town Check Cashing, said, "Everybody played the number."
Mary Lou Williams, who operates the lottery machine at Town Check Cashing and who formerly owned Home Dairy, said many of her customers had been buying lottery tickets from her for more than two decades.
"We used to have a lot of fun selling tickets," Ms. Williams said. "Now it's much more serious. People are determined they're going to win."
Ms. Williams does not make as much money from lottery sales as she once did because more ticket outlets are in the area.
"Nowadays I'm like a spider in a web," she said. "There's one on every corner."
 
The Jackpot
One City Awaits A Big Winner
While there may be plenty of places to play the lottery in this city, finding someone who has actually won a big jackpot is not as easy. When asked whether they could provide any big winners from Orange, lottery officials said they had winners in surrounding areas, but none who had actually bought their tickets in Orange.
Photocopies of winning tickets are prominently displayed above the counter at Home Dairy, but based on the serial numbers on the winning tickets, they were sold at stores elsewhere in the state.
One recent evening, Stanley Micheaux, 69, who uses part of his twice-monthly disability payments to play the numbers each day, gazed skeptically at the winners pasted up inside Home Dairy.
"I mean, how long have those things been up there?" Mr. Micheaux asked. "They make us think we're going to win, but we ain't going to win a lot of money."
Mr. Micheaux's wife, Margaret, who is 59, retired and also a daily player, is more sanguine. "I play because I think I'm going to win," she said.
By 7:55 P.M. that day, Mr. Micheaux, who has lived in Orange for more than 25 years, was in front of the television set just as he is every day at the same time.
"Stan, turn to Channel 23!" his wife yelled into the living room, reminding him that it was time for the daily lottery drawing.
While at Home Dairy, Mr. Micheaux had bought a "Happy Birthday" instant ticket (it was a loser) and bet $1 on 059 -- adding a zero to his home address just as he does each day -- and $1 on 5723. (Both were losers.)
 
The Hopes
A Possible Jackpot Is Always Present
When Emmett Newsome pulls his number-covered file cards from his wallet, the first thing a person notices is the dirt on the cards, and then his hands. The skin is dry and cracked, his fingertips are covered with a greasy film.
They are the hands of a man who labors for a living, and Mr. Newsome, who is 54, hopes that one day he will win a big lottery jackpot and be able to wash his hands of the more than 20 years he has worked at metal-coating plants.
Raised in the tough Howard Street area of Newark, he has been involved in the daily numbers since he was a boy working as a "runner," picking up betting slips for his "Uncle Soldier," who ran an illegal numbers racket.
Mrs. Newsome, 51, has been a bus driver for New Jersey Transit for 20 years, and whether the couple win a big lottery prize or not, she plans for them eventually to retire from their jobs, sell the restaurant and move to her native South Carolina. Her only misgiving about returning to South Carolina is that the state has no lottery.
"It's a shame they don't have a lottery because people need to have some way to try to make a little extra money," she said.
On April 7, however, legislation in South Carolina moved a step closer to allowing voters to decide in 2000 on whether to establish a lottery.
The couple's 15-year-old daughter, Monique, struggles to understand her parents' obsession with the lottery.
"I mean, I know that sometimes you win, but you also lose," she said.
She thinks that her parents play the lottery too much.
"My father, if he has a little money left over, he plays his Pick-Its," she said. "And I tell my mother not to play, and then after she loses she says, 'Oh, I should've listened to you.' "
On a Saturday, Mr. Newsome followed his regular routine. Among the numbers that he bet on that day was a family favorite, 703, a combination of the home address. It was also the winning number that evening, paying Mr. Newsome $262.50 -- enough to keep him playing for another month.

Chart: "Spending on the Lottery in New Jersey"
 
An analysis by The New York Times of lottery spending in New Jersey found that people who live in the state's lowest-income ZIP code areas spend more than five times as much of their income on lottery tickets as do people who live in the highest-income ZIP code areas. For example, in the 100 lowest-income ZIP code areas, spending on the lottery game known as Pick 4 was $29 per $10,000 of annual income. But in the 100 highest-income ZIP code areas, the amount spent on Pick 4 was less than $5 per $10,000 of annual income. And for instant-win scratch-off tickets, the amount spent in the 100 lowest-income ZIP codes was $46 per $10,000 of annual income, compared to $10 per $10,000 of annual income in the 100 highest-income ZIP codes.
 The Times also found that when lottery revenue is analyzed along with other tax revenues that the state receives, low-income people -- through their lottery spending -- close the tax burden gap between themselves and wealthy people. For example, for every $10,000 of annual income earned in lower income areas, $108 is spent on income taxes, while $111 is spent on the lottery. But in wealthier areas, for every $10,000 of annual income earned, $319 goes to income taxes, while just $25 goes to lottery spending. FORD FESSENDEN
 
Low-income areas pay less than high-income areas in property taxes and income taxes per $10,000 of income. But when it comes to the lottery, New Jersey's fourth-largest source of revenue, the trend is reversed: lower-income areas spend more.
 
There are nearly twice as many outlets selling lottery tickets in the lowest-income areas than in the highest-income areas.
 
HOW THE ANALYSIS WAS DONE
The New York Times study of lottery spending was based on data derived from 48,875 people who won at least $600 in 1998 playing one of five games: Pick 4, Jersey Cash 5, Pick 6 Lotto, Lotzee, and Instant-Win. Data on people who won less than $600 on any of the games is not available because those winners are not required to provide personal information such as name and address. A sixth game, known as Pick 3, is one of the lottery's most popular games -- especially in low-income areas -- according to lottery experts. But data for Pick 3 are not included because most winners receive less than $600.
 In the analysis, each winner indicates a certain amount of money spent on the games. For instance, each person who won the Pick 6 Lotto in 1998 represent 2/3ed $45,000 in betting. Because winners should be a random sample of players, The Times was able to estimate the amount of play in each ZIP code.

HEADLINE: Halt in Pay For Legislators Ruled Invalid

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 21

 BODY:
A Brooklyn judge ruled today that a new law withholding state legislators' pay until a budget is passed is unconstitutional. His decision dealt a blow to an attempt to speed the state's notoriously lethargic budget process.
Gov. George E. Pataki and Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer said they would appeal the ruling. Both camps in the case have agreed that the ruling will not take effect while an appeal is pending, so the legislators may not see new paychecks for months. 
 The 211 members of the Assembly and the Senate have not been paid since March 31, the last day of the old fiscal year, and some say they are beginning to have financial trouble. "Let's just say that my landlord is happy at the thought of my getting paid again," said Senator Thomas K. Duane of Manhattan, one of 14 legislators, all Democrats, who sued to challenge the law.
The plaintiffs took heart from the strongly worded decision by Justice Richard D. Huttner of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. He found that the law gives the Governor a coercive power over the Legislature that curbs its power and independence, in violation of the State Constitution.
"When even one legislator, by dint of economic circumstance, is coerced into passing a budget that may require him or her to sacrifice conscientiously held beliefs, then the entire process is tainted," Justice Huttner wrote.
As a sideshow, the question of withholding pay has threatened to drown out the main attraction. The state budget is 51 days overdue, there are no serious negotiations under way, and the Republicans who control the Senate and the Democrats who run the Assembly are blaming each other for the lack of progress. Republicans say Democrats have dawdled, pinning their hopes on the court case, while Democrats have accused the Governor of waiting for them to crumble under the pressure of working unpaid for months.
In the icy atmosphere of the Capitol, where even civil talk among the powers has become rare, the dispute has deepened the animosity between Mr. Pataki, who continues to collect his pay, and the Assembly Democrats, including the Speaker, Sheldon Silver. It has heightened tensions between Mr. Silver, who did not take part in the suit but looked favorably on it, and the Senate's Republican majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, who proposed the law withholding pay.
Mr. Pataki has proposed a $72.7 billion budget, while the Assembly Democrats want to spend $2 billion to $4 billion more, and the Senate Republicans' plan falls between the other two proposals.
Cases turning on constitutional issues can sometimes be appealed directly to the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, bypassing the Appellate Division, but it is unclear whether that will happen in this case.
Justice Huttner ruled that the withholding law, known as Chapter 635, violated both the separation of legislative and executive powers implicit in the State Constitution, and an explicit provision barring any change in a legislator's pay during a two-year term.
"Chapter 635 flies in the face of that prohibition," he wrote. "By enacting Chapter 635, those legislators who voted in favor improvidently and unconstitutionally incapacitated the Legislature from performing its duty as a representative body. The natural and intended consequence of Chapter 635 is to coerce passage of a timely budget by the infliction of personal financial hardship upon some legislators."
Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried of Manhattan, who has taken the lead in the suit, said: "The court's analysis is quite plain, and doesn't leave much room for argument. I know we're not going to get paid, but I'm very pleased."
Mr. Silver could not be reached by telephone because he was observing the Jewish holiday of Shabuoth.
Mr. Bruno issued a statement saying: "This entire issue can be easily resolved by passing a budget. It is long past time that the Assembly join with the Senate and the Governor in adopting a prudent, responsible budget."
Zenia Mucha, Mr. Pataki's communications director, expressed confidence that the law would be upheld. The plaintiffs' pursuit of the case, she said, "proves that they're not interested in doing the people's business, only in getting paid."
The withholding law was rooted in the legislators' desire for a pay raise, which Mr. Pataki had opposed for years. In December, he relented and signed a bill increasing state elected officials' salaries by 38 percent. Legislators now earn $79,500 a year, plus stipends for leadership and committee positions that raise the average close to $90,000. The Governor earns $179,500. But Mr. Pataki insisted that a withholding law be part of the price the Legislature would pay for his agreement to the raise.
Last month, 11 Assembly and Senate Democrats who had voted against the law, and 3 who first took office in January, after it was enacted, sued to overturn it. Many Republican legislators are sympathetic to their cause but have not spoken out, unwilling to risk the ire of Mr. Bruno, Mr. Pataki or the public. And some lawmakers in both parties voted for the law, believing that it would be struck down in court.
The paychecks are being held in a safe. They can be released only by agreement of the State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, a Democrat, and the State Department of Taxation and Finance, controlled by the Governor.
In light of today's ruling and the fact that no appeal has yet been filed, Mr. McCall authorized release of the checks. Mr. Silver's office sent the Pataki administration a request for their release, which aides to the Speaker conceded was an empty exercise. Ms. Mucha said the checks would remain in the safe.

BURLINGTON NORTHERN IS MAKING MOVES TO CUT COSTS

BYLINE: Reuters

 BODY:
The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation, the second- largest United States railroad, said yesterday that it was slashing a total of 1,400 jobs, cutting capital spending and naming a new president as part of a plan to improve profits. The railroad said the moves were aimed at cutting costs because revenues are slipping below levels a year ago. Some 400, or about 7 percent, of the railroad's salaried positions are scheduled for elimination by the end of the second quarter, and 1,000 hourly union positions will be eliminated by the end of 1999. The Fort Worth-based Burlington Northern has about 39,000 hourly union employees. Shares of Burlington Northern fell $1.4375, to $33.50.

HEADLINE: Vacation Spots in New York Suddenly Appeal to Clintons

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
President Clinton, as he is fond of reminding everyone from time to time, cannot run again for re-election, which frees him from certain political calculations. One of these, you would think, would be where to spend his summer vacation, a decision that in the past has been so fraught with image-conscious polling that he twice went off to Wyoming just to please environmentalists when he really wanted to go back to Martha's Vineyard.
Now, with his wife edging closer to running for the Senate from New York, the summer vacation is still in the balance. And although Administration officials caution that a final decision may be dozens of permutations away, one thing seems likely: It will be in New York. 
 The First Couple for the first time in their lives, these officials say, are exploring the recreational options across the state. The choices have apparently narrowed, they say, to the Adirondacks or Shelter Island, although Marsha Berry, the First Lady's spokeswoman, was noncommittal.
"I don't know that you can narrow it down to two, or rule out Martha's Vineyard," Ms. Berry said. She noted that the Clintons were planning a five-day Florida vacation next week, where Mrs. Clinton will focus on deciding whether to run for the Senate. "That's as far as they're planning, in terms of vacation," Ms. Berry said. The annual vacation decision, she said, "is one of the hardest things to pin them down on."
Other officials say the Adirondacks and Shelter Island are under close study. Both spots, at different ends of the state, make two entirely different political statements, and have their own drawbacks.
The rustic Adirondacks, spread across six million acres in northern New York, make a nice setting for the outdoorsy look. But the area is remote and short on the kind of socializing that the Clintons favor.
It may be telling that when one Administration official was asked whether the Clintons might pick the Adirondacks, his first response was: "How far is that from New York City?"
Answer: Too far for dinner.
Shelter Island, tucked between Long Island's North and South Forks, is quaint -- it has no traffic lights -- while still easily accessible to the Hamptons and its trunks of campaign cash. But constant shuttling to Steven Spielberg's estate could suggest a certain elitism that Mrs. Clinton, if she runs for the Senate, would probably want to avoid.
Dick Morris, the former White House consultant, in the past has steered the Clintons toward places that have an appeal to middle-class families -- i.e., the suburban swing voters who frequently decide elections.
It was Mr. Morris who convinced the Clintons in 1995 and 1996 to drop Martha's Vineyard and head for Jackson Hole, Wyo.
As he writes in his memoir, "Behind the Oval Office," (Random House, 1997) Mr. Morris, with the help of pollster Mark Penn and an elaborately refined polling grid, found out that people whose votes are up for grabs tend to like baseball, hiking, camping and technology.
"I urged that he take a mountain vacation, that he hike and camp out in a tent" and publicize the high-tech gear he was using, Mr. Morris wrote, admitting that he was carrying his belief in polling to "a mindless extreme."
"Clinton was not happy," Mr. Morris continued, asking him whether, for example, if he wore a baseball cap he could still go golfing. "What if I hike, set up my campsite and go fishing but I don't catch anything?" an irked President pestered the consultant.
Despite his irritation, the President and First Lady went to Wyoming, and they did camp and hike. But then, after the President's re-election, they returned to Martha's Vineyard in 1997 and 1998 -- ever nomadic in the summer, having no family retreat like a Kennebunkport or Hyde Park to call home.
Mr. Morris, now widely loathed within the Administration, laughed today when informed of the New York options.
"That's ridiculous," he said, branding their sudden interest in a New York vacation "totally and completely phony." He said that the Adirondacks were "derivative of my advice to go to the Rockies" and that Shelter Island was "derivative of Martha's Vineyard, which is where they really want to go."
On reflection, he thought the Adirondacks would be a better choice than Shelter Island. "Swing voters like camping, hiking and fishing," he said.
While a visit to the woods may have broad appeal, it is unclear whether it would help with the Adirondack locals, who tend to vote heavily Republican. Gerald B. H. Solomon, who represented the Adirondacks in Congress for 20 years before retiring last year, said in an interview today, "The natives would welcome them, but they certainly wouldn't vote for them."
Mr. Solomon said that Mrs. Clinton's advocacy of gun control would be particularly troubling. He received much attention for his forceful denunciation of a gun-control measure in 1996, when he said his wife, who lived alone in Glens Falls while he was in Washington, needed her rifles for protection.
But he also acknowledged that the seasonal Adirondack economy could use a boost from the money a Presidential visit would bring in. "Their entourage would be most welcome," he said.
Wherever the Clintons wind up, they are not likely to bump into Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mrs. Clinton's likely competitor in a Senate race. The Mayor makes a point of not taking vacations.

FREEDOM FROM FEAR
 The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945.
 By David M. Kennedy.
 Illustrated. 936 pp. New York:
 Oxford University Press. $39.95. 
 WHAT remains of the legacy of Franklin Delano Roosevelt? The office of the Presidency is as weak today as it has been in decades. The welfare state is in tatters. Even the once sacrosanct Social Security system is being challenged. With our hostility to government regulation, our Gilded Age reverence for entrepreneurship and our bipartisan devotion to balanced budgets, aren't we all Reaganites now? Didn't the Roosevelt Memorial arrive in Washington about 35 years too late?
David M. Kennedy's "Freedom From Fear" not only gives us the chance to reflect on such questions, it also provides us with an engrossing narrative of a momentous time, the best one-volume account of the Roosevelt era currently available. Part of the outstanding Oxford History of the United States series, it is good old-fashioned history. Kennedy is concerned with the big political, economic and military questions, the large decisions, who made them and why. Dead white males predominate. Not that Kennedy fails to consider minorities and women -- how could he in the years of antilynching-law debates and the Japanese internment, of Eleanor Roosevelt and Rosie the Riveter? -- but these fashionable topics are decidedly secondary to his story. Similarly, American culture, particularly popular culture, is all but ignored. Yet if Kennedy has chosen to do without Jack Benny and Mickey Mouse, Louis Armstrong and Citizen Kane (not to mention William Faulkner, Aaron Copland and Frank Lloyd Wright), he is still able to soldier along with dramatic discussions of the Great Depression, the New Deal, the rise of the totalitarians and World War II. Indeed, with event piling on history-making event, "Freedom From Fear" is, despite its 936-page length, a miracle of compression.
The first surprise here, especially for those raised on Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.'s three volumes on the New Deal, is Kennedy's relatively kind treatment of Herbert Hoover. "To a degree uncommon among Presidents," he says, "Hoover was a reflective man of scholarly bent, even something of a political philosopher." He had made a reputation as a great humanitarian during World War I, and he arrived in the White House in 1929 "the most respected man in America," a progressive Republican who was not afraid to use the powers of government for the public good. After the market crash that heralded the start of the Depression, Hoover pressured businessmen to refrain from cutting wages, and he pushed through a small public works bill as an effort at countercyclical Government spending. Bolder measures like the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which lent taxpayers' money directly to private corporations, followed. If his actions seem cautious today, it is largely because no one appreciated the depth of the crisis at first. Kennedy, who has a genuine talent for plunging the reader into the immediacy of the moment, writes that "down to the last weeks of 1930, Americans could still plausibly assume that they were caught up in yet another of the routine business-cycle downswings that periodically afflicted their traditionally boom-and-bust economy. Their situation was painful but not unfamiliar, and their President was in any case taking unprecedentedly vigorous corrective actions."
Kennedy, the Donald J. McLachlan Professor of History at Stanford University, paints Hoover as an imaginative policy maker "overwhelmed by events," in many ways a precursor to Roosevelt, but often with a better grasp of the economics of the situation. It's a persuasive portrait, but one that shouldn't be pushed too far. Hoover's policies were always aimed primarily at alleviating the problems of business; the great humanitarian could never find it in his heart to support relief for the poor. One has to turn to Schlesinger to read Hoover's damning recollection that "many persons left their jobs for the more profitable one of selling apples," but even Kennedy's summation of Hoover's character goes a long way toward undermining any sympathy one might feel for the man: Hoover, Kennedy observes, had a "maddening tendency to subordinate real human needs to his obsessive desire for ideological consistency."
Hoover's besetting sin was rigidity to the point of callousness. Problems of consistency, even coherence, never bothered Roosevelt. Nobody really knew what to do about the economic disaster blanketing the country, and he was determined simply to act -- even if that meant going off in several directions at once. Kennedy is an expert guide to the alphabet soup that was the New Deal -- the A.A.A., N.R.A., P.W.A., W.P.A., C.C.C., C.W.A., T.V.A. and on and on. One's eyes glaze over just looking at this flood of letters, but as Kennedy recounts the stresses and strains behind the profusion of legislation, he is able to transform otherwise dry, wonkish material into genuine drama.
THE Social Security Act is an example. Not only is it "emblematic of the very meaning of the New Deal," Kennedy writes, but no act better reveals "the tangled skein of human needs, economic calculations, idealistic visions, political pressures, partisan maneuverings, actuarial projections and constitutional constraints out of which Roosevelt was obliged to weave his reform program." Every aspect of the Social Security bill was a compromise among impossible alternatives. How would Social Security be financed? Would benefits be uniform? What should be done about the retirees who were going to start receiving payouts almost immediately but had contributed little or nothing to the system? Many of the questions that troubled the framers of the law are with us once more, and one comes away from Kennedy's description of their work with an admiration for their legislative creativity, even their artistry.
The New Deal had pretty much come to an end by 1938 (the Fair Labor Standards Act of that year was the last major piece of legislation), and Kennedy pauses midway through his book to offer an assessment. Despite appearances, and despite the conclusions of many historians, he says, there was method in Roosevelt's madness, an underlying consistency to the seeming chaos. He stresses that the New Deal never did end the Depression or significantly redistribute income, but it provided Americans with a security they had never known before -- job security, life-cycle security, financial security, market security." For all the present talk about the undiluted virtues of the market, the Roosevelt Administration embedded the Federal Government in the lives of all of us, and it is not going to go away. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, by safeguarding savings, has ended the sorry history of bank runs. The Wagner Act has brought a semblance of order, and a reduction of violence, to labor relations. The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened up the stock market to millions of small investors. The Federal Housing Administration and Fannie Mae have enabled a majority of Americans to become homeowners. Kennedy shrewdly suggests that the New Deal was at its best when it provided greater access to the benefits of a more stable, "devolatilized" capitalism, and at its worst, as in the grotesque National Recovery Administration, when it tried to stifle the marketplace with a leaden, price-fixing bureaucracy. But the issue is not one of government or no government, regulation or no regulation. That question has been settled. Ever since Roosevelt, Kennedy concludes, "Americans assumed that the Federal Government had not merely a role, but a major responsibility, in insuring the health of the economy and the welfare of citizens. That simple but momentous shift in perception was the newest thing in all the New Deal, and the most consequential too."
The Roosevelt era divided neatly in two, and so does "Freedom From Fear," with the first half concentrating on domestic issues, the second half on foreign affairs and war. Kennedy takes an expansive view of World War II, showing us heroism aplenty but also much cowardice and incompetence. We are a long way from John Wayne movies. Battlefield atrocities, Kennedy points out, were committed by both sides, increasing as the months and years of bloodletting went on and an inevitable coarsening set in. America's military commanders were wise and unwise, able and less than able, admirable and quasi-criminal. Kennedy never fails to lob a grenade or two whenever Gen. Douglas MacArthur crosses his pages; "fatuous" is one of his kinder adjectives. As for the Allied leaders, in Kennedy's telling they differed just about as much as they agreed: Roosevelt and Churchill quarreled about the future of Britain's colonies; Stalin and Roosevelt persistently pushed for a second front, which Churchill just as persistently resisted; Roosevelt and Churchill first worried that Russia was going to lose the war and then, after the Soviet victory at Stalingrad, that it was going to win; de Gaulle drove Roosevelt up the wall, and nobody took Chiang Kai-shek seriously. Kennedy's powers of compression tend to fail him in his battle descriptions, particularly with regard to the Pacific -- they are too cursory, and seem to lack weight -- but he has a nice eye for detail. One of his best stories (worth rehearing, even for those who know it) concerns the role of Navajo Indians in the Marine Signal Corps. The Navajo language had a complex syntax and no alphabet. It was understood by fewer than three dozen non-Navajos in the world, none of them Japanese. Navajo marines were able to transmit "coded" messages across the Pacific merely by talking to one another in their native tongue. In a conflict in which the breaking of codes was an invaluable weapon, this was, Kennedy reports, "one of the war's most secure communications systems."
If there is a single idea about World War II that one is likely to take from "Freedom From Fear," it is that the United States prevailed because of its astounding productive capacity. This is a theme that Kennedy returns to again and again. Even before the war, the imbalance was telling: during the Depression year of 1937, Americans produced 4.8 million cars, while the Germans were producing 331,000 cars and the Japanese 26,000. Once the war and Federal deficit spending sent American industry into high gear, the numbers became crushing. By 1945, the United States was turning out 88,410 tanks to Germany's 44,857; 299,293 aircraft to Japan's 69,910. American bases in England, Kennedy says, were "oases of abundance": the G.I.'s had "more of everything," even toilet paper (the American ration was 22.5 sheets per man per day, compared with the British ration of 3 sheets). Most striking of all, perhaps, were the figures on civilian consumption over the course of the war. In Germany, personal consumption fell by 20 percent, in Japan by 26 percent, in Britain by 22 percent. But in the United States, consumption rose by more than 12 percent. America, "alone among all the combatant societies, enjoyed guns and butter too -- and both of them in unrivaled quantities."
SUCH statistics may be the key to Kennedy's account of the war, but for sheer drama, nothing can top his pages describing how a basically isolationist nation entered the war in the first place. They are the high point of "Freedom From Fear." It is here, too, that one confronts Roosevelt's most profound wartime legacy.
The story is gripping. By 1935, Roosevelt had come to realize that Hitler represented a threat, not only to the United States but to Western civilization itself. Yet at the same time the country was becoming increasingly isolationist, and in that year Congress passed the first of five neutrality acts, forbidding American arms assistance to either side in a conflict, and tying the President in "a straitjacket that rendered the United States effectively powerless in the face of the global conflagration that was about to explode." Over the next six years Roosevelt schemed and plotted to get aid to the British and French. He operated secretly, even duplicitously. He stretched the law and conceivably risked impeachment. Many of his most influential advisers were against him -- the Secretary of War; the Secretary of the Navy; George C. Marshall, the Army Chief of Staff. They argued that arms for the Europeans meant fewer arms for the Americans, and a potentially weaker national defense. What if the United States was forced to stand alone? It was all a colossal gamble, and as Roosevelt told one of his confidants, "I might guess wrong, and it is nothing more than a guess." There were times when the pressures on him must have been close to unendurable. During the 1940 campaign, Roosevelt was called a warmonger by the Republican Presidential candidate, Wendell Willkie, by Charles Lindbergh, by the powerful labor leader John L. Lewis. The isolationists contended that the President was provoking a war, and the truth is that they proved to be correct, though when war came, it traveled across the Pacific rather than the Atlantic.
But the isolationists were right only in the narrowest sense. In terms of the large picture, they were totally, woefully wrong, and it does not seem an overstatement to say that Roosevelt's greatest achievement, the action of his that changed history for the good more than any other, was his decision to engage with Europe and steer his country toward war (which is different from saying, as some of his enemies did, that he got the country into war). This was an achievement that, in effect, exists outside of America's social and political institutions. It rests on the insight and wisdom of a single individual, and its meaning is ambiguous at best. One can readily imagine a brooding Lyndon Johnson sitting in the Oval Office 25 years later, wading deeper into the mire of Vietnam and consoling himself with thoughts of his hero Roosevelt, the interventionist, the forceful Chief Executive, the "warmonger." (Sometimes, those who learn from history are doomed to try to repeat it.) Nor is it sufficient to argue that Roosevelt was right and Johnson was wrong, that Hitler was a threat to the national interest and Ho Chi Minh was not, for the policies that Roosevelt was pursuing were never entirely under his control. The imponderables were too great. Britain might have fallen, as France did. Germany might not have declared war on the United States after Pearl Harbor, leaving the country to fight the "wrong war." This is why Kennedy can have it both ways and state that the President "acted with remarkable boldness -- or with wanton recklessness." In the end, Roosevelt was tossing the dice for all of us, and he knew it.

Victor Hugo
By Graham Robb. Norton, $19.95.
Victor Hugo was a prodigious literary and political force during his lifetime, and when he died in 1885 his funeral drew two million people. This incisive, myth-penetrating account of the French writer's extravagant life, selected by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 1998, "is both necessary and highly readable, and easily outclasses all existing Hugo biographies in English," Peter France wrote here last year.
 
The Way I Found Her
By Rose Tremain. Washington Square/Pocket Books, $14.
The English novelist assumes the voice of a 13-year-old boy spending a summer in Paris to reveal the fantasies and half-understandings of a precocious intelligence on the verge of adulthood. Praising the author's "superlative storytelling gifts" in these pages last year, Claire Messud called this "a mystery story, a psychological exploration and a novel of ideas." The same publisher has reissued Tremain's previous novel, Sacred Country ($14), which chronicles three decades in the life of a British woman struggling to transform herself into a man, and the large circle of people who witness her coming of age and into being. "Tremain gives us a precisely imagined landscape and a complicated group of characters that we come to care deeply about," Stephen Dobyns wrote here in 1993.
 
The Factory of Facts
By Luc Sante. Vintage Departures, $13.
For the author, who was born in Belgium and raised in New Jersey, the past is "a hypothesis," and he uses his sly autobiography to probe selfhood from many angles, historical and otherwise. "He has a historian's fiendish taste for information, but he has a journalist's wit . . . and love of idiosyncrasy," W. S. Di Piero said here last year.
 
The 13th Valley
By John M. Del Vecchio. St. Martin's Griffin, $14.95.
This gritty first novel by a former combat correspondent focuses on a company of grunts scrambling to survive in Vietnam, and on the day-to-day pain, frustration and exhilaration of their ordeal. "He has made the jungle real and terrifying" and "enabled us to feel what it was like over there," Joe Klein wrote here in 1982.
 
Other Powers: The Age of Suffrage, Spiritualism,
and the Scandalous Victoria Woodhull
By Barbara Goldsmith. Harper Perennial, $16.
A historian chronicles the colorful life and times of the American social reformer Victoria Woodhull -- Presidential candidate, clairvoyant, publisher, stockbroker, jailbird, free lover and world-class oddball. "Her pages swarm with major and minor figures," Richard Brookhiser wrote here in 1998. "She writes with sympathy of the many sufferings her story records." A Century of Women: The History of Women in Britain and the United States in the Twentieth Century, by Sheila Rowbotham (Penguin, $16.95), tracks the parallel battles for women's rights in two nations whose Governments and social policies presented different obstacles. "Throughout 'A Century of Women' . . . there is a sense of real human beings during changing times -- times women helped to change," Naomi Bliven said here last year.
 
The Seville Communion
By Arturo Perez-Reverte.
Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $14.
This thriller's Bond-like hero is a sexy priest dispatched to Seville by the Vatican after someone hacks into the Pope's computer and sends a warning about mysterious goings-on at a crumbling 17th-century church. "Perez-Reverte writes with wit, narrative economy, a sharp eye for the telling detail and a feel for history," Paul Baumann wrote here in 1998.
 
Mayhem: Violence as Public Entertainment
By Sissela Bok. Merloyd Lawrence/Perseus, $13.
The author argues that while media violence seems to heighten fear and aggression -- especially among children -- there are effective defensive strategies. In 1998 our reviewer, Michael Sherry, praised these "brief, nimble . . . evenhanded essays on a subject that often provokes hysterical warnings or cavalier dismissals."
 
Quarantine
By Jim Crace. Picador USA, $13.
An expert re-creator of other times and places turns to the Gospels for inspiration in this strikingly original novel about Christ's 40-day fast in the desert. "The wilderness setting . . . is rendered in obsessive detail," Frank Kermode wrote here last year. "The effect is of an almost hallucinatory concentration."
 
In the Ballpark: The Working Lives of Baseball People
By George Gmelch and J. J. Weiner.
Smithsonian Institution, $14.95.
This backstage account features interviews with groundskeepers, ushers, mascots, umpires and other bit players in the national pastime. The result is "the rare book that can actually make you see a baseball game in a different way," Allen St. John wrote here last year.
 
The Inn at Lake Devine
By Elinor Lipman. Vintage Contemporaries, $12.
This romantic comedy, set in the 1960's, features a teen-age Jewish heroine who is determined at all cost to infiltrate a gentile resort in Vermont. Last year our reviewer, Lore Dickstein, admired the novel's "wry, understated humor." Scott Veale

HEADLINE: Home Is Where the Trip Ends (Usually)

BYLINE: By ROBERT PACKARD; ROBERT PACKARD's trips usually end in New York City or Maine.

 BODY:
A TRIP isn't over till it's over, and over doesn't mean journey's end. The journey begins and ends at your doorstep. The trip is another matter. The trip starts when you first contemplate it, well before you set out. When it's over depends on the traveler.
In my case, the trip is over not when my return flight pulls up to the gate, nor on the drive to my house. Once I'm home, I look around initially with an unmitigated clarity. This extrasensory perception signals the trip's coda. It's a bit of a jolt. The interior of my dwelling -- the walls, the furniture, the floor coverings, the light (or lack of it) -- all appear in unaccustomed sharp outline. 
 I'm looking at my familiar environment as a stranger might view it. I'm seeing myself as a klutz, living in clutter, with serious lacks in both taste and furnishings that, blindsided by routine and sloth, I have avoided rectifying over the years.
But once I take up the mundane activities interrupted by absence -- kick back in that easy chair, grab a beer, turn on the local TV newscast -- the spell induced by the trip dissolves and perception segues into the habitual domestic glaze.
That's when it's over.
The final aria, already dwindling to a humming sound, fades away. That perceptive interlude before it disappears could well be gratifying for many travelers, but not for me. My European journeys, in particular, invite aftermaths of stark insight.
There's always plenty of time on the ride from Kennedy, stalled on the Van Wyck Expressway, to assess my urban environment as a stranger might. O.K., so I don't live in the Tuscan countryside. The Manhattan street on which I live has views of neither the Seine nor the Volga. More to the point, neither the Hudson nor the East River is visible.
The light filtering through the protective gate facing my fire escape is not that of the Aegean. Those table lamps in no way resemble the incandescent fixtures in my upscale Milan hotel. The covering on that sofa in the Paris apartment where I dined recently makes my upholstery this year's candidate for the tacky-in-extremis award.
To get the full impact of this extrasensory vision on returning from a journey, you need only to have placed the familiar details of your home base in the bottom drawer of consciousness along with what might be called the frayed underwear of life.
These revelations hardly rank with a Newtonian discovery, and most people deal with them dismissively. But experiencing them is like looking into a shaving mirror or through a magnifying glass: nothing has altered except intensity.
I try to use the perception to keep a firmer grip on my tendency to aggrandize in memory whatever is distant from my field of vision. Still, I seem unable to learn from experience.
I have a house in northern Maine. In truth, I have two houses, one old, filled with character, impossible to heat and with plumbing that is sporadic at best. The other house began life eight years ago as a garage with sleeping quarters. Now it's a dwelling with a functioning bathroom and a few amenities the old house lacks.
When I arrive at these two houses after a 500-mile trip following a winter in New York City, they are altered. Unlike the capacious country dwellings my imagination has created, I am looking with unimpaired vision at two modest cottages occupied by someone of limited means whose principal architectural concern seems to have been economic.
From what I've told them in advance, guests who arrive for the first time have every right to expect a country estate of formidable dimensions and appointments. What confronts them is a rural backwater between humble and forgettable.
During the first moments of greeting, guests find it hard to confront the host with the accusation that he has misled them, not to say lied outright. "It's somewhat different from what I expected," said my friend Miriam, a professor with a penchant for understatement.
Every winter, when I'm away, the houses get larger, and every spring they get smaller. The land on which they sit has many trees, mostly conifers. But the first spring hike in my woods reveals countless trees that have either fallen or are planning to do so. Next winter, when I'm in Manhattan, they will all rise up again, tall and proudly reaching for the sky.
The precise moment when a trip is over is different for every traveler. Perhaps the most traveled person I know, a celebrated dermatologist, has visited many countries on all continents, lecturing and attending meetings.
"It's easy for me to pinpoint," he told me. "When I return from a trip, I'm compulsive about unpacking and establishing order. After I have everything in my home exactly as if I had not gone away and I get into my own bed that night, the trip is over."
But my friend Doris, when she returned from an inland waterway trip from Moscow to St. Petersburg, had another view.
"Once you narrate the detailed outline of your trip, it's over," she says. "You have converted it into an edited, abridged version, truncated out of shape, longueurs omitted and highlights accentuated. The trip itself becomes rhetoric. Even your memory of it begins to reflect this transformed version. The actual trip no longer exists."
"Trip" is often used for a period of travel with prescribed boundaries. It can be over in the middle of the journey. "When she said that to me," I overheard a woman telling her son on the third day of a two-week cruise, "the trip was over."
Some contend that a trip is never over as long as you can recall it. To some degree that's true, but memory selectively discards and embroiders without your conscious awareness.
In my own case, I have an indistinct recollection of some of the European trips I've taken, at least one every year since the early 60's. Each is different, but there's a metronomic routine to frequent travel. Sanity demands that the journeys dissolve in the memory pool of discarded trivia.
For me, individual trips are over the moment my perception no longer offers the trip's concluding visual acuity. That final occurrence often shows me how lucky I am to be living in material comfort, albeit without the view of the Tuscan hills. Sometimes, it tells me to clean up my act.
I'm better at dealing with the former message.

Andalusian Drives
Q. I'm planning a driving trip in Spain and would like to see Andalusia's White Towns. Can you give me some tips on possible routes? -- Sandy R. Richardson, Seattle
A. The White Towns in the region of Andalusia in southern Spain are some 25 villages distinguished by their large numbers of whitewashed buildings. There are several driving routes, but tourism officials suggest that the trip start in Arcos de la Frontera and end in Ronda, or vice versa, a distance of about 44 miles, which can be covered in a day. 
 Arcos, with a population of 27,000, is on the banks of the Guadalete River, and was inhabited in the Roman era. Its historic section includes the Condes de Aguila Palace, a former home of Muslim rulers and the Santa Maria de la Asuncion Church, done in the Gothic-Mudejar style, both from the 15th century. The town of Ronda, population 34,500, was founded by the Celts. It straddles the spectacular gorge cut by the Guadalevin River. The Ronda bullring, built in 1785, is considered the oldest bullfighting plaza still in use in Spain. The old town gates include the 13th-century Puerta de Almocabar.
Between the start and finish of the drive are such picturesque towns as Ubrique, known for its leather goods, and Zahara de la Sierra, next to the reservoir of the same name, a village that Arabs founded in the eighth century and that has been declared a national monument. For much of the drive, you can use either Highway N-342 or the narrower, more winding C-344. Maps are available at the tourist offices in Arcos (34-95) 6-702-264 and in Ronda (34-95) 287-1272, which are generally open daily from 10:30 A.M. to 1:30 P.M.
Among the other routes are the 30-mile Central Route, which goes from Zahara de la Sierra to Prado del Rey, and includes a loop through the towns of Grazalema, Villaluenga del Rosario, Benaocaz, Ubrique, El Bosque, and Benamahoma; the 32-mile Western Route, from Villa martin to Algar, going through Espera, Bornos and Arcos de la Frontera; the 44-mile Northern Route from Puerto Serrano to Olvera and passing through Algodonales, El Gastor, Setenil, Alcala del Valle and Torre Alhaquime; and the 40-mile Eastern Route from Ronda to Algatocin, including Montejaque, Cortes de la Frontera, Atajate and Benadilid.
For more information, contact the Tourist Office of Spain, 666 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10103; (212) 265-8822.
 
Brazilian Air Pass
Q. Do you know anything about a Brazilian air pass? -- Sophia R. Perkins, Albany
A. If you're planning on taking more than two round-trip flights within Brazil, the Brazilian Air Pass is the economical way to go. It must be bought outside Brazil, either through travel agencies or through the foreign offices of Brazilian airlines, like Varig or Transbrasil. If bought at an airline office, the passenger must use all the coupons with that airline. If bought through a travel agent, such as Brazil Nuts, (800) 553-9959, the visitor can use different airlines.
The pass is valid for 21 days and offers from five to nine coupons. Prices depend on the number of coupons and whether it's high season (Dec. 10 to Feb. 29 and June 25 to July 25) or low season (March 1 to June 24 and July 26 to Dec. 9). For instance, a five-flight pass costs $540 in the high season and $490 in the low season. In comparison, a recent one way, coach fare from Rio de Janeiro to Fortaleza on Varig was $470.
 
Millennium's Eve in Paris
Q. I plan to spend New Year's Eve in Paris and would like information on special events for the millennium. -- Annie-France Von Arx, Rumson, N.J.
A. New Year's is always a big deal in Paris, but this year you can even celebrate it aboard what is being billed as the biggest helium balloon in the world. Exhibits, a parade and special performances are among the other possibilities in the city's $6.5 million greeting to the year 2000. Some events will start this summer and run through the end of next year. Information is featured on the city's Web site in English, www.paris-france.org.
Here are some events that might interest you:
The Opera Bastille will be putting on Verdi's "Falstaff" in a new production starring Jean-Philippe Lafond throughout December, including on Dec. 31. Tickets, which range from $10 to $68, will go on sale in September. Beginning Oct. 18, you can order tickets by calling (33-8) 36.69.78.68.
From Dec. 18 to Dec. 30 (excluding the 19th and 25th), the Opera Garnier will present three short ballets: "Capriccio" by George Balanchine, "Reversibilite," by Michel Kelemenis, and "Le Rire de la Lyre" by Jose Montalvo. On Dec. 31 a special event called "The Year 2000" is being planned, but details won't be available until the end of next month. Information: (33-8) 36.69.78.68.
From Dec. 10 to 31, 16 performances of "The Nutcracker," reinterpreted and choreographed by Maurice Bejart, will be staged at the newly restored Theatre du Chatelet, on the Place du Chatelet, which is scheduled to reopen in early October. Call (33-1) 40.28.28.00 or www .chatelet-theatre.com for updated information.
The balloon ride is offered from July 1 to Dec. 31, 2000, during daylight hours at the Parc Andre Citroen in the 15th arrondissement. About 30 people at a time will get a 10-minute panoramic view of the city. The cost is $10.
Illumination will be a central New Year's theme, with more than 150 of the city's monuments lighted, including Paris's 36 bridges and the promenades along the quays of the Seine. One way to get a good view is on the Ferris wheel that will be installed on the Place de la Concorde.
The Place du Trocadero, overlooking the Eiffel Tower in the 16th arrondissement, will be the gathering place for those who want to watch the Tower's countdown clock; a light show is scheduled shortly after midnight.
On New Year's Day, a parade will wind through the streets of Montmartre. It begins at 2 P.M. from the Rue des Martyrs.
While most major hotels and restaurants have been booked for months (or years), their lobbies and bars -- such as the Ritz Hotel's Bar Vendome or the bar at the Bristol -- promise to be festive, if crowded, places to experience a luxurious millennial atmosphere without having to worry about making reservations.

HEADLINE: Bedlam on the Streets

BYLINE: By Michael Winerip; Michael Winerip, a staff writer for the magazine, is the author of "9 Highland Road: Sane Living for the Mentally Ill."

 BODY:
Maybe they should have just stenciled it in large letters on Andrew Goldstein's forehead: "ticking time bomb. suffers schizophrenia. if off medication, run for cover!" The news accounts of his arrest for pushing Kendra Webdale under a subway train in New York that first Sunday afternoon in January must have sent a cold shiver through the hundreds of psychiatrists, therapists and social workers who had treated this seriously mentally ill man.
They knew he was dangerous. In the two years before Kendra Webdale was instantly killed on the tracks, Andrew Goldstein attacked at least 13 other people. The hospital staff members who kept treating and discharging Goldstein knew that he repeatedly attacked strangers in public places. They knew because he had attacked them -- two psychiatrists, a nurse, a social worker and a therapy aide in two years' time. Over and over, his hospital charts carried warnings. 
 5/6/98: High risk for violence. 7/31/98: Last 6-12 months patient has been acting aggressively and impulsively by striking out unprovoked.
They knew. Long before this subway push and another one last month, the state of the nation's shattered mental-health system all but assured such calamities. Yet for each hospitalization -- there were 13 in 1997 and 1998 alone -- Goldstein was given medication, then discharged, often after just a few days, to live on his own in a basement apartment. And now the consequences were front-page news: "Horror on the Tracks," read the tabloid headlines, "The Face of a Madman."
They knew. He was hospitalized after assaulting a psychiatrist at a Queens clinic. 11/14/97: Suddenly, without any warning, patient springs up and attacks one of doctors, pushing her into a door and then onto the floor. He was hospitalized after threatening a woman at a Waldbaum's supermarket; after attacking two strangers at a Burger King; after fighting with an apartment mate. 3/2/98: Broke down roommate's door because he could not control the impulse. And particularly chilling, six months before Kendra Webdale's death, he was hospitalized for striking another woman he did not know on a New York subway. 6/20/98: Brought to E.R. by E.M.S. after patient lost motor control and punched a girl on the subway.
Sometimes he was delivered to the hospitals by well-meaning police officers trying to get him treatment. More often, Goldstein walked into the psychiatric E.R. on his own, seeking help. This 29-year-old Jewish male (as the records describe him), who before schizophrenia set in had been so bright that he graduated from Bronx High School of Science, one of the city's elite public high schools, now was repeatedly explaining to E.R. doctors that he was confused or couldn't remember how to get home or that his brain had stopped working.
Six weeks before Webdale, on Nov. 20, 1998, he arrived at Jamaica Hospital in Queens, again asking to be hospitalized. Walked in the E.R. complaining of hearing voices, people following him and being inhabited by people. . . . They removed my brain, I don't know why. I am hearing these voices telling me something will happen. . . . I cannot cope."
How psychotic was Goldstein when he was off his medicine? At various times, he has told psychiatrists that he was turning purple, that he had shrunk six to eight inches, that he had lost his neck, had developed an oversize penis because of contaminated food and that a homosexual man named Larry was stealing his excrement from the toilet "through interpolation" then eating it with a knife and fork. The voices seemed so real, so relentless, that on Nov. 24 a psychiatrist wrote, "He requested eyeglasses so that he will find the people talking to him."
 
He Wanted Help
When a mental patient kills, there is often an outcry for tougher commitment laws, but this was not the problem in Goldstein's case. He signed himself in voluntarily for all 13 of his hospitalizations. His problem was what happened after discharge. The social workers assigned to plan his release knew he shouldn't have been living on his own, and so did Goldstein, but everywhere they looked they were turned down. They found waiting lists for long-term care at state hospitals, waiting lists for supervised housing at state-financed group homes, waiting lists for a state-financed intensive-case manager, who would have visited Goldstein daily at his apartment to make sure he was coping and taking his meds.
More than once he requested long-term hospitalization at Creedmoor, the state hospital nearby. In 1997, he walked into the Creedmoor lobby, asking to be admitted. "I want to be hospitalized," he said. "I need a placement." But in a cost-cutting drive, New York has been pushing hard to reduce its patient census and to shut state hospitals. Goldstein was instead referred to an emergency room, where he stayed overnight and was released.
Again, in July 1998, Goldstein cooperated with psychiatrists, this time during a monthlong stay at Brookdale Hospital, in hopes of getting long-term care at Creedmoor. Brookdale psychiatrists had a well-documented case. In a month's time, Goldstein committed three violent acts: punching the young woman on the subway; attacking a Brookdale therapist, a psychiatrist, a social worker and a ward aide; striking a Brookdale nurse in the face. This time, Creedmoor officials agreed in principle to take him, but explained that there was a waiting list, that they were under orders to give priority to mental patients from prison and that they did not know when they would have an opening. Days later, Goldstein was discharged from Brookdale.
Another reasonable alternative would have been a supervised group home or single-room-occupancy hotel staffed by counselors around the clock. Goldstein repeatedly asked for such a placement, but openings are rare, since Gov. George Pataki financed no new supervised community residences for the mentally ill during his first four-year term and just 200 S.R.O. beds statewide. "Working on getting him a residence in Manhattan within the next three to six months," says a Dec. 16, 1998, note, 18 days before he pushed Webdale.
At the very least, Goldstein should have had an intensive-case manager, a state-financed caseworker whose job would have been to visit him daily at his apartment. On Dec. 11, 1998 -- 23 days before Webdale -- a North General Hospital social worker wrote that an intensive-case manager was needed, because "patient is unable to manage his money, does not take care of himself and becomes noncompliant with meds." But that waiting list was months long, too.
Goldstein's last hospitalization before Webdale was at North General, from Nov. 24 to Dec. 15. Because of cost-saving measures mandated under managed care, hospitals that operate short-term, or "acute care," psychiatric units are under great financial pressure to discharge patients within three weeks. So two weeks into his stay, on Dec. 9, even as Goldstein was still being described by North General's psychiatrist as "disorganized, thought-disordered . . . talking to himself . . . very delusional," the discharge team had already set his release for the next week.
Sure enough, on Dec. 15, North General discharged Goldstein with a week's supply of medicine and a form advising him to report to Bleuler Psychotherapy Center for counseling. This was like a bad joke -- that a man so sick, with his history, would be sent into the community with so little support. At clinics like Bleuler, state financing is minimal. Social workers have large caseloads with no time to visit clients. Since September, Bleuler had supposedly been treating Goldstein, but he had missed most of his appointments and had repeatedly gone off his meds.
It happened again: he missed two clinic appointments in late December. He stopped taking his medication. If he had had an intensive-case manager or a group-home counselor, or both, it would have been their job to find him and see what was wrong. At Bleuler, it wasn't anyone's job. Instead, on Dec. 26, a Bleuler worker mailed a form letter requesting that Goldstein phone the clinic by Jan. 6, 1999, or else his case would be closed.
On Jan. 3, 1999, at 5:06 P.M., the N train pulled into the station at 23d Street and Broadway. Kendra Webdale was a vivacious 32-year-old who had come to the city three years before from upstate and was working as a receptionist with dreams of landing a big job in the music industry. To Andrew Goldstein, she was another stranger. He never saw her face. As he later wrote in his confession: "I felt a sensation, like something was entering me. . . . I got the urge to push, shove or sidekick. As the train was coming, the feeling disappeared and came back. . . . I pushed the woman who had blond hair."
 
A Confidential Case
Because of patient confidentiality laws, Andrew Goldstein's 3,500-page psychiatric file will never become public, even when he goes to trial on the murder charge. But it was given to me by people who see his treatment record as a harrowing testament to the failures of the mental-health system.
There is a long list of institutions and individuals who should be held accountable for what happened to Goldstein and Webdale, but at the top of that list belong Governor Pataki and the State of New York, for it is the states that, for the last 150 years, have had primary responsibility for citizens who are seriously mentally ill, and it is the states, beginning with deinstitutionalization in the 1950's, that have persistently shirked that responsibility.
With the introduction of antipsychotic medication, state hospitals nationwide began releasing patients into the community. There was a good deal that was hopeful about this; by then, many state hospitals had become snake pits. Yet the states never created the outpatient services that were supposed to replace those hospitals, landing many of the seriously mentally ill on the streets. In 1953, there were 93,000 patients in New York's state mental hospitals; today, the number is 6,000 and dropping. And while these last patients are often very troubled (about one-quarter have criminal backgrounds), the state's special discharge teams continue to push them out the door -- even when there's no place for them to go. The New York State Office of Mental Health provides only 21,000 supervised community beds. And during Pataki's first term, the state financed just 200 new beds with 24-hour supervision.
The problems in New York are the problems in virtually every state. Fewer than half of the Americans with schizophrenia receive adequate care, according to a 1998 national study. The Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law estimates that spending by the 50 states on treatment for the seriously mentally ill is a third less today than it was in the 1950's (once numbers are adjusted for inflation and population growth).
While this is a danger primarily to the mentally ill and their families, who bear the brunt of the states' neglect, it is also a danger to the public. From the many studies on mental illness and violence, we know that treated mentally ill people living in the community are no more a risk than the general population. But if a person is off medication and psychotic, he becomes a greater risk for violence; if you add substance abuse to that psychosis, the risk grows significantly, and one of the strongest predictors of whether a mentally ill person will be violent is whether he has been violent before.
It is the most sensational cases of the untreated-turned-violent that make headlines: Russell Weston Jr., ruled incompetent to stand trial for killing two U.S. Capitol police officers; Sergei Babarin, who murdered a man and a woman at a Mormon library in Utah; John Salvi 3d, who shot to death two abortion-clinic workers in Brookline, Mass.; Mark Bechard, judged criminally insane for killing two nuns in Maine, and last month, another New York subway case, Julio Perez, charged with attempted murder for pushing a father of three in front of a rush-hour train, severing the man's legs.
Even in such criminal cases, the failings of the mental-health system are rarely exposed because most psychiatric records never become public. A few examples among many I looked into: in February, newspapers reported that Calvin Bostick, a homeless man, was arrested for setting fire to the Church of St. Anthony of Padua in Queens. But only from confidential state documents would you learn that between 1967 and 1998, Bostick had been treated and released 25 times from five state psychiatric institutions. And when he was out in the community, he built a criminal record of 18 convictions -- for arson, assault, robbery and drugs.
When Kaid Farhn was arrested in December for nearly choking to death a 3-year-old girl standing with her mother in a Brooklyn subway station, it did not make news. He was recently found unfit to stand trial and confined for treatment -- the second time in two years. In 1997, Farhn was arrested for assaulting three people, judged unfit and sent to the state psychiatric hospital on Staten Island, where, according to state documents, he was released after three weeks.
There are now far more mentally ill in the nation's jails and prisons (200,000) than in state hospitals (61,700). With 3,000 mentally ill inmates on Rikers Island, the New York City jail is now, in effect, the state's largest psychiatric facility. In a year's time, according to a study by the Urban Justice Center, 15,000 prisoners in Rikers are treated for serious mental illness.
Some, like Goldstein, are awaiting trial on violent crimes. But far more have been too sick to cope alone in the community and were arrested for shoplifting, disturbing the peace, public lewdness, intoxication, drug use, fare-beating. Many would never have landed behind bars if there were adequate community care.
And that is the larger, quieter scandal behind the states' failure. While some of the untreated are dangerous, far more suffer unnecessarily from their own illnesses. After years of declining numbers, the population of homeless adults is rising again in New York City shelters; it is estimated that of the 7,200 homeless, 2,200 to 3,000 are mentally ill. These days, commuters are noticing more disoriented people begging on the city's subways; police precinct commanders report a growth in "E.D.P." (emotionally disturbed persons) cases. "The number of disturbed people out there is definitely creeping back up," says Mary Brosnahan, director of the Coalition for the Homeless in New York City.
 
A Return to the 1840's
On a winter's night, I visited the city's Atlantic Avenue shelter in Brooklyn -- a run-down, dark, drafty military armory that houses 300 men. It is a mean, hard place; the previous shelter manager was assaulted there and never returned to work. Everywhere disoriented men were talking to themselves, staring into space, rocking back and forth, their faces hidden like shades in hooded sweatshirts. A man with mangy hair, a foul smell and red plaid pants walked up to a top-ranking city official and explained that he was Albert Einstein. "I'm paranoid," Einstein said. "I think I did something I didn't do."
To Muzzy Rosenblatt, then the city's Acting Commissioner of Homeless Services, it is the mental-health system that seems crazy. "We shouldn't have mentally ill people in our shelters," he says. "They should be in mental-health programs."
The state's Commissioner of Mental Health under Governor Pataki is James Stone, and advocates for the mentally ill have been so frustrated by his department's failure to finance more community-housing programs these last four years that they bitterly refer to this period as "the Stone Age." Indeed, in some ways we are back to where we were in the 1840's, when the legendary reformer Dorothea Dix set out to shame Massachusetts legislators into doing something for the mentally ill, who were locked away in the basements of local almshouses and jails. In 1843, Dix completed a 32-page expose, "Memorial to the Massachusetts Legislature": "I proceed, Gentlemen, briefly to call your attention to the present state of Insane Persons confined within this Commonwealth in cages, closets, stalls, pens! Chained, naked, beaten with rods and lashed into obedience!"
Dix described the care of each mentally ill person she had seen: "Saugus poorhouse: Apartment entirely unfurnished; no chair, table, nor bed . . . cold very cold. . . . On the floor sat a woman, her limbs immovably contracted, so that the knees were brought upward to the chin; the face was concealed, the head rested on the folded arms." Her accounts reminded me of the basement apartment in Brooklyn where Andrew Goldstein lived last year, as described in Jamaica Hospital records: "One-room unit, nonfunctioning bathroom, unsafe electrical wires hanging from ceiling, no electricity, foul smell of dead and decaying mice, lock to room broken. In general, conditions unsuitable for living."
Though a moralist, Dix understood that it was all about money, as David Gollaher points out in his biography of her, "Voice for the Mad." The 1840 Massachusetts census counted 978 "lunatics"; the two state asylums had only 353 beds. The state, Dix implored, must appropriate $60,000 to create beds for the 625 neglected; cities and towns were too small and too poor to finance their own asylums, she argued. Shamed into it, Massachusetts found the money. And that was what cemented the states' responsibility for the seriously mentally ill.
One hundred and fifty years later, neither the Giuliani administration nor the nonprofit agencies that rely on state funds to provide housing for the mentally ill have been able to shame Pataki into doing the same for them. The Republican Mayor is no Dorothea Dix, but Rudolph Giuliani does understand the problems of having lots of disoriented people on the streets and subways in a city where so many live so close together. Two years ago, he asked the Governor to renew a 1990 housing agreement for the mentally ill between the city and state, known as New York/New York. That agreement, made between Gov. Mario Cuomo and Mayor David Dinkins, provided 3,600 new units of housing for the mentally ill in the city, with the state financing two-thirds and the city the remainder. It had a big impact. At the time, there were 9,300 adults in city homeless shelters. By the mid-1990's, when the New York/New York beds were opened, the shelter census dropped to 6,000.
But those beds are full now, the homeless population has risen and so the Mayor asked this Governor to help create New York/New York II. Giuliani was willing to put in $85 million for new construction -- to match the city's 1990 share -- and hoped that Pataki would create a new program on the scope of the first.
Not this Governor. For two years those New York/New York II talks were stalled, with Pataki unwilling to commit more than $45 million for construction -- a third of what city officials say was needed. This despite personal appeals to the Governor from an array of prominent New Yorkers, including John Cardinal O'Connor. Finally in mid-April, the Mayor gave up on the Governor's doing more and put the best face on a watered-down agreement. In the end, for the state's share, Pataki agreed to build just 500 new supervised S.R.O. beds over five years -- on top of the mere 200 already in the state budget; in contrast, during Cuomo's last five years, the state financed or pledged 3,200 such beds. As one Giuliani aide told me: "A long time ago we realized we weren't going to get a lot from this Governor. He just wasn't into it. So we were happy to get anything."
In 1990, when the first New York/New York agreement was signed, advocates celebrated. This time they held a protest rally, on April 29, picketing Governor Pataki's New York City office. "Pataki where are you?" chanted the 500. "Remember the homeless!"
 
A Broken Contract
Neither Governor Pataki nor Commissioner Stone would be interviewed for this article, and the spokesman for the state Office of Mental Health, Roger Klingman, requested written questions and supplied written responses. He would not comment on the Goldstein case, because "state mental-hygiene law does not permit us to discuss information from a patient's clinical record." He described the state system as "large and varied," and wrote that New York's community housing program is "one of the largest if not the largest such system in the country."
Unfortunately, there are no comparative qualitative studies of state systems, and efforts to create national standards are in the early stages, says Clarke Ross, a public-policy expert at the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill. However, Ross says, any such measure would include the numbers of mentally ill in jails and prisons, as well as homeless, and in those areas, New York also has the dubious distinction of being a leader.
One measure of how low the national standard is when it comes to caring for the seriously mentally ill is to compare their deinstitutionalization with the movement of mentally retarded adults into the community during the same period, which is one of the more impressive social revolutions of our time.
In the early 1970's, after Geraldo Rivera sneaked a camera into the Willowbrook state institution for the mentally retarded on Staten Island, exposing snake-pit conditions, family members sued. Gov. Hugh Carey could have got the state off cheap by agreeing to improve Willowbrook, but instead signed a consent decree that forged a remarkable social contract for the mentally retarded: for each person discharged, the state would finance a group home or an apartment bed. That compassionate agreement helped to set a national standard.
By 1998, the state had financed 32,000 community beds for the mentally retarded -- even though those beds are two to three times as costly as the 21,000 available to the mentally ill. (Mentally retarded residents need far more staff support.) Although Pataki hadn't come close to matching his predecessors -- the list of mentally retarded adults in New York waiting for housing grew to 6,000 by last year -- he has always at least paid lip service to the social contract forged by Carey, building the mentally retarded between 480 and 1,100 new community beds each year.
Then last June, just as Pataki's re-election campaign was getting under way, newspapers in suburban Westchester County reported that there were 26 mentally retarded adults found living in homeless shelters there -- prompting outrage. Pataki's response was swift. Ten weeks before the election, he suddenly announced a program to finance 5,000 new community beds for the mentally retarded called New York Cares. It means that community beds built or pledged for the mentally retarded now outnumber those for the mentally ill by some 15,000. Indeed, the Governor's 1999 budget calls for a $40 million increase in spending for the mentally retarded; for the mentally ill, a $27 million cut.
Why haven't we forged the same social contract for the mentally ill? After all, there are as many as 3,000 mentally ill in New York City's shelters. One reason has to do with timing. In the mid-1970's, when Governor Carey signed the Willowbrook consent decree, there was already a well-organized lobby for the mentally retarded. But the mentally ill had no lobby yet; the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, which today boasts more than 200,000 members, was not founded until 1979. It wasn't until the mid-1980's, after deinstitutionalization had created a large, menacing homeless population, that New York began financing a substantial number of community beds for the mentally ill. But by then, the Reagan revolution had set in, activist judges were no longer in favor and government spending for the poor was in decline. Just as new community-housing programs were showing real success, money was drying up and advocates couldn't find a judge or governor to forge that social contract for the mentally ill.
In the early 1990's, I spent two years all but living at a well-run, state-financed group home for a book on the mentally ill. What I saw made me a believer in quality community programs and in the nonprofit agencies that use state money to run them. There were problems at the home, but they did not spill into the streets, because counselors were there to defuse the crises.
Today there is an impressive array of state-financed community models, from the heavily regimented to the lightly supervised, that have been developed by nonprofits: group homes for mentally ill substance abusers that use an abstinence model and have 24-hour supervision; S.R.O.'s, where people have their own rooms, share kitchens and get support from caseworkers and psychiatrists with offices on the premises; rent-subsidy programs to pay for an apartment in an affordable building in the community, with a case manager who might visit as often as every day or as rarely as once a month.
The programs are so varied because the needs of the mentally ill vary, too. Among the least restrictive is Pathways to Housing, a program based in Harlem and Queens, which gives homeless mentally ill people who have long resisted treatment apartments even if they still have a drinking or drug problem and do not want to take medication. They are assigned a case manager who sees them regularly, making sure their problems with meds or substance abuse are reasonably under control. Though many Pathways residents had been homeless for more than a decade, 88 percent were still housed in this program after five years.
Thayer Gamble, 43, is one. Talk about a time bomb: he is schizophrenic, was suicidal, used crack and has been imprisoned several times. Four years ago a hospital social worker referred him to Pathways, which gave him an apartment and a caseworker, Ben Tallerson. Tallerson visited Gamble's Harlem apartment regularly. Because Tallerson knew Gamble, he realized one reason Gamble had trouble taking his medication properly. "He can't read," Tallerson says. "He didn't know what it meant to take meds A.M. and P.M." Tallerson drew it out for him, the sun for A.M., the moon for P.M. And two years ago, when Gamble started on crack again, Tallerson noticed. "When Thayer's going good," he says, "he has clean habits, he keeps himself clean, his apartment is clean. Now I start seeing his physical appearance is sloppy, he's smelly, he's hanging on the streets." Tallerson urged him into a detox program. As Gamble says, "I have his beeper number -- if I'm having a problem at 3:30 in the morning, I can call Ben."
There are thousands of mentally ill New Yorkers whose lives are better because of state-financed programs like Pathways -- it's just that success is less visible than failure. Cecil Dozier, 44, panhandled at the corner of Bleecker and Thompson in Greenwich Village last fall. He is now in a program for mentally ill substance abusers run by Volunteers of America. Bladimer Lopez, who slept by the Dumpster at a McDonald's on 125th Street, is in a supervised S.R.O. for the mentally ill run by the Center for Urban Community Services. So is Robert Whynot, who used to beg on the subways until he made $35, then bought himself a bag of heroin, half a gram of coke and a metro card ("so I wouldn't get arrested for fare-beating"). Now for the first time, at 40, he is getting treated for manic depression.
Even the New York City shelter system has made considerable progress, converting 1,000 shelter beds to mental-health-service beds run by nonprofits. These community programs cost between $10,000 and $43,000 per person, per year. All, however, are cheaper than a year at a state hospital ($135,000) or Rikers Island ($69,000).
 
The Push to Discharge
In 15 years of reporting on mental health, I have never seen the system in such disarray. Unprecedented cost-cutting measures are undermining safety valves that had long been in place. I count six dangers -- for the mentally ill and the public -- that have come into play in the last few years.
Danger 1: The last 6,000 long-term hospital patients that the state is working so hard to discharge are twice as likely to have a criminal background as patients from a decade ago.
Danger 2: While many of these patients could live in 24-hour supervised community residences, those beds are full. Even if the first New York/New York II beds open as scheduled, more than a year from now, there won't be anywhere near enough to absorb these new discharges, let alone the growing number of homeless.
Danger 3: Psychiatric wards of general hospitals used to have the flexibility to keep a patient like Goldstein for months or transfer him to a state hospital for long-term care. But state hospitals are now taking few admissions, and managed care is pressing the general hospitals to discharge within three weeks. The five acute-care hospitals that treated Goldstein can receive up to $700 a day during those first weeks. But after that the medicated schizophrenic is usually considered "stable" by insurance monitors, and compensation can drop to $175 a day or be denied altogether. And even at $175 per day, hospitals lose money. As a result, there is a revolving door for patients, who quickly relapse without community support.
Danger 4: There are a record number of mentally ill in prisons and jails now being released -- without any discharge planning.
Danger 5: The crackdown on Federal disability and welfare benefits will leave more mentally ill people with no Government support.
Danger 6: Government watchdog agencies like the Commission on Quality Care for the Mentally Disabled in New York have had their budgets cut and their jurisdictions narrowed in recent years. Over the last decade, the commission's staff has been reduced 25 percent. It is far less likely today to undertake major inquiries. During Cuomo's adminstration, the Legislature authorized the commission to do a sweeping investigation of the adult-home industry; that authorization has not been renewed.
The reason the mental-health system behaves so irrationally is usually money. There is a push to close state hospitals because that saves money, but there is no incentive to build the badly needed community housing to replace them because that costs money.
The Pataki administration has given each state hospital an annual census-reduction goal. Mimi Koenigsberg was a social worker at Manhattan Psychiatric Center for 24 years, and in that time she never saw a push for discharges like the one begun in early 1998 by the hospital's director, Eileen Consilvio. "We started having these weekly discharge meetings," Koenigsberg recalls. "She'd say: 'Why isn't so-and-so going, he's been ready for weeks; this one's been ready for months. . . . Just get them off the census."'
Klingman, the state mental-health-office spokesman, says that these meetings are conducted "to assure that discharge planning is proceeding appropriately." But the process plainly worried doctors at the Manhattan state hospital, where more than half the patients have a criminal record. According to minutes of a March 17, 1998, meeting of the psychiatry staff, "In the need to reduce census it appeared to some present that they were being ordered by nonmedical staff to discharge patients prematurely."
A measure of how difficult these last patients are and how indifferent the state can be came in the form of a December ruling, by the New York State Labor Department, that Hudson River Psychiatric Center in Poughkeepsie is a hazardous workplace. It was the first such ruling in state history. While Klingman dismisses the case as a union ploy, the Governor's own labor department noted that state "employees have suffered broken bones, bites . . . and have been choked until they were unconscious" by patients. The report said that most injuries to workers came when wards were below minimum staffing levels.
In one case, a single patient assaulted aides and nurses 37 times over two months. The local union president, Judy Watts-Devine, repeatedly asked James Regan, the hospital director, to transfer the patient to a high-security facility for violent cases, but was ignored. And then Mary Veltre, a nurse, became the 38th case: she was kicked in the pelvis and taken to a local emergency room. At that point, Watts-Devine told the director, "I'm going to call every TV station and every newspaper unless you get this man out of here." And he did.
Still, in the next few years, the state hopes to reduce its long-term census from 6,000 to as low as 3,700. With so much pressure from Albany to release, discharge teams routinely mislead the nonprofit housing providers about the severity of patients' problems, in hopes of arranging a placement quicker, in a less supervised setting, no matter how inappropriate. The Colonial is a run-down hotel on 112th Street in Manhattan. Colonial tenants complain of filthy, smelly conditions, fights in the narrow hallways and people living crowded into small rooms. Rockland Psychiatric Center acknowledges discharging 75 to 100 patients to the Colonial in recent years. Elizabeth Kane, a tenants' lawyer for the Goddard Riverside Community Center, called Rockland at one point to complain. "I didn't know if they realized what a dangerous, stupid place it was to send a fragile person," she recalls. "They said, 'We know, but we don't have any choices."'
Even the building manager, John Klein, who denies tenants' complaints, says: "I don't think you'd want to live in a building like this. The problem is, there's no place for these people."
On Dec. 30, 1998, Rockland discharged a 43-year-old man to the Colonial. His sole support was a case-management team. Diane Sonde, who oversaw it, argued that the man needed a 24-hour supervised residence. Rockland disagreed.
The state never told Sonde's team key details of the man's history: that he was so sick that he had been in state hospitals 32 of the last 34 years; that he had a history of sexual assault; that he had been transferred to a high-security state facility four times because he was too dangerous for a regular state hospital.
After a few days at the Colonial, the man cornered a woman on Sonde's team, sexually exposed himself and threatened her. He was immediately returned to Rockland. Only then did Sonde begin to piece together his real story. Nor was it the first time that the state had tried dumping this troubled man: in August 1998, Rockland discharged him to a city homeless shelter, only to have him walk back into a city hospital two days later, asking for help.
It is not that community programs won't take tough cases but that they want adequate resources from the state. A few years ago, Kingsboro Psychiatric Center in Brooklyn sent a man to a discharge interview at the Institute of Community Living, a large nonprofit housing agency. The state's two-page summary mentioned that the man had previously tried suicide. What the state summary did not mention was that the suicide attempt came after the man murdered his father. The community program learned this while interviewing him and confronted state officials, and he was returned to Kingsboro. Klingman claims that Kingsboro officials didn't know the man had committed a murder because it was part of his juvenile record and was sealed. In a year, Kingsboro tried again, but this time the nonprofit agreed to take him only if he was in a 24-hour supervised residence with an intensive-case manager. And the state agreed.
All the big nonprofit community providers say the same thing: they can't trust state hospitals to tell the truth. "They mislead us," says Steve Warren, director of Services for the Underserved, a nonprofit with 800 state-financed beds. "They'll fudge on people with arson and sexual crimes. They're trying to package them in the best way they can, to get them out."
 
An Unnecessary Death
The sad saga of a schizophrenic 51-year-old named Peter Fazio, a long-term patient at Manhattan Psychiatric Center, illustrates the consequences of the state's relentless push to discharge. Before his schizophrenia hit, in the 1960's, Fazio was an A student at Bergen Catholic in suburban New Jersey and won a full scholarship to Manhattan College. After the illness, he was wild. He was estranged from his family, at one point holding his mother hostage for five days before police arrested him. He lived in Bowery flophouses until he murdered another resident, suffocating the victim by shoving a sock into his mouth. At the time, the police were struck by how much other flophouse residents despised Fazio.
In jail, he stopped eating and was kept alive by a feeding tube. At Attica prison, he tried hanging himself in 1986. For the next two years, he later told a therapist, he planned how he would kill himself after his prison discharge. In May 1988, two days after that release, he slit his chest open with a scalpel, then stuck a boning knife into his heart. Miraculously, he lived, and was sent to Manhattan Psychiatric, where he spent the next 10 years. While still a troubled patient -- records describe him as "sadistic" and "hostile" to fellow patients, as repeatedly pacing the halls, paranoid and arrogant -- for the first time, he found a niche. He relished waking early to read the newspaper, sold bread from a little cart, got along with staff members and enjoyed grounds privileges.
When discharge was discussed, he commented, "There's nothing more to enjoy outside." When pressed, he repeatedly threatened suicide. A social worker's note describes a talk in January 1997 about discharge: "I asked about suicide. He said, 'Yeah, I'd basically go that route."'
Hospital officials were well aware that Fazio had repeatedly threatened suicide if released. "When discharge planning is discussed," says a May 1997 note, "Fazio retreats." The note continues: "I will hurt myself.' Alert: He is a serious risk."
In the months leading to his final night at the hospital, July 26, 1998, Fazio "complained he and other patients are being pushed by the administrattion to be discharged whether they are ready or not," according to records. During therapy he asked, "Is the reason they're pushing discharge now that they want to save money?"
For a few months, the record indicates, he was more positive about leaving, but by spring 1998, as the staff pressed, he is described as "depressed" and "not very happy or ready to talk about discharge." He worried that people in the community would know he was a murderer. In May, he told a case manager that twice before at the hospital he had tried suicide but had mentioned it to no one. Still the staff pressed, and on June 3 a discharge team, sent to the hospital by the state to lower the census, indicated that Fazio was ready to go.
On July 6, he was taken to visit a community residence, though he refused a placement there. On July 12, an aide noted his "regression" and "isolation," and a July 22 note mentioned his ambivalence and fear. On July 25, his next to last night at Manhattan Psychiatric, he stayed in his room at dinnertime, according to a hospital worker I interviewed: "He says, 'I'm being discharged, I really don't want to leave.' He was very depressed."
The next evening, Fazio again did not go to dinner, but this time was found in the bathroom, "in a pool of blood," a final hospital note says. "Body was cold to the touch." Using a razor, he had cut a wedge out of his neck, piercing his jugular.
The story has an addendum. The state's quality-care commission did a brief report on Fazio's suicide, finding "no deficiencies" by the hospital. The report said, "We found no evidence that Mr. Fazio had threatened suicide since mid-1996" (though in Fazio's hospital notes I count seven suicide threats in 1997 alone). The report found "nothing significantly unusual in the life of Mr. Fazio in the weeks or days prior to his death" and concluded that Fazio's death was "unpredictable, thus not preventable."
The report offered no theory as to why Fazio did kill himself. However, it did mention that two hospital workers who had talked to the media were disciplined for violating the confidentiality of the dead man.
 
Off the Streets
Rockaway, Queens, is a shabby seaside resort of old boarding houses and for-profit adult homes that have long been a dumping ground for the state's mental hospitals. Jonathan Gaska, district manager for Rockaway's community board, has been fighting the problem for years. "There's no supervision -- you have sick people urinating on the lawns," he says. "We have a guy who walks around with a mop on his head. You feel sorry for people like that. They act odd, they dress odd and they hang around outside all the time -- it keeps people away." To discourage the mentally ill from sitting on the benches in front of the Park Inn adult home, the benches were removed. Now the mentally ill stand in front of the Park Inn.
A few years ago, Steve Warren, the director of Services for the Underserved, offered to take over a particularly bad adult home and run it properly. He took civic leaders to see housing programs that he ran all over the city. "They were good," Gaska says. "Warren was so open. Everyone's like, 'What's the deal?' We're always being lied to." When Warren started to redesign the Rockaway adult home, he spoke to the home's residents about why they were always on the street. "You know why?" Warren recalls. "There were 125 people crowded in that adult home, two or three to a room. To get privacy, the street was the only place to go."
With a $1.2 million state grant, he redesigned the place, reducing the size to a 71-bed S.R.O. where everyone has a small apartment. There are also several lounges and recreation areas. The state provided financing for an extensive staff, including eight case managers, two substance-abuse counselors, a psychiatrist and a nurse. The facility costs the government $25,000 per person, per year, three times the subsidy for one of those awful adult homes.
"The place is as good as advertised," Gaska says. "The state has to be able to make other places do what they're doing."
Once, for a year, in 1994, Andrew Goldstein was in a group home on the grounds of Creedmoor state hospital and did well, regularly taking his medication. 8/17/94: Follows schedule well, is uniformly polite, friendly and cooperative. But that group home is highly supervised, costing $41,600 per person, per year, and there is great pressure for state workers to move residents on to less-supervised, less-expensive programs, even if it's too soon.
A state discharge team set up screening appointments for Goldstein at a few apartment programs that offered moderate supervision. But he was judged too low-functioning and didn't pass those interviews. A system driven by an individual's well-being would let him stay at the Creedmoor home and try again later; a system driven by money cannot wait. So when he wasn't well enough for a program with moderate support, the team pushed him to move to a place with almost no support, an adult home.
Goldstein rejected the first adult home he was shown as too large, a 200-bed facility in Rockaway, but social workers kept pressing. 10/31/94: He has been told he cannot go to Delaware to visit his father until his housing placement is made. So he chose the very next thing he was offered, Leben Home in Queens, with 361 beds, the second-largest adult home in the state. For Goldstein, that was the beginning of the downward spiral to the basement apartment and Webdale. He tried several times after that to get back into a supervised residence, including the one at Creedmoor, where he had lived in 1994, but with no luck.
On Sept. 12, 1997, after Goldstein walked into Bellevue Hospital's E.R. seeking help, a hospital social worker noted: "Patient states he would like to return to S.C.C.R." -- the group home -- at Creedmoor. Spoke with Carol Erman, the secretary, who states patient was a resident, however, he can only be referred from Creedmoor inpatient. She referred patient to David Frazier for community residence. Mr. Frazier reviewed chart but was unable to accept referral as there were no beds available."
The next day, Bellevue discharged Goldstein to his basement apartment. The social worker noted that she had given him a piece of paper with the phone number of a mobile crisis unit to call if he became disoriented again; the social worker also noted that he had no phone.
For years, instead of resources, there have been shortcut solutions that push the problem around. The latest, inspired by the Goldstein case, is an effort to pass an outpatient commitment law for New York. It would allow people resistant to treatment to be committed to a supervised community program, and if they are not compliant with medication, they would be hospitalized. Supporters see it as a way to control the resistant mentally ill and leverage the system for more resources; if more people are committed to community programs, the state will have to build more. Opponents fear it will deprive the mentally ill of the right to control their treatment.
I doubt it would make much difference either way. The reality is that commitment is no longer much of a civil liberties threat -- state hospitals don't want patients, and the short-term hospitals can't get rid of them fast enough. If New York had outpatient commitment, it probably would not be enforced because the resources aren't there; or if it were enforced, given current resources, one group of people that needs care would be pushed aside for another group that also needs it. There are 37 states with outpatient commitment laws, and most have systems as dysfunctional as New York's.
What I found most haunting about Goldstein's 3,500-page file was his repeated pleas for services that had no vacancies. There was no room at the inn.
Last month at a court hearing, Goldstein's lawyers, Harvey Fishbein and Jack Hoffinger, argued that he was not fit to stand trial. Judge Carol Berkman disagreed, finding him competent. But she also hinted that she understood the larger scope of the crime. "I have no doubt," she said, "that someday, probably after we are all gone, people will look back at our treatment of mental illness under the law and be shocked and appalled."
When Dorothea Dix had finished shaming Massachusetts into spending more money, she set off to shame New York. In her 1844 report to Albany's legislators, she urged them to live up to the state motto, "Excelsior! Excelsior!"
Excelsior is probably shooting a little high when it comes to social services in America these days, but the time is long overdue to establish a social contract for the mentally ill.

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 5-23-99;
Greenback Blues

BYLINE: By Jason Goodwin; Jason Goodwin is the author of "Lords of the Horizon: A History of the Ottoman Empire." He is working on a history of the United States dollar.

 BODY:
I was in Ahmadabad, India, when I was 17, listening to a railway clerk explain that I could stay there forever for all he cared. So I squeezed a dollar bill into the filthy bundle of rupees I was toying with. Without missing a beat, the clerk heaved open a ledger and began combing it for late cancellations.
Returning from China, Marco Polo had to produce a hoard of gems before his relatives recognized him. But since the Bretton Woods conference of 1944, travelers like me could get that same instant recognition with U.S. dollars. They have achieved unparalleled consumer awareness all around the world; with more greenbacks in circulation than even gospels, they may be the most popular man-made product of all time. 
 Yet now, following in the benighted footsteps of that other global product, Coke, the United States has started monkeying with its successful formula. Over the last four years, the Treasury has rolled out new versions of the $100, the $50 and the $20 bills. And on May 4, in a ceremony beamed live across the internet, Hillary Rodham Clinton unveiled the plans for a new dollar coin. It is meant to be handy for vending machines and what the Mint politely calls "gratuities," and it shows the Shoshone Sacajawea carrying her papoose as she guides Lewis and Clark's 1804 expedition out into Indian territory.
Most of us felt that the new bills looked weird, but we were told the change was necessary to foil counterfeiters. And perhaps it was. But this latest design change, however tasteful and charming at first glance, risks undermining America's compact with the world to define what money ought to be.
For centuries, there has been nothing so properly American as paper money. Colonial Massachusetts invented the stuff in 1690, and it was the paper dollar that made the new country. It was uniquely suited to finance American opportunity: easy money, with which anyone might realize his ambitions -- the very opposite of the gold-backed and class-bound economies of the Old World. "Do you think that I will load my constituents with taxes," asked a representative at the first Continental Congress in 1775, "when we can send to our printer and get a wagon-load of money?"
Which they did. Five years later it was being sewn together into paper suits, but it had paid for the war, and later paper money rolled out the frontier. Local banks started printing their own versions (13,000 different ones -- a third of them counterfeit -- were in circulation by the start of the Civil War); the Union Government effectively consolidated production by issuing greenbacks, the patriarch of the bills in your wallet.
The new bills didn't just facilitate America's ambitions; they seemed to embody them. Compared with the other currencies of the world, which shift and shrink and update themselves perpetually, piling color upon color and one bloodless symbol upon another, the dollar is staggeringly august and changeless -- basically unaltered since 1928, shortly before Wall Street proved that America's health was the world's concern.
Foreign money gets bigger and brassier as it climbs the scale -- it bows to a hierarchy of wealth -- but American democracy is nobly expressed in the identical size of all its bills. The pauper's roll is as impressive as the millionaire's, and the hundred, or the ten, at a glance, is indistinguishable from the one. I feel bad for the Ahmadabad clerk, but there it is: the price of democracy is eternal vigilance.
And so, the 20th century's wars and booms were financed with symbols of the simple morals of the Republic: faith in democracy, belief in God and the perfectibility of man. Novus Ordo Seclorum, it says, A New Order of the Ages. And as the global economy becomes increasingly unstable, the dollar, more than ever before, has emerged as the currency of last resort. Indeed, when Washington announced plans to redesign the $100 bill, the news nearly toppled Russia's underground economy; this month, Argentina floated the possibility of abandoning its own currency in favor of America's.
Yet just at this moment when Asia and Russia and Latin America teeter, when gold has sunk and even Coca- Cola has stumbled, America -- alone among all the nations of the world -- is making a symbolic retrest from the paper dollar that built it and that now represents it.
Compared to all that (and in light of the Susan B. Anthony dollar's utter failure) what does the Sacajawea dollar have to offer? Despite its golden color, it's not likely to cut any ice on an Indian railway station or in a Moscow taxicab. Even its imagery, meant to be nice to Native Americans and women, is fraught with tension. Sacajawea's persevering loyalty to Lewis and Clark helped facilitate American expansion but thereby doomed her own people. The other side of her coin bears a bald eagle swooping through the sky, as dictated by monetary law -- a bit queasily, in this case.
For all Sacajawea's charm, her gentle gaze is wildly misplaced, signaling a relationship with the currency that is essentially false. After all, she's going to fetch up in some pretty unsavory places. As a father, I'd want to keep an eye on that papoose; as an earner and a spender, I'd worry about Sacajawea's anxious backward glance. (In 1787, one-cent coins bore the motto "Fugio"; we know it to be true, but do we really want our money nodding us goodbye?) What's so gentle about this, I'll be tempted to ask Sacajawea, when I feed her and her baby into the cold slot on the parking meter or exchange her for a paper full of Balkan horrors? For my part, I still prefer my money stern and grim -- more a primer in republican values than a token of America's sentimental dialogue with its past.

Chart: "The Dollar Coin: Data"
 
* The decision to mint a new dollar coin was included in the United States Dollar Coin Act of 1997. The House of Representatives recommended that the coin feature the Statue of Liberty; the Senate nominated Sacagewea. Enjoying the dual advantage of having once been an actual living person and having recently been featured in two major books about Lewis and Clark, Sacagewea prevailed.
 
* The unsuccessful Susan B. Anthony coin, the Treasury's last attempt at a dollar coin, was last minted in 1980. It cost about four cents to produce. The Sacagewea coins will cost approximately twice that.
 
* Opinion polls indicate that at least 70 percent of Americans prefer paper dollars to metal.

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 5-23-99: Questions for Joan Chen;
The Revolution of Little Girls

BYLINE: By Melanie Rehak 

 BODY:
Q: Your new film, "Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down Girl," focuses on the plight of children during the Chinese Cultural Revolution in China. What was life like for you during those years?
The Cultural Revolution started in 1966, when I was 5, and from 1967 to 1977, more than 10 million children were "sent down" to remote areas like Tibet and Mongolia to help build socialism. Later on, we all learned that it was to relieve the city of unemployment, and stories came back about how horrible it was. It involved everybody's child -- everyone. So it was better if you volunteered. Otherwise they dragged you out. 
 How did you avoid that fate?
In my first year of high school, I was picked to go to the film studio, which was very, very rare. Mao's wife planned to do three movies about the Long March, and she had to personally approve all the cast. I was proud to be doing propaganda, to be of use to the Communist cause.
Movie star - that's a very unusual exemption. Was the kind of celebrity that you eventually achieved difficult for a believer in the group cause?
I was very young and pure, and I didn't enjoy fame. I would be on a street in any city, and there would be thousands of people falling down hurting themselves, crowding me, their bicycles all trampled, and I wouldn't be able to get out. That scared me. Really, I wanted to be a parachuter.
A parachuter? Why did that appeal to you?
The uniforms looked so handsome, and the female uniform actually had a waistline. Ordinarily we weren't allowed to have a waistline. In school, our outfits didn't show our shapes. When you have no physical appearance of being a woman, you seem to have less vulnerability. And we were taught that we shouldn't behave any differently than the boys.
But clearly, you also learned how to act in a way that's not boyish at all.
I had to learn a whole new set of things after I came to America and got parts in "Tai-Pai" and "The Last Emperor." I knew there was one version of Chineseness that America wanted from me: exotic, slant-eyed, long-haired, sexy, vulnerable China doll. I was eager to adapt and conform. I regret that.
Your screen-siren femininity got you places, though. Was it a greater source of strength than the androgyny you were taught back in China?
I've learned that I could combine these two things. When I was directing this movie, I had to command a crew of 60 that consisted mostly of men. So I tried to see what was most effective: should I be straightforward or should I be coy? Sometimes batting your lashes works. I had to recognize feminine power; now it's good because I have both faces.
What about the other, more ideological aspects of your Chinese upbringing? What lessons have they given you for your current life in America?
It instilled in me an appetite for something intangible, spiritual and grander outside of the practical pursuit of self-interest. That's what drives me to make films. I'm actually extremely comfortable materially. I feel very rich; I don't need any more. It's the other side of me that's hungry. From getting an idea to completing this film to talking with you was obstacle after obstacle after obstacle. I think without that drive, that spiritual need to tell a meaningful story, I would not have been able to do it.
Do you think that whatever keeps you from losing yourself to materialism will also keep China from losing itself in American capitalism?
It seems to spread so easily in China. They're quite brand-oriented, more so than America. The younger generation saves up for a month to buy Chanel lipsticks and cosmetics. I'm grateful that my Communist upbringing has taught me how to enjoy myself in a less materialistic way. But the new generation seems to embrace materialism quite easily.
But for all your patriotism, you were denied a permit to film in China. You ended up filming it illegally. Did you know it would be that hard?
I didn't think that far. I just wanted to pay tribute to a land and a culture that I came from. But my fame hurt me, in a way. If I was caught, I'd be punished a little more strictly -- just to show, because I'm a known figure.
Are such painful homecomings a familiar part of your cross-cultural life?
There are times when I feel like a bastard everywhere I go. Every time there's tension between China and the U.S. I get scared that I won't be trusted by either. But most times I feel fortunate that I could be in both places and learn both cultures. I do miss the real texture of China, but it's good to have something to miss. Melanie Rehak

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 5-23-99: Economics Of: Unemployment;
Labor Pains

BYLINE: By Paul Krugman; Paul Krugman is an economics professor at M.I.T. and the author, most recently, of "The Return of Depression Economics."

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan doesn't think you should get a raise. And he doesn't want you to feel too secure in your job, because otherwise you might demand that raise.
I'm not putting words in his mouth. A few weeks ago, addressing an audience of bankers, the usually Delphic chairman of the Federal Reserve Board was uncharacteristically clear, warning that the United States economy is "steadily depleting the pool of available workers" -- that is, giving jobs to the previously unemployed. As a result, "labor market conditions can become so tight that the rise in nominal wages will start increasingly outpacing the gains in labor productivity" -- that is, workers who know that jobs are plentiful will get big raises. And that, Greenspan implied, would be a very bad thing. He didn't say what he would do about it, but markets got the hint: bond prices immediately plunged, on fears that the Fed would soon raise interest rates. 
 Now to a man from Mars -- or for that matter to a normal human being -- Greenspan's concerns might sound very peculiar. After all, what's wrong with giving jobs to the jobless and higher wages to the employed? But Greenspan is probably right to be worried. What is less clear is whether it was a good idea for him to be so explicit.
Think of it this way. Once upon a time (say, back in the mid-70's, when Gerald Ford was President and Alan Greenspan was his chief economist), the U.S. economy was like a trendy restaurant -- one of those places where the tables are set close together and the ceiling seems custom-designed to maximize the din. What happens in that kind of environment is that everyone tries to talk above the background noise so as to be heard by his or her companions. But by talking louder, you yourself raise the noise level, forcing everyone else to talk louder, raising the noise level still further, and eventually everyone is shouting themselves hoarse. Substitute wage and price increases for speaking volume and inflation for the overall noise level, and you have a capsule analysis of the kind of inflationary spiral that the U.S. faced in the 1970's. And the only way that the noise level (inflation) could be kept under control was to keep a substantial number of tables vacant -- that is, by maintaining a large reserve army of unemployed.
Today, of course, the situation is vastly improved. The economy is flourishing, with unemployment at a 25-year low. (The restaurant is full again.) Yet so far inflation is quiescent. (The noise level is tolerable.) This is partly because exceptional productivity gains have made it possible for companies to pay higher wages without raising prices. (A sound-absorbing ceiling?) But it is also because, for reasons that nobody fully understands, workers have been remarkably diffident about demanding higher wages, even in the face of labor shortages. (Diners have mysteriously become more polite?) Everyone is happy. But will the very exuberance of the diners bring the bad old days back?
That's what Greenspan is worried about. What he said to the bankers was, in effect, that no matter how good the acoustics, no matter how well behaved the customers, if the restaurant gets sufficiently crowded there will be a shouting match. And if that happens -- well, he'll just have to limit the number of patrons. It's not that he is mean-spirited or a tool of capitalist oppression; he's just doing his job. But you still have to wonder whether it was a good idea to describe that job so explicitly and so honestly.
For there is, when you come down to it, always something slightly unsavory about the business of central banking. A market economy -- even the Goldilocks economy of America in the 90's -- requires that a certain number of people who want to work be unable to find jobs so that their example will discipline the wage demands of those who are already employed. Even liberal economists like myself grudgingly accept the conclusion that a responsible Fed must sometimes raise interest rates in order to limit the number of jobs and maintain a suitably high rate of unemployment. But the scene remains an ugly one: when the Fed acts to cool off an overheated economy, what that literally means is that a group of comfortable men and women in suits are deliberately acting to limit the job prospects of some of their worst-off fellow citizens.
How is one supposed to explain that scene to the general public? Many of Greenspan's counterparts deal with the ugliness by denying that it exists -- by denying that they have any influence over employment at all. Greenspan, to his credit, tells the truth about what he does, but until now, he has done it in a way that only the cognoscenti can understand. Well, now he has said it clearly. But is America ready to hear it?

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Two Plays Illuminate Each Other and Their Author

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY 

 BODY:
THE British playwright David Hare, now at the Booth Theater in "Via Dolorosa," his own one-man play about the Arab-Israeli stalemate, reports with some amused chagrin Dame Judi Dench's response to his performance, which marks his debut as a professional actor. A few blocks away, Dame Judi, a longtime pro and a legitimate Dame, is starring in Mr. Hare's "Amy's View" at the Ethel Barrymore. Though both productions were hits in London earlier, Dame Judi apparently hadn't had a chance to catch "Via Dolorosa" until she came to New York.
"She's been saying to me for some time now," Mr. Hare told James Barron of The New York Times, "that I must write a play in which we can act" together. Though after seeing "Via Dolorosa," he said, she seemed to have cooled on the idea. 
 "Mmm," Mr. Hare quoted her as having said, "I don't think I want to be in a play with you. You don't act. There's not a single choice you make in the course of an evening that any professional actor would make. It's moving, but I don't feel that what I do and what you do have any professional kinship."
This sounds very much like good-natured ribbing from an admiring star who may have received a certain amount of constructive criticism from the playwright during rehearsals, possibly through Richard Eyre, the director.
Yet it also calls attention to Mr. Hare's approach to theater and, indeed, to the vast differences between "Via Dolorosa" and to virtually every other Hare play American audiences have had the opportunity to see. That would recently include not only "Amy's View," but also "The Judas Kiss," a consideration of the fate of Oscar Wilde, which opened in New York just a year ago, and, to a somewhat lesser extent, "The Blue Room." This is the playwright's chilly, sardonic variation on "La Ronde," the Schnitzler classic, in which a discreetly nude Nicole Kidman helped to sell out a limited Broadway engagement earlier this season.
Seldom has the latest work of an established playwright been available in such quantity on Broadway within such a short period of time. For many of us, it has been a learning experience of the sort that only repertory theaters can offer. It is as if Mr. Hare had decided to supplement three more or less conventional plays ("Amy's View," "The Blue Room" and "The Judas Kiss") with a fascinating, extended career footnote ("Via Dolorosa"). For the first time, he allows us free entry into the mind -- the playwright's hidden storage vault -- where he keeps the raw material that later goes into his plays.
In fact, of course, "Via Dolorosa" is no footnote. It is a major work in its own right: not fiction but reportage, being Mr. Hare's first-person account of his three fact-finding trips to Israel and the West Bank when he was pondering the writing of a play to illustrate the problems there. Somewhere along the way, however, he decided that what he calls "theater of fiction" would not be adequate to the task.
Instead, he wrote a 90-minute monologue in which he, as himself, an uncommitted, skeptical outsider, a native of a land where passion has become theoretical, reports on the religious, ethnic, social and economic contradictions that have led to this most passionate of stalemates.
Dame Judi is right. Mr. Hare doesn't portray himself with the skill and nuances that a pro might bring to the role, which is all to the good. There is nothing seductive about his performance that might distance the audience from the full import of what he is saying. Yet he brings to intense, dramatic life the dozens of remarkable characters he meets en route, all the while keeping up a running commentary of his own thoughts, which issue from a mind infinitely curious and committed only to common sense and justice. Such are the luxuries, he acknowledges, available to the outsider passing through.
Now, New Yorkers have the luxury of seeing "Amy's View" and "Via Dolorosa" back to back in such a way that each serves to illuminate the other. You have to make your plans quickly, though: "Via Dolorosa," which is directed by Stephen Daldry, closes on June 13.
In "Amy's View," Mr. Hare has created fictional characters into which, like a ventriloquist, he throws his disguised voice to make points that are often dramatic but not always consistent with the characters who express them. On the other hand, there is never any doubt in "Via Dolorosa" about the validity of the characters or about the playwright's reactions to them. Writing in the first person, he is a superb reporter with a gift for locating the vivid detail.
"Amy's View" is an updated version of the kind of star vehicle I associate with the pre-World War II American theater. That was when actresses on the order of Katherine Cornell, Tallulah Bankhead and Ina Claire wouldn't be caught dead onstage at the curtain's rise, but would make great, sweeping dramatic entrances intended to provoke adoring applause.
Dame Judi's entrance in "Amy's View" is not quite so self-conscious, but the buildup for it is perfectly timed and the response to it warm. The performance that follows is big, showy and, I suspect, infinitely satisfying to American audiences. They are ready to salute the star who played Queen Victoria in "Mrs. Brown" (for which she should have received the Oscar last year) and this year's Oscar-winning best-supporting actress for "Shakespeare in Love," in which she plays Queen Elizabeth I.
Dame Judi doesn't disappoint. Mr. Hare has written a rich role for her in "Amy's View": Esme Allen, a great, dedicated star of the London theater whose daughter, Amy, falls fatally in love with a young man named Dominic who represents everything crass in contemporary culture. In the 16 years covered by the play, Dominic, a part-time correspondent for tabloid journals, hustles his way first to celebrity as a television arts critic and then to financial and critical success as a director of movies that are described as if they might be Quentin Tarantino spinoffs.
"Amy's View" is actually about more things than can easily be absorbed in one viewing, though it reads more coherently than it plays. Among other things, it's about Esme's abiding faith in the theater as opposed to Dominic's commitment to getting ahead in the more popular arts. Theater is mind and conscience. Movies and television are pure sensation.
At the same time, Mr. Hare explores Esme's horror that Amy should marry Dominic in full acceptance of the fact that he can never love her to the degree that she loves him, which is a brief replay of the theme spelled out at somewhat greater length in "The Judas Kiss." Rapacious capitalism, as exemplified by Lloyd's of London, also figures prominently in a plot that seems to wander from one would-be big emotional scene to another until the end. At that point, magically, Mr. Hare delivers a coda that helps to make all that has gone before seem worthwhile.
Dame Judi is splendid and great fun to watch as an actress who is most actressy and out of touch in real life, whether dealing with those she loves or even with a bankruptcy that might send a more ordinary woman into a permanent nervous breakdown. Only at the end of "Amy's View," when she is about to go onstage in a hit play that has arrived late in her career, is the essence of the woman revealed. The scene is a stunner and is, I suspect, the reason that people come away from "Amy's View" with such fond feelings.
Except for Esme, none of the characters in the play has the startling authenticity of those recalled by Mr. Hare, acting David Hare, in "Via Dolorosa." Like so many characters in earlier Hare plays, those in "Amy's View" tend to sound like mouthpieces. Yet "Via Dolorosa" is so good that it invites us to attend to all his other work with greater care. It reveals the playwright to be a man of piercing wit, understanding and intelligence. "Amy's View" has the manner of a play that has been laboriously built and furnished, not out of creative urgency but out of a need to provide temporary shelter for the author's colleagues and himself.
It will be interesting to see if the critical success of "Via Dolorosa" has any effect on the direction Mr. Hare's work takes in the future. Most encouraging is the fact that he is still taking chances, still in the process of growing, still exploring new ways of expression. He is alive and well and restless.
 
'The Lonesome West'
I hope New York audiences don't fail "The Lonesome West," now at the Lyceum Theater. If anything, this third play in Martin McDonagh's Irish trilogy set in Leenane is more satisfying and less tricky than the initial installment, "The Beauty Queen of Leenane," which closed not long ago, having won Tonys for three of its actors and its director last season.
That Mr. McDonagh is still a young playwright (he is 29) is apparent in "The Lonesome West," which replays the manners and, to a certain extent, even the central situation of "Beauty Queen." However, the denouement of "The Lonesome West" does not depend on something as lame as an undelivered letter.
The setting is another dreary Godforsaken farmhouse in County Galway in the west of Ireland, inhabited this time by two aging bachelors, Coleman Connor (Maeliosa Stafford), a brutish lout, and his brother, Valene (Brian F. O'Byrne), a fussy fellow who collects plaster figurines of saints as his passport to heaven. The two deeply loathe each other but, at the start of the play, they have become forever locked together.
They have just buried their not so dear old dad, who died suddenly when Coleman, in a rage, shot him at point-blank range. In return for Valene's testimony that it was simply an unfortunate household accident, Coleman has deeded his brother his share of their father's money and is now dependent on the stingy Valene not only for his freedom, but also for food, drink and the clothes on his back.
Surveying all, aware of everything, but himself unable to cope with a parish where murder and other antisocial activities are endemic, is Father Welsh (David Ganly). He is a young man who, in a more shapely play, might have been its central figure. Welsh is not a comic character. He is a sweet-natured fellow who has gone into the church as a last resort. It's there, and it provides a living in a land not bursting with opportunity.
Father Welsh hangs around Coleman and Valene because they are free with their booze, and because he genuinely likes them. As the rest of the parish goes about its dark business, the priest drinks with Coleman and Valene and tries to save them from their mutual hatred. The only thing that frightens the priest more than the Leenane bloodshed is the adoring, openly available presence of Girleen Kelleher (Dawn Bradfield). She is a pretty young thing who, knowing Welsh's squeamishness about sex, can't resist talking dirty to him.
Though most of "The Lonesome West" is devoted to the furious sparring of Coleman and Valene, it is the ineffectual, alcoholic Father Welsh, a nascent independent thinker, who dominates the play. His gradual awakening to the hell he inhabits is the backbone of "The Lonesome West," providing a subtext for a work that otherwise would be merely the Irish equivalent to the kind of hillbilly cartoons Esquire used to run.
Garry Hynes, who staged "Beauty Queen," is also the director of "The Lonesome West," which is beautifully acted by Mr. Stafford, Mr. O'Byrne, Ms. Bradfield and, particularly, Mr. Ganly. Still to come: the second play in the Leenane Trilogy, "A Skull in Connemara."
In one way and another, Mr. McDonagh is out to destroy the old Hollywood vision that rural Ireland is a land of jolly, avuncular Barry Fitzgeralds. Mr. McDonagh's message: let your daughters run free, but lock up your firearms and all instruments blunt and sharp.
 
AMY'S VIEW (and VIA DOLOROSA)
Dame Judi Dench doesn't disappoint in a rich role, but David Hare's star vehicle creaks and does, unlike his own excellent solo show.
 
THE LONESOME WEST
A beautifully acted and satisfying return to the blackly comic Leenane Trilogy.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE;
A Multiplex of a Museum Turns On the Lights

BYLINE: By ANN WILSON LLOYD; Ann Wilson Lloyd's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was on the artist Teresita Fernandez.

DATELINE: NORTH ADAMS, Mass.

 BODY:
THE Visavox was a proto-television device developed here in the 1920's by the electronics wizard Frank Sprague, founder of the Sprague Electric Company. The appliance was more accurately a personal cinema, synchronizing sound and image for the first time, but awkwardly requiring you to stick your head up inside a box. Among Sprague's more successful products before the plant closed in 1986 were capacitors that enable radio, television and other appliances to spring to life at the flip of a switch.
This electronic trivia is relevant for the way it meshes with a new installation to be introduced here next Sunday by the video artist Tony Oursler. Titled "Optics" and aimed at investigating the origins of sound and light media, Mr. Oursler's new work was commissioned by the Williams College Museum of Art in nearby Williamstown and the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, called colloquially Mass MOCA, which is what the sprawling, former Sprague plant has become. 
 Mr. Oursler's work will have its premiere as part of Mass MOCA's long awaited opening, also next Sunday. After more than a decade of honing a workable formula, the institution -- five huge, 19th-century mill buildings out of 27 available at the site -- will become the Northeast's newest, and the nation's largest, contemporary museum and high-tech performance center. It will have a black-box theater that seats 650, an outdoor cinema and courtyards filled with artists' installations and sound works. Joseph Thompson, Mass MOCA's director, calls the place a cultural laboratory. His ambitious, multifaceted concept would probably do Frank Sprague proud.
It was serendipitous timing that Mr. Oursler was chosen to help inaugurate Mass MOCA, said Deborah Rothschild, the curator of the Williams College Museum, where Mr. Oursler's midcareer traveling survey is on view though Oct. 24. "We were looking for a way to collaborate with Mass MOCA and also for a way to allow Tony to make new work," Ms. Rothschild said. "His work is appealing on many levels; it's lively and actively involves the audience. We thought it would fit Mass MOCA's combined purposes well."
Mr. Oursler calls "Optics" his audiovisual treatise on a spectrum of phenomena -- mythology, the origins of science, early distrust of theatrical entertainments and the mysteries of sound and light. "All these came together for me in this installation," he said. "I wanted to create a loose chain of optics, mimicking, for instance, how TV takes light and turns it into electricity, and then into a coded signal, which is then represented to the viewer who decodes it again culturally."
Though not finished as of this writing, Mr. Oursler's new work promises to be a departure from what his audience knows best: projections of hectoring, neurotic characters onto puppets and rag dolls; whining, talking heads and disembodied blinking eyeballs that simulate a psycho ward of sadly funny misfits. About two dozen of these characteristic pieces are on view at the Williams College Museum exhibition, where some of his earliest television installations have also been reconstructed, revealing, in their haphazard quirkiness, the roots of Mr. Oursler's obsessions.
If Mr. Oursler has pulled back from television specifically, and from examining our complicities with the electronic personas that demonically invade our lives, his refocus on proto-media has flushed devils out of the historical details. Part of his installation at Mass MOCA will feature small glass Lucifers lurking around various lighting devices and drawing attention to the odd behavior of light. One little devil appears to be crawling into a utility lamp, mischievously leading one's eye into the glare. Viewed indirectly, the light seems to pop out the tip of his tail.
Devils cropped up everywhere when Mr. Oursler researched early sound and light experiments, he said. Part of his installation will include a homemade camera obscura with a hand-ground lens. Through it, people are rendered as small, fuzzy, moving figures that, apart from being upside down, are akin to early television figures. The history of the camera obscura, traceable to the 13th century, depicts engravings of cavorting devils in the imagery, Mr. Oursler said: "Somehow they connected devils with the lens transparency. To me, that connects to Lucifer as light, and the battle we've had with media that goes on to this day."
Inspired by early films in which moral dilemmas are often portrayed by devils wrestling angels, he is shooting a video of two costumed friends battling it out amid puffs of smoke and other primitive theatrics. Other segments of Mr. Oursler's installation will include a new video projection in which a camera interacts with aberrant light that causes auras or coronas around figures, effects that filmmakers try to eliminate. Mr. Oursler plans to remove the figures and keep the mystical-looking flares. A digitally animated video of morphing imagery, to be projected on arranged objects, is also under development. "It will be a frieze based on a kind of meta-history of technology, almost a W.P.A. mural based on sensory research," he said.
The video was made in collaboration with the digital-animation firm Kleiser-Walczak Construction Company, one of Mass MOCA's newly installed commercial tenants, and another reason the Williams College Museum wanted Mr. Oursler to be able to develop new work at Mass MOCA. Kleiser-Walczak, formerly based in California, produced the special effects for the 3-D opera "Monsters of Grace," by Philip Glass and Robert Wilson, which will be presented at Mass MOCA on July 17. (The full summer programming is available on the Internet at www.massmoca.org.)
Down the vast hallways from Mr. Oursler's new piece are newly installed monumental works, few of them ever likely to fit into conventional museums. Robert Rauschenberg's marathon painting, "1/4 Mile or 2 Furlong Piece" (1984-1999), lent by the artist, has its own gallery the length of a football field. Large, rarely seen works by John Chamberlain, Joseph Beuys, Bruce Nauman, James Rosenquist, Mario Merz, Dan Flavin and Carl Andre, are also on loan for various tenures from several institutions.
These galleries represent what remains of Mass MOCA's original plan to be a home for oversize contemporary art that Thomas Krens envisioned here back in 1985. Mr. Krens, who became director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, headed the Williams College Museum of Art at the time. As Mass MOCA's mission evolved over the years, the Guggenheim's role gradually diminished. It is now simply one of several lenders of large artworks, said Mr. Thompson, who is also an alumnus of the Williams College Museum.
These rooms, large enough to swallow up art leviathans, are themselves a grand spectacle finessed back from near ruin by the architectural firm Bruner/Cott & Associates of Cambridge, Mass. Practicing minimal intervention, their efforts, in one vast gallery, include a center row of old wooden support posts chopped into stubs left hanging from the ceiling like a spine. These are spanned by interlacing steel cables creating a graceful trussed ceiling. Throughout, a century-old patina of paint and fugitive markings denote former rooms, floor levels, doors and windows that bear elegant witness to the past. If romance can be mined from America's industrial age, the mother lode is here.
Around 100,000 square feet of space will eventually be leased to compatible commercial tenants, like Kleiser-Walczak, generating up to $1.2 million a year, Mr. Thompson said, to offset operating costs. Revenues from the performances will help, though the cultural economy here is seasonal, and Mass MOCA's avant-garde programming unproven as a draw.
Additional visual art that Mr. Thompson has commissioned for Mass MOCA is, like Mr. Oursler's, in keeping with the museum's revised mission as a place for experimental new media and cross-disciplinary investigations. "Ghost Catching," a video installation of images of the dancer Bill T. Jones digitally multiplied into an ensemble is a prime example. Others are off site and temporary, like billboards by Sue Coe, Gary Simmons and Leon Golub, placed along nearby highways; some will become part of Mass MOCA's somewhat ephemeral collection.
These include two sound pieces from previous exhibitions that already exist and a new work, "Music for a Quarry," by Walter Fahndrich, in an abandoned marble works outside town. Others are "The Visitations," an installation by Ron Kuivila in an unrenovated building that was left with dropped tools and rusting equipment still in place, and "Tree Logic," a large outdoor piece by Natalie Jeremijenko sure to make arborists cringe. Six trees have been strung up in high rigging, roots skyward in containers, where they are expected to pit gravity against phototropic forces.
Back up in Mr. Oursler's galleries, he tells the tale of the so-called "lightning room" during Sprague's occupation of the site. It was where electronic components were jolted by thunderbolts to see how they stood up. Residents of North Adams recall seeing flashes through the lightning room's glass-block wall as they drove past, invoking a mad-scientist scenario that the artist relishes. "This was a room I couldn't refuse," Mr. Oursler says.

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/The Andrew Freedman Home;
A Retirement Home Built for the Formerly Wealthy

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
IT is the Grand Concourse's grandest building, a broad limestone palazzo set back behind a wide grassy lawn between 166th and McClellan Streets in the Bronx. But the building, paid for by the somewhat mysterious Andrew Freedman, is not a mansion or a museum. It is a home for the elderly, and it has an unusual history. The 1924 building, the Andrew Freedman Home, operated by the Mid-Bronx Senior Citizens Council, has its own signs of age, and of rejuvenation.
 By the turn of the century Andrew Freedman was a millionaire, but it wasn't clear just how he became one. He had been involved in real estate and subway financing, owned the New York Giants baseball team and was a close associate of the Tammany Hall boss Richard Croker. But Freedman's entry in the authoritative Dictionary of American Biography ventures only that "by ways that are no longer traceable he achieved a conspicuous success." 
 Freedman died in 1915 in his private apartment at Sherry's, a restaurant-hotel at 44th Street and Fifth Avenue, unmarried and without children. His will left the bulk of his $7 million estate to establish a retirement home not for the poor, but for those who had been wealthy but had suffered reverses. His sister, Isabella, explained to The New York Times that Freedman believed that "worthy habits and traditions of affluence and refinement deserve recognition and respect."
His will was drawn up in 1907, and some accounts say that the financial panic of that year damaged Freedman's finances and made him contemplate how easily he could have been reduced to poverty.
The trustees of what became known as the Andrew Freedman Home retained the architects Joseph H. Freedlander and Harry Allan Jacobs to design a broad four-story-plus-basement structure set on an elevated platform. The main floor contained a card room, library, parlor, dining room and related rooms, the interior designed by L. Alavoine & Company, a French decorating concern. The entertaining rooms were as grand as many private clubs of the period, and the guest rooms upstairs compared favorably with the scale and finishes of Park Avenue apartment houses of the time.
Finished in 1924, the Andrew Freedman Home accepted only 14 of the first 84 applications. Two wings were added in 1931, designed in matching style by the architect David Levy.
In a 1933 article in The New Yorker, Geoffrey Hellman noted that servants made the beds of the residents, dusted the furniture and cooked the meals. He noted that the residents included a stockbroker who had made $160,000 a year, but that most were doctors, lawyers and ministers who enjoyed "sofas that couldn't be more overstuffed if they were in the Union League Club."
"Ceilings are high," Hellman wrote, "carpets deep, and it seems incongruous to look out the windows and see, across the lawn, the nondescript traffic of the Grand Concourse. Somehow you expect to see limousines." There were 50 employees for the 129 residents, paid for out of the Freedman Home's endowment income of $150,000 a year.
In the 1960's operating costs exceeded income, and by the 1970's the Home started charging for its accommodations. In 1974 the Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the building over the trustees' objections, but the designation was overturned by the Board of Estimate.
IN 1984 the Mid-Bronx Senior Citizens Council purchased the building, and now it offers the elderly -- whether or not they were formerly wealthy -- lodging on the second floor and the use of the main rooms on the main floor. The council also agreed to landmark designation in 1992. The third and fourth floors are unoccupied, but the council has renovated the basement -- which is open at the rear because of the slope of the site -- with a commercial mortgage and $600,000 in state grants.
Now it rents the basement to a Head Start program and a family preservation program, using the combined rent to pay the mortgage interest. "There is nothing left over," said Zenon Arribalzaga, deputy director of the council.
The council has also worked with Thomas Navin, an architect and garden designer, to redo the entire front lawn and the planting beds, with a $188,000 Urban Resources Partnership grant.
Mr. Navin relocated plantings away from the base of the steps -- where they were distant from the sidewalk and could not be seen from inside the home -- out to the property line. "I was thinking of the winter, when people who couldn't come out could look out the window," he said.
He also cleared out later growth from the center of the front lawn -- where it blocked the view of the building -- and established curved walkways and seating areas. The Head Start children come up to the garden to learn about the different plants over the course of the year.
MR. NAVIN'S work is implemented by Mark Hill, a horticulturalist hired by the council with the grant. Mr. Hill maintains the garden and invites the public to visit. The gate is open during daylight hours and Mr. Hill offers tours to anyone who calls the home at (718) 293-8100.
Part of the council's goal was to have year-round planting. The colors of the irises and lilac now in bloom will be succeeded by hydrangeas, lilies and liriope in the summer, mums and peonies in the fall and witch hazel, yellow twig dogwood and cherry in the winter.
The garden is flourishing, but the terrace masonry is cracking, the wooden windows are rotting and the upper sections of the building show signs of water penetration. Mr. Arribalzaga said that returning the Andrew Freedman Home to good repair is an uphill battle.
The Mid-Bronx Senior Citizens Council would like to open up the top two floors for additional community programs, but doing so would require a new elevator -- at a cost of at least $100,000, Mr. Arribalzaga said, plus the costs associated with refitting the floors. The Andrew Freedman Home grows older and older, with no retirement in sight.

HEADLINE: Making the Best of a Congested Bridge

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
IF the thought of being in Friday afternoon or Sunday evening summer traffic heading across the Tappan Zee Bridge makes you shudder, here is some advice from the experts:
*Get an E-Z Pass. 
 *Get a good pair of sunglasses.
*Get an E-Z Pass.
*Avoid traveling in prime time.
*Consider alternative Hudson River crossings.
*Get an E-Z Pass.
The Tappan Zee Bridge, opened in 1955, draws about 47 million vehicles each year, with average daily traffic of 130,000. On holidays and summer weekends, expect more, much more.
On Friday afternoons in the summer, said Nancy K. Finger of Elmsford, who lives near Interstate 287, an approach to the bridge, "Get yourself a good book if you're trying to go across the bridge."
Officially the Gov. Malcolm Wilson Tappan Zee Bridge -- almost no one calls it that -- the 3.03-mile-long span, seven lanes wide, is the only bridge that crosses the Hudson River between Westchester County, where it connects with the Cross Westchester Expressway (I-287), and Rockland County.
High volume on the Cross Westchester, the only east-west highway that traverses the county, has a strong impact on bridge traffic. The expressway splits the eastbound and westbound sides of Westchester Avenue, called the Platinum Mile because of its many large corporations. Even when employees do not cross the bridge -- for example, they might be going to or from White Plains or one of the county's other parkways that link with the expressway -- they collectively clog the roads that lead to the bridge.
Add an accident or bad weather and traffic can be at a turtle's pace on the road's six lanes (three in each direction).
An added contributor to bridge congestion this year is the new Palisades Mall in Nyack in Rockland County, attracting customers to stores not present in Westchester.
Laurie A. Smith of Elmsford regularly goes to the Jersey Shore in the summer. "It's a question of do we want to creep across the Tappan Zee or chance the G.W.," she said, referring to the George Washington Bridge. "I usually will take the Tappan Zee and literally crawl across it, or try to leave before noon on Friday."
She added: "You plan your whole return trip around what time you think you will be going across the bridge. On Sundays we try to come back by 11 A.M., or even come back Saturday nights."
Roberta A. Klumpp of Greenburgh said that as a "reverse commuter" who heads toward Rockland when the mass of traffic is Westchester-bound, she has encountered few major delays on the bridge getting to her teaching job in Nanuet. "But when I look in the other direction and see the backup, I say, 'Thank God, I'm not going that way,' " she said.
Last year, on Thursday, July 2, the start of the Fourth of July holiday, 79,000 vehicles crossed the bridge in each direction (for a total of almost 160,000). On Labor Day weekend last year, between noon and 3 P.M., 16,499 crossed the bridge northbound, compared with 14,104 during a similar time on Friday, April 17, a nonholiday weekend.
Even on nonholiday summer weekends traffic can build up, particularly southbound (toward Westchester), where the toll is collected; 82,563 crossed the bridge from Rockland last July 24, a Friday; 77,316 on the following Sunday.
"The traffic gets quite bad on summer weekends, particularly Friday evenings and Sunday evenings," said Mark Kulewicz, the director of traffic engineering and safety for the Automobile Club of New York. "That's from the crush of people who are headed on vacations or holiday weekends."
But, he observed, what is bad news for summer vacationers can be good news for regular commuters. "The regular traffic congestion for commuters in the morning and evenings tends to lighten up a bit," he said.
Jim Volpe, owner of the Wedge Service Station in Tarrytown, on Route 119 near the bridge, agreed. "The morning and evening commutes Monday through Thursday are easier in the summer," he said. "There is no waiting."
Mr. Volpe, who for four years until recently commuted to his station from Rockland, added: "Unless there is an accident. Then my service station gets swamped because a lot of people coming from Rockland get off the expressway, to take a short cut near my station and stop for soda or gas."
Officials of the State Thruway Authority, which owns and operates the bridge, say that a continuing $28 million project to rehabilitate the bridge should not have much impact on bridge users because lane restrictions will occur during off-peak hours only and closings will not be permitted during commuter or holiday travel times. Most of the work, to resurface the bridge, will take place at night and require lane closings in the evening.
A number of people interviewed said that there was actually less congestion on the Tappan Zee Bridge these days than there was a few years ago because of the growing use of E-Z Pass and the reversible lane median barriers. Also helpful are additional toll stations. There are 13 toll stations, 6 of them tandem, meaning they can serve two vehicles at a time. Three tandems were added in the late 80's and the other three in the early 90's.
"Our delays have been less; they never reach the other side of the bridge" except when there is an accident, said Mary Ann Meola, a former toll taker who is now the toll division manager for the Thruway Authority. "I would say our maximum delay is 30 minutes to get across the bridge, and that's very unusual. We're able to push vehicles through much faster than ever."
Users of E-Z Pass prepay their tolls and are given a small electronic gadget, which is taped or held inside the front windshield near the rear-view mirror. As they pass through the tollbooth at 5 miles an hour, their account is debited. "I wouldn't go across any bridge without an E-Z Pass," said Barbara A. Policastro of Pleasantville, adding that she uses her E-Z Pass on other bridges.
At the Tappan Zee Bridge, about three-quarters of all vehicles use E-Z Pass during peak commuter hours. But the number is half that during summer weekend and vacation getaway times -- something the Thruway Authority would like to change. "We are aggressively marketing E-Z Pass," said Howard E. Steinberg, the former chairman of the Thruway Authority. "It makes a tremendous difference."
Frequent bridge crossers get another benefit: 17 trips a month for $17, instead of $3 each trip. For further information or an application for E-Z Pass, call(800) 222-8655 or go to the Authority's Web site (www.thruway.state.ny.us/ezpass/ index.html).
The reversible lane median barrier on the bridge "has been a blessing," Mr. Kulewicz of the Automobile Club said. Twice a day since 1993, transfer machines move a 3-mile chain of barriers 12 feet across the bridge. This changes the traffic direction for the center lane, so that a fourth lane can be added in the direction that most traffic is headed (toward Westchester in the morning rush period, toward Rockland in the evening rush). The transfer machines travel at 3.5 miles an hour and make the 12-foot transfer of the seven million pounds of concrete barrier in about 60 minutes, according to Barrier Systems Inc., the company that installed it.
Mrs. Finger, the Elmsford resident, said that traffic actually slows down while the changeover is under way.
It is people's inability to see that causes some other bridge slowdowns, Mr. Kulewicz said. "Sun glare is a tremendous problem," he said, observing that it affects those going toward Westchester in the morning and those leaving the county in the afternoon. "Get a good pair of sunglasses," he advised.
Other advice he offered was consideration of alternatives to the Tappan Zee Bridge. "It depends on where you're going," he said. "You can use the Taconic Parkway to go south. There are a number of other Hudson River crossings. You can cross on I-84 at the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge, or take the Bear Mountain Bridge or cross at Rhinebeck."
And what of the future? Jessica Astrof, the New York project coordinator for the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, an alliance of public interest, transit advocacy, planning and environmental groups, said: "There is an obvious need to solve the problem of congestion on the bridge. It's hurting the region's economy as well as its environment."
The alliance supports a multipronged approach, she said, a cornerstone of which is "congestion relief pricing" -- charging vehicles different toll amounts, more in prime time, less in off-peak hours. "This is a very cost-effective strategy, and the revenues could then finance more public transportation," she said, adding that the Thruway Authority is soon expected to complete a yearlong study of this option.
Mr. Kulewicz of the Automobile Club rejected this idea, however, saying: "We oppose any increase in tolls. Congestion pricing is unproven."
Past suggestions, for a new bridge or for I-287 to be widened to accommodate a high-occupancy-vehicle lane, are off the drawing board because of intense local and political opposition, the Thruway Authority said.

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
Providing Modest-Income Assisted-Living Units

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
WITH its ballooning population of residents 60 years of age and older, New Jersey has become fertile ground for all types of housing for the elderly, especially assisted-living residences, which offer apartment living with meals, social services and personal care.
As of January, 9,671 such units in 113 projects have been or are being built. Some 28,908 more units in 326 projects are planned, according to the state's Department of Health and Senior Service, which began licensing assisted-living developments four years ago. 
 Most of the projects, where the average age of tenants is 75, are being built for affluent residents. Now a small group of developers, with financial assistance from the state, are putting up projects in which at least 20 percent of the residences are reserved for people with annual incomes of 50 to 80 percent of an area's median income.
The financial help is coming primarily from two semi-autonomous state agencies -- the Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency and the Economic Development Authority. The agencies, using money raised through the sale of taxable and tax-exempt bonds, provide construction and/or permanent loans at or below market interest rates to developers.
"We are striving to insure older New Jerseyans have the opportunity to age in place and access to a residential setting with the services needed to maintain an independent lifestyle that is within their means, " said Deborah De Santis, executive director of the housing finance agency.
In the three years since both agencies began offering such loans they have provided $270 million in financing for nearly 2,000 units in 20 projects either built or under way. At least 20 percent of the units will be for those with incomes below an area's median.
Some of the projects offer assisted-living residences with wings for residents with Alzheimer's disease or with independent-living units as well. Developers who accept Medicaid-eligible residents into their projects can also apply to the state for Medicaid vouchers for qualified residents -- those 65 or over with a monthly income of no more than $1,500. The vouchers, valued at $40 to $60 a day, help write down costs of services. The state has allocated 350 of the available 1,500 vouchers.
"The problem has been getting developers to accept the vouchers since the the state's first developers of assisted-living projects have been reaching out for the middle- to high-income elderly," said Andrew P. Aronson, director of longterm care licensing and certification at the state's Department of Health. "The challenge is to spread the housing to people of all economic levels."
To that end a bill was recently introduced that would require developers of licensed assisted-living residences to set aside 10 percent of their units for Medicaid-eligible residents. The measure is now in committees in both houses of the Legislature.
At the same time, the New Jersey Association of Health Care Facilities in Trenton, which along with other groups is concerned about overbuilding in the state, is advocating more government oversight. The aim, said Rick Abrams, president of the association, is to devise a system that makes sure that the growth of the assisted-living industry is both "orderly and meets the demographic, geographic and economic needs of the state's elderly residents."
One way to address those concerns, he said , would be to revise the state's way of reviewing assisted-living projects. The current 90-day review process primarily looks at a developer's record in running such properties.
A state commission has been formed to study the current review process and come up with recommendations in 10 months on whether to retain or modify it. Meanwhile, the housing finance agency, also worried that supply may be outpacing demand, is considering ways to direct the financing that it and other state agencies provide to avoid saturating areas, yet still encourage construction of assisted-living units affordable to people with modest incomes.
DEVELOPERS building such units believe they will fill a niche in the market. Yet, even with state assistance, getting the economics to work is difficult and often involves piecing together several different financing sources.
That is the case at the Clare Estate in Bordentown in Burlington County, where renovation and new construction are to get under way next month. The complex will have 105 assisted-living units, including 50 for people with Alzheimer's disease, in a restored 1885 monastery.
There will also be 36 independent-living units in nine buildings to be built on the grounds of the former nine-acre campus of the Sisters of Poor Clare, a Roman Catholic order of cloistered nuns. The complex is in the downtown, a designated historic district of the one-square-mile city.
Forty-six of the units will be affordable to residents whose incomes are 50 to 80 percent of the area's median income. The area's median income for a one-person household is $38,920 and $44,480 for a two-person household.
The state's housing finance agency provided $14.2 million in low-interest loans for the $16-million project, which also received $1.2 million in Federal tax credits for rehabilitation of historic structures. The rest came from private sources and the developer's own equity. The city also granted the project a 30-year real estate tax abatement, tying taxes to profits, rather than the value of the property.
"Nobody is paying attention to the affordable assisted-living market," said Christiana Foglio, president of Community Investment Strategies, of New Brunswick, the developer. "We came up with a strategy that will produce low- and moderate-income units and keep the price of the market-rate units reasonable."
The key, she said, is to use public financing to create the housing, allowing the market-rate units to, in effect, help subsidize the modest-income units.
Services also vary for the subsidized and unsubsidized units. While residents of both receive a general package, including three meals a day, help with bathing and dressing and transportation, those in the market-rate units get more medical-related assistance and weekly housekeeping.
The 55 units in the monastery, eight for low-income tenants, will range in size from 350 square feet for the private units to 450 square feet for shared ones. Monthly rents, including meals and services, are $463 for the modest-income units and $2,200 to $2,800 for the market-rate ones. The fees for the Alzheimer units will be $3,400 a month and include all services.
All of the independent-living units, with 600 square feet each, will be for modest-income residents and rent for $495 to $590 a month. Meals and services will be offered to residents for a yet to be determined fee, said Ms. Foglio.
She said she hoped to repeat the formula for other projects her company has planned in the state. One with 130 units, 61 of them for modest-income people, is in Cherry Hill.
In Edison, work is winding down on the Heritage at Clara Barton on 4.2 acres on Amboy Avenue, just west of Route 1. It has 27 independent-living units and 84 assisted-living units. Twenty percent of the latter are for residents earning no more than 50 percent of the area's median income, or $26,850 for a single person and $30,700 for a two-person household. All of the units will be in a renovated three-story former school built in the 20's and an interconnected new building of the same size.
The $17.6-million project is being developed by Pennrose Properties of Philadelphia using $12.2 million in financing from the state's Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency. Edison also provided a low-interest $500,000 loan and granted the project a tax abatement also tied to profits as opposed to property value.
"The market is totally untapped for these units," said Charles M. Lewis, assistant vice president at Pennrose, referring to subsidized apartments. "But without the public financing we wouldn't be able to do it." The financing also helped lower rents on the market-rate units, he added.
The 84 assisted-living units, with 450 to 840 square feet, will be in the old school and the two upper floor of the new building. Residents will receive three meals a day, transportation, housekeeping and personal care. Rents for the modest-income units, including all services, will be $1,700 to $1,821. Some of those units will be made available to Medicaid-eligible people, said Mr. Lewis. Monthly rents for the market-rate units will be $2,400 to $3,400.
The fees for the 27 uniform-size independent-living units will be $765 to $984, he said, adding that the services would be available as options to those residents. Occupancy is to begin next month.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property /Trinity Real Estate;
Longtime Landlord Ponders Becoming a Developer

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
AS the subsidiary of an institution that is 302 years old, Trinity Real Estate tends to take the long view of things. For the last decade and a half it has been transforming most of the 5.5 million square feet of industrial buildings it acquired -- unwillingly -- during the 1930's into office space.
Now it is about to take the next step: development. Executives of the unit of the Parish of Trinity Church have selected four properties that can be demolished or totally remodeled into 2 million square feet of new offices. 
 Not that anyone is getting carried away. These projects are not likely to be built on speculation. Tenants, in most cases, will have to sign leases for a substantial share of each building before a spade goes into the ground.
"We are not risk takers," said Joseph T. Palombi, executive vice president of real estate for Trinity Church. "The only way we are going ahead with these projects is if we have tenants for 60 percent or more of the space."
Nevertheless, he said, the time is ripe for development by a company that owns its building sites, does not need zoning changes and is in an area that has proven attractive to the computer- and Internet-related companies that have been multiplying in recent years.
Handling architects' renderings of new buildings is an unusual sensation for managers of a portfolio of former lofts and factories clustered near the Holland Tunnel that until the early 1990's mostly housed printing companies. The buildings are a lingering legacy of a gift of 215 acres of land by England's Queen Anne in 1705 that is now generally thought of as the west side of lower Manhattan.
Most of the royally deeded land was sold or given away over the intervening centuries to found churches, hospitals and an educational institution now known as Columbia University. As New York industrialized in the early part of the 1900's, the church allowed developers to build sturdy factory buildings, most of them occupied by printing companies eager to be close to their financial industry clients on Wall Street.
Trinity retained ownership of the land and simply collected the ground rent until the Depression of the 1930's. The collapse of the economy left tenants unable to make mortgage and tax payments and the church was forced to take title to the properties to avoid losing them to lenders or the city. The debt it assumed was not retired until the 1960's.
By the mid-1980's, Trinity's real estate managers decided they did not want to be in a printing business that was clearly in longterm decline with the advent of electronic communications. They began remodeling the industrial buildings to attract office tenants, particularly the new-media and other computer-related companies that were springing up in the city.
Companies like these were not interested in the supposed prestige and high cost of midtown Manhattan. They installed open space layouts and strung the multitude of wires needed for connections in overhead racks and got to work.
That conversion process is still under way.
Trinity is renovating a triangular, 1.1 million square foot building bounded by Canal, Varick and Watts Streets for office use by enlarging the lobby, replacing elevators, bringing in additional electrical power and telecommunications and installing new windows to shut out the din of traffic at the Holland Tunnel.
Once known as 75 Varick Street, the building has been renamed 1 Hudson Square as part of an effort to put a brand name on the Trinity portfolio.
The proposed development projects include one large building that would occupy the entire block bounded by Hudson, Varick, Spring and Vandam Streets and three more modest undertakings.
Mr. Palombi said the low vacancy rates and the dearth of new construction in the city has convinced Trinity's leaders that there will be tenants eager to occupy brand new space. And because the church owns the land, it can charge lower rents than are possible in situations where a third party landowner is part of the equation.
"We figure that we have a $15 to $20 a square foot advantage over comparable space in midtown," he said, referring to projected annual rents. "That adds up to a big number over a period of years."
HE said that a 1.2 million square foot building could be erected on the site, which is currently occupied with smaller, Trinity-owned structures, without the need for a change in zoning. Because the building, to be designated 4 Hudson Square, would cost from $260 million to $300 million to build, the church will not proceed without a lease, and possibly financial participation, from a tenant whose solid credit will enable economical borrowing.
"Our fantasy is that a company like AT&T or I.B.M. will take the entire building," said Stephen D. Heyman, the director of commercial leasing for Trinity.
Mr. Palombi said that while Trinity will be the owner of the building, the church will hire a developer to supervise the detailed planning and construction.
One of the buildings on the site, 304 Hudson Street, which is 85 percent occupied, largely by information technology tenants, may be incorporated in the larger structure, but smaller buildings facing Varick Street are likely to be demolished, he said.
If a suitable tenant can be found soon, the building could be ready for occupancy by early 2003.
The remaining 800,000 square feet of potential development is divided among three projects. One is at 330 Hudson, to be designated 6 Hudson Square, which occupies the western half of the block bounded by Hudson, Varick, Vandam and Charlton Streets. The building is occupied by a document storage company, but Trinity officials said there is an opportunity to terminate the lease in about a year.
The plan here would be to strip the building down to its steel frame, use an alley in back to install a modern core and add four floors to the top, expanding it to 425,000 square feet. Once again, Trinity officials say they can make the alterations within existing zoning, a situation that is called "as of right" in the industry.
Because no foundation work will be involved, Trinity officials say they will be able to deliver what will amount to a new building quicker and cheaper, possibly by the end of 2002. "We may do this one without a tenant," said Mr. Palombi, who noted that the building would offer new space at a rental rate in the mid-30's per square foot annually compared to $45 a square foot and above for older space in midtown.
A small parking lot and garage to the east of the building at 345 Hudson Street, now known as 555 Greenwich Street, would be replaced with a slender building that has been designated 7 Hudson Square. The building could rise as much as 15 stories with 220,000 square feet of space. The building is being designed so that its floors match up with the Trinity-owned 345 Hudson, so that tenants in the Hudson Street building could expand via connections with the new structure.
An unused automobile service station adjacent to a Trinity property at 100 Avenue of the Americas would be converted into a six-story office building with 23,000 square feet of office space that could be connected to the larger structure.
In addition to the new building, Trinity officials said there is an opportunity to add 50,000 square feet of penthouse space to the building at 350 Hudson Street.
Trinity officials say the benefits of the new buildings will be greater than the rents they can collect on the added space. New, Class A buildings, they say, will enhance the entire portfolio by enhancing the image of the neighborhood.
"Our interest in developing these building goes beyond any individual project," Mr. Heyman said. "These developments will raise the value of the other space in the area."
He said the area began its transformation from light manufacturing to office when the Saatchi & Saatchi advertising agency moved into a new building at 375 Hudson Street in the mid-1980's. Although Trinity does not own the building, which was built by Tishman Speyer Properties, the company that controls Rockefeller Center, the church benefits from more than the changed image the building brought to the area.
"We," Mr. Palombi said, "own the land.".

HEADLINE: For Temporary Workers, A Full-Time Quandary

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Temporarily Yours" (Preludes, April 18) noted the boom in temporary work but not the sobering fact that a large number of temps are trapped in these precarious work arrangements, and in most cases without job security and employee benefits. 
 The column did not mention that many of these so-called nomads have resorted to temporary employment only because they have not been able to secure permanent, full-time jobs.
Under the guise of flexibility and independence, temporary status is quite seductive. But for most, temporary work means lower wages, no health insurance or pension coverage and little if any economic security.
Most alarming is that the temporary-work industry is expanding as employers turn to these work arrangements to cut costs and raise revenues because they can exclude employees from benefit plans and deny them protection under labor laws.
That is creating a new working underclass and is lowering our national living standard.
I will soon be introducing legislation in Congress to prohibit employers from evading their legal and moral responsibilities to their employees. For those of us who care about working families, a legislative solution to this expanding problem has been a long time coming.

HEADLINE: Local Wineries Developing a Following

BYLINE: By HOWARD G. GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
AS wine-making knowledge grows apace, the production of pleasurable, expressive, technically sound wines in areas once deemed inhospitable to the grape has become commonplace. In the trade, this movement is called wine regionalism, and it is as natural as the culinary world's late-20th-century emphasis on the delights and utility of local bounty.
Yet, oddly, owing in part to snobbery, the reputations of local wines in minor wine appellations lag behind other fare. 
 Which informed Hudson Valley residents would not return often to such products as Hudson Valley Foie Gras? To Hudson Valley Draft Cider? To Coach Farm goat cheese?
Three long-established wineries constituting the Dutchess Wine Trail, on the east side of the Hudson River Valley, often generate excellent white and red wines. They are John and Kathe Dyson's Millbrook in, of course, Millbrook; Ben and Phyllis Feder's Clinton Vineyards, in Clinton Corners, and Bill and Margaret Wetmore's Cascade Mountain, in Amenia.
The wines of these estates, delivering distinctive local character, can be splendid mealtime and party fare.
The wines of Clinton and Cascade Mountain can be read as the equivalent of France's vins de pays, outstanding country wines, the kind that American visitors relish, say, in the Midi but declare nostalgically "never travel well." (In fact, they do, splendidly.)
Because of the ambitions and financial assets of Mr. Dyson -- Rudolph W. Giuliani's former Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, and former Agriculture, Commerce and State Power Authority official under Gov. Hugh L. Carey -- many of his wines occupy a different category: the so-called world-class arena in which chardonnays, cabernet sauvignons and pinot noirs compete for attention and approbation.
Millbrook's current offerings in the tasting room consist of 1993, 1995 and 1996 reserve chardonnays; 1994, 1995 and 1997 regular chardonnays; 1993 and 1994 reserve cabernet sauvignons and 1992 and 1996 regular cabernet sauvignons; 1995 reserve cabernet franc (a grape that is a cousin of the cabernet sauvignon) and regular 1992, 1993 and 1996 cabernet francs; 1993 and 1997 reserve pinot noirs; 1991 and 1994 merlots and a 1997 gamay noir (the grape of Beaujolais), and 1998 Tocai Friulano (an Italian grape).
This array enables customers to buy several bottles and compare differences in style, vintage and outcome from the agricultural variables that influence fruit farming.
(Mr. Dyson also sells 14 wines from his holdings on the coast of central California, but he does not sell any from Williams and Selyem, the outstanding pinot noir property in Sonoma's Russian River Valley, which he bought in 1998, and from his Villa Pillo estate in Tuscany.)
Clinton Vineyards currently offers customers the 1997 "Anniversary Reserve" seyval blanc (marking the house's 20th year); the nonvintage Seyval Naturel, a sparkling wine, and Romance, a half-bottle nonvintage fortified sweet Seyval dessert wine. It will soon be releasing the 1998 seyval "Proprietor's Reserve."
In addition, Clinton sells Peach Gala, which is the Seyval Naturel with peach flavoring, and is introducing Embrace, a fortified dessert wine in half bottles made from Dutchess raspberries.
Ben Feder, the founder of Clinton Vineyards, was a Hudson Valley pioneer. He planted seyval blanc and after more than 21 vintages has so mastered the hybrid grape, a Northeastern specialty, that his crisp, fresh, fruity wine can sometimes be confused with chardonnay.
For many years, the Hudson River Club, a fancy restaurant in the World Financial Center in lower Manhattan, has kept Clinton's methode champenoise Seyval Naturel and its still-wine counterpart on its wine list.
The White House bought the Feders' Victory White, and when Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin held a summit conference at the Franklin D. Roosevelt estate in Hyde Park in 1995, Clinton wines were poured for the press.
Cascade Mountain Winery was founded in the early 1970's by Bill Wetmore, who likes to call himself a "novelist turned grapeist." A big attraction is its rustic indoor-outdoor restaurant where students and graduates from the Culinary Institute of America, in nearby Hyde Park, have been present. Ever the wordsmith, Mr. Wetmore, an easygoing fellow who likes to talk with customers, has given his wines names that sell. Though no longer made, Le Hamburger Red lingers fondly in residents' memories.
Customers can find the following grape-based wines: the 1997 seyval blanc, a dry, fruity white; 1996 Private Reserve White, an oak-aged blend of chardonnay and seyval blanc; Summertide, a nonvintage, picnic-oriented semidry white blend made of seyval, aurora and Cayuga white; a 1997 Coeur de Lion, a Beaujolais-style red blend, which is typically composed of Marechal Foch and cabernet sauvignon; the 1997 Private Reserve Red, a full-bodied blend of Foch and cabernet sauvignon; nonvintage Harvest Rose, a light wine made from the Chancellor grape, and 1997 Vignoles, a golden-colored sweet dessert wine.
The three Trail members all lie in a dreamy rural part of Dutchess County. The vistas -- pheasants rising, trout streams, orchards, woods, meadows, gentle hills, valleys, distant Catskill Mountains -- inspired Hudson River School paintings in the 19th century. On late 20th-century weekends, they calm frazzled Manhattan dwellers.
"We hibernate there -- and play hard," said Cathy Morrell, the wife of Peter Morrell, whose Madison Avenue wine shop in Manhattan (soon to move to Rockefeller Center) and wine auctions lure the cognoscenti.
The Dutchess Wine Trail lies within the Hudson River region that the Federal Government designated an American Viticultural Area in 1982 and which is one of the oldest wine-growing areas in the United States.
Overall, the area is home to 20 wineries, 16 of them widely dispersed on the river's west side. (For example, the Brotherhood Winery in Washingtonville -- which is on the west bank and not part of the trail -- is the oldest continuously operated winery in America, having been founded in 1839.) All are within easy driving distance of Westchester.
But that is another story.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Seaford, N.Y.;
A Certain Chemistry on the South Shore

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
LAST fall Seaford High School's football team topped off a winning season with a 23-to-12 victory over Babylon to take the Long Island Class 4 championship.
The victory, said head coach Rich Schaub, "left an indelible imprint on all of us."
"The team had great chemistry and a never-give-up attitude," he added, "and that reflects the people in this community." 
 The hamlet's chemistry, said Mr. Schaub and others, combines good schools, involved parents, family-centered living and a choice coastal setting.
"The parents here are so very involved in the schools," said Edward P. Mavragis, the Seaford Schools Superintendent. "The booster club is always raising money. We don't even have to ask."
An area of single-family houses -- many of the more expensive ones bordering canals, waterways and wetlands -- Seaford is situated on Nassau County's South Shore.
Representative Peter T. King, the Republican incumbent in Long Island's Third Congressional District, moved to Seaford from Queens in 1967 and sent two children through Seaford schools.
"We've lived in the same house for 28 years and never had a bad moment," Mr. King said. "It's a very solid place, very family-oriented, very safe, good schools, good community spirit."
Mr. King said that while there were some complaints about higher school taxes than in some nearby districts, even this had an upside. "It's because we have no industry," he said. "And in a place like Seaford, if the trade-off for lower taxes is more industry, I'd rather see no industry."
As recently as the 40's, Seaford, linked historically to the adjoining hamlet of Wantagh -- with which is once shared the name Jerusalem -- was a marsh and farm area with few houses. The 1940 census put the population at 2,216. By 1960, after Long Island's postwar building boom, the census recorded 14,718 residents, just about 1,000 fewer than today.
Water has always been central to Seaford. Houses along canals with backyard docks or along Seamans Creek, Seaford Creek or the James River are considered waterfront and cost more than houses on the inland, or north side, of the hamlet.
The southside canals lead past salt marsh islands into South Oyster Bay, part of Great South Bay. "The closer you get to the bay, the more expensive your house gets," said Donna Pasquale, office manager at Cruse Real Estate and Development in Seaford.
Mrs. Pasquale said home prices in Seaford ranged from $130,000 "for something that needs total renovation" up to $600,000 on the water.
At times, lower-priced waterfront homes appear on the market. Barbara Shane, the broker and owner of Shane's Anchor Realty in Seaford, said a two-bedroom, one-bath riverfront Swiss chalet was in contract for $225,000.
Housing styles in Seaford include summer bungalows converted to year-round dwellings, ranches, colonials, Cape Cods, eclectics and contemporaries. Most were built in the 50's and 60's.
There is some new construction. Crescent Cove, a 57-home development planned at the former Marina Del Mar, will include three- or four-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath, two-story colonials and traditional-style, single-family homes starting at $459,000.
PRICES will be about $100,000 higher for homes on the water, said Barbara Adamo, vice president and director of sales and marketing for Realty Group Marketing of Smithtown. She said 22 homes had been reserved from blueprints and are now under contract. The development is expected to be completed by next spring.
Seaford's rental market is very limited. Two-bedroom apartments rent for about $1,200 when available. There are also rentals in a few small buildings, the largest with 25 units, and in a few two-family houses. Other rentals are illegal ones in single-family homes.
There are about 200 co-op apartments, including 71 for the elderly citizens at the Cedar Cove co-op. Average prices are $150,000 for two-bedrooms and $120,000 for a one-bedroom. One-bedroom units for the elderly are about $90,000. Buyers of these units must be at least 62 years of age and have an annual income of no more than $35,000. Mrs. Shane said there were no condominiums in Seaford.
Seaford has no beaches or public boat ramps. But there are a number of private marinas and Jones Beach State Park is about seven miles away.
The 77-acre Seamans Neck Park, a Town of Hempstead park, has three playgrounds, six playing fields and courts for basketball, tennis, volley ball, handball and paddleball.
Cedar Creek Park, a 265-acre Nassau County park, has five playing fields and courts for handball and tennis plus picnic areas, a roller rink and hills for sledding. The county's 84-acre Tackapausha Preserve is a five-mile nature trail popular with birdwatchers.
Local shopping is along Merrick Road, the main east-to-west thoroughfare. The 1.2-million-square-foot Sunrise Mall is less than five miles away.
At Seaford High School, 72 percent of the 143 graduates in the class of 1998 earned Regents diplomas. The state average was 43 percent. About 90 percent went on to higher education. Average S.A.T. scores last year were 516 in verbal and 526 in math. State averages were 495 in verbal and 503 in math; national scores were 505 and 512, respectively.
The Seaford High School Marching Band performs in the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade in Manhattan, and performed in events in Phoenix and Los Angeles last year.
A Regents tutorial program in the high school spans the academic year and continues in summer sessions. In the elementary and middle school, many students enroll in special reading and math programs to meet tougher state standards.
There are four computer labs in the high school, one in the middle school and one in each of the two elementary schools. Every classroom in the district has at least one computer. All computers are connected to the Internet and each student has an e-mail address.
Pupils in the first three grades are placed together in what the school refers to as learning communities, where they are encouraged to advance to the limits of their abilities, regardless of age.
A school-to-career program exposes elementary and middle-school students to future career choices at an early age. And high school students are eligible for internship programs at local businesses.
The high school offers advanced placement classes and participates in a Syracuse University program in which students can earn college credits in economics and history. A districtwide inclusion model integrates special education students into regular classes.
District elementary schools are for grades K through 5 and the middle school is for grades 6 through 8. The district has 2,534 students.
A former schoolhouse closed in 1921 and, for a time, headquarters of the Seaford Fire Department is now a Hempstead landmark, housing the Seaford Historical Museum, where memorabilia from the hamlet's maritime and farming past is on display. The museum is open by appointment only. Call (516) 826-1150.
Joshua Soren, president of the Seaford Historical Society and the museum, said that many an older home had been torn down to make way for two or three new houses on the property. Each year, he said, there is less to show schoolchildren he takes on historic tours. "It's more like this was there than this is there," he explained.
AMONG English settlers of Hempstead in the 1640's was Capt. John Seaman, who built a home in what came to be known as Jerusalem, now Seaford and Wantagh. One legend is that the captain, who died in 1695, was from Seaford, England. But another maintains that it got its name because a horse stolen in the 1860's was found in Seaford, Del.
Mr. Soren said that Seaford was variously known as Jerusalem South, Hempstead South, Atlanticville and Verity Town -- after a large local family -- until the name Seaford was finally adopted in 1868.
By then the area had a post office, a schoolhouse and a Methodist church. The Long Island Rail Road arrived that same year, but Seaford didn't get a station until 1899. By 1909 the population was 850, up from 350 in 1888. By 1926, when the Seaford National Bank opened, there were 1,200 residents. Then came the transformation following World War II, when home construction soared and city residents, many from Brooklyn, flocked in.
In 1967, residents managed to get the name of the just opened Wantagh-Oyster Bay Expressway changed to the Seaford-Oyster Bay Expressway, arguing that the southern terminus was really in Seaford. The expressway links Seaford to the Long Island Expressway and to the Northern and Southern State Parkways.
Mrs. Shane said long-term residency was the rule in Seaford. "Most people who come here stay here until they die," she said.

SEAFORD SKIFF: From its beginnings, Seaford has been a place for duck hunting and fishing. In the 1920's, Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig were among visiting sportsmen. And Seaford baymen, now few in number, once plied local waters for shellfish. A favored boat for such expeditions was the Seaford Skiff, a flat-bottomed vessel made to navigate shallow bay waters where the best shellfishing was found. The skiff, which had a mast and oars, was also used by duck hunters, doubling as a duck blind. An original locally designed skiff is on display at the Seaford Historical Museum. Joshua Soren, the museum president, said officials from Mystic Seaport in Mystic, Conn., came to the museum two years ago to measure and document the 14-foot vessel and build a replica.

A Ruling on Co-ops and Disability

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
THE New York City Commission on Human Rights has issued a wake-up call of sorts to property owners -- including co-op and condominium boards as well as landlords -- about discriminating against tenants with disabilities.
In a decision in a case involving a wheelchair-bound shareholder and a co-op on Central Park West, the commission ordered the co-op to construct a ramp for the shareholder to use to enter the building, to install automatic door openers on elevators and in the building's lobby, and to pay the shareholder $15,000 in compensation for the mental anguish caused by the co-op's failure to provide "reasonable accommodations" when the shareholder requested them. The $15,000 award was $5,000 more than a recommendation in a report by an administrative law judge that formed the basis for the commission's decision. 
"The commission's decision and order puts co-ops and their boards in the five boroughs on notice that disability-based discrimination is absolutely illegal under the city's Human Rights Law, and that violators will be called to account by the Commission on Human Rights," the commission chairwoman, Marta B. Varela, said in a press release issued with the decision on March 8.
Randolph E. Wills, the deputy commissioner in charge of the commission's Law Enforcement Bureau, said that the Human Rights Law requires property owners to make reasonable accommodations so that residents with disabilities can enjoy the same rights as those without disabilities. And, Mr. Wills said, in the case in question, that included the right of a shareholder who used a wheelchair "to leave her building without fear of having to beg a car service driver or other stranger for assistance."
John Herrion, assistant program counsel for the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association in Jackson Heights, Queens, said that the shareholder, Ronnie Ellen Raymond, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1990, had experienced increasing difficulty with balance and negotiating stairs. Mr. Herrion, who represented Ms. Raymond in the case against the co-op at 325 Central Park West, at 92d Street, said that despite the fact that the shareholder offered to pay for installation of a sidewalk ramp at the building's entrance stairs, the co-op board rejected her offer.
Instead, Mr. Herrion said, the board decided to install an exterior lift that could transport a person in a wheelchair from street level down into a "moat" that ran along the front of the building. Once in the moat, the person in the wheelchair would then be able to enter the building through a basement door and from there gain access to the elevator. That arrangement, Mr. Herrion said, was not acceptable to Ms. Raymond and did not satisfy the "reasonable accommodation" provision of the law.
"The board was essentially saying to the shareholder, 'You can use the back door,' " he said. "But the Human Rights Commission agreed that our request for the ramp was a reasonable one." Mara B. Levin, the co-op's lawyer, declined comment on the decision or on whether the board will appeal.
Real estate lawyers say the decision puts all property owners on notice that they must take seriously any request for special accommodations made by a disabled resident. "I've been dealing with several cases like this myself," said C. Jaye Berger, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. "But the problem with the Human Rights Law is that there are no clear parameters to guide you."
Ms. Berger said that while the law clearly requires property owners to make "reasonable accommodations" for disabled residents, it is impossible to define that term in the abstract. "A decision like this is extremely scary for a co-op," she said. "There's a huge potential for a building to have serious claims. And the Human Rights Commission wields such broad authority to decide what is appropriate, you have to take every request by a disabled tenant quite seriously and engage in a lot of creative thinking."
Bruce Cholst, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that the recent decision -- along with an apparent increase in the number of elderly residents who choose to remain in their apartments as they grow older -- makes it necessary for boards to prepare for requests for reasonable accommodations in any number of different situations. "This is a slow-motion time-bomb in the early stages of exploding," Mr. Cholst said, adding that there are two distinct aspects of what may be required to provide a reasonable accommodation for a disabled tenant or shareholder. "One is whether to make physical changes to the building," he said, "and the other is whether to suspend or change rules already in place."
For example, he said, an older tenant would not have to be disabled -- in the traditional sense of the word -- to have difficulty opening heavy lobby or elevator doors. Nonetheless, Mr. Cholst said, it would probably be appropriate in such a case for a property owner to choose to install automatic doors like the ones ordered by the commission in the Raymond case. On the other hand, he said, a board being asked to make a reasonable accommodation for a person who has a need for a pet for companionship might have to contemplate rule changes if there is a no-pet rule in the building.
At the same time, Mr. Cholst said, it may also be possible for a property owner to provide a reasonable accommodation for an older or disabled tenant without having to resort to changing the rules or the physical layout of the building, if all parties strive to remain reasonable.
"What is usually at issue is not whether something needs to be done, but how to do it," he said. "If you have a disabled person in a wheelchair, it might be possible for a neutral person -- maybe even a paid mediator -- to assure the resident that having a building staff person always available to help them up a short flight of stairs would be a reasonable alternative to constructing a ramp." Indeed, Mr. Cholst said, one of the elements of "reasonableness" is whether a proposed solution to a problem is economically feasible and practically achievable.
"A reasonable accommodation is one that does not impose undue hardship on the property owner," he said.
Dennis Greenstein, another Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that property owners -- particularly co-op and condominium associations in which tenants are owners -- must also prepare for the inevitable increase in the number of building residents who will have special needs as they grow older. "Most boards are pretty good at dealing with financial planning and capital improvement planning," he said. "But now they have to start thinking about people planning, too."
In fact, Mr. Greenstein said, the best way to address a request for help from a disabled or aging resident is to do so as quickly as possible.
"I'm seeing more and more people come to boards saying they need better accommodations, better access to the building," Mr. Greenstein said. "And in many cases, even though the board is making a good-faith attempt to help the tenant, they may seem to be a little slow in responding." When that happens, he said, the resident may perceive the slow response as an indication that the board does not sincerely wish to cooperate.
"And once a complaint gets filed," Mr. Greenstein said, "it's much more difficult to keep the discussion on a friendly basis."

HEADLINE: Troubled Co-ops Outside Manhattan Are on the Rebound

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
BEYOND the plusher precincts of Manhattan, New York City's co-op and condominium market has been steadily gaining strength, bringing welcome financial news and a palpable sense of relief to many apartment owners.
The market had been dormant, if not on life support, for the first half of this decade. 
 Those were the bad old days: a time when promises went unkept, renters balked at paying for neglected apartments, shareholders withheld their maintenance checks; a time when sponsors defaulted and sometimes disappeared -- some after pocketing co-op funds -- when banks filed foreclosure petitions, buildings struggled to devise financial workout plans and a few even deconverted, leaving residents owing loans and owning nothing.
It is not as though the co-op and condominium market in the boroughs outside of Manhattan, as well as above 96th Street, has roared back. But signs of vitality are evident almost everywhere.
"We're seeing a dramatic shift in the reason people come to New York," said Stuart Saft, chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums. "Because of the fall in the crime rate, there's a significant increase in empty-nesters moving from the suburbs into the city instead of going South; young families electing to stay in the city rather than moving to the suburbs."
"And I don't mean just Manhattan," Mr. Saft said, "but also the outer boroughs."
Typical of the swing in fortunes is a 122-unit postwar six-story, red-brick building in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, that -- as it flirted with foreclosure -- did not see a single sale between 1992 and 1995. Since then, 23 apartments in the co-op have been sold, including six this year. "It was like cancer back then," said Jules Reich, who took over as sponsor of the building at 302 96th Street in 1994, after the original sponsor defaulted and left the resident shareholders holding the bag -- mortgage and tax arrears totaling $4.6 million.
"You couldn't give apartments away," Mr. Reich said.
At Hampton Court, a four-building co-op complex of 316 apartments on Park Lane South in Kew Gardens, Queens, where occupied apartments sold for as little as $10,000 during an auction in 1992, one-bedrooms currently go for $85,000 and two-bedrooms for $149,000 -- with 17 sold so far this year. "It's been a bumpy ride, but we've landed on our feet," said Frank Daliendo, the board president.
A nine-story, 76-unit building at 250 Cabrini Boulevard in Manhattan's Washington Heights, where there were no sales in 1992, 1993 and 1994, has since seen 40 apartments sold, 10 so far this year. At the nadir of the market nose-dive, a one-bedroom in the building sold for $13,000. Currently, they are going for $150,000.
"It's a wonderful turnaround that people can now sell for the original prices or more," said Annice Alt, the board treasurer, "compared to when four shareholders lost their apartments after defaulting on their mortgages."
Not every nook in New York's co-op-condominium supply closet -- an estimated 10,000 buildings containing 700,000 units have been converted or constructed in the city since 1980 -- is basking in the financial glow. In many buildings, while sales have picked up, prices have not yet rebounded to where they were at the time of conversion. And in some buildings, strength has been felt only in the level of rents for sublets -- a precursor, some say, to a resurgence in sales.
At Regents Park Gardens on Jewel Avenue in Kew Gardens Hills, Queens, two-bedroom apartments in the 138-unit garden-apartment condominium complex were offered to outsiders for $145,000 at the time of conversion in 1986. They now sell for $125,000.
But at Barnes Gardens, a 96-unit co-op at 2080-90 Barnes Avenue in the Pelham section of the Bronx, Howard Lazarus, the sponsor, said, "We have a dramatically improved rental market, which has led to reduced availability of apartments, and at higher rents."
"This means," Mr. Lazarus said, "that given the still moderate prices of co-ops in the Bronx it is now significantly cheaper to own than to rent." At Barnes Gardens, a one-bedroom renting for $800 a month can be bought for $35,000, he said, with total monthly costs of under $700 (maintenance of $450 and $250 in debt service on a loan of $30,000). "People have started calling our office, asking about buying," Mr. Barnes said. "This is new, compared to last year."
All of which -- in a citywide market where the level of demand continues to outstrip a supply long constricted by limited construction -- indicates that the seemingly inexorable rise in market-rate rents is making those still moderately priced co-ops and condominiums increasingly desirable.
Edithe Deshauteurs, a leather-accessories designer who recently sold her one-bedroom in Manhattan's Gramercy Park area, needed more space and, at first, she said, wanted to move downtown, "somewhere in the Village, or lower."
She will soon move into a one-bedroom in Forest Hills, Queens.
"More than a year ago," Ms. Deshauteurs said, "I started looking around Manhattan; then I looked at the prices. For what I wanted, it was at least $200,000, and I just didn't want to spend all my money on a mortgage."
Some friends had already "moved out to Brooklyn -- the Heights, Cobble Hill," she said. But Ms. Deshauteurs, a native of Haiti who grew up in Richmond Hill, Queens, said she "really can't relate to Brooklyn; as beautiful and trendy as it is, it's foreign territory to me."
So when she looked at what was available in Essex House, a six-story prewar building on 75th Avenue in Forest Hills, "I thought the sizes were great, the apartment charming."
"I'll have an eat-in kitchen, windows in every room," she said. "The eat-in kitchen was a big thing; I had a little kitchenette in Gramercy Park."
Ms. Deshauteurs did not want to state the precise price of her new apartment, "but a one-bedroom in the building is $90,000, $100,000," she said. "I looked at two-bedrooms in the area, and some were about $100,000. You also have those luxury apartments with a doorman and all the trappings, and those, I'd say, could be $130,000 to over $200,000."
She also did not want to disclose the price she got for her Manhattan co-op, which she bought 12 years ago for about $100,000, except to say, "Some apartments in the building went for a quarter of a million, so I'm making some profit." Another one-bedroom in the building was "on the market less than a week and went for more than $250,000," Ms. Deshauteurs said. "I was shocked."
Manhattan prices have been shocking many buyers for several years, and, more recently, prompting them to expand their horizons.
"It's one of the main topics on people's minds," said Sylvia Shapiro, a lawyer, president of the board of her Greenwich Village building and author of "The Co-op Bible" (St. Martin's Griffin, 1998), an "everything-you-need-to-know" book. "I can tell you stories about friends who were priced out of Manhattan and headed to the boroughs."
In particular, what people want to know these days, Ms. Shapiro said, "is what to do given the dizzying heights of both rental and sales prices: 'Do I take the plunge now?' "
Manhattan rents, she said, "are so exorbitant that people face a Hobson's choice -- between throwing away thousands a month in rent or plunking down a king's ransom to buy a little piece of Manhattan."
AMONG those scratching their heads are insiders who chose not to purchase at the time of conversion. Some even hope to buy now at the old insider price. In one court case, Adiel v. Lincoln Plaza Associates, a tenant who passed up the chance when the building converted to a condominium in 1983 filed suit 13 years later, claiming the insider price remained in effect because the offering plan inaccurately described the number of rooms in her apartment. She lost.
Ms. Shapiro said that in her building, Randall House at 65 East Ninth Street, prices are "literally triple" what they were at conversion in 1991. "One-bedrooms are now in excess of $300,000," she said, "two-bedrooms, $450,000 to $500,000."
And she told of a friend who paid $400,000 for a two-bedroom in the Village two years ago, "a price which, at the time, seemed like a stretch."
"But now she's thanking her lucky stars," Ms. Shapiro said. "Today that same apartment is selling for $600,000, and who knows if she could afford it?"
William Lie Zeckendorf, co-chairman of the Brown Harris Stevens brokerage company, tried to place the Manhattan market's trajectory in longterm perspective. Based on surveys of several market levels, not just the luxury sector in which his firm specializes, Mr. Zeckendorf said sales volume plummeted by at least 50 percent between 1990 and 1993, while prices dropped 25 to 30 percent. It was only in 1996, after nine years of slippage, that the first significant price increases were recorded, he said.
Mr. Zeckendorf called 1997 "a great year," with prices rising 28 percent, followed by a leveling off in 1998, when -- despite foreign economic tremors and a Wall Street swoon -- prices rose a still appreciable 15 percent.
"People ask: 'How much longer can this market keep going? Am I buying at the top?' " Mr. Zeckendorf said. "But if you look at this over a 10-, 12-year period, relative to inflation, we're only 19 percent higher than in '88." By comparison, Mr. Zeckendorf pointed out that the Dow stood at 2,168 at the end of 1988, and at 9,181 at the end of '98. "That's 323 percent," he said. "For now, I think the market has behaved efficiently."
But buyers take a more immediate view -- wondering whether they will find what they need now; whether they will automatically eat up the profit from the sale of their old apartment when they plunk down the money for the new one; and, for some, whether to venture across a river.
And they worry whether there will ever be another debacle like that of the early 90's.
There is no central registry of all the buildings -- and, more pointedly, all the people -- whose financial health was shaken when the bottom dropped out of much of the co-op market after the boom of the 80's. In the early 90's, said Gary Connor, chief of enforcement in the real estate financing bureau of the New York State Attorney General's Office, about 10 percent of the 13,400 co-ops and condominiums created in the state after 1980 found themselves in some sort of financial difficulty -- 900 to 1,000 of them in the city.
"I can tell you that the number of buildings that have financial problems is greatly diminished," Mr. Connor said. "We still have longterm problems at some buildings, but it's nowhere near what it used to be."
DURING the depths of the troubles, he said, the Attorney General's Office filed about 100 civil actions to bar sponsors from further activity in the real estate securities business, with "a high percentage of those" eventually enjoined. About 10 sponsors were brought up on criminal charges, with "several of them" convicted, he said.
"We had one sponsor who from day one just outright took the reserve funds, didn't pay maintenance and sold apartments without disclosing this," Mr. Connor said. "He went to jail."
There were 25 to 30 buildings in the city, Mr. Connor said, that were ultimately foreclosed upon and deconverted. "But the vast majority of troubled buildings were eventually worked out," he said. "And now we're down to 15 or 20 that remain with some kind of financial problem."
Beyond the greed and mendacity of a few sponsors, there were two spikes that popped the late-80's co-op-condominium bubble -- a market already bloated by overvalued properties purchased with huge underlying mortgages that had been granted to speculating sponsors by high-risk-taking lenders. One spike was the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which eliminated incentives for outside investors to buy apartments; the other was the confidence-chilling stock market slide of 1987.
Many conversions back then had less to do with the real value of buildings than with the sponsor's prediction of the maximum value of the apartments after they were all sold. Many sponsors, in their conversion plans, added wraparound mortgages to the underlying mortgage, creating additional capital for themselves and more debt for the resident shareholders. Tenants often did not raise objections to the wraparound because they were more interested in buying apartments at low insider prices and selling for quick profit.
"Typically, the co-ops that had the greatest difficulty were those with less than 50 percent of their units sold when the music stopped in 1989," said Susan Hewitt, president of the Cheshire Group, one of a handful of companies dubbed "white knights" for their work in rescuing troubled buildings -- in exchange for a significant share of future sales.
"The distressed situations," Ms. Hewitt said, "were those with the fewest owner occupants and the largest number of regulated tenants, whose rents were less than the maintenance, so the sponsors fell behind and defaulted. And they tended to have disproportionately large underlying mortgages -- everybody got carried away back then. That's the universe of buildings that white knights were working with."
Before 1986, a sponsor could expect to sell blocks of his unsold apartments to other investors -- a syndicate of doctors, for example -- who saw short-term tax benefits and longterm value in eventual sales to outsiders. But the 1986 Tax Reform Act eliminated most of those deductions, and a significant portion of the market. The following year, the stock market drop forced thousands of layoffs in the financial district; not just the big-money traders, but support staff -- the people who buy apartments in Brooklyn and Queens.
Sponsors started applying for, and getting, end loans (the individual apartment loans) against the value of their unsold apartments. Often, the sponsor got a loan based on an estimate of one-third of what the apartment's price would be when it someday sold to an outsider, even though the apartment was occupied by a rent-regulated tenant. The rent would be significantly less than the maintenance and debt service the sponsor had to pay. They began to default.
Gila Khabbaza, president of the board of Sanford Plaza, a 180-unit, four-building co-op complex on Sanford Avenue in Flushing, Queens, remembers those nightmarish times.
"When I joined the board in '87, I realized the numbers didn't add up," said Ms. Khabbaza. One number, she recalled, was $180,000 for asbestos removal, "and we didn't have any removal."
In a not entirely unusual pattern for the time, Ms. Khabbaza said: "The sponsor owned the management company. The vendors doing work were mostly owned by him. The bank doing the end loans was owned by a business partner. It was very incestuous." The sponsor hadn't paid maintenance for several months, she said, "but we didn't know because he owned the management company and he controlled the board."
It took pressure from the Attorney General's Office and Queens Borough President Claire Shulman, who set up a task force to deal with troubled co-ops, before a settlement was hammered out with the sponsor "so that we would take over everything and he would just get lost," Ms. Khabbaza said.
During the turmoil and before a financial workout could be reached between the board and the banks -- reducing the underlying mortgage from $7.1 million to its current $2.7 million -- some shareholders were forced into bankruptcy.
"We had 10 people who just walked away," Ms. Khabbaza said. The foreclosure price for those apartments was $25,000 for a one-bedroom. Currently, one-bedrooms sell for up to $70,000.
Ms. Hewitt said the typical "white knight" strategy was to negotiate a reduction of the underlying mortgage in exchange for an interest in the unsold shares. "We would buy the underlying," Ms. Hewitt said, "reduce it to where the co-op could afford the shortfall on the unsold shares and then split the proceeds from any new sales with the co-op; usually we'd get 75 percent, the co-op got 25 percent. In most cases, the sponsor was history."
MOST of the troubled buildings are now three or four years into their recovery, and Mr. Saft of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums believes they have come out stronger than if they had not gone through the wringer. "They are stronger," he said, "because when we did the workouts we attempted to not only resolve the obvious financial problems, but also to predict future problems -- an overall solution rather than a Band-Aid."
Assessing himself as "usually pessimistic" about the co-op and condominium market, Mr. Saft said he was "very bullish" these days. "Of course, this will be tested in the next recession, but I don't believe we'll see the kind of collapse we witnessed in the early 1990's."
Arthur Margon, an economist and director of academic affairs at the New York University Real Estate Institute, concurred. "Things are different this cycle because the financial institutions and the co-op buildings themselves are both on firmer financial footing," he said. "This is because the workouts addressed the longterm financial responsibilities of the buildings."
But even more important, Professor Margon said, is that "there hasn't been enormous production of new units or newly converted units, and that means it's unlikely that any economic downturn will coincide with substantial oversupply."
Pointing out that "we didn't start absorbing the oversupply in Manhattan until '94, and outside of Manhattan until the last two years," Professor Margon said: "Now, apartments in even more recently gentrifying neighborhoods and middle-class neighborhoods -- Prospect Heights, Windsor Terrace in Brooklyn, Rego Park and Ridgewood in Queens -- are selling quickly."
None too quickly for Ms. Khabbaza, the board president at Sanford Plaza in Flushing, and for many others who lived with uncertainty for so long. "It was like not being able to breathe, like holding our breath," Ms. Khabbaza said. "And now it's like being given oxygen."

Rites of Survivorship

BYLINE: By JAMES SCHEMBARI; James Schembari is an editor at The Times. His column on the prime earning, spending and striving years appears the fourth Sunday of each month. E-mail: jimschem@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IT was fitting that this financial revelation came in church.
During a recent service, our minister honored the people who have been members of the congregation for at least 50 years. As he called their names, they stood at their pews, some with the aid of canes. Almost all of them were women. 
 I looked at my wife, Christine, sitting next to me, and I suddenly realized that she could be among the honorees someday and that I would not likely be standing next to her. The odds are that Christine, a television reporter, will outlive me by a good stretch.
I leaned over and whispered my thoughts to her, and we spent the rest of the service holding hands. I was sitting in that church trying to figure out how we were going to save for our children's college education -- and still have enough for Christine when she's going to church solo.
Not a very romantic notion, but a prospect that financial experts say baby boomers must consider. After all, the Census Bureau says that in 1997, some 46 percent of all women 65 and older were widows, while only 16 percent of men that age were widowers. And if wives indeed outlive their husbands, the family's assets must outlive the husbands, too.
HAVING a sound financial strategy is an obvious first step. Like many other financial planners, Elaine Bedel of Indianapolis recommends conventional investments first, with life insurance a possible supplement. If couples think that their assets will not last long enough to provide for a surviving wife, they can buy insurance to cover the shortfall. She favors level term policies that can offer hundreds of thousands of dollars in coverage at the same, or level, premium, for as long as 30 years.
Insurance agents often recommend whole life insurance and variable annuities, which offer both investment returns and death benefits. But financial planners, citing the fees and tax complications, say many people would be better off buying cheaper term life insurance while using their other funds for conventional investments.
Even a solid financial plan can weaken if one partner is not a participant, though. Often, one spouse takes charge, and even in the 1990's, it's usually the husband.
Keith Phelps, 53, a vice president of employee benefit sales at Conseco Risk Management in Carmel, Ind., had always managed his family's assets. He had the expertise and his wife lacked the interest. His father had died young, so he knew the importance of planning ahead. Recently, Mr. Phelps asked his wife, Kay, to accompany him to visit Ms. Bedel.
"While I still had time to do something about it, I wanted to make sure we had our finances on track," he said. "I wanted my wife to be more involved. I was concerned that if something happened to me, she wouldn't know where to start financially."
Ms. Phelps, 53, an administrator of a scholarship program for the Independent Colleges of Indiana in Indianapolis, found the meeting useful, but still counts on her husband. "He's so conscientious, and such a good husband and parent," she said. "I guess I have always had so much confidence in his love and caring for me that I knew everything would be taken care of."
Mr. Phelps now carries about $1.25 million of life insurance, mostly term insurance. He plans to cut back, sharply though not entirely, as he nears a retirement he intends to finance with his investments. "I've been in the insurance industry for 30 years and have a loyalty to the product, so I am reluctant to give it up," he said.
But how much money will a widow need? The more men think about it, the thriftier they might become today to provide their wives with more security tomorrow. Assuming continued low inflation, Ms. Bedel said that if a man who is 45 today lives to 65, and his wife outlives him by 10 years, she will need $750,000, assuming living expenses of $50,000 a year. If she outlives him by 20 years, the total rises to $1.2 million.
To reach those totals, a Mr. Wonderful must immediately start saving $1,250 or $2,000, respectively, a month or invest $150,000 or $250,000 now and get an 8 percent return until he dies.
So get busy, guys.

Multiplex Choice Question: Who's on First?

BYLINE: By RICHARD WEIR 

 BODY:
For the past year, homeowners living near the Queens Center Mall have been fighting plans for two multiplexes within five blocks of each other. While one of those projects seems to have fallen through, residents are now keeping their eyes on yet another developer's plan, this one for a 3,200-seat theater atop a nearby Stern's department store.
Word that the developer, Forest City Ratner, had entered the race to put up the first multiplex in the area further stoked the anger of local residents. "Why do we need more movie theaters shoved down our throats when the community is screaming we don't want them?" said Maura Mullen, a member of Community Board 4 who serves on its zoning and land use committee and on a borough task force studying the potential impact of various proposed projects, including expansion of the mall. 
 At a community board committee meeting Tuesday, the executive vice president and general counsel of the city's Economic Development Corporation, Michael Carey, said research by the city and the theater industry showed a shortage of movie screens in Queens. But apparently not enough to support more than one multiplex, he said. "That's why there's such a rush," Mr. Carey said.
Until recently, the Mattone Group of College Point and Proto Industries of Elmhurst were both vying to put up a theater. Mattone is collaborating with Loews Cineplex Entertainment, which is owned by Sony, to build an 18-screen theater on a municipal parking lot between 59th Avenue and the Long Island Expressway, near the mall. The project, which needs city approval, is under official review. As part of it, Mattone would demolish the four-screen Elmwood Theater, off Queens Boulevard, and Loews would give the property to St. John's Queens Hospital.
Proto Industries and AMC Entertainment, meanwhile, had planned a 30-screen theater on a parking lot behind the Georgia Diner on Queens Boulevard and 55th Avenue. The diner's owner, Dimitrios Kaloidis, is an investor in Proto Industries. But on Wednesday, a spokesman for AMC, Sonny Stuffle, said the company was "not interested in that site anymore."
In March, a lawyer representing Forest City Ratner announced that the developer wanted to build a theater above Stern's, directly across 55th Avenue from the Georgia Diner. The lawyer, Jesse Masyr, said the project did not need city approval. On Wednesday, he said Forest City was also planning to build a shopping plaza on the lot behind the diner.
But a spokeswoman for Forest City Ratner, Joyce Baumgarten, said later that the retail plans for the lot behind the Georgia Diner were "on hold." On Thursday, she said that plans for the Stern's store would include a shopping center "with movies as a possibility."
Mr. Carey, who sits on the borough task force and whose agency is negotiating the sale of the city land to the Mattone Group, said the shifting plans were "a little bit like a slippery eel -- it's hard to get our hands around." RICHARD WEIR

HEADLINE: Wedding or Wipe-Out?

BYLINE: BySTEPHANIE STROM and KEITH BRADSHER 

 BODY:
A CANDID version of the advice that the Ford Motor Company might offer its competitor, Renault S.A., on making an investment in a Japanese car company would probably be something like this: Get ready for a long, hard trek, because the payoff won't come quickly.
Ford's 20-year, $624 million odyssey with a Japanese car maker, the Mazda Motor Corporation, has so far produced a lot of headaches. But since Renault has already plunked down $5.4 billion to buy a 36.8 percent stake in the sputtering Nissan Motor Company, Japan's second-largest auto maker, avoiding the potential potholes is no longer an option. 
 So what lessons has Ford learned that might be useful to Renault? Grasp authority and hang onto it for dear life. Expect nasty surprises. Hand responsibility for a turnaround to your partner and its employees. Respect the sacred cows, but don't kowtow to them.
And read the life story of Mother Teresa, for hers is the sort of tenacity and forbearance that you will need.
These principles have led to what industry executives regard as the beginning of a turnaround at Mazda's headquarters and sprawling factories in Hiroshima. The company has gained market share in Japan despite slipping sales and an extremely weak domestic car market; in the fiscal year ended March 31, it posted its first overall profit, including the performance of subsidiaries, in six years. Operating profits doubled, and, thanks to a more than $2 billion reduction in costs, the break-even point for Mazda alone, exclusive of subsidiaries, has plummeted almost 40 percent.
All of this has been accomplished without the cultural clashes that many people expected when Ford took control of Mazda in 1996 after 17 years as a major stockholder. After all, international auto mergers have a history of ending badly, with the two best-known examples involving Renault: the managerial chaos at the American Motors Corporation, which Renault controlled through most of the 1980's and sold to Chrysler in 1987, and Renault's failed merger with Volvo of Sweden in 1993.
Not surprisingly, Renault and Nissan executives have been trying to understand why Ford and Mazda have gotten along so much better. "That relationship between Ford and Mazda is very good, and that is one example of two cultures working," Yoshikazu Hanawa, the chief executive of Nissan, said in an interview.
Indeed, it is clear that the French are trying to follow Ford's blueprint. Ford increased its stake in Mazda in 1996 by giving it cash for new shares, and Mazda spent the cash to reduce debt, bankroll vehicle-development programs and meet other urgent financial needs. Now Nissan has issued new shares to Renault and has plans for a similar kinds of spending.
Also following Ford's lead, Renault is trying to combine its product lineups with its Japanese partner's to eliminate duplication, but without sending lots of managers to Japan. "It is not about merging corporate structures; it is about working together to develop and sell cars, which is not quite the same thing," said Louis Schweitzer, chairman of Renault.
Still, the rapport between Ford and Mazda obscures an awkward fact that can only trouble Renault's shareholders: Ford has made little money on its Japanese investment and is unlikely to make much anytime soon. Rather, Ford has behaved to some extent as an indulgent sugar daddy, willing to bail out its Japanese partner and providing gentle nudges rather than risking blunt action that might upset managers at Mazda's headquarters.
Ford, eight times the size of Mazda, is the world's second-largest company in sales, after General Motors, so it can afford to make generously financed, long-term bets on the Japanese market. Renault does not have that luxury. It is slightly smaller than Nissan in sales and less than one-third the size of Ford. Nissan's problems are bigger than Mazda's ever were, mainly because Nissan has continued to bleed financially as the Japanese auto market has crumbled over the last three years, while Ford has taken some steps to stanch Mazda's losses.
Nonetheless, Mr. Schweitzer, delighted at the scope of his deal, declared soon after the ink was dry in March that it would offer a "shortcut to the world growth status we were looking for." If Ford's experience is any guide, however, the road ahead of Renault may be more of a meandering detour.
 
Grab the Wheel
For a long time, Ford's investment in Mazda, starting in 1979 with the purchase of a 25 percent stake for $140 million, amounted to little more than an expensive visitor's pass for Detroit engineers and managers to tour Japanese factories. One of Ford's goals was to figure out why Japanese auto makers seemed able to build more reliable and affordable cars than American auto makers, and it did pick up valuable tips on quality and efficiency. But it had little success in influencing Mazda's overall strategy -- failing, for example, to persuade Mazda not to produce cars that competed directly with Ford models.
Through the first 17 years of the partnership, in fact, Mazda executives largely ignored their American partners. Indeed, in the early 90's, Mazda went on a panicked spending spree, building a modern factory for the equivalent of several hundred million dollars and opening three new sales divisions while the Japanese economy tumbled into its worst recession since World War II.
Senior Mazda executives appointed by Ford, meanwhile, were not even invited to key meetings and did not always receive full information about Mazda's activities, said Henry D. G. Wallace, a career Ford executive who served as Mazda's executive vice president in the mid-1990's.
The situation changed in 1996, when Ford spent $484 million to raise its holdings to 33.4 percent after Mazda found itself losing money and struggling to meet its debt payments. By itself, such a stake usually does not confer control in Japan. But Ford imposed a crucial condition on its investment: that it have the right to appoint Mazda's president.
Mr. Wallace got the job, becoming the first foreigner to oversee a Japanese auto maker. And he was no figurehead. At Mazda, as in most large Japanese companies, whoever is president is virtually an absolute monarch; his wishes rarely go unfulfilled, no matter how unreasonable, unprofitable or ill-conceived. No longer, Mr. Wallace said, was he outside the loop. He was the loop.
Ford also had a powerful ally in Sumitomo bank, Mazda's main lender. Sumitomo and Ford had a close, longstanding relationship; it was Sumitomo officials, for example, not Mazda executives, who convinced Ford to make its initial investment in Mazda, and it was Sumitomo officials who put Ford on a white horse to rescue Mazda in 1996.
"What Ford wanted to see was that the relationship with Mazda would go smoothly, and when it was necessary, we did talk to Mazda to insure its cooperation," said Sotoo Tatsumi, the retired Sumitomo chairman who first approached Ford in the early 70's, when he was a general manager. "Until a few years ago, not all the people at Mazda welcomed Ford."
The former Ford managers who are now Mazda executives consider the Sumitomo relationship crucial to their success. "It's not just Ford and Mazda at work here," James E. Miller, Mr. Wallace's successor as Mazda's president, often says. "It's Ford, Mazda and Sumitomo."
Though Renault's 36.8 percent stake in Nissan is slightly larger than Ford's holdings in Mazda, Renault does not appear likely to wield as much control. Renault will be installing Carlos Ghosn, one of its best executives, at Nissan this summer, but he will be the chief operating officer, and while Nissan's executive vice presidents will report to him, he will report to Mr. Hanawa.
 
Confront the Unexpected
Ask top American or European auto executives about their Japanese rivals these days, and they are likely to repeat dark rumors about how much debt the Japanese companies have -- and how much of it lurks in hidden business partnerships.
The extent of Nissan's liabilities off the balance sheet apparently had a lot to do with a decision by DaimlerChrysler A.G. not to invest in the company. But Renault says it has not been scared by what it has found in poring over Nissan's books.
There are many stories in the auto industry about how much debt Ford might have discovered at Mazda after taking control, mostly at dealerships that were owned by Mazda. Kaoru Kurata, an auto analyst at Goldman Sachs (Japan) Ltd., estimates that Mazda's dealership-related debts may be as high as $3.66 billion.
Ford executives say their full year of research before taking control adequately documented these debts. But Gary K. Hexter, a Ford manager who is now Mazda's chief financial officer, acknowledged that there had been some surprises elsewhere. "Yes, we've found some liabilities that hadn't been adequately identified, both at Mazda and at the subsidiary companies," he said. "It's inevitable."
William C. Ford Jr., chairman of Ford Motor, said there had not been any major shocks. "We have a very firm idea of where Mazda is," he added.
To prevent any future shocks, however, Mr. Hexter has the thankless task of trying to bring order to Mazda's books, pulling together figures on roughly 180 affiliates and subsidiaries. He has established borrowing limits; he also requires pre-approval of major new spending and reviews new business proposals.
"We have made a lot of progress, but it has been slower in the domestic subsidiaries and dealerships," he said. "There's such a huge range of businesses, which makes it difficult to manage them centrally."
 
Set Goals That Stick
Ford executives have long believed that there is nothing like tangible success to help win friends and allies. So the Ford managers dispatched to Mazda have made a practice of setting all sorts of targets and then making it clear that they expect them to be met.
That is a big change for Mazda, said Kei Kado, a director in charge of product development planning and international business planning. "Most Japanese workers would feel that a target is a sort of challenge," Mr. Kado said. "But the people from Ford regard it as a commitment -- and in Japan, if you don't meet your commitments, you put a knife in your stomach."
One of his tasks was to achieve a 40 percent reduction in the variable costs of car production -- the expenses left after subtracting things like profit margins, fixed costs, advertising and the price of logistics from the price of a car. He accomplished that, and now Mr. Miller is asking him to save 30 percent to 40 percent more.
Mazda's dealers and directors were shocked when he began pushing a plan that consolidated back-office dealership operations regionally, eliminated unprofitable shops and pared the number of dealer chains from five to three. All of Mazda's Japanese directors opposed the plan, but Mr. Miller persisted. Then the results came in. "Our monthly expenses went down by nearly 100 million yen," exclaimed Yoichi Suzuki, president of the consolidated dealership operation in Saitama prefecture, still somewhat in awe of the results.
"Their approach is brilliant in terms of business," Mr. Suzuki said of the Ford officials. "They are energetic, speedy and clear about what they want. The Japanese style is more ambiguous, dependent on mood and human relationships."
By now, though, Mazda's Japanese managers have become accustomed to once-startling changes. Among other things, Mazda has eliminated the time-honored Japanese practice of shuffling unneeded white-collar workers off to affiliates for two-year job stints, rather than laying them off. Instead, it now dispatches them to its own assembly line, where staffing is relatively lean.
 
Be Sensitive; Show Spine
In the United States, Ford has been criticized for not moving faster at Mazda to reduce capacity, cut jobs and use other tools favored by American companies overhauling their operations. In Japan, however, it has been praised for the same cautious approach. "I did not give them any specific advice," Sumitomo's Mr. Tatsumi said, "but I knew Ford understood it would need a soft touch."
Although Mazda has eliminated about 6,000 jobs, it has winnowed its ranks through attrition, early retirement and leaner hiring practices, softening the effects on the Hiroshima area, where the company is crucial to the economy.
But Ford's genius has been in differentiating the truly sacred cows from the merely privileged ones. Consider taxicabs. In 1995, Mazda was producing cars for sale to taxicab companies, a business dominated by Toyota and Nissan, and it wasn't making money on the operation. Mr. Wallace's suggestion that Mazda exit the cab business met with protest from Japanese executives. But the cries were quickly silenced when he asked whether they wanted to be riding in Mazda taxis after the company went bankrupt.
At the insistence of managers sent from Ford, Mazda also slowed research into rotary engines, a product for which the company was famous but which had limited usefulness. "That was painful, because a lot of people felt it was the heart and soul of the company," said Mr. Wallace, now group vice president for Asia-Pacific operations and affiliations at Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich.
To soften this sort of pain, Ford's executives have tried to adopt local customs whenever possible. Mr. Miller has stunned his Japanese colleagues with his whole-hearted embrace of the after-hours carousing that is an integral part of Japanese business. His stamina in keeping up with the parties that migrate from restaurant to bar to bar has astonished Mazda employees. And like Japanese executives, Mr. Miller often takes to the public-address system to rally the troops, reading haltingly in Japanese to make announcements, issue exhortations and pay compliments for jobs well done.
His cosmopolitan ways reflect one of Ford's biggest assets at Mazda -- its unusually large corps of globe-trotting executives. Mr. Miller is an American, but his curriculum vitae reads like that of the most seasoned international executive: president of Ford New Zealand from 1989 to 1993; head of Eastern Europe and exports at Ford Europe to 1994; president of Ford's South African subsidiary until 1997, when he joined Mazda.
Four of the six group vice presidents at Ford grew up outside the United States, including Mr. Wallace, a Scot. So did Jacques Nasser, the new chief executive and president, who was raised in Lebanon and Australia and speaks fluent Arabic, French, Spanish and Portuguese, in addition to English.
Mr. Ghosn, the top Renault executive going to Nissan, was born in Brazil, and the company has long had a large and successful business in South America. But Renault's leaders are clearly worried that they may be short of top managers with international experience. "Probably we would look outwards for a few new talents at Renault," said Mr. Schweitzer, the chairman.
 
Get Ready to Wait
While it appears that Ford has pulled off at least the beginnings of a turnaround at Mazda, the true benefits of its investment remain to be seen. "While we've climbed mountains," Mr. Miller said, "there are higher mountains in the range to climb."
The first synergies will not appear until the end of next year, when the two companies are expected to begin producing sport utility vehicles with common suspensions, engines, transmissions and other components.
In the meantime, its Mazda stake gives Ford a foothold in the Japanese market, which can only prove valuable whenever car sales rebound there. Ford officials hope to sell Mazdas in other Asian markets, as well, though they have not developed a strategy since the recent economic turmoil.
With these benefits hard to measure in dollars and cents, it is difficult to make a case for the wisdom of Ford's investment. The company got a bargain in 1979 by securing a quarter interest in Mazda for the equivalent of $318 million in today's dollars; that is a pittance compared with the $6.5 billion that Ford paid in March for Volvo's car-making operations, a smaller but more consistently profitable business than Mazda. And Ford has also collected $100 million in dividends from Mazda over the years.
Yet if Ford had invested the money it sank into Mazda in 1979 in its own stock instead, the shares would now be worth $8.4 billion, a 6,000 percent return. And for $8.4 billion, Ford could buy controlling stakes in several Mazda-sized companies today.
Still, many auto executives are betting that the industry will eventually consolidate into five or six big companies. Each of these leviathans will need sizable operations in Japan. And given the impossibility of starting from scratch there, American and European auto makers are going to be in business with the Japanese one way or another.
By that reasoning, Ford's years of losses at Mazda might someday not seem like such a waste of money. And Renault, in taking an even bigger gamble than Ford, can only hope to have as much success.
Mr. Schweitzer, conscious of his company's failures in the past, said he is determined to form a close partnership with Nissan. His Japanese partner may not be a beauty now, but he nonetheless uses the language of love to describe his plans for the courtship.
"To build a good relationship," he said, "you should not look at each other but do things together and look in the same direction."

In taking a big stake in Nissan, Renault of France is buying into a much bigger Japanese car maker than Ford did when it gained control of Mazda three years ago. But Nissan's problems outstrip Mazda's, too. Its losses and debt are much steeper and its operations far less productive than Mazda's were when Ford took over.

Yes, Investors Panicked. But Brazil Didn't.

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO

 BODY:
PRESIDENT FERNANDO HENRIQUE CARDOSO traveled to the United States early this month and everywhere he went, the same people who just four months before were worrying about an Asian-style meltdown of Brazil's economy praised him for his astute leadership. At the White House, President Clinton led the chorus, expressing relief at "the substantial progress" Brazil has made in recovering from the fiscal crisis, which led to a 40 percent devaluation of its currency in January.
During his tour Mr. Cardoso also stopped in New York, where he was peppered with questions about Brazil's implementation of a $41.5 billion economic rescue package backed by the International Monetary Fund. Left unaddressed, however, was a more fundamental issue: To what extent did the crisis reflect genuine deficiencies in the Brazilian economy and to what degree was it a self-fulfilling prophecy, brought on by panic and myopia in the global capital market itself?
At this juncture, no one denies that Brazil's currency, the real, had become overvalued against the dollar and needed to be adjusted. Throughout his first term, Mr. Cardoso's main policy goal had been to bring inflation, traditionally the country's biggest bugaboo, under control; that made him eager to avoid any sharp and sudden devaluation and the surge of higher prices that would follow it. 
 But Brazilians, from Government officials to the average citizen, are increasingly convinced that a series of "simplistic comparisons" and "undue generalizations," as Minister of Finance Pedro Malan put it in a recent interview, made the situation last January worse than it might have been and overlooked the country's underlying strengths.
Now that the world's eighth largest economy has begun to right itself, for example, all the talk about "global contagion" seems particularly exaggerated. Except in the estimation of some traders abroad, Brazil was never really comparable to Indonesia, where a family dynasty enriched itself at the country's expense. Nor was it equivalent to Russia, where the collapse of a Communist state has allowed a mafia to seize control of the economy, or even Mexico, where one corrupt and ossified political party has wielded power for 70 years.
"Wall Street needs a geography lesson," Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes, a former Cabinet minister who is now president of the Brazilian Association of Exporters, said recently. "A bank goes bust in Moscow and they sell their Brazilian shares? They should go back to school."
Too late for Brazil and its 165 million people, who have had to endure lost jobs and recession since January, stock markets around the world seemed to recognize that error this month.
Granted, speculative pressure on Argentina and its currency last week generated some turbulence here and in other Latin American countries. But Boris Yeltsin's dismissal of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov in Russia caused barely a ripple. Indeed, as the announcement was being made in Moscow, the Sao Paulo stock market rose to an 18-month high, fueled largely by the return of foreign money, and the Brazilian Government was able to announce the sixth cut in interest rates in the past two months.
Other measures of Brazil's strengths are, if anything, more revealing. In contrast to the traumas that have wracked Russia and the Asian tigers recently, Latin America's largest country has in just 15 years successfully made the transition, without violence or social trauma, from military dictatorship to democracy. Its democracy is often raucous, as is demonstrated by a current Congressional investigation into insider trading that took place at the time of January's devaluation. But even though Mr. Cardoso has to work within a system of checks and balances more restrictive than the systems facing his Asian, Russian and Mexican counterparts, he has time and again delivered on promises to restructure the Brazilian state and economy.
After the agreement with the I.M.F. was signed last November, investors and officials abroad immediately began to view a reduction of Brazil's often-generous social security benefits as a test of Mr. Cardoso's resolve. Though the Brazilian Congress dithered for two months, it eventually passed the legislation, which requires a constitutional amendment. As political leaders here have noted, none of the countries that have been hectoring Brazil on this matter -- not Germany, not France, not Italy, and certainly not the United States -- have themselves begun to come to grips with the issue at home.
In reality, the steps Brazil had taken to modernize its economy even before the January crisis were substantial, more than what many other countries have done in decades. When he took office in 1995, Mr. Cardoso inherited a highly protectionist economy. But he quickly lowered tariffs, allowing trade and competition to surge, and sold off one inefficient state-run monopoly after another: ports, electricity, mining, telecommunications, railways, banks and more.
Mr. Cardoso maintained that course, showing unusual political courage, even when a harsh recession set in after the eruption of the Asian crisis in 1997, threatening both his re-election and efforts to stabilize both prices and the real. And Brazilian voters were mature enough to resist opposition blandishments of short-term relief in favor of what they saw as the long-term payoff that would make their country an economic power: stability and growth.
The late Carroll Quigley, the Georgetown University professor whom Mr. Clinton has cited as his most influential teacher, used to define capitalism as "a system of accounting that ignores social costs." Judging from Brazil's recent experience, the converse is also true: market-driven philosophies are unwilling to grant credit for social gains that cannot immediately be measured.
TO Riordan Roett, an expert on the Western Hemisphere at Johns Hopkins University, Mr. Cardoso's most significant achievement may be that during his first term "more Brazilians were lifted from poverty than in the past 50 years." That feat, a result of the same inflation control and currency stabilization program that came under speculative pressure in January, has turned millions of poor Brazilians into consumers and makes the country more attractive to foreign investors hunting for new markets.
At the height of the crisis, a new study appeared here showing that between 1994 and 1998, high school enrollments in Brazil increased 37 percent, as parents realized that they no longer needed to yank their children out of classes and send them to work. "These are extraordinary numbers for so short a period," a "gigantic leap," Claudio de Moura Castro, an economist who is the co-author of the study, wrote in the news magazine Veja. In the long term, of course, they also represent a social investment that will benefit foreign companies in the form of better-educated workers who will, as a consequence, earn higher salaries and be able to spend more money.
A generation ago, Charles de Gaulle visited here and rendered a verdict on Brazilian society so stinging that it is still frequently recalled, always with chagrin. "This is not a serious country," the French leader said. Brazil in 1999 may still be associated primarily with soccer and samba, but in a perverse way the January crisis was a yardstick of how far the country has come: Thirty-five years ago, even an economic collapse here would have had little impact elsewhere. Today, for better or worse, Brazil matters.
At a conference in Chicago earlier this month, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, cautioned that Brazil is "not quite out of the woods," a warning that a suddenly euphoric market now seems prepared to discount. Investors snapped up more than $2 billion in Brazilian bonds issued last month, and so much foreign investment is flowing back into the country that the Government has had to adjust its estimate upward to as high as $20 billion for the year.
Mr. Cardoso himself, however, ever the realist, appears to be as unmoved by the sudden recovery of confidence in Brazil as he was by its January jitters. "The Brazilian situation was never as bad as it was presented then, and it is not as good as it is presented now," he said in a recent interview. So let the market beware.

Rates Are Rising. Are the Bears Near?

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
IS Goldilocks dead, choking on her porridge, or merely suffering indigestion?
People have long wondered just how long the "not too hot, not too cold" environment that has amazed economists and nourished financial markets for years could last. Recent events suggest we may be in the introductory phase of a very different story. 
 The consumer price report for April, which showed an increase of 0.7 percent, hit on May 14. Then, last week, the Federal Reserve Board, for the first time in more than two years, said it was more inclined to raise interest rates than to lower them.
One could argue that inflation is entitled to one bad month every now and then. And since 1996, the Fed has adopted a bias toward tighter monetary policy 14 times, but has actually raised interest rates only once.
Still, with stocks at high levels, there is little margin for error. Kevin Parke, chief equity officer at MFS Investment Management in Boston, talked last week about the possibility of a post-Goldilocks economy.
 
Q. Bond traders have been pushing up interest rates for some time now. Is this just a blip, or are we in an upward trend?
 
A. The fact is that bond traders overreacted to last fall's global financial crisis by pushing bond yields down too far. Now you are getting a bounce back up, but I think it is best measured from a floor of 5.25 percent, not the 4.75 percent level they reached during the crisis. We think the correct range for bond yields is between 5.25 percent and 6 percent.
The fact that bond yields went through 5.90 percent is fantastic, because it means that the market is not complacent. Bond traders are a policing mechanism, keeping a lid on inflation and economic growth.
 
Q. So do you still believe in Goldilocks?
 
A. The rise in bond yields and the Fed's announcement last week insures a continuation of the Goldilocks scenario. It will help keep us in the middle ground we have occupied for some time.
 
Q. The Fed didn't actually say it was going to raise rates, and many analysts say it is unlikely to do so this year. Do you agree?
 
A. I would be surprised if the Fed didn't eventually raise interest rates this year. As international economies recover, that puts more pressure on rates. And one of the main reasons the Fed cut rates three times last year was to help the world financial system. If they truly believe the patient is now healthy, they can turn off the I.V. machine.
We are not worried about consumer inflation, because there is no indication you can pass on price increases at all. In fact, companies are still cutting prices. Just look at what Amazon.com did with best sellers last week. And the competition followed.
 
Q. Does a change in rates warrant a change in how investors pick stocks?
 
A. You want to find companies that can thrive in a relatively slow-growth, low-inflation environment and companies with managements that can take advantage of opportunities. This will be more of a stock-picking market, not one you just throw money at.
 
Q. Can the hot growth stocks that have led the market thrive in this environment?
 
A. You have to be very careful what you pay for high-quality growth stocks.
This market has been helped by earnings, but it has also been helped by higher valuations for growth stocks. If interest rates are rising, I don't think these sorts of price-to-earnings multiples can be justified.
Stocks are the longest-duration financial instrument we have. They are like zero-coupon bonds. When rates are stable, price-to-earnings multiples will be stable. When rates are falling, which they have been for some time, the ratio will rise. The last thing you want to pay is 40 times earnings for a company whose growth rate is slowing.
 
Q. Name a few companies that fit your criteria for purchase at this point.
 
A. In the pharmaceutical area, a sector where most will experience a slowdown in growth, we see some companies whose growth rates are accelerating, like American Home Products and Pharmacia Upjohn.
In industrials, United Technologies will continue to be a very strong performer. About 25 percent of their business is in Asia, which will show an improvement.
 
Q. A number of companies saw the crisis in Asia as a chance to buy local businesses at bargain prices. Do you like any of them?
 
A. One industry that will benefit from those who bought on the cheap in Asia is investment banking. Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Citigroup all gained market share in these parts of the world.
 
Q. Some market forecasters say that with rates rising, a correction of 5 to 10 percent is quite possible in the next month to six weeks. Do you share that concern?
 
A. I don't know about the near term, but I do think the market is vulnerable, because there is an excess of speculation in the market. Things have been too easy for too long.

Check the Fed's Pulse. Call Us in the Long Term.

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
JAMES W. PAULSEN, the chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, says he is only tilting. Marshall Acuff, the equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, is just moving at the margin. And Jeffrey M. Applegate, the chief United States strategist at Lehman Brothers, is only trimming his expectations for returns.
These three strategists and others all had to review their outlooks last week to accommodate the fact that the Federal Reserve is now leaning toward raising its short-term interest rate target, the Federal funds rate. While no one knows when, or even if, the Fed will raise rates, the policy makers have made it clear that if inflation does tick up, they will move quickly. 
 But according to these strategists, this bias toward higher interest rates will not force them to make big changes in what they have been doing.
Even if the rally does not run wild, these analysts still expect stocks to rise. Mr. Applegate is betting that the Fed will not increase rates to slow growth and curb inflation. Mr. Paulsen doesn't think the Fed will have to raise rates -- though he says it is still a possibility. Mr. Acuff thinks any rate increase will be modest.
Mr. Paulsen has shifted his asset allocation slightly, to benefit from the bond rally he expects when it becomes clear that inflation will not get out of hand. So he is cutting his allocation to stocks to 60 percent, from 70 percent, while raising bonds to 40 percent, from 30 percent.
"I am not so negative on stocks," he said, explaining this shift. "I just think that bonds might meet them tick for tick."
He is also suggesting a small shift in the composition of stock portfolios. He thinks economic growth will slow, partly because of the rise in oil prices, the slower growth in real wages and the slump in mortgage refinancings. All three will curb consumer spending, which has been the driving force of the economy's still rapid growth.
For Mr. Paulsen, a slowdown makes growth stocks, especially the big-name companies that can produce solid earnings in a weaker economy, attractive again. He also likes financial stocks, which will benefit from declining market rates, and consumer staples, which also do well in a slower-growth environment.
But that does not mean he is dumping all his cyclical stocks, which have done very well this year. "I believe you should tilt in the direction you think the market is going," Mr. Paulsen said."But I am not selling all my cyclicals. I know I can be wrong."
Mr. Applegate is also shifting out of cyclicals and into growth stocks. "The cyclical trade has come and gone," he said. But he is holding his asset allocation at 80 percent stocks and 20 percent bonds.
The recent rise in interest rates has curbed the expansion in valuations that would help stocks move higher, he said, but corporate earnings forecasts are improving. His firm just raised its forecast for 1999 operating earnings gains to 10 percent, from 8 percent. His year-end target for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is unchanged at 1,450, 9 percent above Friday's close.
And Mr. Applegate would not think of trying to shift out of stocks to sidestep a slump. He did not even do that last summer and fall, when market indexes plunged 19 percent or more, because he worried that he would not get back in quickly enough.
Why so sanguine? Because there is confidence that the Fed will not let inflation get out of hand, which means that the long-term still looks fine. And because the investing environment had, in fact, changed long before the Fed announcement. Investors had worried most of this year about a Fed rate increase because the economy refused to slow down. The jump in long-term interest rates by a percentage point, to 5.92 percent since December, was a result.
Abby Joseph Cohen, the market strategist at Goldman, Sachs, said, "If you have been an investor paying attention, there was no major news this week and the response of the markets says that." The Dow lost just 0.77 percent, while bonds rallied, with long-term yields falling to 5.75 percent.
What investors should focus on, she added, is the positive side of the Fed announcement. As she phrased it, the Fed said: "Look folks, our economy is strong and the rest of the world is out of danger."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
With Assets Pumped Up, Few Worry About Inflation

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
INFLATION is back: Not rising prices, except for an uncharacteristic spurt in April, but the perennial debate about the sacrifices that must be made when inflation does turn into a problem.
The debate is premature. The 0.7 percent jump in the Consumer Price Index last month appears to have been an anomaly, reflecting a set of circumstances not likely to be repeated in May. But the April jump was the largest for a single month in nine years. And the Federal Reserve compounded the alarm by announcing last Tuesday that, while it was not yet raising interest rates to slow the economy and head off inflation, it was leaning that way, "concerned about the potential for a buildup of inflationary imbalances." 
Suddenly, then, a debate has revived that had lain dormant during more than two years of very modest inflation. But the terms of the debate have changed; the issues are different, and the public's perception of inflation is drastically altered.
The old alarm is missing, for one thing. The C.P.I. may have jumped in April, but Americans took no notice, according to the University of Michigan's consumer surveys. "They don't think any price increases will stick," said Richard Curtin, director of the surveys. He added that people are more relaxed about inflation than at any time since the early 1960's.
That is a considerable change. Three years ago, there was talk among policy makers of reducing the annual inflation rate to zero, even if that meant suffering higher unemployment. And people listened respectfully.
Now that talk is gone. An inflation rate of 1.5 to 2 percent (the C.P.I.'s range for most of the past year) makes no one nervous today, and a rise to 3 percent seems tolerable to the public, if not to Wall Street. After all, no homeowner -- and most of the nation's families are homeowners -- is complaining about housing prices, which have been rising briskly in most regions. Or, as Mr. Curtin put it, "An important element of the strong consumer confidence today is this rise in the value of physical assets."
The revived inflation debate is also taking place in an altered context. Inflation in America is no longer viewed as a national phenomenon, but seen as a global one. The American economy can indeed operate full-blast without the shortages that push up prices, as long as enough other countries can supplement American production by diverting their unsold merchandise and their idle labor to America's needs.
The Asian crisis and its aftermath have forced that perception into everyone's consciousness. Faced with recession and weak consumer demand at home, companies in Asia, Europe and Latin America have been sending their wares to the United States at discount prices. And, gradually, officials and economists are coming to the view that without this flood of imports, the inflation rate in the United States could not have remained so low through three years of expansion and the labor shortages it produced.
Excess global capacity is the new buzz phrase, representing a concept that three years ago most economists and policy makers thought impossible. Supply used to be considered something that rapidly fell in line with demand. Now oversupply -- caused by excess capacity, if not in the United States, then somewhere else -- is recognized as a persistent problem. And deflation, a word shunned in the old inflation debate, is a common concern in the new one.
"The global economy has become the new wild card in making policy to control inflation," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
This new emphasis showed itself last Tuesday in the reaction of the National Association of Manufacturers to the Fed's inflation concerns. The manufacturers, who often complain that they cannot raise prices because of global competition, urged the Fed to hold interest rates steady because of "the general weakness of global growth."
Two days later, when the Commerce Department announced that the trade deficit had widened in March, because of a big jump in imports, some Wall Street economists welcomed the news instead of wringing their hands as they once would have. The former thinking was that trade deficits pull the United States deeper into debt to foreign lenders who finance the nation's excess spending on imports. Eventually this borrowing can depress the dollar, and a weaker dollar then makes imports more expensive for Americans, pushing up the inflation rate.
That may yet happen. But it was not uppermost last week in the minds of the economists at Bankers Trust. They applauded. "A burgeoning trade deficit continues to act as a safety valve for the U.S. economy," they told clients, "siphoning production away from potentially overheating domestic industries and thus helping keep inflation tame."
The new inflation debate is fundamentally altered in another way. Nothing used to be of greater concern than the trade-off between domestic unemployment and domestic inflation, a concept embodied in the acronym Nairu, short for nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment. When the unemployment rate fell too low, the theory said, labor shortages would put upward pressure on wages, forcing employers to increase prices. Nairu refers to the level of unemployment below which this effect kicked in.
But where is Nairu, exactly? The common wisdom as recently as 1996 put it at 6 percent, or perhaps a bit lower. But the jobless rate dropped below 5 percent nearly two years ago, and inflation kept falling.
Many explanations are offered for this uncoupling: job insecurity, weak labor unions, temporary workers, a more productive labor force, the global economy. Whatever the cause, Nairu has lost its clout in the new inflation debate -- "sublimated by the marvelous combination of low unemployment and low inflation," as Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist, put it.
The Federal Reserve, in these new circumstances, is much more constrained. Labor shortages are no longer a persuasive reason for raising interest rates to head off inflation. And when the Fed does finally act, the communique will have to take a world view -- explaining convincingly how the global economy is now fomenting inflation in America instead of stifling it.

HEADLINE: Insurers Ask Government To Extend Health Plans

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
Health insurance companies are proposing new Federal programs and tax breaks to subsidize insurance for millions of people without coverage.
The insurance industry, which helped kill President Clinton's plan to guarantee coverage for all Americans in 1994, said it had become alarmed at the growing number of uninsured. 
 "Every American ought to be concerned that more than 43 million people lack health insurance," said Leonard D. Schaeffer, chairman of the Health Insurance Association of America, which mocked the President's plan with its "Harry and Louise" commercials five years ago.
The Clinton plan would have tightly regulated the operations, and squeezed the profits, of health insurance companies. The association's proposals, announced on Friday and intended to cover up to 28 million of the uninsured, would amount to a huge new Federal subsidy to the industry. But Mr. Schaeffer said most of the money would be passed on to doctors, hospitals and others who provide health care.
The insurers proposed expansion of the new Children's Health Insurance Program to cover uninsured people of all ages under the official poverty level (an annual income of $13,880 for a family of three). States would have a large role in arranging this coverage.
The insurance companies also proposed a new Government subsidy, in the form of vouchers, for uninsured people between 100 percent and 200 percent of the poverty level. The vouchers, about $2,000 a year for each person, could be used to buy private health insurance of the type sold by members of the association.
The industry also said the Federal Government should subsidize existing state insurance pools, for people in poor health who cannot get insurance in the private market.
In addition, the insurers asked Congress to create new tax deductions and tax credits to help small employers, self-employed people and uninsured individuals buy coverage. Congress is considering such tax breaks.
The association said these initiatives, taken together, could cost as much as $60 billion a year. But, it added, Congress could start with parts of the plan costing much less.
Judith Feder, a health policy expert who worked in the Clinton Administration from 1993 to 1995 and is now dean of policy studies at Georgetown University, said: "I commend the insurance industry for supporting the expansion of public health insurance programs for low-income people. At present, there's no medical safety net for millions of childless adults with low incomes. But it makes me nervous to depend on an undependable private insurance market for people above the poverty level."
In recent months, Congress and President Clinton have focused on ways to assist people who already have health insurance, by defining the rights of patients in health maintenance organizations and by expanding Medicare to cover prescription drugs.
But Charles N. Kahn 3d, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, said it was more urgent to provide at least basic coverage to people who did not have it.
If Congress uses some of the Federal budget surplus for health care, Mr. Kahn said, it should "spend the surplus first on basic health coverage for all Americans before it's spent on prescription drugs for seniors."
It would be easy to dismiss the association's proposals as self-interested. But the proposals reflect the anxiety of many business, labor and consumer groups over the erosion of health insurance coverage in the United States. The erosion is remarkable because it coincides with an economic boom in which the unemployment rate is at the lowest level in 29 years.
Health insurance executives say they fear that if the erosion of private insurance coverage continues, people will demand new Government programs to guarantee health benefits. Such programs could marginalize private insurance companies or force them to operate like a heavily regulated public utility.
Mr. Kahn said he saw no inconsistency between the industry's positions in 1993-94 and in 1999. Back then, he said, the association supported Mr. Clinton's goal of universal health insurance coverage and even the means to that end favored by the President, a mandate for all employers to subsidize coverage.
"Our problem with Clinton care was the overall superstructure, the bureaucratic and regulatory apparatus, not universal coverage or the employer mandate," Mr. Kahn said.

HEADLINE: The World;
Kosovo Isn't Just an Air War; It's a Blair War

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
WHAT was a British Prime Minister doing dressed down in an open-neck shirt and short sleeves and sitting cross-legged and shoeless in a refugee tent in Albania? And why was this leader of a spent imperial power passing as much time this month in places like Aachen, Bonn, Brussels, Bucharest, Chicago, Mons, Sofia, Skopje, Tirana and Washington as in London?
Through a combination of passion, stamina and focus, Prime Minister Tony Blair has turned his look of concern into NATO's most familiar face, and his sermonizing speech into the alliance's most insistent voice, articulating in emotive language a moral justification for the conflict over Kosovo and a demand for an uncompromising solution to it. 
 In the process, he is projecting a belligerent British view across the English Channel onto a continent that Britain has long treated warily, and across the Atlantic to a continent that it is used to addressing more modestly.
So far Mr. Blair's aggressiveness enjoys considerable support in Britain, but it has provoked some strong opinions abroad. Most notably, his lobbying last week for an augmented ground force that would be prepared to enter Kosovo before any peace settlement brought annoyed retorts from two allied leaders.
President Clinton told the Prime Minister during a 90-minute trans-Atlantic phone call that Britain was fostering a dangerous appearance of disunity between London and Washington, and Gerhard Schroder, the German Chancellor, said flatly that Germany was against the introduction of ground forces and would veto it in NATO. Mr. Schroder added a line that left no doubt who he thought was out of line: He described the alliance's disagreement as "this specifically British debate."
Is Mr. Blair's combative campaign a case of the old British Lion getting its lusty roar back? Or does it reflect a wholly new British assertiveness, from a self-described young modernizer interested now in remodeling Britain's global role in the attention-getting way that he has been reshaping its politics at home? Or is it a bit of both, the old noble beast turned out in eye-catching trappings from New Labor stylists?
To Kenneth Minogue, professor emeritus of government at the London School of Economics, Mr. Blair's campaign represents "a remarkably high level of personal diplomacy for us."
"It's the Diana syndrome," he continued, "a policy made by image, the image of miserable refugees, not one made in terms of long years of development." He said the 46-year-old leader's tactics had put the British into "a position of having to put up or shut up."
"And the problem is we can't put up, and we won't shut up," he added.
John Keegan, the military historian, said he thought Mr. Blair's populist brand of politics was no way to fight a war. "Master politician that he is," he said, "he has no experience of conducting the diplomatic or military side of war. He is running terrible risks. Polls show that he has a majority of public support, but it is the support of tabloid readers. The well-informed feel uninformed, are anxious and racked by doubt. Those who cheer him on do so in the spirit of football supporters."
But Anthony King, professor of government at the University of Essex, sees Mr. Blair's current conduct as squarely in the British tradition. "Certainly Churchill during World War II made it a very personal affair and went in for great personal symbolism," he said. "He was much given to posing with a tommy gun and a bowler hat, he went to bomb sites, walked the decks of warships. I've no idea whether Blair has that analogy in mind, but I think he's just doing what comes naturally."
AS for Mr. Blair trying to muscle his friend Bill Clinton, "British prime ministers have been in the business of trying to influence American presidents for a large part of this century," Professor King said. "Churchill regarded wooing and winning over Franklin Roosevelt as a prime mission of his life, Attlee was always busy with Truman, and Thatcher made it her business to work on both Reagan and Bush."
Mr. Blair's repeated calls for total victory ("no compromise, no fudge, no half-baked deals"), his reliance on graphic accounts of refugee miseries and his description of the war as a "just" one based on moral principles have resonances in British political history for Vernon Bogdanor, professor of government at Oxford University. "Gladstone talked of Bulgarian horrors and Turkish atrocities in the late 1870's, and it's in the British tradition of the liberal left to believe that one intervenes to define certain values," he said.
Its proven military capability and willingness to use it has always given Britain international influence, and Mr. Blair has exploited the current NATO mission to emphasize his desire to repair relations with the continent after the years of Conservative-sponsored estrangement. In Aachen, Germany, this month, he said he insisted that Britain resolve "once and for all its ambivalence towards Europe."
"I want to end the uncertainty, the lack of confidence, the Europhobia," he continued.
Mr. Blair's present popularity at home remains the highest of any Prime Minister in British history, and the Conservative opposition is fractured and ineffectual. Debate on Britain's war policy filled little more than half the seats in the House of Commons last Tuesday.
"At the risk of sounding naive," said Professor King, "one thing to bear in mind is that Blair is a creature of calculation, but also a creature of instinct. His sense of outrage at what the Serbs are doing is both profound and completely genuine. I don't think he's grandstanding, and he's a proven risk taker, led to his convictions by his gut and his passion."
EVEN if his view didn't prevail, that might not put him in too much jeopardy. If NATO settles for less than its declared objectives, Mr. Blair will not be the one faulted. Prompted by winks and hints from 10 Downing Street, British public opinion and the British press have already laid the charge of going for an indecisive conclusion at the door of President Clinton, and that is where it will continue to reside.
Andrew Marr, a columnist for The Observer, wrote last week that Mr. Blair's role as the aggressive young war leader at first struck him as "a crazy gamble." But he added that even as NATO bombing mistakes mount and the war's aims seem more remote, he found himself moving toward a different conclusion. "Every political instinct I have," Mr. Marr wrote, "tells me that Blair is going to emerge from this war with Kosovo back in NATO hands and a position of European leadership no British leader has enjoyed since 1945."

HEADLINE: The World: A Better System in the 19th Century?;
At This Rate, We'll Be Global in Another Hundred Years

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

 BODY:
IF anything seems obvious today, it is that globalization is a new and powerful force that is erasing national borders and linking the world in an unprecedented web of trade and investments. As one tycoon put it: "The world is a city."
But that was Baron Carl Meyer von Rothschild, in 1875, reacting as stock markets tumbled all around the world, in unison, feeding off each other. 
 Perhaps the greatest myth about globalization is that it is new. By some measures, its peak occurred a century ago, making the 20th century memorable in economic history mostly for its retreat from globalization. In some respects, only now is the world economy becoming roughly as interlinked as it was more than a century ago.
"We're still not back to where we were 100 years ago," said Charles W. Calomiris, a professor of finance and economics at the Columbia University's Graduate School of Business.
Labor is less mobile than it was in the last century. In those days, passports were unnecessary and people could travel freely from one country to the next, to visit or to work.
That mobility led 60 million Europeans to move to the Americas or Australia or elsewhere, and it helped fill up the United States. In 1900, according to the census, 14 percent of the American population was foreign born, compared to 8 percent today.
It's not just labor. The 1860's and 1870's were a golden era for free trade, and goods moved easily across borders. As late as 1879 an astonishing 95 percent of Germany's imports were still free of duty. Low trade barriers led to an explosion of trade, so that American exports soared to 7 percent of the gross national product in the late 1900's; it is 8 percent today.
Even capital seems to be less mobile now than in the 19th century. A "capital mobility index" prepared by the International Monetary Fund for a report in 1997 suggests that capital movements as a proportion of economic output are still well below the levels of the 1880's.
How can this be? A century ago, England and France invested hugely in developing countries -- places like the United States, Australia and Canada. England invested a larger share of its wealth abroad at that time than it does now.
Foreign capital financed one-third of domestic investment in New Zealand and Canada in the late 19th century, and one-quarter in Sweden. In contrast, foreign capital accounted for only about 10 percent of domestic investment in emerging markets in the 1990's, according to the I.M.F.
"To me as an economic historian, it was really the 19th century that represented the birth of the global economy," said Alan M. Taylor, an economist at Northwestern University. "These days, it's just getting back to where it was 100 years ago."
Mr. Taylor suggested that 19th-century investors might well have had a larger share of their stock portfolios invested abroad than investors do today. He noted that Americans often have living rooms full of goods from all over the world, but their portfolios still tend to be focused in the United States. That discrepancy, he said, may be an anachronism related to financial markets' being less globalized than markets for goods (at least until recently).
In some respects, globalization predates the 19th century. Chinese demand for silver in the 16th through 18th centuries played a role in financing the Spanish empire and the slave trade. China absorbed perhaps half of the global production of silver, and that bolstered prices and created wealth for mining magnates in the Americas -- who traded their silver for slaves. After passing through several hands, the silver was used to purchase Chinese porcelain and silk.
Although it is often said today that globalization is irreversible, it proved very reversible early in this century. After economic integration reached a peak in the late 19th century, there was an astonishing retreat after World War I and especially after the Great Depression. Since World War II, trade and international investment rose again, and they have soared in the last couple of decades.
"After the first world war, we had a massive interruption and reversal of the long-term trend," said Jagdish Bhagwati, an international economist at Columbia University. "One interpretation is that now we're just climbing back on that trend."
Still, today's globalization is new in some important ways, and arguably it touches many more people than the earlier kind.
Professor Bhagwati noted that trade in the 19th century consisted mostly of commodities. Now it is mainly manufactured goods with parts from so many countries that it is difficult to describe the finished products as made in any one nation.
CAPITAL flows are also different, says David Hale, chief global economist of the Zurich Group, a financial services company. In the 19th century, capital movements represented the savings of a relatively small group of prosperous families in England and France who were investing for the long term. Today investments are far more broadly based, he said, and much more likely to be leveraged and short term, more flighty and speculative.
One result is that capital rushes around the globe much more quickly than ever before, and is more prone to sweep into countries and then out. Technology has created an electronic herd but as yet no electronic cowboys to control the herd.
Indeed, for a world without telephones or computers, the 19th century had its economic advantages. Output shot up and down like a roller coaster, but mostly up. Professor Calomiris has recorded 90 major banking crises over the last 20 years, and he notes that they often led to runs on national currencies. In contrast, in the period from 1870 to 1913, he can find only five major banking crises, and just one of those led to an exchange rate crisis. In many ways, he argues, 19th-century globalization worked better than today's.
"It's very hard to recapture the successes of the earlier period," Professor Calomiris said, but he thinks it is worth a try. It may seem heretical to tinker with the 21st-century process by looking over one's shoulder for models a hundred years past, but it is a reminder that globalization may well be older than nationalization.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Citizenship Has Its Privileges;
The Court Resurrects A Civil War-Era Ideal

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN constitutional law, as in geology, things can look perfectly stable on the surface -- until the tectonic plates shift underneath.
As the Supreme Court term heads into its final weeks, the question is whether such a shift may be underway. In its decision last week striking down California's reduced welfare benefits for newcomers to the state, the Court relied on a portion of the 14th Amendment that forbids states to restrict the "privileges or immunities" of American citizens. 
 This is the long-neglected privileges-or-immunities clause, the sudden resurrection of which, by a broad 7-to-2 majority, was certainly one of the most surprising and possibly one of the most consequential constitutional developments in years.
The 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868 to ratify the outcome of the Civil War, says in its first paragraph, "No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." There is historical evidence that the amendment's drafters regarded the privileges-or-immunities clause as more important than the much-invoked guarantees of due process and equal protection that it precedes in the text.
But the clause was sent into early eclipse by an 1873 Supreme Court decision known as the Slaughter-House cases, which held that the clause protected only the rights of national citizenship and placed no new obligations on the states.
So by turning back to this long-buried language, the Court was taking at least a tentative step on a new path of constitutional analysis. While the ultimate destination is uncertain, it appeals to both conservatives, who see the clause as a new source for protection for property and economic rights, and for weary liberals, who see it as a means for protecting individual rights without having to fight endless battles over the meaning of due process.
And indeed, Justices across the ideological spectrum signed their names to this opinion, from John Paul Stevens, its author and arguably the Court's most liberal member, to Antonin Scalia, one of the most conservative.
While Justice Clarence Thomas dissented, disagreeing that welfare was one of the historically protected privileges, he made clear his enthusiasm for reconsidering the privileges-or-immunities clause in an "appropriate case." That left Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist oddly isolated in his complaint that "the Court today breathes new life into the previously dormant privileges or immunities clause," an observation that the majority did not rebut.
The Justices who came together in the California welfare case, Saenz v. Roe, did not necessarily do so for the same reasons, or with the same expectations of where this new opening might lead. The privileges-or-immunities clause has been invisible for so long that there are few recognizable signposts, and there were no concurring opinions by which individual members of the majority might have elaborated on the analysis.
But at the least, to carry the geological analogy a step further, the opinion undoubtedly achieved a release of doctrinal tension much as an earthquake relieves pressure that builds up under the Earth's crust.
The two-tiered welfare program challenged in this case was quite clearly unconstitutional under the Court's most directly relevant precedent, a 1969 decision called Shapiro v. Thompson that invoked a constitutional "right to travel" to bar states from denying welfare benefits during a newcomer's first year of residency.
Yet there was probably no member of the current Court completely at ease with the analytic method that produced Shapiro v. Thompson. That decision represented a kind of high-water mark of the Warren Court's open-ended approach to constitutional analysis -- so much so that Chief Justice Earl Warren himself dissented from Justice William J. Brennan's majority opinion, which candidly conceded that the right to travel was not anchored to any particular place in the Constitution.
"We have no occasion to ascribe the source of this right to travel interstate to a particular constitutional provision," Justice Brennan wrote. It goes without saying that there are no Warren Court-style liberals on the Court today. Briefs from a group of states and other interested parties in the current case urged the Justices simply to overrule the 1969 precedent.
Instead, in Justice Stevens's practiced hands, the right to travel did not disappear but morphed into a right of national citizenship that each state is obliged to honor and that, more to the point, has a solid foundation in the Constitution's text. For the Court's moderate Justices, the privileges-or-immunities clause offers a comfort zone that permits them to defend individual rights while shedding the baggage of liberal methodology.
For conservatives, particularly those with libertarian leanings like Justice Thomas, the appeal of the clause is even clearer. There is no dispute that, as a matter of history, the privileges the amendment's drafters sought to protect included the right to earn a living, enter into contracts and acquire and maintain property free of government interference -- all aspects of the natural law philosophy that inspired the signers of the Declaration of Independence.
THE privileges-or-immunities clause should be used to restore "the fundamental connection between the Constitution and its natural law foundations," Roger Pilon, director of constitutional studies for the Cato Institute, a libertarian policy group here, wrote in a law review article several months ago.
One result would be, Mr. Pilon argues, to raise the level of protection for economic rights, like unrestricted land use, which receive only minimal scrutiny under current constitutional analysis, to the level of protection given to individual rights that under the current approach are deemed "fundamental."
In any event, it is clear that the Justices in a sense are simply catching up with a lively discussion that has been going on for some time among legal academics and constitutional historians. A broad, although by no means universal, consensus has emerged that the Slaughter-House decision of 1873 was based on a mistaken understanding of the intent of the drafters.
Now that the Court has spoken, however tentatively, that conversation will expand to a wider audience. Arguments based on privileges or immunities will be developed in law review articles and presented to lower court judges, who in turn will write opinions that will provide more raw material for the Court, if the Justices want to use it to move further down the new path.
Just as the Court does not act in isolation from the rest of the legal system, cases on its docket do not exist in isolation from one another. Between now and the end of next month, the Justices will announce decisions in three cases that challenge the power of the Federal Government with respect to the states.
It would be surprising if the Court does not continue on its recent course of shifting power away from Congress, a result the states are actively seeking. But new power may come with a price if, as California learned on Monday, the Court at the same time is placing new obligations on the states to safeguard the rights of all their citizens.

HEADLINE: PRIVATE SECTOR;
Celebrating Women's Success

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
Once the women numbered only eight. This week, 800 were at the annual Financial Women's Association dinner at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan, honoring Abby Joseph Cohen, who as Goldman, Sachs's chief United States market strategist is Wall Street's most influential bull, and Charlene Barshefsky, the United States Trade Representative.
Founded 43 years ago by the eight -- the only eight women on Wall Street then, said Lenore C. Albom, a vice president at Chase Securities and the group's president -- the association began as an alternative to the Men's Investment Club, which had denied them membership. Today, the Men's Investment Club no longer exists, and the women's association is selling fund-raising tables at $5,000 a clip. 
 Both honorees wore their trademark silk scarves and both presented rosy views of the American economy. Ms. Cohen was chosen as a symbol of women's hopes and frustrations: long denied a partnership at Goldman, Sachs, she finally gained one last year. In an introduction, Elaine Kloss, an agent with the New York Life Insurance Company, repeated a favorite quip of Ms. Cohen's: "I believe that every male chief executive should have a working wife."
Ms. Cohen's perspective on attaining that partnership? "It was not the defining moment of my life," she said, "but it was very pleasant."

A Surprise Showing by Small-Cap Stocks

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE 

 BODY:
Cinderella finally showed up at the ball. For whatever reason -- a presummer lull or concern about how blue-chip companies would be affected by rising interest rates -- small-capitalization companies were the market's stars last week. But for how long?
 The Russell index of 2,000 small-cap stocks rose 1.4 percent for the week, to 449.14. The increase, which sent the index near its high for the year, came as the Dow Jones industrial average, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and Nasdaq fell fractionally. 
 "Some of the money coming out of the large-cap stocks is just looking for a new home," Tony Cecin, director of institutional trading at Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis, told The Associated Press.
 Analysts were divided, however, on whether that was a trend or just a sign of an aimless market after a shift by the Fed toward favoring a rate increase.
 Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd., told Reuters: A big yellow flag was raised this week. That's why we're drifting in a narrow trading range.
 Elsewhere, stocks fell in Japan and Hong Kong for the week, but climbed in European markets.

HEADLINE: A Just and Necessary War

BYLINE: By William Jefferson Clinton; William Jefferson Clinton is the 42d President.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
We are in Kosovo with our allies to stand for a Europe, within our reach for the first time, that is peaceful, undivided and free. And we are there to stand against the greatest remaining threat to that vision: instability in the Balkans, fueled by a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing.
The problem is not simply ethnic hatred, or even ethnic conflict. The people of the former Yugoslavia have lived together for centuries with greater and lesser degrees of conflict, but not the constant "cleansing" of peoples from their land. Had they experienced nothing but that, their nations would be homogenous today, not endlessly diverse. 
 The intolerable conditions the region finds itself in today are the result of a decadelong campaign by Slobodan Milosevic to build a greater Serbia by singling out whole peoples for destruction because of their ethnicity and faith. The brutal methods are familiar now. Spreading hate in the media. Killing moderate leaders. Arming paramilitaries and ordering soldiers to conduct planned campaigns of murder and expulsion. Eradicating the culture, the heritage, the very record of the presence of his victims. Refugees are not a byproduct of the fighting he has initiated; the fighting is designed to create refugees. We are haunted by the images of people driven from their homes, pushing the elderly in wheelbarrows, telling stories of relatives murdered.
We saw this for the first time in Croatia and in Bosnia. The international community responded at first with a studied neutrality that equated victims with aggressors; it followed with diplomacy and the deployment of unarmed peacekeepers with the mandate, but not the means, to protect civilians. By the time NATO acted, 250,000 people were dead, more than two million displaced, and many have still not returned. People will look back on Kosovo and say that this time, because we acted soon and forcefully enough, more lives were saved and the refugees all came home. The Balkan conflict that began 10 years ago in Kosovo will have ended in Kosovo.
We cannot respond to such tragedies everywhere, but when ethnic conflict turns into ethnic cleansing where we can make a difference, we must try, and that is clearly the case in Kosovo. Had we faltered, the result would have been a moral and strategic disaster. The Kosovars would have become a people without a homeland, living in difficult conditions in some of the poorest countries in Europe, overwhelming new democracies. The Balkan conflict would have continued indefinitely, posing a risk of a wider war and of continuing tensions with Russia. NATO itself would have been discredited for failing to defend the very values that give it meaning. Those who say Kosovo is too small to be of great importance forget these simple facts.
When the violence in Kosovo began in early 1998, we exhausted every diplomatic avenue for a settlement. Last October, we convinced Mr. Milosevic that he should withdraw some forces from Kosovo and allow an unarmed international presence. That is the solution advocates of compromise propose today. But it failed last fall. Mr. Milosevic broke his promises, poured more troops into Kosovo, poised for an offensive he had been planning for months. When it began, we had to act.
Mr. Milosevic's strategy has been to outlast us by dividing the alliance. He has failed. Instead of disunity in Brussels, there are growing signs of disaffection in Belgrade: Serbian soldiers abandoning their posts, Serbian civilians protesting the policies of their leader, young men avoiding conscription, prominent Serbs calling on Mr. Milosevic to accept NATO's conditions. Meanwhile, our air campaign has destroyed or damaged one-third of Serbia's armored vehicles in Kosovo, half its artillery, most of its ability to produce ammunition, all its capacity to refine fuel and done enormous damage to other sectors of its economy. Though he has driven hundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanians from their homes, Mr. Milosevic has not eliminated the Kosovar Liberation Army. Indeed, its ranks are swelling, and it has begun to go on the offensive against Serb forces hunkered down to hide from air strikes.
Now Mr. Milosevic faces the certainty of continuing air strikes, the persistence of the K.L.A. and the prospect of having to answer to his people for starting an unwinnable conflict that is bringing military failure and economic ruin. The question now is not whether his ethnic cleansing will be reversed, but when, and how much of his military he is willing to see destroyed along the way.
While I do not rule out other military options, we are pursuing our present strategy for three reasons. First, and most important, it is working and will succeed in meeting NATO's basic conditions of restoring the Kosovars to their homes, with Serb forces out of Kosovo and the deployment of an international security force. This force must have NATO at its core, which means it must have NATO command and control and NATO rules of engagement, with special arrangements for non-NATO countries, just like our force in Bosnia. Our military campaign will continue until these conditions are met, not because we are stubborn or arbitrary, but because these are the only conditions under which the refugees will go home in safety and under which the K.L.A. have any incentive to disarm -- the basic requirements of a resolution that will work.
Second, this strategy has broad and deep support in the alliance, and allows us to meet our objectives. While there may be differences in domestic circumstances, cultural ties to the Balkans and ideas on tactics, there is no question about our unity on goals and our will to prevail. I have worked hard to shape our present consensus; 60 days into the air campaign, NATO is more unified on Kosovo than it was at the beginning.
Third, this strategy gives us the best opportunity to meet our goals in a way that strengthens, not weakens, our fundamental interest in a long-term, positive relationship with Russia. Russia is now helping to work out a way for Belgrade to meet our conditions. Russian troops should participate in the force that will keep the peace in Kosovo, turning a source of tension into an opportunity for cooperation, like our joint effort in Bosnia.
Finally, we must remember that the reversal of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo is not sufficient to end ethnic conflict in the Balkans and establish lasting stability. The European Union and the United States must do for southeastern Europe what we did for Western Europe after World War II and for Central Europe after the cold war. Freedom, respect for minority rights, and prosperity are powerful forces for progress. They give people goals to work for; they elevate hope over fear and tomorrow over yesterday. We can do that by rebuilding struggling economies, encouraging trade and investment and helping the nations of the region join NATO and the European Union. Already, the region's democracies are responding to the pull of integration by sticking with their reforms, taking in refugees and supporting NATO's campaign. A democratic Serbia that respects the rights of its people and its neighbors can and should join them. If it does, we will help to restore it to its rightful place as a European state in the Balkans, not a balkanized state at the periphery of Europe.
The Balkans are not fated to be the heart of European darkness, a region of bombed mosques, men and boys shot in the back, young women raped, all traces of group and individual history rewritten or erased. Just as leaders took their people down that road, leaders must take them back to a better tomorrow. Ultimately, we and our allies can help make this happen, if we stick with NATO's campaign and follow through with a strategy to insure that the forces pulling southeastern Europe together are stronger than the forces tearing it apart.

HEADLINE: At Ivy, Women Are Welcome

 BODY:

To the Editor:
As one of Princeton's 4,200 undergraduates who are not Ivy members, I found Monique Yazigi's feature misleading and disappointing. She seemed intent on writing an article to prove that, in her words, "the pendulum is swinging back, in part a reflection of an increasingly status-conscious, money-conscious era." She missed the real story. While most colleges and universities still have a brutal social sifting process of "rush," the majority of Princeton eating clubs determine their membership by lottery. While fraternities and sororities remain dominant at many schools, Prospect Avenue clubs are entirely coed. While administrative crackdowns on alcohol use are leaving a void in the social scene elsewhere, the eating clubs foster a system in which students spend time soberly eating meals. 
 Yes, the racial, social and economic mix is not perfect at Princeton. It would be hard to find a school where it was. The eating clubs are really a surprising story about a change from an all-male, selective tradition into a coed, more democratic one.

HEADLINE: Blair's Countercultural Plan for Welfare: Get Work

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 22

 BODY:
There were dozens of job opportunities listed at the shiny new Palmers Green job center in the far north of the city, but they were not of immediate concern to James Baxter, who has been unemployed for several months and gets about 50 pounds a week, or $80, in dole money.
What was he doing there, then? "I'm waiting to go see that lady, sign a piece of paper and disappear," explained Mr. Baxter, 23. "The primary reason I'm here is because they pay out benefits. That's the main reason anyone comes to a job center." 
 Maybe so, but it is an attitude that Prime Minister Tony Blair says he is determined to change. Through a two-pronged program that aims both to put the unemployed back to work and to rein in the country's $158.9 billion dollar-a-year welfare bill, Mr. Blair has pledged nothing less than an end to what he calls the "something-for-nothing welfare state."
"The days of an automatic right to benefit will go," Mr. Blair said in February. "If you can work, you should work."
It sounds reasonable, but it is a tall order. Aspects of the welfare reform program have infuriated legislators on Labor's left wing and interest groups representing the sick and disabled, who say that some of the proposed cuts will take benefits away from some of the neediest people.
The welfare culture is so entrenched in Britain that some 30 million of its 59 million residents currently receive some kind of state assistance, in the form of pensions, housing benefits, disability benefits, unemployment benefits, child benefits and the like. And to most people, such support is seen as a right, not a privilege.
"There's always been quite a profound difference in philosophy between here and America when it comes to welfare," said Maeve Sherlock, director of the National Council of One-Parent Families, an interest group.
"Here, if my husband walked out and I lost my job," she added, "I wouldn't for one minute feel guilty about claiming benefits. The danger of Tony Blair's rhetoric is that he seems to be saying there is something intrinsically wrong with your going out and getting your benefits."
At the same time, many critics of the Government's program argue that it reflects what they say is Mr. Blair's Achilles' Heel: the desire to be all things to all people, to appeal to the conservative-leaning middle class that helped propel him into office in 1997 while not abandoning the poor and working classes, Labor's traditional base. The tough talk, they say, is one thing; the reality may fall short of the promise.
"Tony Blair is like someone who has inherited a bar from an elderly widow who's spent nothing on it for years, and he's trying to tell his mum that everything's going to be the same -- nothing's going to change -- and at the same time he's trying to tell his friends that everything's going to change," said Martin Evans, a research fellow at the Center for Analysis of Public Exclusion at the London School of Economics.
Or, as the director of one poverty interest group put it, "The rhetoric is much worse than the action."
Mr. Blair's program, which freely borrows much of its stern philosophical message from the United States, is re-examining many segments of the welfare state. Conceived during the Second World War by the economist Sir William Beveridge as a way to provide Britons with social security "from the cradle to the grave," the system has grown wildly, now representing about a third of the Government's total annual spending.
"It was designed to pay out stopgap insurance between periods of unemployment," Alistair Darling, the British Social Security Secretary, said in a recent interview. "It was designed to be progressive, as a force for good and achievement. The reason we have to reform the system is because it is no longer in tune with modern needs and modern times."
To that end, the Government has begun a program in which people ages 18 to 24 who have been unemployed for at least six months face losing their dole money unless they get a job or enter a training program, although the jobless rate among the group is 13.5 percent.
It has also proposed legislation under which recipients of most state benefits, including single mothers, the long-term unemployed and the disabled, would be required to attend regular interviews with job counselors or risk losing the payments.
Mr. Blair has pledged to cut $1.6 billion a year from the nation's welfare bill by eradicating waste and fraud, and to cut $1.2 billion a year from the disability benefits programs by tightening up eligibility requirements and cutting benefits to higher-income recipients. And he has made it clear that the old system, under which people could sometimes receive benefits without even having to provide proof of identification, is no longer acceptable.
"I was amazed to find that many people receive benefits for years at a time without anyone returning to see if they are still entitled to them," Mr. Blair said in February.
Among the most notorious programs in the system, at least from the Government's point of view, is the incapacity, or disability, benefits program, which pays up to $106.80 a week to people who, through illness or accident, are physically unable to work.
During the Thatcher years, when whole industries collapsed, many people who lost their jobs found that their doctors were willing to declare them incapable of working. This enabled them to sign up for incapacity benefits -- which pay more than unemployment benefits -- and allowed the Government to claim that fewer people were actually unemployed.
As a result, Mr. Darling said, a quarter of men over the age of 60 are claiming the incapacity benefit. "There was an acceptance that people would write themselves off, or be written off," he said. The general unemployment rate -- 6.2 percent -- remains artificially low because of the strict definition of unemployment.
But even as it cracks down on some benefits programs, the Government has poured money into others by, for instance, increasing child benefits by nearly $4.80, to $23 a week for the eldest child (subsequent children generate $15.35 a week). It has also increased the state pension to $106.80 a week for single people, and $170.70 for couples, and vowed to increase the amount it spends on disabled and incapacitated people by $1.6 billion in the next several years.
Still, Labor's program has drawn fire from both the right and the left.
The most stringent cuts have outraged Labor politicians on the party's left wing, as well as interest groups representing the poor and disabled. Frank Field, who resigned as the Government's Minister for Welfare Reform over policy and personality disagreements last summer, has repeatedly accused Labor of backing down on its promises and of abandoning the disabled.
"What I had hoped was that the Government had moved away from this kind of blanket, machine-gun attack, thinking that savings can be made by firing at all claimants in the hope of catching some of those who should not be claiming," Mr. Field said.
At the same time, a spokesman for the Tory Party said: "It's all talk and no action. In very broad terms, the Government came into office saying that they would cut welfare bills. But the bills have gone up."
It is far too soon, of course, to assess the full impact of the Government's program, particularly because its centerpiece, the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill, has yet to be enacted by Parliament. The bill passed the House of Commons by a vote of 360 to 142 this week, after a raucous debate in which 67 Labor members defied Mr. Blair by voting against the amendment to cut the incapacity benefits program. It now goes to the House of Lords.
The program the Government points to as being the most successful is its $4.16 billion scheme to get young people back to work. Under the program, Labor says, 61,380 young people have found jobs lasting longer than six months, and 58,000 others have received training and work experience. About 515,000 youths remain without jobs.
It is just this program that Mr. Baxter, who has been happily picking up his dole checks for several months, will be forced to enter if he does not find work soon. The $80 he collects each week is about average here. Hoping to increase the incentive to work, this year the Government enacted a minimum wage for people 18 and over -- $4.80 an hour for 18 to 20 year-olds, and $5.75 for people 21 and over.
As it happens, however, Mr. Baxter's prospects are better than most: he is a recent college graduate who sees his unemployment benefit as a stopgap measure between jobs, not a long-term way of life.
But even he wonders how useful the New Deal program will be. "It's supposed to be a shock so it gets you hunting for a job," he said. "But we have such an entrenched benefit culture here. People don't want to be seen loafing around and not doing work. But it's so easy to get benefits. And people expect that those who need help will get it from the Government."

HEADLINE: Our Towns;
City's Artists Are Its Pride, And a Pain

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: PEEKSKILL, N.Y.

 BODY:
THIS old river city made a pretty good living in the last century as a factory and shipping town, but by the start of this decade the factories and the ships were long gone, and all that remained was a dying downtown and a declining population.
Then somebody had an idea: artists!
Artists are a kind of pilot fish for gentrification, the City Council reasoned. They like cheap lodging, they aren't fussy about their surroundings, and yet they attract flocks of big spenders. No pushy billionaire ever bothered the fishermen and potato farmers of the East End of Long Island until artists started moving there at the turn of the century. SoHo did not even have a name, let alone languid connoisseurs in expensive black clothes, until artists discovered its industrial lofts. 
 But artists also bring their prickly politics, as Peekskill's City Council has learned in the 10 years of success in luring dozens of painters and sculptors to the city's specially zoned Arts District.
It was a group of artists who tried last fall to change the name of North Division Street to Paul Robeson Street, to honor the singer whose concerts 50 years ago in nearby Cortlandt were famously disrupted by racist rioters. Artists, too, are at the core of a group that has protested loudly at recent Council meetings to keep the city from installing police surveillance cameras at downtown intersections. The city says there has been drug dealing there, but Georgia Svolos, a sculptor who moved here from the Lower East Side five years ago, says she smells racism.
"The town council wants to gentrify Peekskill, and they want to do it by pandering to the fears of the white people they are trying to attract," said Ms. Svolos, who is white and a grandmother. "They feel that fear of violence, a k a fear of blacks, is keeping people away, so they want to put cameras on Main Street to make the blacks make themselves invisible."
Peekskill's Mayor, Frances S. Gibbs, says the anticamera insurgents are a minority, and if she has any regrets about inviting them to Peekskill, she isn't saying.
Peekskill has about 60 artists at work now -- there will be an "open studios" day for visitors on Saturday -- and its reviving downtown is "like a cross between Mayberry and the Bronx," as Lynne Nayman, a real estate agent, puts it. But unlike the Bronx, Peekskill has not elected a Democratic mayor or Council member since before a young Republican comer named George E. Pataki became Mayor in 1981, and this may have widened the gap between city officials and protesters, who use "Republican" as a self-explanatory slur.
Ms. Svolos was recently arrested, with Valerie Courreges, a multimedia artist, and Nick Mottern, a carpenter and member of a vegetarian restaurant collective, for violating the city's new rules on addressing the council. A "Cookies for Court Costs" bake sale last weekend raised $148.
Ms. Courreges, who came from Brooklyn, sees Peekskill's plan for public cameras in the light of 19th-century prison design and 20th-century deconstructionist philosophy. "Foucault wrote about how architecture and design are made to surveil and control people," she said. "To me, the cameras are the technological equivalent of Jeremy Bentham's panopticon -- it is like bringing the prisons to the street."
Ms. Svolos said her group had collected 150 signatures opposing the cameras, but on the streets there was considerable support for them. "I've seen things get worse since I got here," said Anthony Soto, who works for the Veterans Administration and moved here from 110th Street and Lexington Avenue two years ago. "I think the cameras are a good idea."
Suzanne Mucci, who recently opened Vintage Hudson Realty at Main and North Division Streets, where one camera would go, is also in favor. "We're working very hard to create a historic district and to promote business, and to attract people we need to get some of those people off the streets," she said.
The protesters do not represent all of the arts community, said Larry D'Amico, a painter. "There are plenty of artists who are opposed to the cameras," he said, "but they are also opposed to the tactics of this radical clique."

HEADLINE: Jordan's King Makes Most Of His Visit To the States

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
Call him the unorthodox royal.
Three months after he ascended the throne, 37-year-old King Abdullah of Jordan came to Washington a week ago for serious work and a bit of fun. 
 On the weighty side, he paid the kinds of visits expected of a head of state: to the White House and Capitol Hill.
On the business side, he did something unusual for a king. He was guest of honor at a lunch at the United States Chamber of Commerce and asked chief executives to please invest in his needy country.
On the fun side, King Abdullah, a bearded "Star Trek" buff, went to the movies. He chose "The Matrix," a cyber-age action film.
Getting to the movie was not so amusing, however.
"I was pretty shocked," the King said, describing his regal transition in a talk with scholars, diplomats and journalists at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "I was so used to just jump in a taxi and go to a movie theater. I had to go in a six-car motorcade with sirens blaring. When I got out I felt like putting a jacket over my head, I was so embarrassed."
Abdullah became King in February after the death of his father, Hussein, one of the best-known foreign visitors to a succession of American Presidents.
The new King came to introduce himself, to stress what he called the "continuity" of his father's foreign policy and to emphasize Jordan's need for economic growth.
Diplomats and Middle East experts here greeted him with particular interest, not only out of respect for his father but also because he represents the first in what is likely to be a new guard of Arab leadership.
In future years, the aging leaders of Syria, Morocco and the Palestinians will pass on, leaving King Abdullah in the next decade or so as probably the most experienced of a new generation of Arab leaders.
Wherever he spoke during his weeklong stay, King Abdullah stressed that for Jordan to play a role as mediator in the Middle East and be a confident friend to Israel as well as Arab countries, its stagnant economy has to improve.
To that end, he is asking wealthy governments -- chiefly Japan, France and Germany -- to forgive $3.5 billion of Jordan's obligations, half the country's crushing debt burden. The United States forgave $700 million in Jordanian debt last year.
For its part, the King said, Jordan is reforming its largely state-run economy. "We're streamlining the Government, privatizing the economy," he told the executives at the Chamber of Commerce.
As evidence of his intentions in pushing economic reform, he pointed to his new Prime Minister, Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh, whom he introduced to the business people by his nickname, "the Bulldozer."
He promised potential investors that if they came to Jordan they would find a reduced bureaucracy and almost instant connections. "We're doing the best we can so that anyone coming to Jordan meets the right people right away," he said.
On the third day of the King's visit, Ehud Barak was elected Prime Minister of Israel, a victory that Abdullah made no secret of welcoming. His father made peace with Israel in 1994, but the decision remains deeply unpopular among Jordanians. The new King has vowed to stay "absolutely committed" to the peace made by his father.
Trained at Sandhurst, the British military academy, Abdullah commanded Jordan's special forces until his elevation to the throne. He said he got along well with Mr. Barak, Israel's most decorated general.
"We have a good working relationship with this Government," he said at the strategy forum. "They are a Government of soldiers."
But he warned that Palestinians may be unrealistic to hope for better ties with Israel now that Benjamin Netanyahu is no longer Prime Minister. "The fear is obviously with such a high comes high expectations," he said. "If you have an increase in aspirations and nothing happens in four to five months down the line, there could be a worse backlash."
The United States was especially interested in the King's recent trip to Syria, which marked a reconciliation. He spoke warmly of Syria, saying that it wanted to "put its past behind it," and that he hoped for "some breakthrough between Israel and Syria."
On Iraq, with which Jordan shares a substantial border, the King displayed some differences with Clinton Administration policy. Jordan's once strong economic ties with Baghdad have been shattered by the conflict with Saddam Hussein.
"When all else fails, dialogue might be an option," King Abdullah said of Iraq policy. "We are very concerned about the plight of the Iraqi people."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
The Complete and Candid Schilling

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Whether he is fairly paid or underpaid, Curt Schilling earns his money. No, he more than earns it. He works overtime, both on days when he is supposed to work and on days when he is supposed to be off. In an era of pitch counts and pitcher pampering, Schilling is the square peg in the round hole. He just doesn't fit.
The dean of the Philadelphia Phillies' attractive young team, Schilling is the reincarnation of Robin Roberts, the team's Hall of Fame pitching star of the first half of the 1950's, a player who more often than not completed what he started. 
 Last season, Schilling led the major leagues in pitchers' blue-collar statistics, working 268 2/3 innings and throwing 4,213 pitches, according to Stats Inc. Half of that work was the result of a major league-leading 15 complete games, which matched the most anyone has achieved since Roger Clemens completed 18 starts in 1987.
Earning about one-third of Kevin Brown's average salary of $15 million, Schilling again leads in complete games with four, double anyone else's total, and is near the top in innings pitched and pitches thrown.
He also apparently leads the league in outspokenness, which resulted, he told some Mets players, in screaming matches with the Phillies' managing partner, David Montgomery, and general manager, Ed Wade, last Thursday. The confrontations stemmed from his comments in interviews that ownership wasn't committed to winning.
The Phillies' officials took exception to his stinging remarks, but they have never had a problem with his work ethic, which sets Schilling apart from most starting pitchers working today.
"I approach the game as mine," Schilling said. "With pitch counts and all the junk that comes with being a young pitcher in the 90's, it's not something a lot of teams are interested in pushing their kids to do. They don't care to have them learn what it's like to get a guy out for a fourth time without your good stuff."
The questionable lesson, he said, is not lost on pitchers.
"I've run into a lot more guys who get pulled out after six with a lead and have a smile on their face than guys who are angry being pulled after six," Schilling said.
This 32-year-old right-hander becomes angry with anyone who is responsible for his premature departure, especially himself. He puts in too much effort, he feels, not to be in a game in the ninth inning. He is scheduled to start against the Mets at Shea Stadium today, and he has been preparing for this start since his last one on Monday.
"I'm putting my Mets game plan together now," Schilling said last week. "I envision a way to get a hitter out, and there will be variables to that. I'll get so and so out this way; he's the kind of hitter who won't adjust, so I'll keep pitching him that way unless he adjusts. This guy I have to change. The first at-bat, I'll do this, the next time this. These are things I write down in my notes and have on the bench with me.
"My whole mind-set in devising my game plan is to get ready to get each hitter out three or four times a night. So I prepare to be the guy getting hitters out in the ninth inning in their fourth at-bat. I don't know any other way to get ready to pitch other than going nine. I've never approached it any other way."
The tools of Schilling's preparation are as important to his success as his fastball.
"I have notes on hitters, notes on umpires; everything I need to be ready to pitch on the day I pitch," he said. "I've been keeping notes since 1992. I have every at-bat on my laptop. There's no reason why I shouldn't be able to go out and win if I throw strikes."
When Schilling had been in the major leagues for only a week, in September 1989, after being called up by Baltimore, the Orioles were playing in Texas, and he and his fellow rookie Ben McDonald mustered the nerve to talk to Nolan Ryan.
"He said there are things I can and can't do on days I pitch," Schilling related, recalling the conversation vividly. "He said I can't control the weather, the umpires or the emotional state of the other team. But I can control one thing. I can be better prepared than the hitters I face that day.
"If preparation was that important to him, everybody else should be playing catch up. It took me a while to figure out how to do that. I've done it. I believe I'm better prepared than any hitter I face."
But even the best laid plans go awry once in a while, no?
"I try to prepare so thoroughly that there's never a situation that arises in a game that surprises me," Schilling said. "I might be not sure of myself because I have more than one idea, but I'm never surprised because surprise is not a good thing. I've made 200 starts and never been shocked on the mound by something."
Schilling, who has never won more than 17 games in a season, is off to his best start, with a 7-1 record, since the Phillies' pennant-winning season of 1993. With Randy Johnson in the National League, Schilling is unlikely to lead the league in strikeouts for the third successive season, but he could still join Ryan as the only pitchers in history to strike out 300 or more batters in three successive seasons. He has 58 strikeouts and a 2.58 earned run average.
The garrulous Schilling did not reach this juncture as an overnight sensation. He was traded three times in less than four years before he established himself as a major league starter.
Boston traded him and Brady Anderson to the Orioles in 1988 for Mike Boddicker. The Orioles sent him to Houston with Pete Harnisch and Steve Finley in a 1991 trade for Glenn Davis. And then the Astros traded him to the Phillies in 1992 for Jason Grimsley, who seven seasons later has revived his pitching career with the Yankees.
Now Schilling is the most sought-after pitcher in the majors. Just about every contending team that does not have a platoon of good starters is eager to acquire him by the July 31 nonwaiver trading deadline, if not before. The hitch is that the Phillies do not have to trade him; they have Schilling under contract through the 2001 season.
However, the Phillies could add to their nucleus of good young players by trading Schilling, who has a no-trade provision, meaning he has to approve the team he would be traded to.
"My first choice is where I'm at," the pitcher said. "I want to be here if something positive is going to happen with this club. That's really up to the ownership of this team."
Citing the Phillies' low, $30 million payroll, Schilling said he has seen no signs in the last couple of years that the owners are serious about contending.
"Ownership has to step up and help, come the trading deadline, and make a financial commitment to this team," he said. "If they don't want to do that, I don't want to be here."
Not that Schilling doesn't like what he sees in the surprising Phillies, who are 21-19 after Friday night's 7-5 loss to the Mets.
"It's just a different environment to pitch in from what I've been accustomed to here the last four, five years," he said. "It changes your mentality as a pitcher. Going through what we've gone through, with nobody to blame but ourselves, for the last five years, it's nice to see a big league club take the field every day and not a patchwork collection of guys. We have an incredibly talented nucleus of young players."
As complimentary as Schilling was about the team, he incurred the wrath of Phillies owners and executives when he repeated his comments about lack of commitment on Major League Baseball's weekly national telephone conference call last Tuesday.
Wade, whom Schilling praised in the interview for doing the best he could under the economic circumstances imposed upon him, criticized his star pitcher for being anything but positive about the Phillies.
Responding to Schilling's charge that the team hadn't tried to upgrade its pitching staff with an established starter, Wade said in a statement, "There is not a club in baseball that has been more active than the Phillies in its pursuit of starting pitching."
In 1997, Schilling passed up the chance to play out his contract and leave the Phillies as a free agent. He opted to stay, signing a contract that will pay him an average of not quite $5.5 million a year for four years.
"I chose to stay with the team that was loyal to me for two years when I was hurt," Schilling said. "Would I like to be making twice as much as I am? Sure, who wouldn't? But I'm being paid an obscene amount of money, even though it's half of what the market value says I'm worth. I'm still making more money than 99.9 percent of the people walking the earth. And I get it for doing something I've been doing since I was 4 years old."

HEADLINE: America's Promise, Found in the Army;
To More Immigrant New Yorkers, A Better Life Begins in Uniform

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
It was only four years ago that Fernando De Souza and his family arrived in New York from Lima, Peru. Mr. De Souza, the eldest of four children, scrambled to learn English at John Bowne High School in Flushing, Queens, kept his grades in the high 80's, and dreamed of studying medicine in college.
But disappointments quickly tumbled in: A guidance counselor questioned whether he could succeed in a pre-med program. And Mr. De Souza's father, a condominium maintenance worker, could hardly afford college tuition in any case. Mr. De Souza never bothered to apply. Instead, he enlisted in the Army. 
 Mr. De Souza, 17, plans to head off to basic training in Oklahoma by summer's end, and after training hopes to join an artillery unit. It was not the lure of being a soldier that changed his mind -- it was the regular paycheck and the Army's promise of $19,000 for college. Mr. De Souza plans to send his first few paychecks -- $800 a month -- back home to help his family with the rent. He hopes to take college courses near the Army base and eventually graduate from the Brooklyn campus of Long Island University.
"I don't like shooting people and stuff like that," Mr. De Souza said. "I thought I had to work for college, pay for my education. I didn't think I was going to be able to take that. That's why I thought the Army was the best decision."
Because many more high school graduates have been heading directly to college or landing jobs in New York City's booming economy in recent years, military recruiters say persuading young men and women to enlist is harder than ever. But for more and more immigrants, even legal residents who are not yet citizens, the military has come to represent a step up the American social ladder, much as it has long been for working-class youths born here.
At the Army station in Flushing, where Mr. De Souza signed up, officials estimate that half the recruits today are immigrants -- youngsters from India and Korea, Jamaica and Guyana. About a third of the recruits from New York City, where 13 percent of the children under 18 were born outside the United States, hold green cards.
Nationwide, the percentage of immigrants in the Army is still small: about 5 percent last year, up from 2 percent a decade ago. But Army officials say they believe that the children of immigrants, too, are enlisting in greater numbers. Since they do not keep statistics on immigrants who are naturalized citizens, that belief is supported not by hard numbers but by anecdotal evidence and by inference based on such signs as the growth in the percentage of Hispanic soldiers. More than 10 percent of the roughly 70,000 recruits in fiscal year 1998, for instance, were Hispanic, up from 4 percent in 1987. The Secretary of the Army, Louis Caldera, is himself the Texas-born son of Mexican immigrants.
At the Flushing station, Hojin Pak, 17, a Korean-American who immigrated at age 4, said he signed up for the Army because his parents could not afford to send him to the State University of New York at Buffalo, where he had been accepted. In the fall, he will be stationed in Virginia and work as a logistics specialist. He said he hoped that his stint would help pay for college and earn him a measure of self-confidence.
Amos Dobrowski, who was born in Poland before the fall of Communism, said he enlisted because he did not want to subject his parents to financial hardship. In exchange for $50,000 for college, Mr. Dobrowski, 17, who once dreamed of going to culinary school, has agreed to a four-year assignment in Fort Hood, Tex., where he will be a tank gunner.
Margaret Rodriguez, a Dominican immigrant at John Bowne High School who wanted to study law at George Washington University, said she signed up because no one else was offering what Sgt. Marc Ross, a recruiter in the Flushing station, did: $50,000 for college.
So Ms. Rodriguez, a strong-willed, serious 17-year-old with a delicate coif of curls, will spend the next four years as an Army chemical operations specialist, testing for toxic chemicals on the battlefield and, she hopes, attending evening classes at a college near her base.
Talking to Sergeant Ross one afternoon earlier this year "opened a whole new world," she said.
It is that glimpse of opportunity, Sergeant Ross said, that explains the Army's appeal to young people -- not only to native New Yorkers like him, but also to the immigrants of Queens. As he trolls for potential recruits, he peppers them with questions: Do you have any major health problems? Are you a high school graduate?
And then he adds: Were you born in this country? If not, do you have a green card?
The sergeant, a jovial, fast-talking man with a close military haircut and a pencil-thin mustache, grew up in Bushwick, Brooklyn, and now lives with his wife and their three sons on the Army base in Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn. When he was the age of his young immigrant recruits, Sergeant Ross, 30, said, his world was actually not all that different from theirs. He was not exactly brimming with patriotic fervor as a teen-ager. All he wanted after high school was a good job and a way to provide for his girlfriend, now his wife. When a recruiter told him that the Army could help him do just that, he signed up.
He said he often wondered how many of his old friends were in jail, or dead. He still sees some of them hanging out on street corners, he said, and his conversations with them usually go like this:
"Why don't you join the Army?" he asks.
"No, man, I don't want to join the Army," they reply. "You got $20?"
Today, even though the Army is smaller than it was a decade ago, finding soldiers has never been harder, recruiters said. In New York City, they said, it has become harder to attract young people with a high school diploma (the Army can take a few with only equivalency degrees) and without a criminal record. Even among high school graduates, finding applicants who can pass the military entrance exam is a formidable challenge, recruiters said.
And then there is the challenge of competing with the lure of a college education. Compared with previous generations, many more high school graduates are going to college. One recent morning Sergeant Ross went recruiting at La Guardia Community College. On campus, Sergeant Ross passed a young man dressed in camouflage pants. "You want the whole suit?" he asked.
"Nah," came the nonchalant reply.
Sergeant Ross pointed to a table where young men were playing cards. "That's what college is all about -- playing," he said, barely hiding his contempt.
Down the hall, he ran into Brandon Baxter, a student he has been trying to recruit for months, and resumed the hard sell.
Deeply ambivalent about joining the Army, Mr. Baxter, 20, is ambitious and thoughtful. He said he wanted to be like the billionaire investor, Warren E. Buffett. "Rich people inspire me," he said. "Maybe 'cause I'm broke."
Sergeant Ross reminded Mr. Baxter that the Army was a $64 billion business, and that jobs in finance were available to candidates like him.
Mr. Baxter told Sergeant Ross that he wanted to move out of his mother's apartment and was thinking about taking the Army test soon. Sergeant Ross pressed him to act before it was too late -- before he ended up with a criminal record. Mr. Baxter insisted that he was not involved in criminal activity. Sergeant Ross simply shrugged and reminded him of Amadou Diallo. "He probably wasn't into anything either," he said.
Sergeant Ross is much like his recruits in focusing on the security of Army life, rather than its rigors. Many of the young men and women who have signed up at the Flushing recruiting station say they give little thought to the dangers they may face in the Army or the violence of combat.
Mr. De Souza, for instance, said that even though his mother cried for him every time she saw television reports about the war in Yugoslavia, he was confident that he would not be in danger. "I'm not scared about that," he said.
Assembled at the recruiting station one afternoon last week, the newest recruits from Flushing reflected on the lives they will be starting soon.
Lnu Geevarghese, 18, an Indian immigrant, said he knew that combat could be part of the bargain. "It's your job to defend," he said. "Obviously, you have to be prepared."
That evening, Mr. Dobrowski said the war in Yugoslavia had prompted him to think long and hard about serving the United States Government. He became an American citizen two years ago. "I'm seeing it as another Holocaust," he said. "It's good they're helping the people."
But he was also a bit cynical about the American military action. "From history," said Mr. Dobrowski, who plans to major in the subject, "I see they get interested where they have an interest."

NATO Faces Decision On Troop Deployment
Even with the Clinton Administration's decision to push for 50,000 NATO troops on Kosovo's border, the alliance will still face a decision within the next few weeks about whether its wants to begin preparations for a larger invasion force. 1
 
NATO aircraft mistakenly bombed a key base that had been seized by Kosovo Liberation Army six weeks ago, allied spokesman said. K.L.A. fighters use the base to funnel supplies and troops deep inside Kosovo, but NATO did not know that the base was under K.L.A. control. 10 
 
Blair Draws Fire on Welfare
Prime Minister Tony Blair has pledged nothing less than an end to what he calls the "something-for-nothing welfare state." His program has drawn fire from both the right and the left Britain. 3
 
Jordan Seeks 'Continuity'
King Abdullah of Jordan visited Washington for the first time since taking the throne after the death in February of King Hussein to stress what he called the "continuity" of his father's foreign policy and to inject a new emphasis on Jordan's need for economic growth. 7
 
Olivetti's Business Gamble
In seizing control of stumbling Telecom Italia, Olivetti, the former typewriter manufacturer that has become a powerful European phone company, has embarked on a risky business gamble that will rearrange the European phone landscape. 13
 
Paris Plagued by Strikes
Paris museums were shut down last week by striking workers, who demanded that the Government hire more people and create at least 1,000 new jobs. Strikes have become a virtually permanent feature of life in the France of the 1990's. 4

Economic Upswing Helping Young Black Men
The nation's job boom is drawing many young, black men -- perhaps the most economically disadvantaged, socially alienated group in America -- back into the economic mainstream. A new study shows that black men aged 16 to 24 with a high school education or less -- many saddled with prison records -- are working in greater numbers, earning bigger paychecks and committing fewer crimes than in the early 1990's. 1
 
Graduation at Columbine
As Columbine High School seniors and their relatives gathered in an open air amphitheater for graduation, four seniors were missing from the 440 faces that appeared smiling only days ago in the pages of the new class yearbook. 16
 
Indians Rebury Remains
Pecos and Jemez Pueblo Indians in Pecos, N.M., reburied the remains of nearly 2,000 of their ancestors, along with sacred artifacts that had also been stored in museums for decades. 16
 
Tests Ordered for 727's
The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered emergency tests on the tubes that carry electrical wires through the fuel tanks on Boeing 727's, after workers found severe wear on the wires and holes in the tubing on two of the jets. 23
 
Seat Belt Effort Planned
With the support of 42 governors, more than 5,000 police agencies will join a highly publicized enforcement blitz to encourage people to wear seat belts during the Memorial Day weekend, as safety experts have concluded that the twice-yearly crackdowns are causing lasting increases in the numbers of people who buckle up. 18

Young Immigrants Find A Place in U.S. Military
Enlisting the young for military service is harder than ever, with many more high school graduates heading directly to college or landing jobs in the booming economy. But for New York City immigrants, the military has come to represent a step up the ladder in America, much as it has long been for working-class youths born here. 29
 
Louima and Police Silence
Four police officers testified against a fellow officer last week in the torture case of Abner Louima, leading some to suggest that the unwritten rule of silence among police is fading. But officers expressed doubts about that conclusion, saying the Louima case was an aberration. 29

Fordham Class Hears Magician and Peacemaker

 BODY:
In 1974, David Copperfield performed a vanishing act three weeks into his freshman year at Fordham University, dropping out to take the lead in a Chicago-based musical, The Magic Man.
Yesterday, at Fordham's 154th commencement, Mr. Copperfield completed the trick, reappearing on campus to deliver an address to the graduating class of 1999. 
 Mr. Copperfield's parents attended the ceremony for 3,654 graduates at the university's Rose Hill campus in the Bronx. After Mr. Copperfield received an honorary doctorate, he said his parents were especially pleased -- they had always wanted him to become a doctor.
George Mitchell, the former United States Senator who helped broker a 1998 peace agreement in Ireland, also received an honorary degree. Mr. Mitchell told the students, "Real fulfillment in your life will come not from leisure, not from idleness, not from self-indulgence, but rather from striving with all your physical and spiritual might for a worthwhile objective."
Graduates applauded Mr. Mitchell, but many seemed more interested in levity than striving. "How 'bout a trick?" they shouted as Mr. Copperfield finished his speech.
 
Marist College
POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y., May 22 -- Fred Rogers, the creator and star of "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" on public television, addressed 1,050 graduates and received an honorary degree at Marist College's 53d commencement today. Also receiving honorary degrees were the Director of the Peace Corps, Mark D. Gearan, and Dr. Anne E. Dyson, a children's advocate.
Though Mr. Rogers, 71, had prepared a 15-minute speech, the sight of an electronic piano on stage inspired a quick change.
"They have a little piano over here," he said to the graduates, who were already clapping with enthusiasm. "Do you want to sing?"
Mr. Rogers smiled and began: "It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood. A beautiful day for a neighbor. Would you be mine? Could you be mine?"
As more students joined in, Mr. Rogers shouted, "Good! Good for you!"
Mr. Rogers, an ordained Presbyterian minister, spoke of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, the high school massacre in Littleton, Colo., and environmental destruction as he counseled graduates to make their choices carefully. And just as he says each day on television, Mr. Rogers assured the graduates that they were special, just by being themselves.
"It's such a good feeling to know you're alive," he finished, to applause that went on and on.
 
Bard College
 Graduates of Bard College in Annandale on Hudson, N.Y., were urged yesterday by Martha C. Nussbaum, a philosopher and scholar, to seek out "experiences of artful pain," as a way to "combat moral blindness and shape citizenship."
By exposing ourselves this way, Dr. Nussbaum, the Ernst Freund Professor of Law and Ethics at the University of Chicago, said, "We uncover our own weakness and acquire new motives to treat others decently."
At the college's 139th commencement, President Leon Botstein conferred 250 bachelor of arts degrees and approximately 50 master of arts, science and fine arts degrees. Honorary doctorates were awarded to Dr. Nussbaum, along with Anthony Alvarado, an educator; Chuck Close, an artist; Ornette Coleman, musician and composer; Ellen V. Futter, president of the American Museum of Natural History; David Landes, an economist, and Harvey Lichtenstein, performing arts executive at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

HEADLINE: City Council To Curtail Planned Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
City Council leaders announced yesterday that the State Legislature's repeal of the commuter tax had forced them to abandon proposals for at least $443 million in tax cuts for city residents, including $173 million worth of cuts proposed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
The leaders said they had withdrawn plans to reduce the commercial rent tax and several other business taxes, as well as proposals to cut taxes paid by first-time home buyers. They also said the Council had rejected Mr. Giuliani's proposals to eliminate the sales tax on books, construction materials and clothing that costs more than $110, which would have saved taxpayers about $113 million a year. 
 Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone said that he and Mr. Giuliani had no choice but to curtail their tax cut plans sharply, because the commuter tax repeal would cost the city $360 million in revenue next year and $400 million in 2001. The Speaker and the Mayor are negotiating a budget agreement, and say they hope to adopt a plan by early next month.
"We had worked for close to six months on coming together on a tax reduction package which would spur the economy," Mr. Vallone said yesterday in a news conference at City Hall, where Council members met to discuss the impact of the commuter tax repeal on Mr. Giuliani's $35.3 billion spending plan. "Now we have to, in 15 days, figure out how to readjust the entire budget."
Aides to Mr. Vallone and Mr. Giuliani said that despite the repeal, they still hoped to eliminate the sales tax on clothing that costs less than $110 and to provide a tax credit worth $48 million for the working poor. Other tax cut proposals that are still under consideration include a property tax reduction for owners of condominiums and co-ops, worth $166 million, and a tax credit for families who pay for child care.
While the Mayor and the Council usually negotiate a budget agreement together, the Council has the power to adopt a budget without the Mayor's consent. But Joseph J. Lhota, the Deputy Mayor for Operations, indicated yesterday that the Giuliani administration would probably not fight the Council's plan to abandon nearly half of Mr. Giuliani's $405 million tax cut package. "Their proposals are not inconsistent with what we are discussing during our negotiations," Mr. Lhota said.
Aides to Mr. Vallone also said yesterday that they hoped to restore the $165 million in cuts in city programs and services that Mr. Giuliani had proposed. But they said such restorations would be more difficult than usual because of the unexpected loss of the commuter tax revenue.
But Mr. Vallone said that with a $2.1 billion city surplus, he and the Mayor would almost certainly not resort to layoffs or further cuts in programs and services. "It's highly unlikely that we are going to do anything that is going to inflict unnecessary damage on the people of New York City," he said.

HEADLINE: Booming Job Market Draws Young Black Men Into Fold

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR with KIRSTEN B. MITCHELL 

 BODY:
For nearly three decades, in good times and in bad, young black men with little education and few skills lost ground. Facing high unemployment, falling pay and persistent discrimination, a depressingly large number never really joined the work force or drifted out of it, getting by on handouts, hustling or crime.
But now the nation's job boom is drawing many of these young men -- perhaps the most economically disadvantaged, socially alienated group in America -- back into the economic mainstream. 
 Low unemployment and tight labor markets have always encouraged upward mobility. The surprise, researchers say, is how dramatic the gains have been.
A new study of low-wage men in 322 metropolitan areas by Richard B. Freeman at Harvard University and William M. Rodgers 3d at the College of William and Mary shows that black men aged 16 to 24 with a high school education or less -- many saddled with prison records -- are working in greater numbers, earning bigger paychecks and committing fewer crimes than in the early 1990's.
"Poor blacks never lost faith in work, education and individual effort," said Jennifer L. Hochschild, a political scientist at Princeton University and author of "Facing Up to the American Dream: Race, Class and the Soul of the Nation." "What's different now is that they can do something about it."
Far too many young black men are still idle or in prison. But the surge in legitimate employment has gone hand in hand with a drop in criminal activity, which has long clouded the job prospects of young black men. Indeed, crime has fallen rapidly in regions where joblessness has fallen most.
In the 14 areas where unemployment has been below 4 percent in every year since 1992 -- places like the Raleigh-Durham area in North Carolina; Rochester, Minn., and Des Moines -- the percentage of young, less-educated black men who are working has jumped from 52 percent, to 64 percent. The figures exclude young men who are still in school and the 7 percent of those between the ages of 20 and 24 who are in prison. But the improvement does not simply reflect the fact that many of those with the worst job prospects are now behind bars.
"We used the variation across cities to see what might happen at a national level if we were able to get national unemployment below 4 percent for a long time," said Professor Rodgers, who pointed out that by 1998, 146 of the nation's 322 metropolitan areas had unemployment rates below 4 percent. In 1992, only 19 areas had jobless rates that low. "It allows us to see what kind of employment and wage gains these men might experience."
In 15 other metropolitan areas where unemployment fell by five percentage points or more -- places like Pittsfield, Mass., Flint, Mich., and Naples, Fla. -- the corresponding improvement was from 42 percent, to 51 percent. Uniformly, the gains for young black men outstripped the much more modest gains for all young men, including whites, and for black men in their prime working years.
Brian Burnett, 19, is typical of many young blacks who have benefited from the extended period of low unemployment in fast-growing parts of the United States. He graduated from an inner-city high school in Raleigh, N.C., in June 1997, when the local unemployment rate was 2.2 percent. After working at a series of temporary jobs for about a year and completing a federally financed job readiness program, he landed a $7- an-hour, full-time position as a front-desk clerk at an Embassy Suites hotel.
Now Mr. Burnett is planning to study hotel management part time with tuition help from his employer. "The sky's the limit," he said. "No one can hold me back but me."
Professor Freeman, one of the nation's top experts on black youth unemployment, said: "This shows how critical it is not to give up on these guys. If you give these kids a break, they come back."
The gains are coming at a time when affirmative action, preferential contracting for minorities and most job training programs are no longer expanding.
"The market is more powerful than any Government program," Professor Freeman said. "The question is: 'Can we keep it up?' "
In the sharply segregated 1950's -- hardly the best of times for young blacks -- there were more opportunities at the bottom of the economic ladder. Young blacks and young whites were equally likely to hold jobs, although young blacks' hourly pay was roughly one-third lower than that of whites. By the late 1960's, the earnings gap between young blacks and whites had narrowed to less than 10 percentage points, but the fraction of black youths with jobs had fallen sharply. At that point, the collapse in work among young black men in inner cities accelerated, the pay gap widened again, and neither the civil rights movement nor major Federal job training programs did much to reverse the devastation. The pay gap peaked in the early 1990's at more than 20 percentage points.
In the early 1990's, businesses drifted even farther away from cities, the computer revolution increased skill requirements, growing numbers of woman and immigrants competed for entry-level jobs, and the ranks of young black prison inmates continued to swell. To many people, the outlook for a turnaround in the job prospects of young black men seemed remote.
"They have so many strikes against them," said Hazel Logan, a grandmother of five who runs a jobs program in Raleigh. "Whatever the totem pole is, they are at the bottom."
Today, one of the most visible signs of change is on one basketball court at the Durham Y.M.C.A. Around 400 black men between ages 19 and 25 from the inner cities of Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill used to take part in a midnight basketball league where networking and interviewing tips were as much on the agenda as foul shots. Now, says James A. Johnson, director of the Urban Investment Strategies Center at the University of North Carolina, "We've had difficulty getting enough people to play because they are in the job market."
Michael Tavernise, manager of the Employment Security Commission office in Raleigh, said, "Employers are hiring people that two, three, five years ago they weren't hiring." The overall unemployment rate in the Raleigh-Durham region recently dipped to 1.5 percent.
As businesses struggle to fill jobs, other groups of poorly educated workers are reaping even bigger gains. Half of all single mothers, including many young black women, are working now compared with fewer than one-third at the start of the decade, according to David Ellwood, an economist at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and a former adviser to President Clinton on welfare issues. He attributes the surge in work to new policies such as limits on welfare and pay subsidies for working parents as well as the vibrant job market. "It's unprecedented," he said. "Nothing like it has ever happened."
Few expect a revival of the naive optimism of the early 1960's, when some liberal policy makers predicted that just a few more years of strong economic growth would erase the problems of young black men. Those problems are still daunting. Although unemployment among young black men of all education levels is lower now than at the peak of the 1980's expansion -- 17 percent compared with 20 percent -- it is more than twice that for young white men.
And even though more young black men are staying in school longer and entering the work force later -- just like their white counterparts -- some 19 percent of all black men between ages 16 and 24 are not in school or working. That is a smaller proportion than in 1992, but still slightly higher than at the peak of the last expansion and twice the comparable figures for young white men.
"I see people I went to school with and I see them talking outside, hanging around, not doing anything," said Mr. Burnett, the hotel clerk.
Charles Murray, the conservative social analyst at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Losing Ground: American Social Policy, 1950-1980" and, with Richard J. Herrnstein, "The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life," views the persistence of idleness during boom times as a sign that "the underclass is as big as it's ever been and may still be growing."
But these days few experts are as pessimistic as Mr. Murray.
One reason for cautious optimism is that overall unemployment has fallen further and stayed down longer than in the 1980's. The longer the labor markets stay tight, the more time the young have to acquire contacts, work experience and marketable skills with which to weather the next downturn. "The current job market is giving young men an opportunity to build up some confidence," Professor Rodgers said.
Another reason to expect some of the gains to last is that entry-level work has become more rewarding financially. Before the 1990's, pay for less educated men had been declining in real terms for more than two decades.
At the peak of the 1980's economic expansion, according to a now-classic survey conducted by Professor Freeman and Lawrence Katz, also at Harvard, more than half of young black men in hot job markets like Boston judged their prospects in the underground economy superior to any legitimate employment. Since 1992, by contrast, the hourly pay of young, less educated black men has climbed as much as 15 percent in the metropolitan areas with the tightest labor markets.
"There are still big racial differences in employment outcomes, but the improvements are encouraging because they show that these young men aren't totally isolated from the world of work," Ronald Ferguson, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government, said. "When the economy is hot enough, employers hire these folks."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Clemens Returns According To Form

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 22

 BODY:
Roger Clemens had waited 25 agonizing days for this day to arrive. While Clemens was on the disabled list, George Steinbrenner ignored Don Zimmer, Zimmer made incorrect predictions about Joe Torre's return as manager, Torre surprised everyone when he rejoined the team last Tuesday, and the Red Sox jumped over the Yankees into first place. Through it all, Clemens was merely an anxious spectator.
But that changed dramatically today as Clemens returned and helped the Yankees subdue the White Sox, 10-2, at Comiskey Park in Game 1 of a doubleheader. The Yankees almost forgot how he looked in his uniform, but Clemens returned and secured his 18th straight winning decision, establishing an American League record. And he reminded everyone why he was obtained and why he was able to give this plodding team a temporary boost. 
 Clemens's record was somewhat anticlimactic because he has had 10 no-decisions during the streak, including two this year in games in which the Yankees rescued him from defeat. But Clemens, a five-time Cy Young award winner, spoke glowingly about the mark after stifling Chicago on one earned run and six hits in six sharp innings. For Clemens, it was memorable to have 24 teammates congratulate him. For the Yankees, it was important that their ace was there to be congratulated.
"To pitch and to be undefeated for that long, that's pretty special," Clemens said. "Obviously, the guys helped me out in a couple of games I pitched. I'm sure if you look back there's some games I could have won and attained the streak just as easily earlier. I hope it continues. That means I'm doing the right things to help the team win." Clemens was not the most impressive pitcher at Comiskey today, however. That was Mike Sirotka, who limited the Yankees to two hits in eight innings in guiding the White Sox to a 2-1 victory in Game 2. Andy Pettitte, who defeated Sirotka, 2-1, last Sunday, was superb for seven innings, but Sirotka was better and exacted revenge.
The exciting game ended in controversy. After the Yankees parlayed three walks and a balk into their first run, Bill Simas replaced Bob Howry. With the bases loaded and two outs, Simas struck out the pinch-hitter Chili Davis on a 3-2 fastball that looked as if it was outside, enabling the White Sox to grab a split of the doubleheader. The Yankees, whose modest two-game winning streak fizzled, were upset with Umpire Tim Welke's call.
"That ball was not a strike," said Davis, who spiced his remarks with profanities. "Strike 2 was not a strike. Ain't no way I could hit that ball, strike 2 or strike 3. You don't dictate when the game ends. You play until the game is over."
Even Torre, who was pleased that Clemens and Pettitte combined to allow three earned runs in 13 innings, said, "It was a foot outside."
Buoyed by Jorge Posada's home run and five runs batted in and two-run homers from Tino Martinez and Bernie Williams in the opener, Clemens improved to 3-0 and now can pursue the major league record of 24 straight winning decisions by Carl Hubbell of the New York Giants (1936-37).
As excited as Torre was to see an offense that had mustered 14 runs in the last eight games explode for 10, the most critical aspect of the day was Clemens's 89-pitch effort.
Four days after the Yankees got their manager back, they got their ace back and his winning streak continued, shoving Cleveland's Johnny Allen and Baltimore's Dave McNally to the second line of the A.L. record book.
"You have to have a Hall of Fame-caliber guy," Torre said in describing the streak. "The whole thing about pitching is anyone can light it up for one or two starts. To do it over the course of a year, you have to be a superstar."
Fifteen years and two days after Clemens won his first game, he won his 236th to tie Whitey Ford, who is perhaps the best pitcher in Yankees history, for 49th on the career list. Clemens last lost on May 29, 1998, to Cleveland, and he will hurdle Ford soon.
"At this stage in my career, when I approach these guys, these great ones, the Hall of Famers, it's pretty mind-boggling," Clemens said. "You're happy about it. What can I say? Whitey Ford. What a great name. It's awesome."
One of Clemens's stickiest moments occurred when Mike Caruso tried to drag a bunt past him in the third. Clemens tumbled to his knees to field it and then threw to first for the out, but the Yankees worried about the left hamstring, which had been injured. But Clemens felt a cramp in his right hamstring and was relieved when it went away.
Clemens performed like the superstar that Torre says he is when Frank Thomas batted with men on first and second in the fifth. The Yankees were ahead, 6-2, but Thomas had three homers in 43 at-bats off Clemens. When Thomas grounded into a double play to make Chicago 0 for 6 with runners in scoring position, Clemens pumped his fist. The Yankees, who were 9-12 without Clemens, exhaled.
So 51 weeks after his last loss, Clemens is still unblemished. Does he even remember what it is like to lose?
"I don't want to talk about it," Clemens said. "I just hope this continues."
 
INSIDE PITCH
Because ROGER CLEMENS pitched economically, he is a strong candidate to start on three days' rest against the Red Sox on Wednesday. The sexy meeting that did not occur this week in Boston could occur at Yankee Stadium. Clemens, ANDY PETTITTE or RAMIRO MENDOZA will start. . . . JORGE POSADA's five runs batted in were half of what he had accumulated in his first 88 at-bats. . . . After JOE TORRE admitted that the Yankees were operating with 24 players because MIKE FIGGA had not played this season, he inserted Figga to catch in both games. . . . DEREK JETER extended his streak for reaching base to 41 games, the second-longest streak by a Yankee since 1961. PAUL O'NEILL reached in 42 straight in 1996. But Jeter's 16-game hitting streak ended in the second game when he was 0 for 2.

Another Drop in Crime

 BODY:
For the seventh consecutive year, crime in the United States fell sharply in 1998, according to preliminary data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Violent crimes and property crimes each fell 7 percent, declines criminologists attributed to several factors, including an expanding economy, a larger prison population and a lower demand for crack cocaine.

HEADLINE: A World of Ice Cream Waiting to Be Explored

BYLINE: By PATRICIA BROOKS

 BODY:
ICE CREAM and summer go together like Mark McGwire and home runs, canoes and rivers, hamburgers and cookouts. Hard is the heart -- or strong the will power -- that can spot an ice cream place along the road and not slam on the brakes.
There is something especially summery about a no-frills roadside stand. Perhaps it is nostalgia for a simpler time, but it seems to add to the pleasure of the season to sit on a bench in the open air, nibbling at a sugar or waffle cone, licking fast to keep the melting ice cream from dribbling all over one's clothes. 
 Connecticut is blessed with its share of old-fashioned, independently owned ice cream shops (parlor is really too fancy a word for most of them). While vanilla is always popular, most shops offer unusual flavors, the better to tempt drivers to hit the brakes. Cones usually start at $1.50 or $2 and go on up with additional dips, and some places show the price including sales tax (which accounts for odd numbers in prices).
Following are a few favorite shops (listed alphabetically) among an estimated 70 statewide.
Although the original ASHLEY'S in New Haven is closed, there are three others: Hamden's is the largest, Branford's next, Guilford's the smallest. At all three, one will find 28 flavors daily (and 6 flavors of yogurt) from a list of more than 100. Mango (made from fresh mangoes) is the latest of many fresh fruit flavors popular in summer. Cones are $1.50 to $3.
DR. MIKE'S has been a Bethel institution since 1975. While there are 45 flavors in the repertory, 8 are available daily, including the very popular chocolate lace and cream. A second Dr. Mike's can be found in Monroe. Cone prices run from $1.96 for a single dip to $3.13.
After a day at the beach, a stop at the HALLMARK DRIVE-IN in Old Lyme is almost a given for a cone packed with ginger ice cream (a personal favorite), Toll House cookie or hockey fight (cherry vanilla with white chocolate chunks). These are among 22 choices available any given day as well as 2 or 3 weekly specials (all made on the premises), with cones priced from $1.85 to $2.20. The plain old-fashioned stand has been at the spot since the 1940's and recently expanded with grinders, quahogs and lobster rolls. There are eight tables with umbrellas in the rear, facing the sea marshes, a restful place to enjoy a refreshing cone.
THE ICE CREAM SHOPPE, its bright blue exterior making it very visible, has been a staple in Shelton for 29 years, originally as a Carvel stand. Soft ice cream is still on the menu, but the premises-made ice cream is now the big hit, especially chocolate chip mint, one of 31 flavors available in generously filled cones at $1.45 to $2.40.
The sign for MR. SHANE'S HOMEMADE ICE CREAM in Ridgefield is not much smaller than the premises of the tiny shop, in the rear of a Main Street building. Minuscule as it is, Mr. Shane's is worth the hunt for its rich chocolate ice cream. From a list of 60 flavors (all made on the premises), 16 are available at any given time. After vanilla, the most popular flavor is mud (coffee ice cream, Oreo cookies, fudge swirl and almonds), followed by chocolate malt and toasted coconut. Cones are $1.75 for a child's portion (more like a large single scoop), $2.50 for a single dip (really a pile-on of several dips) and $3.25 for the largest (so huge that a cone can't really contain it). Mr. Shane's also sells ice cream to Hay Day and other retail outlets.
Visitor or resident can tell summer is here by the lines on weekends at STOSH'S in the red depot, a landmark in Kent. Sit outside at a white table under a green umbrella and enjoy a turtle (vanilla ice cream, chocolate chips, pecans and caramel swirl) or chocolate-dipped apricot (apricot puree with fudge swirl) cones. There are 14 other flavors to choose from as well (from a list of 130, all made on the premises).
The up-market ice cream parlor has waffle cones dipped in imported French chocolate. Stosh's serves sundaes like Total Eclipse (a brownie with two scoops of chocolate ice cream, hot fudge and chocolate sprinkles) and Dippodopolus (16 scoops of ice cream, banana halves, rivers of toppings, nuts and whipped cream -- a feast for a group, at $18.95). Cones are $2.26 for one scoop, $3.21 for two. Stosh's also serves dazzle dogs (quarter-pound all-beef, skinless frankfurters on hand-rolled buns).
Finally, there is the INSIDE SCOOP in Trumbull, which sells its 48 flavors of ice cream by weight. At 50 cents an ounce, cones generally run from $1.80 to $3. The sparkling fresh looking one-year-old shop makes ice cream and sorbets on the premises. Among the most popular flavors, which one can eat at tables in the shop, are peanut butter swirl, banana Oreo, chocolate raspberry truffle and gianduia (Italian hazelnut chocolate).

HEADLINE: Taking a Dip, or Two, by the Shore

BYLINE: By JOSEPH D'AGNESE

 BODY:
AT the first hint of summer, the madness starts.
Seven days a week, the brothers Goff -- Bill and John -- will take turns on the early shift. By 5 A.M., one of them will start the gleaming stainless steel machine in the back room of their shop, Cone Zone, on Route 33 in Neptune. Five hours later, 100 gallons of ice cream will be chilling in the store's freezers, ready for customers craving a cool lick on a hot day. 
 At the days heat up, so does the ice cream business on the Jersey Shore.
The Goffs' business is typical of most homemade operations. A couple of freezers, a soft-serve machine, a row of toppings and a gaggle of teen-age employees occupy their roadside glass-front take-out place. The Goffs sell 26 flavors of hard ice cream, mountainous banana splits (one is called the pig sty), even ice cream sandwiches made with dog bones for customers' pooches.
"The challenge in the summer is just to keep people moving," said John Goff, a lanky man sporting a T-shirt reading Property of the Cone Zone. He added, "People like that it's a locally produced product."
In truth, though, the term "homemade" is relative. Most shore spots do not concoct their product in a quaint, hand-cranked wooden bucket. For a busy parlor, that scenario is unworkable. Instead, businesses buy a liquid base of cream, milk and sugar from distributors, then add it to their machines with flavoring, fruits and nuts.
The magic lies in coming up with flavors that sell reliably to a variety of customers. "Adults like butter pecan," John Goff said. "But kids like chocolate chip cookie dough. Seniors like old-fashioned flavors, but they stay away from the nuts."
At Seaview Sweets, another homemade operation on the Point Pleasant Beach boardwalk, Bruce Brand, the manager, said the "wacko flavors" he used to sell in his Montclair store just don't fly at the beach. "People on the boardwalk look for the basics," Mr. Brand said, "so we don't get too crazy or we're left with a lot that doesn't sell."
And make no mistake, taste sells. Hoffman's, a storied concession with locations in Point Pleasant Beach and Spring Lake Heights, has a spartan decor. But at the height of summer, every inch is crammed with eager customers. Behind a glass window, customers can see the shining tanks of ice cream mix that will be made into 40 flavors, including caramel nut cluster, chunky chimp and strawberry bonbon. The result is a dense, rich, creamy product, a bellwether on the shore.
Some ice cream outfits on the shore let others take the limelight. Arctic Ice Cream Company, based in Trenton, makes and distributes 6,000 gallons of ice cream each summer week to ice cream parlors, restaurants and convenience and grocery stores on the shore.
"We're a small company," said Tom Green, who bought the operation from his father-in-law in 1964. "And you have to have a niche. New Jersey is our niche."
Arctic sells "premium" ice cream -- not quite Haagen-Dazs, but light years beyond of the stuff found in supermarket freezers. A half gallon, sporting the distinctive penguin-and-cone logo, costs about $4.50, or $3.99 at the company's factory outlet on Arctic Parkway in Trenton.
One parlor that serves Arctic ice cream is Hurricane House in Barnegat. In this 1918 haunt, customers do not come merely for a Hurricane burger and a quick sundae; they linger to soak up the atmosphere. Ocean County's oldest ice cream parlor, it's the stuff of soda fountain dreams: high-backed booths, player piano, marble counters with wooden stools, ceiling fans, seltzer bottles and vintage magazine covers and ads framed on the walls. A true seaside gem.
If a business can't muster authentic atmosphere, zaniness will keep them coming in. At Showplace Ice Cream Parlour in Beach Haven, the attraction is the nightly show featuring singing waiters who exhort customers to perform offbeat dances and stunts in return for a signature dish. Want a Peter Pan sundae? Well, you'll just have to fly. Ask for the flavors, and the troupe belts them out to the tune of Handel's "Hallelujah Chorus."
Each night, the revue-style parlor performs about five shows, packing in 150 customers at each 60-minute seating.
At the low-key Crazees in Rumson, the attractions are the flavors of Princeton-based Thomas Sweets and the faint possibility that Bruce Springsteen will drop in for a cone.
But perhaps the sweetest shore tale is that of Dorcas Cotsworth, who at age 81 operates Dorcas of Bay Head, an elegant restaurant and soda fountain housed in a rambling white Victorian house. Once married to a steel magnate, Mrs. Cotsworth was forced to take over the Berry Steel Company in Edison when her husband died, leaving her with four small children.
But steel left her cold, as did playing bridge with her Short Hills neighbors. So, one summer day in 1964, while her company's boat was docked in Bay Head, she slipped away to the rooming house and restaurant she had eyed for years. "Please," Mrs. Cotsworth recalled pleading with the owners, "won't you sell me this place?"
The owners, a local police officer and his wife, had turned her down twice before. But that day, they said yes. Mrs. Cotsworth returned to the boat to share the news with her reveling cronies. "They'd been drinking all day," Mrs. Cotsworth recalled, "and they looked at me and said, 'What do you know about running a restaurant?' Nobody seemed to think it was odd that I was running a steel company."
Her life changed in one fell scoop. Thirty-five years later, the restaurant serves breakfast and lunch in season to the summer-share set, who sit under the green-and-white awnings ordering eggs benedict, sandwiches and Hershey's ice cream. Inside, there are dangling parasols, frilly curtains and paintings of the 1880's house created by visiting artists.
"This place has been like a dream for me," Mrs. Cotsworth said. "It keeps me alive. It's all happiness, not like bars where people maybe have too much to drink. We sell milk shakes and ice cream soda just like in olden days."

HEADLINE: Reaching the Beach on the Parkway Can Take a Toll

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

DATELINE: WOODBRIDGE

 BODY:
FRIDAY afternoon, warm. The sea air beckons. The suitcases are in the trunk. Lighthearted, you race out of work, jump in the car and head down the parkway for a weekend at the shore. Five minutes later, you're stuck in traffic. 
 Why?
Well, all those other people left early too.
"It used to be a smaller peak period," said Roy W. Little, project development manager for the New Jersey Highway Authority, which operates the Garden State Parkway, "but the amount of traffic growth we've had has spread peak periods out and made it more difficult to find a time to get down to the shore without any congestion."
Mr. Little, who is also the chairman of the New Jersey Recreational Travel Committee, a group of 27 agencies that seeks solutions for transportation and tourist travel needs, said people living in the northern counties, like Bergen, were leaving earlier and earlier on Fridays.
"Anytime after noontime, traffic is starting to build," he said, "and anytime after 2 you could run into congestion. Not only do you have everybody who is going to the shore trying to get a jump on the weekend but you even have the commuters trying to get a jump on the weekend."
In 1998, travelers made 18.4 million trips to the Jersey Shore, 4.5 million of them overnight stays, according to Laura Otterbourg, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Commerce and Economic Growth Commission. The shore region, including Greater Atlantic City, accounted for $14.3 billion of the $26.1 billion that tourism generated.
The 173-mile-long Garden State Parkway, begun in 1952 and completed in 1957, is the main north-south route to 127 miles of sandy beaches. Traffic volume just keeps going up. In 1989, there were 337.5 million car trips on the parkway, according to Jude T. Depko, principal traffic engineer for the New Jersey Highway Authority. By 1998, volume had increased 15.6 percent, to 390.2 million trips annually.
The Raritan toll plaza is as good a place as any to take the parkway's pulse. On an average day, 105,000 cars make trips through the plaza each way, Mr. Depko said. In February, the number drops to 93,000, but in August it goes up to 130,000. The difference is far greater at Great Egg toll plaza near Cape May, where 242,015 cars passed through last February, and 634,124 in August.
"The parkway is one of the heaviest trafficked commuter roadways in the world," handling over a million vehicles a day, Denis F. Ingoglia, the parkway spokesman, said.
That volume causes congestion, but it is not the only factor.
Most obviously, there are the toll plazas, 11 of them. No matter how many lanes officials add at the plazas or how speedily they manage to pass the cars through, the barriers still act as, well, barriers. There are 91 interchanges -- entrance-and-exit complexes -- 19 of which require a toll. However, 20 percent of those who use the road enter and exit without ever having to pay a toll, 30 percent pay one toll and 25 percent pay two. (The average trip length is 15 miles.)
Other bottlenecks: the Driscoll Bridge, over the Raritan River, has no shoulders, which means that whenever someone has car trouble, an active lane of the road gets clogged up. Add people afraid of heights who stop in midspan (150 feet above the water) and even an occasional horse like the one Mr. Ingoglia says stopped traffic one day when it escaped from a horse trailer involved in an accident.
Hot summer days mean more vehicle breakdowns, not to mention accidents caused by drowsy, drunken or distracted drivers. From June through September 1998, 21,055 incidents required trooper help or road service, Michael J. Cerisano, traffic analyst for Troop E of the New Jersey State Police, said.
When the traffic stops, most motorists just cope.
Mr. Ingoglia said, "You see people get out of their cars, take their lawn chairs, go up on the grassy berm, sit out there, put their suntan oil on and just veg out, because they know they're not going anywhere for a while."
Perhaps the largest traffic jam ever occurred on April 4, 1995, when a fast-moving brush fire in the Pine Barrens burned on both sides of the parkway near the Barnegat toll plaza.
"We closed the road down and had about a nine-mile back-up from about milepost 74 to milepost 83," said Mr. Ingoglia. "It took at least two hours for traffic to start moving."
A northeaster flooded and closed the Parkway in the Cheesequake flats near some marinas in 1994. Said Mr. Depko, "We ended up with a couple sailboats on the parkway."
The classic traffic jams on the northern end of the parkway begin almost immediately after the Bergen toll plaza and continue through Essex County.
"It is a commercial hot spot," said Mr. Ingoglia. "And because of the lack of right of way and the unique urban environment, it has been difficult to effect any real expansion, so you've got traffic there all the time."
Cars getting onto Route 280 from the southbound parkway add to the slowdown. There are three lanes in each direction at that point but below Route 280 it goes to four lanes. About 13,000 cars a day get off the southbound parkway on Route 280 and 35,000 get on the parkway from Route 280, Mr. Depko said.
The parkway leading to the Driscoll Bridge at the Raritan toll plaza also backs up, but across the bridge, the situation changes dramatically because of the dual local-and-express system between Sayreville and the Asbury Park toll plaza 22 miles to the south. The road ranges from five to seven lanes in each direction.
At this point, near Sandy Hook, cars begin to exit the parkway for shore points, thinning traffic out somewhat.
Once below Asbury Park, the road narrows again from five to four lanes, drops to three lanes at Manasquan-Point Pleasant and then to two lanes above Toms River.
The authority is adding three more toll lanes to the Barnegat plaza and using more reversible lanes, Mr. Depko said. The new configuration should be in full operation to handle the Memorial Day weekend crowd.
Traffic also slows along a stretch in Cape May County that has three traffic lights, the only ones on the parkway.
The authorities are working on ways to ease congestion on the parkway. Tokens have helped to move traffic at toll plazas, especially at rush hour when 50 percent of drivers use them, Mr. Ingoglia said. The E-Z Pass electronic toll-collection system should also help. It is to be installed incrementally on the parkway from north to south, possibly starting as early as next November and concluding in January 2000, said Edward Gross, executive director of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, the agency assigned to oversee E-Z Pass. The turnpike plans to have the program in place in March 2000.
Traffic engineers using computer models estimated that if only 25 percent of drivers use E-Z pass at a parkway toll plaza that now has 10 minute-backups during rush hour, the wait would be eliminated. "And that's going to have a dramatic effect as well even for those who remain on the token and cash system," Mr. Gross said.
To keep things moving during shore season, the parkway bans contractors from working on the road from noon Friday to noon Monday. For short-term relief, it also uses electronic signs to advise motorists of traffic conditions at points of congestion like Gateway National Recreation area and Island State Park as well as approaches to the bridges to Staten Island, which can be bottlenecks on Sunday nights.
For longer-term solutions, it contracts for aerial photographs of the parkway as part of a study of traffic patterns.
For those driving to the shore, backups are less likely to occur on parkway exits than on roads leading from the highway to the shore, officials say. Such hot spots include Route 36 to Sandy Hook, Route 34 from interchange 98 to Manasquan-Point Pleasant, Route 37 from exit 82 at Seaside Heights, and Route 72 off exit 63 to Long Beach Island.
Improvements on such roads, as well as a major rehabilitation of the Driscoll Bridge and two nearby bridges sometimes used to get around it, are also expected to ease traffic flow when the three bridge projects are finished around 2004.
Richard M. Halczli, principal structural engineer for the parkway, said the authority will build a new span west of the current Driscoll Bridge and repair the current north and southbound sections. Once finished, all three spans constituting the bridge will have shoulders, wider lanes, and a total increase of lanes from 12 to 15.
The department is also going to build a new bridge between the four-lane Edison Bridge, which is 60 years old, and the Driscoll Bridge. And another alternative to the Driscoll, the two-lane Victory Bridge on Route 35, will be replaced by a higher bridge with two 12-foot lanes in each direction.
It may be that no roadway will ever be built that can handle maximum traffic volume all the time, Angus Kress Gillespie, associate professor of American studies at Rutgers University in New Brunswick and co-author of the book "Looking for America on the New Jersey Turnpike," said. Too wide, too expensive.
Citing an American Automobile Association travel guide from the 1920's, he said that getting to the shore was much more of "a production" in those days. "It's not hard to see how there was pressure in the 40's and 50's for a highway that would bypass the congestion of going from village to village all the way down to the shore," he said.
So, for the best possible trip, travel at off-times and try to keep things in perspective. If you do get stuck in a huge traffic jam, settle on the parkway's grass berm in your lawn chair and do a little reading, maybe a 1920's road guide to show how good you have it now.
 
The Bottleneck Bypass Is No Cure, But You May Feel Better
Traffic is backed up for three miles. Civil war is about to break out between back-seat passengers. And the engine is starting to overheat.
Isn't there an easier way to get to the shore?
The answer is maybe, though the relief may be more psychological than practical.
John P. Wallace, a lawyer who has a summer house in Surf City, tries to leave his office in Ridgewood early on Friday but usually doesn't get out until 5 P.M., the height of the rush hour.
To avoid parkway traffic, he takes a circuitous route down the New Jersey Turnpike to exit 8 in Hightstown, where he picks up 539 south to heavily traveled Route 72 east to Long Beach Island. His children kid him that the journey takes longer -- in miles and minutes -- than if he had just stayed on the parkway.
But Mr. Wallace retorts: "It's more interesting. I see people. I can stop and buy some vegetables and fruit. Besides, I get bored with the parkway."
Helene Grynberg, administrator of the American Studies Department at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, who has a cabin cruiser moored in Forked River, avoids rush-hour traffic by traveling later on Friday and also taking an alternate route. She leaves her Old Bridge home between 8 and 9 P.M. and takes Route 18 to Route 9 to a linkup with the Garden State Parkway in Toms River.
"It's perfect for people going to the shore below Toms River," she said.
Roy W. Little, project development manager for the New Jersey Highway Authority, which operates the Garden State Parkway, is skeptical about the value of alternative routes.
A traveler taking the New Jersey Turnpike or Route 287 to Woodbridge to pick up the parkway can run into heavy congestion. Route 9 is heavily traveled before and after the Edison Bridge, and Route 35 meanders through shore towns.
"You hear of people trying to take an all-back-road route," Mr. Little said. "I've tried it myself and I think, when all the dust settles, you're getting there about the same time you would on the main road." GEORGE JAMES

HEADLINE: Strawberries Are Not Forever. The Time to Enjoy Is Now.

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT 

 BODY:
BONA fide strawberry lovers manage to keep their appetites for lush, sweet berries in check until June, when the local crop begins to perfume the fields and farm stands. Then, like the corn connoisseurs who insist on sticking to the season to risk a lapse of no more than eight hours from picking to plate, they are annually rewarded with an incomparable treat.
To most Americans, the notion that strawberries are seasonal would come as a surprise. The berries sold in those little green plastic baskets in produce markets all year have become as ubiquitous as potatoes. With their cottony taste they often seem more like potatoes, too. They might measure up cosmetically, with big, scarlet, glossy good looks. But the come-on is wasted. Without flavor and aroma they are easy to resist. 
 Then the ripe, juicy Long Island berries arrive. In the old days, their fleeting one-month season from late May to the end of June was a time for celebration. The annual strawberry festivals at churches and community halls all over the Island put the spotlight on strawberries. Bowls of berries fresh from the field were lavished with whipped cream and freshly churned ice cream. Dessert plates were piled with a rich indulgence of shortcakes and pies. Jars of homemade preserves were stacked for sale.
A few of these festivals survive, especially on the East End. But even without a party, today's strawberries are worth cheering and enjoying pretty much as they were 50 or 100 years ago. Bring on the cream.
The big change is not the way strawberries are eaten but in the way they are grown, and especially how they are harvested.
A decade or so ago on the Island, "pick-your-own" was hailed as the strawberry's savior. In the mid-1980's, when the Cauliflower Association, a farmers' group, discontinued the annual commercial strawberry auction, the demand for the berries by wholesalers, who would distribute them locally and in Manhattan, plummeted.
"It caused a major decline and the only way the farmers could continue to grow the berries and still make money was pick your own," said William Sanok, of the Cornell Cooperative Extension in Riverhead. "They're very labor-intensive to harvest, and finding enough workers to do the picking became a problem."
Attracted by the prospect of fresh strawberries for $1.50 a quart, vacationers, day-trippers to the North Fork and the Hamptons, people interested in saving a little money on a few quarts of berries, and other intrepid souls who did not mind stooping, crouching and coming away with stained fingertips, took to the fields.
At the peak of pick-your-own, there were more than 30 farms, including one in Nassau County and a few in Western Suffolk, in addition to those in the Riverhead area and on the North and South Forks, that opened their fields to pickers.
This season there will be fewer than 20 pick-your-own farms, about the same number as last year. The acreage planted in strawberries has shrunk to about 250, from several thousand a few decades ago.
And as with a good deal of the rest of agriculture on the Island, the future remains shaky. The prospect of planting homes instead of fruit and vegetable crops on the land that has not been deeded for farming, or nursery stock on land that has, becomes increasingly tempting for farmers.
Besides, with the thriving economy of the past few years, the notion of saving a few dollars by picking your own strawberries has lost its allure. "People still want strawberries and they're happy to buy them, but they can't be bothered to do their own picking," Mr. Sanok said. Fat wallets can easily handle the difference in price, while the less resilieant knees and hips of many of the aging baby boomers are not up to the physical stress of picking.
"I recently gave a talk to an elementary school class in Suffolk County," Mr. Sanok said. "When I asked how many of them had ever picked strawberries only four raised their hands. But almost all of them have picked pumpkins." Around Halloween going out to select the jack-o'-lantern from the field is fun. Picking strawberries, a task that requires an adult to pitch in, is not. It's work.
At the same time, appreciation for locally grown seasonal berries is growing. Consumers who do not drive out to farm stands can find the Island's strawberries at farmer's markets on the Island and greenmarkets in New York City. A few highly selective produce markets also carry them. Chefs, many of whom support local agriculture, demand them.
"There are more farmer's markets than ever in Westchester and up the Hudson Valley," said Bob Lewis, the chief marketing representative for the State Department of Agriculture and Markets. "It's important for the farms, and it has helped to increase the number of small farms."
Now, with the declining interest in pick-your-own, the industry is changing again. Farmers are experimenting to try to get a jump on the season to be able to deliver ripe berries by early to mid-May instead of around Memorial Day or later. "To get into the premium commercial market we have to extend the season," Mr. Sanok said.
Following the example set by New Jersey farms, strawberry plants are being set into the ground in July instead of in the fall so the fruit will begin to set earlier in the season.
The plants, which are viable for about two seasons at most before weeds take over and the plants become difficult to maintain, go through two flowerings. The flowers are removed the first time so no berries will set. But with the midsummer planting, a second flowering will occur at least 10 days earlier in the spring than with traditional cultivation, allowing for an earlier harvest.
More intensive planting will increase the crop. And the season will continue to run into June. It ends when summer's heat kicks in. Farmers say that three successive days of 90-degree weather is enough to put an end to it.
Another new kind of strawberry, called the Day-Neutral because it requires fewer hours of sunshine and continues to bear fruit throughout the summer, is grown in New York's Hudson Valley but not on a commercial basis on the Island because of the problem of finding labor to do the picking.
Strawberries, more or less as we know them, are a result of cross-breeding a large, juicy variety known as frago chiloensis, which came mostly from cool-temperature coastal areas of Chile, and fraga virginiana, a native American wild strawberry.
An 18th century French naval engineer and amateur botanist, Andre Francois Frezier, is credited with having been the first to bring the Chilean berries to Europe. They were planted in a garden in Brittany, where they hybridized naturally with the Virginia variety planted nearby. The result was a strawberry that looked and tasted much like our strawberries today. That fraisier, the French word for strawberry plant, sounds exactly like Frezier's name is sheer coincidence. The Latin term for the berry, fraga, refers to its fragrance.
The smaller Alpine strawberry, or fraise des bois, is of European origin.
The most popular strawberry under cultivation on the Island is the Raritan, which has been around for decades. It bears the name of a New Jersey river. Chandler is a newer variety being planted in the new system. It is larger and is said to have good flavor.
What sets the local strawberry crop apart from those grown in California, which is the source for more than half the national total, and Florida, the other major grower, is that it is not harvested mechanically. Local berries are not bred for their ability to withstand the battering inflicted by machines. They also do not have to be transported for many days over thousands of miles. And there are even some who raise their berries organically.
But that also makes these vine-ripened beauties highly perishable. Even with the most careful handling, they rarely last more than 24 hours.
Whether self-picked or purchased, they should be sorted carefully as soon as possible, to remove any that have soft spots. They should be refrigerated at once, but not rinsed until just before use. The hulls are best trimmed off after rinsing to prevent them from becoming water-logged. Unless they are destined for the jam pot, they can be served as a cocktail or with dessert.
In "The Compleat Angler," Izaak Walton wrote, "We may say of angling as Dr. Boteler said of strawberries: 'Doubtless God could have made a better berry, but doubtless God never did.' " Dr. Boteler, or Butler, a late 16th-century English physician, might well have been making his point about the seasonal berries grown on the Island.

HEADLINE: With a Nod to the Economy, the Art Market Is Flourishing

BYLINE: By HELEN A. HARRISON 

 BODY:
A DECADE ago, the East End's art galleries attracted more window shoppers than buyers, and were seldom patronized by serious collectors. As one local gallery owner remarked, what was for sale in the Hamptons was considered "second-rate art for second homes."
But many dealers now agree that the situation has changed significantly in the last few years. Most of today's art buyers are still people whose primary residences are elsewhere, but their attitude toward shopping at for art is as different as their approach to finding a loaf of high-quality bread. They used to bring it with them from the city, but now they can buy it locally. 
 Gallery owners see several reasons for the shift. The lure of the Hamptons, enhanced by widespread media coverage of high-profile residents and glamorous special events like polo, the horse show and the film festival, is attracting a new generation of potential art buyers. Specialized galleries have developed niche markets and cultivated a national, even international, clientele.
But the most decisive factor is the increasing number of affluent residents. The wealth generated by the surging stock market has fueled a building boom, creating hundreds of new homes with empty walls. Surrounding those homes are lavish gardens that provide the perfect backdrop for sculpture. And the proliferation of galleries demonstrates that the supply of art has increased to meet the demand.
The region's most venerable monitor of the art market, Mary Liberatore, has noted the trend and capitalized on it. "Last year," she said, "I counted 52 places listed in the papers where art can be seen." Her gallery, Clayton Liberatore, which she runs with her niece, Celeste Padilla, has been in business since 1961, selling representational work by established and lesser-known artists.
At the age of 88, Ms. Liberatore has been in the gallery business for 57 years, most of them at 2173 Montauk Highway in Bridgehampton. "I've seen the ups and downs," she said, adding that the last couple of years had been exceptionally good.
She is unusual among local dealers, however, because she has a stock of work by well-known early-20th-century artists, including Ernest Lawson, George Bellows, William Glackens and George Luks, who were represented by the gallery's New York City forerunner, which opened in 1920. Sales from this collection have been brisk, she said, ranging from $1,000 drawings and watercolors to major oils at $50,000.
A similar market is being tapped by the Wallace Gallery, which specializes in paintings of eastern Long Island from 1840 to 1940. The owner, Terry Wallace, began with an inventory he amassed over two decades. After selling to private clients and other dealers in New York City, he opened his gallery on Park Place Passage in East Hampton in 1996.
Realizing that, as he put it, "we're in an area that's going to grow continually," he focused on developing a market for historical depictions of the disappearing rural landscape by artists like Childe Hassam, the Moran family, the Tile Club and their contemporaries. He was aware, however, that previous ventures of this type had not survived, but he believed the time was ripe.
Mr. Wallace's optimism was sparked by the East End's influx of young, well-to-do Wall Streeters, who he said account for 70 percent of his sales. The rest, he said, are made to people in the entertainment industry. He concentrates on clients interested in the region's history as an attraction for painters working from nature. His prices start at about $3,000 for small works by lesser-known artists and go as high as $250,000 for a major oil, although his average sale, he said, is in the $10,000 to $20,000 range. In his first summer, he sold 120 paintings.
"I was surprised that I did as well in the retail market," he acknowledged, but pointed out that the market had expanded. In fact, it is less seasonal than he anticipated. Like many of his colleagues, he stays open year round. "My winter last year was better than my summer," he said.
A growing demand for academic painting is being met by the new Grenning Gallery, which opened last year at 1 Bay Street in Sag Harbor. The gallery's location, tucked between the Provisions health food store and the Corner Bar, seems unpromising, but the owner, Laura Grenning, said she gets increased visibility by being near the Bay Street Theater.
Ms. Grenning is a former stock analyst who left Wall Street five years ago to pursue art training in the Beaux-Arts tradition. Her gallery represents an international roster of artists she calls New Masters, some of whom she met while studying in Italy. Many of their paintings, priced from $1,000 to $15,000, are bought by second-home owners, but she also sells to people who come by boat to the adjacent marinas, and arranges portrait commissions for clients willing to pose in the traditional way for a painter working from life.
Despite her background in the stock market, Ms. Grenning said she did not promote art as an investment. Her emphasis is on "Old Master quality," which she believes is the only objective standard for judging art. "All the rest is subjective," she said.
Her attitude is echoed by other gallery owners, who stress the importance of a buyer's confidence in the dealer's taste and reputation as primary factors in successful marketing. Nevertheless, there is a feeling that many in the new generation of art collectors want work that will hold its value and has the potential to appreciate.
"I'm dealing a lot with resale, so I can give my clients resale value," said Ruth Vered, who with Janet Lehr is co-owner of the Vered Gallery, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year. Originally the gallery, in East Hampton, handled a mixture of work by well-known and lesser-known painters and sculptors, many of them local, but the focus has now shifted to established names.
Many of Ms. Vered's buyers are established collectors who want to invest, and Europeans who visit regularly in the summer, she said. As she sees it, they are more comfortable with artists whose names they recognize, like Picasso, Chagall, de Kooning and other modern masters.
"It seems much easier for me to get $100,000 than to get $5,000, because at $5,000 it's much more difficult to convince them it's worth the money," she said.
Another gallery owner, Arlene Bujese, said, "I hear the word investment more often than I used to."
Ms. Bujese opened the gallery that bears her name at 66 Newtown Lane in East Hampton in 1994. Before that, she had run the Benton Gallery in Southampton for eight years, but found that most of her clients were in the East Hampton area. From its initial format of large group exhibitions, the gallery has evolved to a schedule of small group and solo shows, mostly by abstract artists of the region.
Notwithstanding the concern for investment value she has observed, Ms. Bujese believes there are more risk-takers among the younger generation of collectors, those in their late 30's or early 40's.
Catering to new buyers while retaining the loyalty of longstanding ones is a goal for the Elaine Benson Gallery, just starting its 35th season at 2317 Montauk Highway in Bridgehampton. Now operated by the late Ms. Benson's daughter, Kimberly Goff, the gallery has been thoroughly renovated but maintains its traditional May-through-September schedule of eclectic exhibitions, including work by regional and nonresident artists, ceramics, jewelry, and tribal art and artifacts.
As in the past, each show opens with a benefit for a local cause. The gallery has a devoted following among her mother's contemporaries, but Ms. Goff is mindful of the need to reach out to "a new generation of homeowners who want to start collecting."
With prices ranging from as low as $20 for a piece of eccentric jewelry to $50,000 for a large outdoor sculpture, there is something for everyone, but Ms. Goff pegs the "magic price" at $450. At that level, purchasers are comfortable trusting their own taste and can afford to buy on impulse.
"We do have some older people who are passionate about art and are true collectors," said Arnie Lizan, co-owner with his wife, Elizabeth Tops, of the Lizan Tops Gallery in the back tier of shops at 66 Newtown Lane in East Hampton. "But," he added, "we also see a lot of younger people building homes and wanting to decorate them."
For those clients, he and his wife like to serve less as gallery dealers than as art consultants, visiting homes and showing work suitable for specific living spaces. But they do not sell only to New York City people with second homes on the East End. Mr. Lizan said the gallery attracted many out-of-town visitors during the summer season; he has clients in the Middle West who visit each year, and he has had buyers from as far away as Italy and England.
After several years selling art privately from their Manhattan brownstone, Mr. Lizan, who has a corporate background, and Ms. Tops opened their East Hampton gallery five years ago. Prompted by their strong attraction to the local environment, they concentrate on landscape painters of the region, although they have also shown artists from elsewhere and some abstract work.
Two- or three-person shows are the norm, with pieces priced from $2,000 to $50,000. "Most of our sales have been in the $5,000 to $15,000 range," Mr. Lizan said, "but we have sold several at $40,000 to $50,000. We've had five really good years, and we're out here to stay."
On the strength of such reports, the Wally Findlay Galleries of Manhattan, established in 1871, will inaugurate an East Hampton branch next weekend. The gallery, which also has branches in Chicago and Palm Beach, opens next Saturday with an invitation-only benefit for Boys and Girls Harbor. It will occupy the 4,000-square-foot lower floor of the imposing Greek Revival building on Main Street that also houses London Jewelers.
According to the director, James Borynack, the gallery will remain open 10 months a years. "The East End is a year-round market," he said, "and many of our regular clients have homes there." Work by the gallery's regular stable of French and American Impressionist and representational painters will be featured, at prices starting around $2,000 and rising, in Mr. Borynack's words, "into the millions."
A number of art dealers agree that the client base has become more diverse in recent years. Potential buyers seem more willing to accept galleries in the Hamptons as serious professional businesses, not just seasonal venues, especially when they focus on a particular market.
One of the most specialized is Pritam and Eames, at 29 Race Lane in East Hampton, which sells hand-crafted studio furniture, often made of exotic woods or other rare materials. In fact, the gallery's location in the Hamptons is more or less irrelevant to its success, although it was vital to the owners, Bebe and Warren Johnson, who wanted to live in the area full time. Now in its 19th season, the gallery has a national clientele that the Johnsons have actively cultivated by seeking out people with an interest in the field.
Their roster of artists -- only two of whom, the woodworker David Ebner and Fran Taubman, a metal worker, are based on Long Island -- reflects the nationwide scope of the studio furniture movement and its following.
"The last couple of years have been very good for the field as a whole," Ms. Johnson said. "The American studio furniture movement is gaining in stature, with more pieces entering museum collections."
About half of their business is devoted to commissioned pieces, although their showroom is always stocked with one-of-a-kind furnishings that range in price from $300 for a handcrafted mirror to $50,000 for a marble bench in the shape of a polar bear.
Another specialist, Morgan Rank, has been selling American primitive art on Newtown Lane in East Hampton for 25 years. At first his gallery concentrated on 18th- and 19th-century work, with one show a year by a contemporary self-taught artist, but the proportions have reversed. Mr. Rank now has only one historical show a year, and focuses instead on living artists.
Like his colleagues, Mr. Rank said he often sold to second-home owners from New York City, but American primitive art has its own aficionados who seek it out wherever it is shown. They come from all over, he said, and include Europeans, who account for about a quarter of his sales.
Contrary to what is commonly believed, Mr. Rank does not think that the area has become more of a year-round residential neighborhood. From his vantage point at the corner of Main Street and Newtown Lane, he observes village traffic and notes the increase in day visitors and nonresident weekenders.
"Things changed when going to the country became going to the Hamptons," he remarked drily. But he pointed out that casual visitors may well become seasonal renters and then homeowners who will be needing art for their newly acquired walls.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Lodgings On the Cheap

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
GONE are the days when the family piled into the car and drove off willy-nilly, selecting roadside motels or cabins as they appeared. The tourist cabins on the blue highways are big resorts now, and in summer almost everything requires a reservation.
There are still economical ways to find housing on the road, although these, too, require planning ahead: in college dormitories vacated by their school-year inhabitants; hostels, either linked to an association or free-standing; and Y's or other youth-oriented organizations with downtown buildings. 
 At all these places what you get is more likely to be a single bed or bunk than a private room, and a private bathroom is a rarity. But sometimes early calls can produce the one or two family rooms in a hostel. Some universities that run subsidiary businesses in conferences will have nicer quarters.
Guides to places to stay on campuses and other no-frill lodgings are in accord with the places they depict: economically printed, devoid of glorious color pictures of tea on the veranda. The commercially sold guides may simply re-sort and print public-domain material that is otherwise available free. But the convenience of a single guide may make the cost worth it.
 
The Low-Rent Route
Here is a glance at guides to alternative housing on the road in the United States and for travelers taking the low-rent route overseas.
One of the least known here is the British Universities Accommodation Consortium, which annually prepares free brochures on facilities in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This year's guide lists 62 universities, with grids showing what is available at what times of year, and the fees. As an example, bed-and-breakfast accommodations at Kings College in London, available from July 9 to Sept. 16, start at 25 a night, or $41 at a recent rate of exchange.
Some of the phrases on the chart may be a bit obscure, for example, "self-catering holiday flat," which means a vacation apartment where you may prepare your own meals. Prices are given in pounds. The guide is available free on request to B.U.A.C., Box 1756, University Park, Nottingham, England NG7 2RD; telephone (44-115) 950-4571. The guide is also on the Internet at www.buac.co.uk.
The Canadian University and College Conference Officers Association publishes similar free information about its dormitories, although the main thrust is toward conference planners. The leaflet "Vacationing on a Budget" covers nine universities in Atlantic Canada. "The Planners' Guide to Canadian Universities and Colleges" covers 60 places. They are both available from Christi Higginson, Dalhousie University Conference Services, 6136 University Avenue, Halifax, Nova Scotia B3H 4J2, Canada; (902) 494-3831, fax (902) 494-1219.
The organization also maintains a Web site at cuccoa.org with basic information and a number of links to the individual college pages. It includes color pictures; the photographs of Shirreff Hall at Dalhousie, built in 1923, show a lounge with a fireplace and a dining hall set for a meal. A single room there, with breakfast, is $25 a night, a double $37, about $17 and $25 in United States currency.
Another free publication is "Y's Way Accommodation and Reservation Guide," published by the Y.M.C.A. This slim pamphlet, with an introduction in five languages, focuses on places to stay in New York, such as the Vanderbilt Y.M.C.A. and the West Side Y.M.C.A., where singles with shared bath, with access to health facilities, cost $54 to $59 a night, depending on the season. Affiliated places in other cities and overseas are included. In the back is a form to request a reservation, which must be prepaid. Y's Way: 224 East 47th Street, New York, N.Y. 10017; (212) 308-2899, fax (212) 308-3161.
 
Guides to Hostels
Hostelling International-American Youth Hostels publishes "Passport to North America," which also has an introduction in four languages in addition to English. This 432-page annual guide to 220 hostels is free to members, or can be ordered by nonmembers for $3 a copy. Part of the publishing expense is met by the ads for guidebooks and car-rental and bus companies.
The hostels are organized by state, one listing to a page, with small black-and-white pictures and schematic maps. The book includes a list picking out 25 United States "sustainable living center" hostels that have been adapted to reduce waste and conserve water and that seek out nontoxic products.
Membership in the hosteling group is free for anyone under 18 and costs $25 a year for people 18 to 54, $15 for those over 54. For people going overseas, the organization sells two guides, one to Europe and the Mediterranean and the other to Africa, America, Asia and Australia. These are $13.95 each.
The organization is also distributing a free map of its 142 hostels in the United States, with addresses and telephone numbers. Hostelling International-American Youth Hostels, 733 15th Street, N.W., Suite 840, Washington, D.C. 20005; (202) 783-6171, fax (202) 783-6171.
"Hostels U.S.A." by Evan Halper and Paul Karr, a directory to all American hostels, whether affiliated or not, has just been published in its second edition by Globe Pequot Press. This 440-page book, in a tall narrow format slightly larger than the H.I.-A.Y.H. book, uses stars and icons to grade 300 places in the United States and parts of Canada.
Although A.Y.H. affiliates do not usually permit alcohol, this is not the case with independent hostels. So one of the useful icons in this book is the "party index," one to five New Year's hats for places that range from "downright quiet" to "rage all night." The Fort Lauderdale International Hostel, as an example, rates only two stars, or "barely adequate," and gets five hats on the party line. This book costs $14.95 in bookstores.
Globe Pequot has also published two overseas guides in the same format, "Hostels U.K.," which includes Northern Ireland ($14.95), and "Hostels France and Italy" ($14.95). A separate guide to Canada is due in the fall.
 
Campus Quarters
"Campus Lodging Guide," published by Robert C. Luckcuck and Jan Luckcuck in California, who operate as B. & J. Publications, contains a lot of supplemental material in its 334 pages: addresses of tourist offices, a collection of travel bargains and a dense list, three columns to the page, of hotels, motels and inns. The campus material is copious, starting with Australia and ending with Wyoming. The book also has a long list of Y's worldwide. The editors, who have been publishing this book for 18 years under various titles, earmark lodging places that have not responded to requests for up-to-date information.
B. & J. Publications has a Web site, campus-lodging.com, that contains an order blank. The price of the book is $14.95, and shipping is $2. B. & J. Publications, Post Office Box 5486, Fullerton, Calif. 92838; (800) 525-6633, fax (714) 525-6625.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Joseph E. Stocke;
Evergreen Select Special Equity Fund

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
WHAT makes for successful stock-picking? Simple number-crunching, or the evaluation of more qualitative matters, like management talent?
Joseph E. Stocke, portfolio manager of the $100.1 million Evergreen Select Special Equity fund, says he has one foot in each camp. He starts with a numbers-driven computer model, then uses more traditional, "kick the tires" qualitative analysis to whittle down his list, which mostly includes small-capitalization stocks. 
 "The quantitative approach is very disciplined and the qualitative is like an art form, so we think it's a very balanced process," he said from his office in Malvern, Pa.
Mr. Stocke (pronounced STAHK-ee) says the balanced approach has helped the fund as small-capitalization stocks have sputtered. Evergreen Select returned 20.1 percent, annualized, for the three years ended May 14, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher, versus an average of 8.5 for its category of small blend funds, which own stocks with both value and growth characteristics.
Mr. Stocke, who bench-presses 165 pounds when he is not picking stocks, joined Meridian Bank of Reading, Pa., in 1983, and eventually began managing an institutional fund that was the predecessor to Evergreen Select. Meridian was bought in 1996 by Corestates Financial, which in turn was bought in 1998 by the First Union Corporation, owner of the Evergreen Funds.
His starting point is the roughly 5,000 publicly traded American companies with market capitalizations of less than $2 billion. Then Mr. Stocke, 39, skims off 10 percent of them, using a computer model that combines elements of growth, value and even momentum investing. The model seeks out stocks with high earnings growth rates, low price-to-earnings ratios, high dividend yields, upward changes in analyst earnings estimates, heavy insider buying and positive price momentum. The computer finds those that are reasonably appealing by all six measures, or those that are very attractive on at least two of them, ending up with 450 to 500 stocks.
Mr. Stocke and the six analysts who work on the fund then divide the list among themselves, by industry. (He takes consumer cyclicals and health care stocks.)
They review each company, looking at its management, new products, industry position, research and development and sensitivity to economic trends. For example, Mr. Stocke's team wants management that owns company stock or whose pay is tied to performance, and that has a track record in various market and economic environments. "We look at anything that would add value," Mr. Stocke said.
That allows him to make the final cut, to the 100 or so stocks that he holds in the portfolio.
Last month, he added to the fund's position in Electronics Boutique Holdings, a retailer of computer games that he bought for $14 a share last July, at its initial offering. The company, based in West Chester, Pa., has 528 outlets, mostly on the East Coast, and plans to open stores in the rest of the country, he said. It began selling games over the Internet last month and could profit from demand for computer games tied to the "Star Wars: Episode I -- the Phantom Menace," which opened on Wednesday.
He estimates the company's five-year earnings growth rate at 20 percent. The stock, which now trades at $16, sells for less than 11 times his earnings estimate of $1.50 to $1.55 a share for next year.
MR. STOCKE recently added to his stake in Williams-Sonoma, the kitchenware marketer that also sells furniture and tableware under the Pottery Barn name. The company should benefit from strong sales of new and existing homes, he said. Williams-Sonoma shares are selling for less than 22 times his 2000 earnings estimate of $1.50 a share. He attributed that ratio to the company's increased spending over the last few quarters to upgrade distribution and computer systems, which hurt earnings and dampened the share price.
But Mr. Stocke expects annual earnings growth of more than 25 percent over the next three years. He bought shares last fall at $22; they closed on Friday at $31.875.
 Another favorite is Gildan Activewear, a Montreal manufacturer of inexpensive T-shirts and other sportswear. The company has begun making golf shirts to benefit from the trend toward more casual wear in offices, Mr. Stocke said. "It's a family-owned business, and the owners put their heart and soul into the business," he added.
He expects earnings to grow 20 percent annually over the next five years. The fund began buying the stock at $7 in June 1998; it closed on Friday at $16.0625, eight times his earnings estimate of $2 a share for next year.

THE UNCERTAIN SCIENCES
 By Bruce Mazlish.
 328 pp. New Haven:
 Yale University Press. $35. 
 We get our most reliable knowledge, it is often said, by sharing experiences with one another and testing our favorite claims to truth against the evidence and reasoning of the widest possible community of inquirers. Charles Peirce in the 1870's endowed this epistemic universalism with philosophical rigor and moral passion. Jrgen Habermas has called attention to the democratic political resonance of this community-centered vision of inquiry. Now Bruce Mazlish, a historian at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, writes a book designed to help "bring into being a scientific community that is composed of most, or at least a large part," of the world's population.
This community would advance knowledge in physics, mathematics, chemistry and the other fields where cognitive agreement across cultural barriers has long since been substantial. Mazlish presses for a worldwide consensus in the study of humanity itself, an object that has proved resistant to scholarly agreement. Given the fact that humanity is an evolving entity, Mazlish holds that knowledge of it cannot be as certain as that of the natural world. Hence what he calls "the human sciences" are the referent of his title, "The Uncertain Sciences."
An assessment of the prospects for a universal community of inquiry about the human species is timely. Science-based technology facilitates global economic integration at a rapid pace, while resistance to Western domination often takes the form of religiously coded rejections of scientific culture. But Mazlish confronts these contemporary conditions only in the abstract. It is all too characteristic of his book that its most compelling example of learning amid "globalization" is an anecdote told by John Locke in the 17th century. The King of Siam refused to believe a Dutch ambassador's description of a winter in which water could become hard enough to support an elephant. The skeptical King "was thinking as a good scientist," Mazlish allows, but "only by an expansion of shared experience" could the King of a tropical country "make a more informed judgment."
Mazlish appears to have decided that the best way to promote species-wide inquiry is to remain persistently vague about what it means to be "scientific" about human beings. Specificity might split the movement along lines that have long divided theorists of science. Yet this fuzziness, though it might create temporary coalitions of politicians or voters, deprives "The Uncertain Sciences" of the clarity demanded by a conversation that has been under way for centuries. Mazlish repeatedly invokes "scientific method," which, in his most decisive formulation, entails "obedience to the dictates of experience, experiment, verification and theoretical imagination, among other things." What "other things"? The distinction between scientific and nonscientific ways of thinking is highly contested and is absolutely vital to his case, but he is loath to shut down the discursive escape hatches through which the substance of his argument drains away. A striking feature of this book is the frequency with which the phrase "and so forth" substitutes for clarification of an ambiguity.
No less striking is the frequency with which Mazlish tells us what his book is not. It is not "a history of the social sciences," although readers will find aspects of that history on almost every page. It is not a "philosophy" of the sciences that deal with human beings, although Mazlish offers philosophical obiter dicta about the study of human evolution, psychoanalysis, political science and anthropology. It is not an account of the "pragmatists' or the idealists' view of science," although Mazlish labors hard to deliver, late in the book and with a decidedly anticlimactic effect, conventionally pragmatic notions of a middle way between "positivistic" and "hermeneutic" philosophies of science. He urges us to treat his book "like an orange, to be slowly peeled."
Within the rind Mazlish has located a series of sweeping, poorly defended claims about the relative success of several disciplinary projects. He pronounces political science hopelessly "unscientific." On the basis of whose efforts does he judge political science a failure? The 92 annual volumes of the American Political Science Review, perhaps, or the 112 annual volumes of Political Science Quarterly? No. He does not confront a single study published in the two journals that have led in the effort to build a science of politics. His case is made on the basis of the performance of Hobbes, Locke, Machiavelli, Madison, Montesquieu, Rousseau and Marx, all theorists who lived well before the modern discipline of political science was even formed. But Mazlish has warned his readers, "We shall be flying high above the actual terrain of the particular social sciences under consideration."
Nowhere does he fly higher than when he turns, near the end of "The Uncertain Sciences," to the relation between science and religion. Humanity will continue for some time to have a hard time getting its scientific act together because evolution has not progressed far enough to discard religion from the inheritance of the species that, Mazlish tells us three times, has spent 99 percent of its experience in a hunter-gatherer state. "Comte was right" that natural science would free itself "from religious modes of thought," he declares, and goes on to lament that "people still espouse and act in accordance with religious beliefs, rather than the laws and methods of the human sciences."
He reveals no interest in why this is the case. The persistence of religion would seem to be a weird instance of "cultural lag," as Mazlish's predecessors among cultural evolutionary theorists would have put it. He notes with alarm that according to a recent poll, some 70 percent of Americans "belong to a church of some sort." But even the most resolute secularist can suspect that the persistence of religion is a more complicated phenomenon than Mazlish, as an unreconstructed Comtean, is prepared to acknowledge. Moreover, the human sciences have been slow to achieve a universal community even among souls who have stopped going to church.
Yet Mazlish, for all his frustrating lapses of judgment and learning, has the right idea. When we move about and try to incorporate the experiences of the widest possible community of investigators, we do learn more. "Many shall run to and fro," prophesied the biblical Daniel, "and knowledge shall be increased."

 The Soviet Union has collapsed. Russian scientists and British salvagers cruise through the Atlantic in a Russian research ship called the Keldysh. Days are spent deciphering clues from World War II records. Nights are rife with sonar pings, whispers of double-crossings and vodka. The C.I.A. may be watching. Gold is involved.
The stage is set for James Hamilton-Paterson to create a thriller that he will parlay into a seven-digit film rights sale. But this odyssey is nonfiction, putting the author at the mercy of reality during his six weeks with a treasure-hunting expedition in 1995. We, mercifully, are in the hands of a deft storyteller -- a seasoned novelist -- who knows how to mine the nuance of character. In "Three Miles Down," he moves beyond the typical adventure formula and gives us a story that lingers on people and place and on small, genuine curiosities.
The Keldysh and its passengers, a British salvage expedition named Project Orca, are on an ambitious mission in search of two sunken vessels. Both are believed to have been carrying gold when they went down in separate World War II incidents: the I-52, a Japanese submarine sunk by Allied forces in June 1944, and the Aurelia (a pseudonym), a British troop carrier sunk by an Italian submarine 15 months earlier. Both wrecks are in international waters -- a fact that will beat back lawsuits if gold is found. Project Orca doesn't have precise coordinates for either of the vessels, or a strong leader; however, the Orca team members do have extensive experience, valuable research and -- thanks to the Keldysh -- some of the world's most sophisticated underwater technology. The stars of the Keldysh's technological assets are two manned submersibles complete with lights, cameras and manipulator arms that operate drills and cutters.
Among the shipmates is Mike Anderson, the orchestrator of the expedition. The quirky Clive Hayley and Simon Fraser are the investors' representatives. Andrea Cordani, a researcher, fights hard for her place in a male-dominated culture and is the most level-headed member of the entire Orca team. An American, Ralph White (whose secretive Government connections make him something of an "Oliver North of underwater photography"), and the author are the only observers aboard. Anatoly Sagalevitch, the brilliant and roguish designer of the submersibles and the head of the operation, is trying to mix science with commercialism.
The group quickly regresses to the "institutional huggermugger one first encountered at boarding school," Hamilton-Paterson writes. "Gossip, rumor, wounded feelings, sendups of third parties behind their backs, emotional overkill" are the result of mixing people with varied agendas. This tense shipboard community proves Hamilton-Paterson's thesis that "treasure hunts have far more to do with personalities than with technology."
Moral questions swirl around the issue of salvage. At what point does grave digging become archeology? Is a wreck a tomb even if no bones can survive so deep in the ocean? Are salvage expeditions morally redeemed if they also support scientific research?
Understandably, these quandaries are forgotten at the front lines. The very "Right Stuff"-like Russian aquanauts know that three miles down there are no "slight defects," only "fatal flaws." These aqua rock stars plummet in the tiny submersibles -- and then casually whip out screwdrivers to do a little ad hoc rewiring.
Pressure may be the nemesis aboard the Keldysh, but deep under the surface it is the Grim Reaper. If there were to be a pinhole leak at 16,000 feet, the seeping needle of water would "cut through a body like a laser," Ralph White tells the author. If a seal broke and there was an implosion? "You might just hear a click. Then the shock wave would turn you into a liquid about as thick as consomme."
Pure science is the pot of gold for the Russian scientists. Their plunder lies, for example, in the capture of bacterial specimens from hydrothermal vents (called smokers) that mark the edges of the earth's tectonic plates.
For the others gold is the gold, and for the few without a tangible stake (including the author) treasure lies in the essence of the quest. "Like love, gold is its own explanation," Hamilton-Paterson says, "a metaphor for pure longing, unattainable happiness, an epitome of that quasi-mystical economy of losing-and-finding which hovers behind our lives and seems to motivate all we do . . . a lump of dream taken from a heap of promise."
While the book's tension is in the complex relationships among the shipmates, the climax comes with the author's journey in a submersible. Declaring that "playing it safe's a modern suburban disease," he jumps at the opportunity to travel to "a place without real coordinates, one that our recent forebears thought of as terrifyingly inchoate, godless, too primeval for any human connection, beyond morality, a leftover from Chaos."
Down in the cramped pod we look, as if through a tiny periscope, both back in time and into his character. While marveling at 50-billion-year-old rocks, he claims a sort of genetic memory and recalls events from 40 years ago: "slanted afternoons, the words of pacts, the nape of someone's neck." He concludes, "I have been moving through a bath of solvent which has thinned away crusts and membranes which had built up around certain memories."
Ironically, these magical passages point to a weakness in the book. They offer only glimpses of a narrator whose own story is best equipped to cradle this voyage into human desire, science, history and good old-fashioned adventure.
Eventually, shipboard politics deteriorate into finger pointing and animosities. The gambler's false optimism that has strung us along begins to dissipate. But then, two months after the Orca expedition concludes without finding either ship, there is startling news. Another Russian ship chartered by an American expedition has found the I-52 -- seven miles from the Orca survey area. New conspiracy theories are hatched. Did the Keldysh aquanauts actually find the I-52, keep mum and sell the coordinates to another operation for a higher price? (In fact, conspiracy was unlikely; good research, first-rate sonar and dumb luck probably helped the American operation.)
As the story closes, there's a final twist. With its manned submersibles, the Keldysh might be the only ship capable of salvaging the I-52. Will the two groups join forces? Suddenly, this treasure hunt has the makings of a sequel.

Artists at the easel, collectors and investors on the prowl: Stories from the success of the auction giant Ebay.

BYLINE: By Denise Caruso 

 BODY:
IN addition to being the most important invention since fire, the commercial Internet is, apparently, the perfect parking lot for a global flea market.
The overwhelming popularity of the on-line auction giant Ebay -- with a $22 billion market cap and millions of daily visitors -- has inspired a convoy of me-too sites. They range from Amazon.com, branching out from its pure retail roots with a huge advertising campaign to draw people away from Ebay, to the on-line technology site Cnet, which started its auction site for high-technology products last week. 
 Whether the gargantuan success of Ebay can be duplicated is anyone's guess in today's surreal business environment. But it has clearly stumbled onto something the likes of which has never been seen before.
Consider the experience of one consultant whose interest in emerging technologies dove-tailed rather nicely last week with her fascination for Star Wars mania.
Sally Rosenthal, who is based in Palo Alto, Calif., said that while at a Target store in Silicon Valley watching collectors line up to buy Star Wars trinkets, she started talking to a couple in their early 40's, with infant in tow, who had been returning to the shelves every 20 minutes. The couple systematically bought up $4,000 worth of stuff, each buying the maximum items that Target allowed each customer, then going back for more.
"They said they'd decided that the lowest risk with the fastest, highest return," Ms. Rosenthal said, "was to buy Star Wars merchandise, then post it on Ebay for a seven-day auction, with a reserve" -- the lowest price they would take -- "of double their money." Thus, at the end of seven days, they would double their investment, maybe doing even better, "or they would return the merchandise, making it zero risk; their only investment was their time and running around to buy the stuff."
If Ebay is easing windfalls for creative investors, it is also inspiring more traditional creators.
Allee Willis, a Grammy-winning songwriter and artist who abandoned a seven-year foray into multimedia because she could not get the "suits" in Hollywood to invest in her Willisville Web community project, said Ebay "honestly inspired a career change for me, and after seven years of dedicating my life to interactive and being repulsed by it, Ebay brought me back."
A fanatical collector of 1950's atomic kitsch and a talent scout for what might best be called "outsider art" and artists, Ms. Willis found her on-line home.
"It's not even the sagas and who I've met," she said. "It's the system I have going for bidding -- right now, I have three G3 Macintoshes, with three bidding windows opened on each of them -- and what goes on when I want to win. I have a special swivel chair that I got just to do Ebay, and all I do is spin around from computer to computer, bang-bang-bang. My final bid goes in three seconds before the end of the auction, and I knock everyone out."
Her discovery of a painter selling his work on Ebay inspired her to start painting again for the first time in 10 years. "I thought if I could make enough money to keep my house I'd be happy," she said. "By the time I sold the third painting, the bell went off and I felt like I'd stumbled into what I'm supposed to be doing."
Yesterday she opened a Web site for her latest find, Bubbles (www.bubblestheartist.com). But unlike previous discoveries, Bubbles the artist is Ms. Willis herself. She will sell Bubbles's paintings, along with matching objets de kitsch (such as Black Power Afro Picks and dog accessories), matching music (from her musician friends who have recorded "really, really horrible" versions of their famous songs) and outrageous, matching on-site animations with sound tracks (also for sale, of course), on both her Web site and on Ebay.
Ebay, she said, is "a fantastic interface for doing nothing but getting people together and getting the business people out of the way -- it's making a people's medium out of something that today is just being cluttered by business and technical junk."
Even though Ebay is big business, Ms. Willis said, "you don't see it -- you don't have to deal with anyone except the person who's buying or selling."
"If the trend in the next century is working for yourself," she asserted, "Ebay is going to do more for that than any other interface. It's easy and it's comfortable, and when you do it once you aren't afraid of it anymore."
Stories like these do not surprise Larry Downes, a technology consultant and a co-author of the book "Unleashing the Killer App: Digital Strategies for Market Dominance" (www.killer-apps.com). Mr. Downes, an unrepentant Ebay addict and collector of 1950's vintage horror comics, finds the auction service to be the perfect example of a killer application in which the Internet lowers transaction costs and creates new markets.
Mr. Downes is a devotee of Ronald H. Coase, the economist and Nobel laureate who more than 60 years ago first explored the concept of transaction costs.
Mr. Coase's transaction costs, which Mr. Downes says are still not considered in most business formulas, include that of buyers and sellers finding each other, of finding or providing the information needed to make the transaction, of bargaining and making the buy-or-sell decision itself, and of policing and enforcing the terms of the sale.
Mr. Downes says Ebay virtually eliminates several of these. "What Ebay lets you do is find mini-transactions where otherwise people would never have gotten together," he said. "Because it's so diffuse, there was a much more liquid market for comics, for example, than any of us knew. Every year there's a comic book convention, but otherwise the market was not very liquid. Ebay's made it a 24/7 bazaar."
Indeed, on just one day last week, there were nearly 500 active Ebay auctions just in the category of 1950's horror comics and more than 25,000 for comic books over all.
Ebay and its clones are not without the kind of caveat emptor problems that plague all flea markets. But on Ebay, at least, scammers offering nonexistent or fraudulent goods, for example, are often caught by shrewd buyers who can then post comments about the sellers, warning off the unwary.
"The most interesting difference between Ebay and other auction sites is who decides what merchandise is sold," Mr. Downes said. "Sites like Onsale.com," which sell distressed, surplus or bulk goods, "are saying, 'Here's what we've got; this is what we'll auction off.' Ebay says: 'We have no idea what you want to buy or sell. We'll just create the platform and a set of tools and allow the markets to define themselves.' "

Selling Backpacks on the Web Is Much Harder Than It Looks

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
Head south on Interstate 5 from downtown Seattle and you cannot miss the huge terra-cotta office tower that commands the horizon from a nearby peak.
The structure is the new home of Amazon.com, the ever-expanding Internet retailer that most other Internet retailers worship and strive to emulate. The Amazon creed is to break the budget on acquiring new customers -- on the theory that big profits will come later, once the company's name is established and the Web's lower operating costs make it impossible for brick-and-mortar competitors to keep up. 
 But drive another 20 minutes down the highway from this shrine to E-commerce, and you come to an undistinguished, low-lying office park in the industrial suburb of Kent. Here, an E-business with a very different philosophy is blossoming: rei.com, the Internet division of the outdoor gear and apparel retailer Recreational Equipment Inc.
Though rei.com is small compared with Amazon.com -- only $50 million in annual sales versus $610 million -- it is similiarly dominating its market. One of every $100 spent on outdoor gear this year will pass through rei.com.
Like Amazon's management, the people who run rei.com are proud of their results and have big plans for the future. But unlike Amazon, rei.com turns a profit. Recreational Equipment Inc., generally known as REI, also operates real-world retail stores, giving the outdoors company a first-hand basis for comparing the on-line with the old-line business models. And REI's experiences run counter to the main assumptions that have grown up around E-commerce and have contributed to the stratospheric stock prices of Web retailers like Amazon.
Contrary to the myths, rei.com says:
Running brick-and-mortar stores has turned out to be not a liability but a huge advantage. The operating costs of the Web site have consistently gone up -- not down. And whatever the barriers that Internet technology may pose to potential rivals, that advantage has been largely offset by the start-up's own, daunting technical challenges.
"This is not an inexpensive way to do business," said the chief operating officer, Dennis Madsen. "As most of the pure plays have shown, there is not a lot of profit in it, and I don't see the economics changing in the foreseeable future."
Which is not to say that REI doesn't view E-commerce as an important part of the company's future. Nor does it mean that industry experts see REI as a bumbler. "They are a great company," said Kate Delhagen, a senior E-commerce analyst with Forrester Research. "I use them all the time as my poster child for success."
As a behind-the-screens look at REI's Web operation makes clear, the point is simply that on-line retailing is one tough business. That is true even for an offbeat company like REI, whose quirks have offered serendipitous advantages.
REI, which was founded in 1938, is a cooperative, which means that at the end of each year, 85 percent of its profits are divided among 1.5 million customers who have paid an annual membership fee. REI was receptive early on to the Internet, going on line in September 1996, at a time when most traditional retailers were still taking a wait-and-see stance.
REI also benefited from the demographics of its active, outward-bound customer/members -- a whopping 83 percent of whom have Internet access at home or at work, almost double the national average. Finally, having a catalogue operation that already brought it more than 5 percent of the company revenue by 1996 gave the retailer an important head start in warehousing and distribution.
Yet even with these advantages, the effort to build rei.com into a viable business has been far from a cakewalk for the executive in charge: Matt Hyde, a sinewy 36-year-old mountain climber.
Mr. Hyde, who is now vice president for on-line sales, has been with the company since he graduated from Oregon State with a degree in geology but quit twice, once in his mid-20's to start a business that ran climbing trips in exotic locales like Afghanistan and Chile. His easygoing manner softens but does not mask his intense, 16-hour-day personality. And he compares building a Web site to ascending an oxygen-less 23,000-foot peak: "You do it because it's a challenge, not because it's fun."
It is Mr. Hyde who is the list keeper for the most common Internet business myths, and his favorite is the idea that a physical store is more expensive to run than a Web store.
Amazon's founder, Jeffrey P. Bezos, has been known to brag that he employs but a third of the staff of his biggest competitor, Barnes & Noble, to achieve a proportional amount of book sales. Internet ventures may have smaller staffs, Mr. Hyde concedes, but they must pay those staff members considerably more.
"Technical people are a lot more expensive than part-time salesclerks," he said. Now, for example, REI's flagship store in Seattle employs roughly 300 people, while all of rei.com has but 60. Yet Mr. Hyde says the payrolls for that store and for rei.com are about the same.
And soon, he says, the balance will tilt toward the Web site, as the cost of the site's payroll rises steadily. Competition for information-technology expertise is so fierce that every three or four months Mr. Hyde reviews published studies on salaries in the industry and, if he is lagging, automatically offers raises to his technical team. The industry average for a skilled technical position, like programmer or systems manager, is about $80,000 a year.
Mr. Hyde also rebuts the notion that operating real stores -- with four walls, air-conditioning, shelves to restock and so on -- is more expensive than keeping their virtual counterparts running. It is true that the average REI store costs $6 million, including everything from building costs to new fixtures, and is remodeled every 5 to 10 years. Rei.com, in contrast, spent $500,000 for its original opening, including all machinery and programming. But the rei.com upgrades have never ceased -- and probably never will, according to Rod Ketchum, the operation's senior Web adviser.
As the person in charge of "Web karma," as he puts it, Mr. Ketchum is the one who is called whenever the system has glitches, however small. "Usually at 3 A.M.," he said genially.
Mr. Ketchum said he had ordered four upgrades in the last two months. The most recent was a $500,000 overhaul by I.B.M. to enable the system to use its processing power more efficiently. Rei.com has also rebuilt its Web page from the ground up twice, completely remodeling such features as the search engine and the graphics, and will do so again next March. Minor changes will also be made when rei.com officially links up with Outside magazine's new Web site next month.
None of this has been cheap. Mr. Hyde estimates that he has spent in excess of $15 million since 1996 on upgrades and remodeling.
But Mr. Hyde, who previously managed REI's adventure travel program and its direct-mail operation, had expected the technology costs. Some other expenses have come as a surprise.
In setting up the operation, Mr. Hyde thought he could piggyback off the photographic, distribution and warehousing capacities of the company's catalogue operation. But for displays in its catalogue, for example, REI shoots film, and rei.com managers quickly realized that digital images worked better for the Web. And so Mr. Hyde has had to build three $20,000 stations for digital photography.
The vaunted advantage of a Web site is that it can offer a far more complete selection of merchandise than a catalogue or even a flagship store. Rei.com keeps 56,000 items in stock. Apparel styles change twice a year; "hard" goods like tents, sleeping bags and bicycles are redesigned by their manufacturers annually.
Which explains, in other words, why the best-known Internet merchants sell mainly books and compact disks. Such items are standardized and do not require the same merchandizing finesse as, say, REI's Gramicci Serpentine knit cotton shirt or the Dagger Delta Expedition Kayak. As Bill Curry, an Amazon spokesman, said, his company "either scans in the covers or gets the images from the publisher."
Other reasons help explain why even REI's extensive catalogue distribution and warehouse system have not translated fluently into Web commerce. "The big difference between a catalogue customer and an Internet customer is that the Internet customer expects the order faster," said Clark Koch, the manager in charge of order fulfillment.
From kayaks to crampons, rei.com ships 93 percent of its Internet orders within 24 hours. That is 3 percent better than last year, but it is still not as complete as Mr. Hyde and Mr. Koch would like. They are planning a new "just in time" system that would allow them to process orders within an hour of placement.
But unlike booksellers, which work mostly with a handful of distributors accustomed to shipping small quantities of their products at light speed, REI has more than 1,000 vendors. Some have modern assembly-line operations that can deliver products overnight. Others, like Metolius Mountain Products, a tiny company in Oregon that makes rock-climbing harnesses, cannot work as quickly. Mr. Hyde has been bringing his vendors to the warehouse in small groups to explain the Web business and to help find ways to operate at Internet speed, but he acknowledges that "these things take time."
Because rei.com is not publicly traded -- and its executives say it is not likely to go public because they are not interested in losing control to the market -- it does not have access to a bottomless well of outside capital. The parent company, which does $587 million in sales annually, has been supportive enough that the start-up has had to make few sacrifices. Still, some belt-tightening has been unavoidable.
Among the cuts that caused some soul-searching was a recent decision to give vendors the job of writing the detailed product descriptions that appear next to the photos on the Web. That was a distinct departure for a retailer that prides itself on knowledgeable in-store salespeople who can interpret the baffling array of capacities and features that high-tech outdoor gear offers.
Yet, while Mr. Hyde acknowledges that he envies the venture-capital or stock-market riches of Internet pure plays, he does not cede them the on-line advantage. "There is a very synergistic role between on-line and retail," he said. "It is just a matter of leveraging your advantages."
Marketing, as expected, is a big advantage. Surveys show that most REI Web customers already knew the retailer's name before they logged on.
Fears of potential disadvantages like cannibalization -- that is, that the Web operation would take customers from REI stores -- have not been realized.
True, REI estimates that 50 percent of the people shopping with them on line are repeat customers. But the company has also found that customers who are "multichannel" shoppers -- using stores and the Web, say -- spend on average $150 more a visit than single-channel shoppers. "This is really about being able to serve our best customers better," explained Shelley Olds, rei.com's marketing manager. And, presumably, to get them to spend even more.
Some American retailers have talked of using the Internet as a way to sell globally without opening stores overseas. Today rei.com plans to open a Web site in Japanese, japan.rei.com. But that is simply prelude to, not in place of, opening a Japanese store, as REI plans to do in Tokyo next April.
Mr. Hyde explained that having a real store in Japan would benefit his entire Web operation, because obstacles like tariffs, exchange rates and customs regulations can make it costly and cumbersome to ship overseas.
He predicts that within a year rei.com will sell more than any one of the company's stores. But he says he still cannot imagine a time when rei.com will be a cash mother lode.
"If this becomes a lot easier, and for some reason the technology and operation costs go down, I still do not think we are going to make a big profit," he said. "I don't think our customers would let us get away with it, and I don't think our competition would let us get away with it. For now we are just trying to eke out a business."

HEADLINE: Lawsuit Revives Questions About Hancock

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
For months, the John Hancock Mutual Insurance Company had been steaming smoothly toward a major reorganization that would permit the sale of shares to the public, raising the likelihood of nice bonuses for policyholders and considerable wealth for some top executives.
But on Friday, a Massachusetts appeals court reinstated a lawsuit that dredges up an old scandal in which the company was charged with illegally bestowing gifts -- dinners, tickets to shows and sports events and outings to resorts -- on more than two dozen Massachusetts legislators in the 1980's and early 1990's. 
 The litigation revives questions about the integrity and management of John Hancock, one of the nation's largest life insurers, at a time when the company has been doing everything possible to enhance its attractiveness to potential investors. The dispute's ultimate damage, insurance industry analysts said, will depend on how it plays out in the courts.
The suit strikes at the core of the company. In it, one of John Hancock's seven million policyholders -- the formal owners of the mutual company -- contends that the top executives and directors "participated in, or approved, the illegal lobbying" and saddled the company with expenses of more than $4 million in fines, legal fees and other costs.
In 1994, John Hancock acknowledged that its lobbying, on a range of issues including legislation permitting the company to reorganize and sell stock, violated Massachusetts law. The company paid $1.01 million in fines. About a dozen state legislators, including, Paul Cellucci, who is now Governor of Massachusetts, also paid small fines.
In her lawsuit, the policyholder, Loretta M. Harhen, is demanding the resignations of John Hancock's highest executives -- Stephen L. Brown, the chief executive, and David D'Alessandro, the president, as well as E. James Morton, a former chairman, who like the others is on the board. She also wants them and two former employees -- Raeburn B. Hathaway, who headed the government relations department as the scandal unfolded, and a former chief lobbyist, F. William Sawyer -- to repay the company the $4 million. Ms. Harhen is not seeking direct compensation for herself.
John Hancock says in court papers that the decisions by its executives were "entirely appropriate." But in a 38-page decision, three appellate judges concluded that that contention should be tested at trial.
The legal assault could not have come at a more delicate time for John Hancock, a company with assets of $67 billion and revenue last year of more than $13.6 billion. It has been trimming and polishing its operations in hopes of drawing top dollar when it begins selling shares. With other mutual insurers also preparing to issue shares, competition for investors is intensifying.
Two years ago, John Hancock agreed to pay $350 million to settle a class-action suit asserting that the company, like many other big life insurers, who were also sued, had misled customers into buying policies they did not need.
On guard against anything that could rekindle memories of the past scandals, Mr. D'Alessandro reacted quickly to the disclosure earlier this year of corruption among the organizers of the Olympic Games, which John Hancock has sponsored for years. He yanked the Olympics logo from all the company's promotions and suggested that unless the games regained their sterling image, John Hancock would be gone as a sponsor.
The integrity and quality of John Hancock's leadership will be particularly important as the company presents specific plans in coming months for the reorganization and the distribution to policyholders of at least $3.3 billion in accumulated profits. The plan, which for the first time will make executives eligible for stock options, is subject to approval by both policyholders and the Massachusetts Insurance Commissioner.
How this will all play out is unclear. "Any litigation against a company is not good news and particularly any litigation in which the company has lost an appeals decision," Patrick Finnegan, a senior analyst at Moody's Investors Service, said. "But in order to assess the impact of this, one would really have to wait to see how much of the company's resources have to be used and whether it brings real pressure on the executive officers to step down. This could be a fly in the ointment or it could very well be a big deal."
Stephen P. Burgay, the chief spokesman for John Hancock, said the company still expected the reorganization to be completed early next year and did not expect the offering price of the stock to suffer. No one, he said, planned to resign.
"This matter was thoroughly investigated years ago by the U.S. Attorney, the F.B.I., a Federal grand jury and the state ethics commission," he said. "None of these investigations found senior management to be involved in improprieties."
John Hancock's adversary in the lawsuit, Jason Adkins, the founder of the Center for Insurance Research in Cambridge, Mass., said the criminal investigation did not address "management's responsibility to the owners of the corporation."
"The U.S. Attorney was looking out for the citizens of the state and the taxpayer," Mr. Adkins said. "This suit is about protecting the rights and interests of the policyholders."
Mr. Burgay says the suit is "all about publicity and trying to squeeze the company" as the offering nears.
John Hancock will most likely try to settle the suit swiftly. Indeed, Mr. Burgay did not discourage that line of thought. "We're considering all our options," he said.
Unless the lawsuit develops into a courtroom brawl, analysts said they expected that the opportunities for personal enrichment for policyholders, investors and top executives would keep the company rolling toward a stock market destiny.
"It would be unusual for a policyholder's suit to derail a process with so much momentum," said Eric N. Berg, an insurance analyst at CIBC World Markets.
Should the lawsuit succeed, Mr. Burgay said John Hancock's corporate liability insurance would be expected to pay any obligation assigned to the executives. But Robert Mescal, a specialist in initial public offerings at the Institute for Econometric Research in Deerfield Beach, Fla., said the executives would not necessarily need insurance. They could simply pay, he said, "and make sure the options on the I.P.O. would be sufficient to cover the cost."

HEADLINE: Clinton Proposes Using Surpluses To Extend Family Leave Benefits

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: GRAMBLING, La., May 23

 BODY:
Seeking to expand one of his most popular programs, President Clinton said today that he would direct the Labor Department to explore ways to allow states to use surplus unemployment insurance funds to subsidize parents who take time off to care for a new child.
The President announced the proposed expansion of the Family and Medical Leave law in a commencement address at Grambling State University, a historically black school in north-central Louisiana. Mr. Clinton used the speech to discuss the growing strains faced by working parents and to offer a few nuggets of relief. 
 "Today's working parents too often feel enormous stress and bring that stress home with them," the President said this morning under a roasting sun in Grambling's football stadium, as thousands fanned themselves with commencement programs. "Unless we act now, this problem will get worse."
The President said states should be permitted to broaden the definition of unemployment to include those parents who voluntarily took time off to care for newborns or newly adopted children. Many new parents do not take advantage of the unpaid leave offered under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 because they cannot afford to live without their wages even for a few weeks after a child is born.
More than half the states are running surpluses in their unemployment accounts, and several are looking at ways to return the payments to employers who finance the systems or to pay for new benefits. Four states -- Maryland, Massachusetts, Vermont and Washington -- have asked the Federal Government to approve the use of the surpluses to expand benefits to new parents who want to take time off work.
Surpluses in states' funds for the jobless and in their medical accounts for children and the indigent are overflowing because of low unemployment and reductions in welfare and health care benefits, sparking a classic liberal-conservative political debate. The President and Democratic lawmakers believe the money should be devoted to expanded benefits. Business groups and many Republican lawmakers say the money should be returned to employers and taxpayers.
The President today also proposed allowing Federal employees to use their accumulated sick leave to care for seriously ill family members, a modest expansion of benefits that would cost the Government about $60 million a year, a White House aide said. The plan would affect 10,000 Federal workers, the aide said.
Mr. Clinton cited a new study by the White House Council of Economic Advisers. "They found that because more and more parents are working outside the home, they have less and less time with their children," he told the Grambling graduates. "I believe it is imperative that your country give you the tools to succeed not only in the workplace but also at home. If you or any American has to choose between being a good parent and successful in your careers, you have paid a terrible price, and so has your country."

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Shepherding a China Report Past the Partisan Routines

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
HE is something of a closet Renaissance man in the House, one who speaks Russian, savors Ayn Rand and seeks out the latest translation of Omar Khayyam. For a hobby, he reads book after book on mathematicians.
And so Representative Christopher Cox may seem the perfect prospect for presiding over the House's arcane and ultra-secret investigation of suspected espionage by China. 
 After all, a man who raced through three years of college at the University of Southern California, then pursued twin degrees in law and business in the next four years at Harvard, ought to be able to manage one of the most complex and technical, not to mention most intensely reviewed, redacted and rewritten, reports of recent Congressional vintage: the tome detailing China's years of suspected espionage, which will be released to the public on Tuesday morning in its unclassified version.
"My Groundhog Day will be over," Mr. Cox exulted in his office, saying that after repetitiously renegotiating every jot and tittle of the report with the Administration, he felt like the Bill Murray character who had to relive a day in Punxsutawney over and over.
"After two months we were nowhere," said Mr. Cox, a Republican from Newport Beach, Calif., who headed the House's eight-member select committee that completed its full top-secret China report last January, only to find the task compounded in the negotiations with the White House over the declassified version. The struggle was understandable, for the panel's mandate was to delve into President Clinton's decision to waive export controls over advanced space technology to China. Beyond missile technology, the highly sensitive inquiry had subtexts of political fund-raising abuses and global economic policy.
"Essentially the guts of the report were blacked out," said Mr. Cox of White House vettings that required numerous rewritings by the committee until some acceptable public ground was laboriously reached.
For all that success, the real achievement by the 46-year-old Mr. Cox may be that his committee conducted its job with none of the partisan bombast and political firefights that have marked five years of Congressional investigations of Mr. Clinton by the Capitol's Republican majority. Almost eerily, the Cox committee stands brickbat-free as it moves off stage.
"Our report was unanimous because we stuck to the facts," said Mr. Cox, carefully praising the committee's minority Democrats, led by Norm Dicks of Washington. "Things about which we disagreed we simply left on the cutting-room floor because there was so much that was incontrovertible fact."
Mr. Dicks still sounds amazed. "There we were, Republicans and Democrats functioning together in the middle of impeachment," he said. "Chris Cox has been a man of his word: there were no leaks during the election. Chris played it straight."
Mr. Dicks said the panel's unusual creation of a joint investigating staff and even a unified press office had set a precedent for cooperation that would be dearly needed when legislation was proposed to remedy the security lapses.
"The report was worth the wait," concluded Mr. Cox, exuding a quiet satisfaction that, whatever public furor may ensue, critics will be hard-pressed to dismiss the report as merely another partisan salvo. It was as if Mr. Cox, a politician ambitious enough to have vied unsuccessfully for the speakership in last fall's Republican meltdown, understood that the clever way to stand out in his China task was to buck the noisy, partisan routine.
Still, he says his only real escape from the job lately is sinking into books about mathematicians. "It takes me completely away from work," he explained, smiling apologetically at his six-year binge of math reading. "A crime novel would only get me thinking about the crime bill."
There is an off-handedness to Mr. Cox's manner that is belied by his resume. He sped through the University of Southern California, shifting his major to English after cramming on math. At Harvard he edited the Law Review. He eventually was hired as a counsel by the Reagan Administration as a kind of aberrant whiz kid, an openly pro-Reagan Harvard man.
"I'm not sure I actually ever discovered an appetite for politics," said Mr. Cox, elected to the House in 1988 after suddenly entering a primary that already included 13 Republicans. "It was merely impulsive. The Reagan Administration was ending and I needed a job."
His earliest ambition was to be a sports car racer like his father, a printing executive who competed on the national auto circuit with his son in tow. "Eventually it dawned on me," he said, "that an abnormal number of my boyhood heroes were deceased because of that sport."
Representative Cox had his own brush with mortality as a law clerk when he broke his back in an auto accident. He was paralyzed for three weeks, an experience that he finds has left him ever appreciating how wayward life can be in its risks but also its blessings.
FOR the latter, he and his wife, Rebecca, who is a vice president at Continental Airlines, have three children. He celebrated the Cox clan in the Congressional Record last year, saluting his parents, Marilyn and Charles, on their 50th wedding anniversary.
"Mark Twain once remarked that he spent $25 to research his family tree, and then he had to spend $50 to cover it up," the Congressman orated happily, taking time out from the China inquiry. "Not so the Cox family."

Yale Graduates Urged to Heal Social Ills

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, May 23

 BODY:
Nearly 7,500 alumni, family members and friends came out despite frequent downpours today to attend Yale University's Class Day, the college's traditional preamble to its graduation ceremonies.
David R. Gergen, the former Presidential adviser and an editor at large at U.S. News and World Report, addressed the 1,361 members of Yale College's class of 1999. Yale will confer 3,146 graduate and undergraduate degrees during its 298th commencement on Monday. 
 Mr. Gergen catalogued the many social, economic and technical accomplishments of his generation.
"Your parents have been the builders," he said. "Wouldn't it be wonderful if you could be the healers."
He went on to describe the great disparity of wealth in the United States, the recent school violence in Littleton, Colo., and Conyers, Ga., and other social ills as "a sickness of the soul creeping into the country."
In acknowledging the accomplishments of several students, Mr. Gergen made special note of the community work of Suzanne Jovin, a Yale senior whose murder on the streets of New Haven last December sent shock waves through the campus.
Ms. Jovin coordinated the Best Buddies program, which pairs students with mentally retarded people for conversation, friendship and a view into another way of life.
 
Trinity College
James Mattison, one of 504 students who graduated yesterday from Trinity College in Hartford, has spent much of his time thinking not about his first job after college, as an analyst at Anderson Consulting, but about fufu, a crushed root that resembles mashed potatoes.
Mr. Mattison, on whom Trinity has bestowed the John L. Nicholas Award in Entrepreneurial Studies, raised $6,000 from friends and Trinity staff members last year to start a cinder block school in a remote area of Ghana, in West Africa.
Many of the school's 85 students, ages 3 to 13, have trouble with schoolwork because of hunger.
Staff members supply a lunch of fish broth and fufu, but Mr. Mattison, 22, who grew up in Old Lyme, Conn., wants to offer each student at least one egg every other day.
"But eggs are expensive there," he said. "They're 10 cents each."
Mr. Mattison, an economics and engineering major, is leaving for Ghana on Thursday to help with the free private school, to be joined by eight other Trinity students.
Lorraine Monroe, author of "Nothing's Impossible: Leadership Lessons From Inside and Outside the Classroom," gave the address at yesterday's commencement, the school's 173d.
 
Vassar College
POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y., May 23 -- James Earl Jones, the voice of Darth Vader in the early "Star Wars" movies, could not resist joining in on the hype that has surrounded the latest installment of the intergalactic saga.
"I don't care if you are sick of hearing it," he told the 600 graduates of Vassar College today. "I offer you one piece of advice on this most auspicious and joyful occasion: may the force be with you."
Mr. Jones urged the members of the class of 1999 to accept their responsibilities not only to themselves and their families, but to "we the people" as well.
Frances Daly Fergusson, the college's president, bestowed degrees on approximately 600 seniors from 38 states and 9 foreign countries.
 
SUNY Albany
When Maya Angelou, the nation's poet laureate, canceled her appearance at yesterday's 155th commencement ceremony at SUNY Albany, the task of replacing her fell to John Pipkin, the dean of undergraduate studies.
"It's a bit daunting, and the crowds at commencement are a bit unruly," said Mr. Pipkin, who had a week to prepare his speech after he was told that Ms. Angelou was ill with pneumonia.
"It's a big disappointment that Maya Angelou is not here today," Mr. Pipkin told the 3,800 graduates.
Ms. Angelou's spokeswoman declined to comment on her health. Ms. Angelou delivered the commencement address at Ithaca College on May 15 and at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., on Saturday.
Mr. Pipkin compensated for Ms. Angelou's absence by quoting her advice on meeting challenges from her best-selling book "Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now": "If the future road looms ominous or unpromising, and the roads back uninviting, then we need to gather our resolve and, carrying only the necessary baggage, step off that road into another direction."

HEADLINE: Budget Surplus Puzzle: Spend Today What Could Vanish Tomorrow?

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Like athletes clutching a trophy, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and City Council leaders have held up New York City's $2.1 billion budget surplus in recent months as proof of their own financial prowess and the city's exceptional fiscal health.
Mr. Giuliani and Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker, have proudly proclaimed that the record surplus would help them balance next year's budget and leave enough over to pave the way for a new round of tax cuts for city residents and businesses. But as news of the surplus strategy spread, the response has been more cranky than congratulatory: in recent weeks, everyone from labor leaders to community gardeners has accused Mr. Giuliani of hoarding the bounty. 
 The unions want him to set aside a chunk of the surplus for salary increases for municipal workers. Advocates for children want more for day care programs, school construction and housing for homeless families. And independent fiscal monitors say every cent of the surplus should go toward reducing the city's multibillion-dollar long-term debt.
Even the State Legislature has joined the chorus. Last week, state lawmakers took the surprising step of voting to abolish the city's commuter tax, saying suburban residents who work in the city deserved a piece of the windfall.
"Thanks to Mayor Giuliani's leadership, New York City has built up a surplus of more than $2 billion," Joseph L. Bruno, the majority leader of the Republican-controlled State Senate, said after his house passed the repeal. "This is the right time to eliminate the commuter tax."
The Giuliani administration has responded angrily to the Legislature's action, saying it cannot simply use surplus funds to make up for the expected loss of $360 million a year in commuter tax revenues. The city must be conservative with its surplus, mayoral aides say, because the economic boom that produced it, driven mostly by Wall Street, could slow at any time.
The city's spending is growing faster than its revenues, contributing to annual budget deficits that are expected to grow in the next few years. Mr. Giuliani has been able to patch recent budget gaps with surplus revenues from the Wall Street boom. He is planning to use 80 percent of this year's surplus -- about $1.7 billion -- to plug the expected budget gap for the fiscal year that starts July 1. "We are not taking the surplus and spending it on party favors," said Robert M. Harding, Mr. Giuliani's budget director. "Fiscal prudence dictates you do everything you can to make sure your budget gaps in the out years are under control."
The city always gets bombarded with wish lists when it has a surplus, but this year -- the third in a row that the surplus has exceeded $1 billion -- the clamor seems louder than usual, city officials say. Douglas A. Criscitello, director of the city's Independent Budget Office, said that after several years of fiscal prosperity, people have come to expect significant increases in spending.
"An expectation has developed that a surplus will materialize each year, and everyone wants a piece of it," Mr. Criscitello said. "But they have to remember, if the economy and Wall Street return to normal levels," the surpluses will end.
While the strong economy has allowed the city to solve short-term financial problems like next year's budget gap, Mr. Criscitello and other budget analysts say that Mr. Giuliani has not taken advantage of recent surpluses to address more serious, long-term problems. Most important, they say, the city has not made great gains in paying off its $37 billion in long-term debt, a sum that is expected to increase rapidly in the coming years as the city is forced to borrow more heavily in order to replace its aging infrastructure.
The Independent Budget Office is predicting that the deficit will be more than $2 billion in the coming fiscal year's $35.3 billion budget and that it will grow to $3.1 billion by 2003, partly because the city is expected to spend more on contracts with unions representing municipal workers.
Those unions have made some of the thundering demands for Mr. Giuliani to share the surplus, asking that he set aside as much as $1 billion to pay for wage and benefit increases for their members. During a labor rally in Manhattan this month, union members waved signs drawing attention to the surplus, and labor leaders gave speeches accusing Mr. Giuliani of squandering the extra money on tax cuts that primarily benefit wealthy businesses.
"There is far too much corporate welfare that goes on in this budget," said Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers and chairwoman of the Municipal Labor Coalition, which represents 100 municipal unions. "We are very concerned about the chasm between the rich and the poor and middle class, who helped create this surplus."
Ms. Weingarten said the city should spend part of the surplus to reduce class sizes in public elementary schools, improve health care services for the poor and cut taxes for poor and middle class residents. But fiscal monitors say it would be foolish to use the surplus for recurring expenses, whether they be salary increases, tax reductions or new city programs.
"A surplus can only be spent once, so it's not smart to use it to pay for things that continue forever," said Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private watchdog group. "We should be looking at what the city can afford to pay year after year."
Ms. Fortuna said that even the Mayor's tax cut proposals were risky, because the city would have to make up for the lost revenue for years to come. She said it was disturbing that even in the strongest of economic times, city officials had not figured out how to balance the budget unless revenue exceeded their estimates. The city would be wiser to spend the money on long-deferred construction projects or to pay off some of its long-term debt, she said.
"Times are good enough that they are ignoring some of the underlying fiscal issues that they could be addressing," Ms. Fortuna said. "They ought to be worrying more about how to address some very serious problems down the road."
But Mr. Harding argued that a few carefully chosen tax cuts could go a long way toward creating future surpluses. While the commuter tax repeal will not strengthen the economy, he said, other measures, like Mr. Giuliani's proposals to reduce certain business taxes, eliminate the sales tax on all clothing purchases and offer an earned-income credit to the working poor -- some of which will probably be abandoned because of the loss of the commuter tax, could.
"The notion that you have a surplus, therefore you can do any old tax cuts, misses the point," Mr. Harding said. "But if you do tax cuts targeted to spur the economy, help create jobs, help make the city more attractive to businesses, then you help build the surplus."

HEADLINE: The Big City;
The Moochers From Upstate? Cut 'Em Loose

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
THE city's politicians are desperately trying to keep the bullies in Albany from taking away our commuter tax, but there's a much more lucrative way to preserve our fiscal honor. The revenue from the current tax is chump change compared with the billions that could be extracted from commuters if the city seceded from the rest of the state.
Secession is a big step, of course, and money alone would never justify severing the ancient ties that bind us to our brothers and sisters upstate. There are many more important reasons why it would be delightful to get rid of those moochers. But let's start with money. 
 Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City Council are furious at the State Legislature's recent repeal of the city's 0.45 percent tax on commuters' income. That's minuscule next to city's income tax on its own residents, which has a top rate of 3.8 percent. It's also much less than the New York state income tax, which has a top rate of 6.85 percent and is collected from everyone working in the city, including commuters from New Jersey and Connecticut.
While commuters pay less than $400 million annually to City Hall, they send more than $3 billion in income taxes to Albany, according to Frank Mauro, the executive director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a private research organization based near the state capital.
An independent State of New York City could not only keep this $3 billion, Mr. Mauro figures, but it could also pocket even more by making commuters pay the same rate as city residents. And that rate could be lower than it it is today, because there would be so much extra revenue that the city could afford to cut taxes and increase services.
"Suppose," Mr. Mauro said, "that the State of New York City set its income tax rate 10 percent lower than today's combined city and state rate. Suppose it also eliminated some of today's taxes seen as economically harmful, like the commercial rent tax and the unincorporated business tax. There would still be an additional $3 billion each year to spend on schools and subways and libraries and parks."
THE beauty of this plan is that even the financial losers, the residents of upstate New York, would be happy. Their opinion of us was nicely summed up by State Senator John R. Kuhl Jr., who said that his constituents in the Finger Lakes region often wonder, "Why don't you just cut the City of New York off and let it drift out to sea?"
Senator Kuhl has obliged them by introducing a bill this year, as he has regularly for nearly a decade, to let New York City, Long Island and Westchester and Rockland Counties became a separate state called New York; the rest of the counties would become West New York. At least one poll in upstate has found the idea to be wildly popular.
Some of the upstaters' enthusiasm is based on the mistaken belief that their money is supporting New York City's welfare state. That notion has been rebutted by a number of studies, most recently from the Center for Governmental Research, a public-policy group in Rochester.
The study, released in January, found that New York City residents and businesses send Albany slightly more in taxes than they receive back in state spending. The whole metropolitan area -- the city along with Long Island and the other in-state suburbs -- sends about $5 billion more upstate than it gets back, with much of that being paid by suburbanites who commute to the city.
One obvious obstacle to the State of New York City would be the Republican majority in Congress, which would fear allowing the city's voters to elect two Democratic senators. But perhaps Congress could also create two probable Republican seats by turning Long Island into a separate state. Or, as proposed in Senator Kuhl's bill, the new state could include the Republican suburbs as well as the Democratic city.
The biggest obstacle would probably be in the State Legislature, whose members zealously protect their lifetime sinecures. But perhaps the city could learn from Gov. George E. Pataki, who recently persuaded legislators to pass his charter school legislation by offering them a pay raise in return. Let the State of New York City promise to dedicate part of its windfall to the Relief and Retraining Fund for Old New York Legislators. Throw in, say, $10 million per legislator -- a pittance for our prosperous new state. How many of our public servants in Albany would say no?

HEADLINE: Unveiling a Bold Vision for Brooklyn's Waterfront

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
To most New Yorkers, the little-used stretch of Brooklyn waterfront between the mighty stanchions of the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges is the stuff of faded picture postcards, vaguely recalling a majestic past but hardly worth the trip. With its abandoned Civil War-era warehouses, its cobblestone streets and a tiny state park, the area, known as Dumbo, commands sweeping views of lower Manhattan but few visitors.
Today, the developer David C. Walentas will release long-awaited plans for a transformation of the site that would include a hotel, movie theaters, stores, two parking garages and newly rebuilt public parks. The plans also include a starkly contemporary hotel and movie complex designed by the French architect Jean Nouvel. 
 How much of the project will actually be built -- and how many years it might take -- are far from clear, given the marathon of public reviews it would require. The plan would involve rezoning, moving a small city street, building on platforms in the East River and altering buildings that are protected as New York City landmarks. Even in a city in which large commercial developments are routinely subject to a year or more of environmental analyses and public comment, Mr. Walentas's project would face unusual scrutiny.
And even before the official announcement, powerful community groups have mobilized to fight it. With such resistance already in place, the Brooklyn waterfront proposal may test not just a single developer's plan, but also the rules for waterfront development throughout the city.
Under his plan, Mr. Walentas said, the area would become a "vibrant residential and commercial neighborhood." He has spent 20 years acquiring nearly all the large 19th-century industrial buildings in Dumbo -- for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass -- while awaiting zoning changes that would enable him to convert them into modern loft-style apartments. With some of the necessary government approvals in place, he has completed work on one loft building, begun renovating two others, and transformed this Brooklyn backwater into a place where apartments with million-dollar views cost up to four times that much.
In seeking city and state backing for his $300 million complex of commercial buildings and public space, Mr. Walentas is seeking a far greater public mandate. He would require not only additional zoning changes but also control of city and state land that would give his site direct access to the water. In return, he would agree to develop that property as a quasi-public park and riverfront promenade, including a marina, a carousel and an ice skating rink.
The plan for Dumbo comes amid a flurry of waterfront projects, including the Hudson River Park in Manhattan, currently under construction, and plans for parcels in the other boroughs. In each case, decisions involve a debate over how to balance commercial activity and private investment with the goal of providing increased public access.
The Walentas plan has been circulating privately among public officials and civic groups and has received an initial nod of support from senior advisers to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki. They praise it as an innovative way to jump-start economic development in Brooklyn and open up a section of the waterfront that has become forlorn and forbidding.
"This is a public-private partnership that would provide access to the waterfront and would not cost taxpayers anything," Charles Gargano, the Governor's economic adviser and chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said in an interview on Friday.
"We've neglected the waterfront for too long," added Mr. Gargano, whose agency entered an agreement last year with Mr. Walentas to redevelop the three-acre Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park and the neighboring 19th-century warehouses, all of which are central elements of the developer's plan.
A senior economic adviser to the Mayor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said on Friday, "Details will have to be worked out, but the city supports the concept."
Mr. Walentas has already invested years of labor and huge sums of money in his plan.
Jack Beyer, a partner in Beyer Blinder Belle, and one of the principal architects for the project, said in an interview, "It will be designed for Everyman Brooklyn."
Reflecting the complicated hurdles he must cross, Mr. Walentas has teamed Mr. Beyer's firm, one of the nation's most respected in historic restoration work, with projects including Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan, with Mr. Nouvel, an architect known for boldly contemporary design.
For this project, Mr. Nouvel has designed a steel and glass, 250-room hotel and a 16-screen movie complex that would jut out over the East River like a shiny elevated pier.
"We don't want any fuzziness about combining the old and the new," Mr. Beyer said.
Mr. Walentas hopes the project's hotel, theaters and stores, and 1,915 parking spaces in two new garages, will make the site attractive to tourists and residents throughout Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens and not simply to people from the prosperous neighboring communities of Brooklyn Heights and Cobble Hill. But residents of those neighborhoods, along with some citywide civic groups, contend the proposed commercial development would clog streets with traffic. The opponents say Mr. Walentas is asking too high a price for the waterfront access he promises.
"The issue for the public is whether we have to accept development on this scale in order to reclaim a piece of the waterfront, and I don't think we do," said Marcia Reiss, policy director for the Parks Coalition, an advocacy group. "The public is getting short-changed." She was one of several representatives of civic groups who attended a briefing on the plan Mr. Walentas held last week.
Opposition to the project has gained added momentum because its waterfront location is so prominent -- Mr. Walentas's new buildings and a large flashing sign saying "Dumbo" would be clearly visible from lower Manhattan -- and because many people regard it as the cornerstone of a larger waterfront park advocated for years by many people in Brooklyn.
"The biggest problem is it completely eviscerates the plan for Brooklyn Bridge Park," said Tensi Whelan, the executive director of the Brooklyn Bridge Park Coalition, an umbrella group for more than 50 civic organizations and neighborhood groups. It has pushed for a decade to have underutilized portions of Brooklyn waterfront, including Dumbo and the land under the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, developed as a park. Although most of the property underneath the Promenade is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and the group has not obtained funding for its park project, its members have been lobbying tirelessly.
But Mr. Walentas, 60, who made his mark as a pioneering developer of loft buildings in SoHo in Manhattan, has always shown a determination of his own.
"Few people have vision," he said. "and everybody is afraid of change."

HEADLINE: In Search of Free Library Access for All

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: HUNTINGTON STATION, N.Y., May 23

 BODY:
In recent weeks, a public commission has been on the road, studying the future of New York's libraries and looking for ways to insure that all state residents have free access to their services.
The 17-member commission, appointed last year by the Board of Regents, has held public hearings in Buffalo, where library users fear that a regionalization plan will shut down their small community branches; in Syracuse and Brooklyn, where the panel heard about the shortage of elementary school librarians, and here on Long Island, where the practice of charging fees for out-of-towners has run afoul of state law. 
 A common thread at the hearings has been the need to insure free access to basic library services, something that 1.3 million New Yorkers still do not have, education officials say. Nor do most elementary schools in the state have a librarian, they say, let alone a complete library.
And while most of the state's 770 public library systems meet basic standards, many are inadequately prepared for the growing demands that new electronic technology will place on librarians in the next century. Librarians' work is now so involved with the Internet and in retrieving electronic data that the term under which they are certified is no longer "librarian" but "school media specialist."
"We're in the middle of an information glut, but very few people have access to it or know how to discern what is viable information and how to apply it to their daily lives," said Martin Gomez, director of the Brooklyn Public Library and a co-chairman of the panel, formally known as the New York State Board of Regents Commission on Library Services.
The commission has until next spring to prepare a report recommending how to provide a high level of library service to all New Yorkers. "Free access to a library, in my view, is an American right," said Frank J. Macchiarola, a commission member from Brooklyn. "And it's our job to help make certain this becomes a reality."
No one is quite sure how much it would cost to meet that goal. "I know that there is no such thing as a free library, just as there is no free lunch," Mr. Macchiarola said at Wednesday's hearing here at the Huntington Townhouse. "Such service costs money. But we should be able to find creative ways to pay for it."
The issue of free access is of particular concern on Long Island. Most librarians here agree in principle with the State Librarian, Janet Welch, also a commission member, that all New Yorkers should have free access. But directors of the 98 public libraries in Nassau and Suffolk Counties say they cannot afford to comply.
They told the commission that they were bound by their local charters to serve only the residents of their districts, who pay property taxes to support a library. When residents of nearby communities that do not pay such taxes come to them, they try to accommodate them but have decided that they must charge a user fee, which some places set as high as $300 a family.
Such fees, however, were banned when the state established public library guidelines 50 years ago. In December, the Regents warned that they would start enforcing the ban in January.
Until the Regents create a new plan for libraries based on the commission's coming report, Ms. Welch said, they have asked that librarians cut out some of their more expensive services for nonresidents, like the heavily attended story-telling hours or using books and videotapes in popular demand.
The commission is awaiting results of a survey of state residents on their library use and preferences, Ms. Welch said, and is studying practices in other states. In Georgia, for example, revenue from a state lottery is designated for providing all residents with free access to libraries and an electronic research data base, she said.
The commission's final hearing will be held June 3 at the State University of New York at Albany.
At the May 13 hearing in Buffalo, residents objected to a plan to close some small community libraries in Erie County to give emphasis to several large regional libraries with lots of parking and computers.
Ms. Welch said: "Unfortunately for Buffalo, which is losing population and has a troubled economy, it's a question of finding ways to provide the best possible service at lower costs. It's a tough decision."
On May 14 in Syracuse, at the Onondaga County Public Library, and again on Thursday at the Brooklyn Public Library, the major topic was the need for more librarians in elementary schools.
State regulations require that in grades 7 through 12, there be at least one qualified librarian for every 1,000 students, Mr. Gomez said. The rules do not require that a second librarian be hired until the number of students reaches 2,000, he said.
At the elementary school level, from kindergarten through the sixth grade, no librarian is required, although many districts do employ one, Ms. Welch said. "And that's important, because children need to start learning library skills early, especially now that so much information is available to them."
She said that of the 600 elementary schools in New York City, only 22 employed librarians.
Mr. Gomez said the message from the public was "loud and clear" at the first four hearings: "The state must play a more active role in helping its citizens become information literate. And everyone sees libraries as playing a key role."

HEADLINE: Thin Support and Red Tape Mire New York City Development Zone

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
Nearly five years after the Clinton Administration chose parts of upper Manhattan and the South Bronx as a special target for economic development, the project has ground to a virtual halt, with millions of dollars going unused.
The creation of an "empowerment zone" in the South Bronx, Washington Heights and Harlem, heralded as one of the city's most important urban-renewal efforts in years, has been paralyzed by a cumbersome approval process and spotty support from state and city officials, zone and local officials say. They say the problems are discouraging businesses from working with the zone and may make future administrations reluctant to invest in New York's inner city. 
 "I think it has wonderful potential," said the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d, pastor of Abyssinian Baptist Church and a leader in Harlem, where most of the zone lies. "I can't see a lot of what they've done."
When the Federal Government began the program in 1994, it promised New York and six other cities $100 million each over 10 years for loans, grants and job training, plus $250 million each in tax incentives for companies that set up in the zone.. To help win the competitive designation, New York City and State each promised to contribute $100 million, for a total of $300 million.
But nearly halfway into the five-year program, just over $26 million has been spent on projects, plus $9 million in administrative costs. The process is so slow that city officials say they have spent no money for the zone this fiscal year, which began last June 30.
While the city can rebudget its own funds, it will lose the state and Federal contributions if it does not spend them within the 10-year limit.
Curiously, the program has stagnated even as Harlem and the South Bronx are on the upswing -- a turn credited to a strong economy and to community development organizations that have rehabilitated housing and lured back retail business and private investment. Major zone officials, showing unusual candor about the program's difficulties, said that such renewed interest by private enterprise makes the zone's situation especially troubling.
"We'd better get on with investing this money to meet the business cycle that's here today, or we're going to lose it," said Deborah C. Wright, the president of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, the local development corporation that manages the project for Harlem and Washington Heights. Ms. Wright is leaving her post next week.
The pool of money has been frozen largely because each proposal requires the approval of officials in three levels of government, whose views often differ. And memories of past urban-renewal programs -- in which buckets of money seemingly disappeared down a black hole -- have resulted in what some say is almost paralyzing caution this time.
Zone officials attribute many delays to Rudy Washington, the Deputy Mayor for Community Development and Business Services, who holds the city's seat on the New York Empowerment Zone's board and has begun demanding the right to approve every loan or grant personally.
Some officials say they wonder if the city's caution masks its reluctance to spend millions of dollars on neighborhoods that promise little political capital for a Mayor considering a run for higher office.
"There's been times we've scratched our heads and asked each other, does the city want this to fail?" said one official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of jeopardizing neighborhood projects.
But Mr. Washington said that that was not the case, and that he was simply being careful with taxpayer dollars.
 
In Harlem, Layers Of Complex Politics
In Harlem, the picture is complicated by complex and sometimes volatile politics -- the layers of Congress and Council members, the different generations and classes, and the competing ethnic and immigrant groups all vying for a piece of the pie.
"I've talked to entrepreneurs trying to do things and I tell them to contact the empowerment zone," said Richard D. Parsons, the chairman of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone. "They say, 'God save me from the empowerment zone -- you get bogged down in all that political foolishness.' "
When the zones were awarded in 1994, New York alone received matching public money from the city and state. Pressed to show that the zones had local support, the six other cities -- Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore, Camden-Philadelphia (jointly) and Atlanta -- instead turned mostly to private investment.
They, too, have had problems with bureaucracy and politics and are spending the Federal money at a similar rate. Among them, according to Federal figures, Baltimore has spent $18 million and Chicago $13 million, compared with $10.4 million in New York.
But Federal officials say it is private investment that best measures a zone's success. For example, Detroit's zone, which Federal officials rank as one of the most effective, has spent about as much Federal money as New York. But a consortium of banks there has also invested $1 billion in the zone, keeping a promise it made to help the city win the designation. The auto industry there has also played an active role.
New York has leveraged far less private investment. Its most visible effort is an $11.9 million loan to the developer of Harlem USA, a mall rising on 125th Street that will create 500 jobs and bring stores like Disney and HMV Records to Harlem.
Because of a lack of data, it is unclear to what extent businesses in any of the nation's zones are using the tax credits. Zone officials in New York say that some bigger businesses have taken advantage of them, but that smaller businesses have had a hard time maneuvering through the complicated paperwork.
Andrew M. Cuomo, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, who championed the empowerment zones as an assistant secretary, said he was pleased with the rate of spending, pointing out that more projects have been approved but not yet financed. He said he expected the pace to pick up in the next few years.
New York's empowerment zone had difficulties from the start. The Democratic Mayor and Governor who supported it were voted out of office, and the Republicans who succeeded them had to be sold on its merits. Now, with a Democratic President and a Republican Governor and Mayor who are often at odds with him and with each other, the zone's overseers sometimes resemble a quarrelsome family.
"I think we could do a little better," said Charles A. Gargano, the state's Commissioner of Economic Development and chairman of the zone's board. "I think we have done a good job, but I think we could move quicker."
When the program was set up, two local development corporations were designated to work with the community and determine what its priorities should be. The corporations would be overseen by a board that would include Federal, state and city officials. The board would need to sign off on each project, but would stay out of day-to-day affairs. Such was the vision.
"The promise of being a one-stop shop -- of being one place where people could come and negotiate help with red tape at the city, state and Federal levels -- that hasn't happened," Ms. Wright said.
Among the upper Manhattan projects that have been financed are a small-business loan fund and a loan to a video duplication factory. But most of the projects the city has delayed have been in upper Manhattan, where five-sixths of the money is to go. Because the area is mostly residential, officials decided that promoting tourism in Harlem -- the destination most requested by European tourists in New York -- offered the best potential for economic development.
But the initiative has instead become a working example of the system's failings, so much so that Mr. Parsons, who is also the president of Time Warner Inc., recently met with the Mayor to discuss the delays.
A year ago, for example, the upper Manhattan zone approved some $4 million in historic preservation funds for aging churches and other buildings that can help draw tourists. The state also endorsed the initiative.
 
Balking at Project To Restore Churches
But Mr. Washington balked at the project, calling such initiatives disguised subsidies. He finally gave the go-ahead earlier this month -- on the condition that he approve each church receiving funds. The paperwork for this project, like others, will then have to pass through numerous state and city agencies before a dollar is ever spent, a process that can drag on for a year.
Mr. Washington, whose relationship with Ms. Wright is visibly tense, said the upper Manhattan zone had supplied him with inadequate information about projects, and he said he canceled the board's quarterly meeting in February for that reason. The board met earlier this month, for the first time in six months.
"If we have no procedures in place and turn money willy-nilly over to the local development corporations and just pray it's invested right, rest assured that five years from now The New York Times and Daily News and Post will be saying, 'What happened to this money?' " Mr. Washington said.
Mr. Washington also said that zone officials were pushing too many social service programs, like day care, even though the Mayor was adamant that the money should support economic development only.
But even in the South Bronx, Jose Ithier, the president of the Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, said projects had seen delays. In one case, he has tried to get a jobs center at the Mott Haven library approved for months. First, he met resistance because the library is a block outside the zone, though it is the closest for most zone residents. Then, he said, city officials accused him of trying to do an end run around city budget cuts to libraries.
The South Bronx part of the zone has also been hampered by its geographic boundaries. It was gerrymandered to include the Yankee Stadium area, and exclude some of the poorest neighborhoods, partly because United States Representative Charles B. Rangel, who wrote the empowerment zone legislation and sits on the New York zone's board, wanted Harlem to reap most of the benefits, and partly because at the time, it was seen as a way to help keep the Yankees in the Bronx. As a result, the South Bronx part of the zone has a population of just 33,000, and businesses and job-training programs there are struggling to find enough zone residents to fill their available slots.
In many ways, the rebirth of Harlem and the South Bronx sometimes seems to be passing the zone by. Stores like Pathmark and Sterling Optical have moved there without zone money, although with other government funds.
At the same time, the zone has come to embody the fears of some Harlem residents. Some local leaders and small businesses resent Harlem USA, and blame the zone for encouraging gentrification. Others say they worry that Hispanic residents of upper Manhattan are getting short shrift.
Placating all these groups has become a significant part of the zone's work and it may in part have precipitated Ms. Wright's departure. While she says she has long wanted her new job as president and chief executive of Carver Bancorp in Harlem -- the nation's largest bank controlled by blacks -- she has voiced frustration with the politics in Harlem and on the board.
Mr. Parsons said her departure would slow the process -- but not disastrously, he hoped.
If the zones, with their focus on economic development, do not succeed where the Great Society programs of the Lyndon Johnson Administration failed, he said, "no one's got any other ideas."

HEADLINE: An Appraisal;
A Stunning Pier Hotel Design Stands Out Amid a Flawed Plan

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
Sensationally great new building. First-rate park design. Half-baked master plan.
These are the main ingredients of an uneven proposal for Dumbo (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass), the 61-acre site on the Brooklyn waterfront between the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges. The chances are slim that the project will ever be executed in its present form. Some local community groups are determined to stop it altogether. 
 Still, even though the master plan needs a lot more work, the proposal deserves a serious look. Let's pretend that the plan is a serving suggestion, as they say on a box of Triscuits.
Start with the River Hotel, envisioned as the anchor for the entire project. It has been designed by the French architect Jean Nouvel, the most original architect of his generation. And this design is one of Mr. Nouvel's most impressive works. New York has not seen a new building of its caliber in decades. This is architecture -- the real thing. It is not a simulation, not corporate schlock, not yet another retro sigh. Vive la difference.
And vive l'amour. Mr. Nouvel has clearly fallen in love with his site: the two monumental bridges that enclose it; the water traffic; the raw, industrial milieu, and above all, the views -- of the harbor, the East River piers, the Manhattan skyline and the subways whooshing across the Manhattan Bridge. His design literally and figuratively reflects this wildly romantic context. And it plays on the narcissism of a city in thrall to its self-image as the center of the world.
The hotel takes the form of a nine-story pier. Indeed, it projects out over the water where a pier once stood, cantilevered from a lower, rectangular structure that contains a 16-screen multiplex and a ground floor of shops. The pier rises to 100 feet, stopping just short of the Manhattan Bridge roadway.
In keeping with the site's industrial ambience, Mr. Nouvel has employed what he calls a sober esthetic. The building, of steel and concrete construction, is clad with gray metal panels and so-called white glass, a material of unusual transparency without the green tint typical of plate glass. The facade is a grid that derives its proportions from the hotel rooms within. To take advantage of the views, Mr. Nouvel has rotated these rooms 90 degrees from the standard hotel design, so that their long sides face outward. This gives the grid facade a strongly horizontal emphasis and also enlarges the views from the rooms to wide-screen scale.
Since the hotel will be seen by bridge and water traffic, Mr. Nouvel has treated the building's underside and its roof as if they, too, are facades. Two floors of public rooms, enclosed within glass walls uninterrupted by window mullions, are suspended beneath the building in an inverted ziggurat configuration. An expanse of glass is set into the floor of the lower of these levels, allowing views of the water rippling below.
Since heating and air conditioning will be supplied by off-site energy centers, the roof is clear of mechanical equipment. Instead, the view from the bridge will be a geometric pattern of skylights and outdoor, landscaped patios that admit light into the hotel's top-floor rooms.
Those who have visited Mr. Nouvel's Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art in Paris know that the architect is a genius with reflections. He deploys that talent here with the strategic placement of mirrors in the hotel's public and private rooms, and by crowning the roof with a long, slanted mirror that casts skyline reflections into the rooms below.
A new Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park has been conceived by M. Paul Friedberg, a master of landscape design. His plan enlarges the existing park and improves access to it by removing an abandoned government building beneath the Brooklyn Bridge. In its place would be a visitors center and a formal entrance to the park, now entered through a narrow alley to the east.
Mr. Friedberg has split the park in two. The first section is an upgraded version of the existing park and would be dedicated largely to sports, with an outdoor ice skating rink and an elaborate antique carousel.
On the far side of the hotel, Mr. Friedberg has proposed an ecological park that would emulate the condition of the shoreline before Colonial times. Between these two parks would be a small marina, enclosed within public walkways that should offer a spectacular place to watch the sun set behind the Manhattan skyline.
The park has a potential weakness. Its eastern edge is bordered by Empire Stores, a stretch of historic brick warehouses between park land and Water Street. The plan designates the lower two floors of these publicly owned landmark structures for retail use. That would be fine if the shops were restricted to refreshments or merchandise related to sports, horticulture and maritime history. But what is to prevent the park from becoming the front lawn for a chain-store commercial strip?
In fact, it is with the treatment of Empire Stores that the master plan, by the preservation architects Beyer Blinder Belle, falls apart. In addition to the retail uses proposed for the first two floors, the plan sets aside the upper floors of these buildings for a museum. But what kind of museum? A Museum of Dust Bunnies? No institution has yet been named.
As for the retail component, the plan's renderings feature every cliche in the festival marketplace book: Glass canopies that deface the historic buildings they purport to preserve. Banners. Repainted versions of faded signs. On the rooftop, a giant, amazingly corny neon sign. A rooftop sculpture garden, as shown on a site model, looks like the miniature golf course from hell. It saps the roof's industrial strength.
There are two things wrong with the plan. The first concerns urban design. The creators of these markets make a big fuss about the distinctive character of the old buildings they recycle. Then they dress them up with trimmings that obliterate that character and produce a homogenized Festival Marketplace Look.
Glass canopies and banners may seem like minor details in a project of this scale. Yet they have the power to destroy precisely the sense of place that the designers intend to create. It is disheartening that a client with the smarts to hire one of the world's most inventive architects would then surround his work with outmoded ideas.
The second problem concerns urban land use policy and lies partly beyond the scope of the Dumbo plan. Thirty years ago, it made sense to recycle older buildings as shopping centers. Surely this was preferable to the prevailing urban renewal strategy of ripping the cityscape to pieces. But, over the years, a basic flaw in the festival marketplace concept became evident. Wholly dedicated to consumption, such centers make no quarter for production. Thus they ignore one half of the urban equation on which a city's vitality depends.
Two Trees, the project's developer, is promoting Dumbo as an artists' district. In this sense, the area could be productive. Even so, when a developer proposes a festival marketplace, especially one in former industrial buildings, the question needs to be asked: how will this project support urban productivity? How can it reinforce the city's eroding industrial base?
One answer would be to link Dumbo, physically and perhaps even economically, to the film production studios that are planned for the Brooklyn Navy Yard, just east of the site. In Times Square, developers have seized the opportunity to bring together the producers and consumers of entertainment and information in a part of town long dedicated to popular culture. Something similar could occur on the Brooklyn waterfront.
Mr. Nouvel's multiplex would acquire a deeper level of urban meaning if it were located in coherent relationship to a place where films are made. His proposal to place movie screens on the hotel's exterior could extend the cinematic dimension into the northern edge of the park. Hollywood on the Brooklyn waterfront? You bet.
But it would require government initiative to bring such a synergistic concept to fruition. The lack of a plan to link the two projects is not something for which the developers alone can be held accountable. Nonetheless, the Dumbo plan will probably be opposed by many whose real grievance is with the city's failure to create a comprehensive waterfront plan.
This is an era of public-private partnerships in which the public sector has too often confined its role to issuing permits to the private sector. Many citizens are justified in concluding that it would be better to halt all private development until the city has put forward a comprehensive vision.
That would be a shame in this case. While the master plan must be rethought, the project has much to recommend it. Those who care about the state of architecture in New York will have reason to grieve if Mr. Nouvel's beautiful design falls victim to a failure of the political imagination.

Writing Songs (Sometimes Even for Real Instruments)

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF 

 BODY:
In a thoroughly memorable and rare New York performance, Tom Ze, a small, earthy, 62-year-old Brazilian, sometimes shouted his songs like a coffee shop radical on a conspiracy rant. Sometimes he cooed them like a doting grandmother, and sometimes he made brave stabs at the romantic samba crooning of the 1930's. He wasn't a graceful dancer: he crouched, moving like a puppet operated from the elbows. And for rhythmic effect he gargled water into the microphone.
He provoked an audience to wonder what made a man like this, and so he helpfully began his show at Irving Plaza on Wednesday night by singing about his birth. The song, "Nave Maria," details the exit from his mother's womb as if it were part of a nautical memoir, and ends on a note of alarm: "Gritei quando vi ja estava respirando," he sang. ("I screamed when I saw that I was already breathing.") 
 Since he first started writing songs in partnership with other members of Brazil's Tropicalia movement 35 years ago, Mr. Ze has never been popular, or even notorious in his own country. Underdog or alternative status doesn't command much attention there; generations and economic classes don't line up against each other over music. But in the United States, after a slowly building campaign through the 90's by David Byrne's label, Luaka Bop, he is understood: it's not hard to slot Mr. Ze into our museum of outsider geniuses, in a vitrine next to Captain Beefheart and Sun Ra.
Mr. Ze is funny, and he's an art-song maker, not a folk musician. But his rhythms are genuine and his sense of compositional form superb; the mistake is simply to think of him as a rootless oddball. Still, that may be what got him here. The other part of the attraction is that Mr. Ze is traveling the country with members of the popular underground rock band Tortoise as his backup group. The connection was made principally because the musicians in Tortoise are interested in all sorts of music, not because their slow-boil instrumentals have much to do with Mr. Ze's esthetic. When they appeared onstage together, Tortoise came all the way to Mr. Ze rather than the other way around; other than some new arrangements to accommodate vibraphone and keyboards, the band stuck to the sound of Mr. Ze's records.
Mr. Ze's songs are built on little rhythmic lines written for the guitar or the mandolinlike cavaquinho, and they amount to a gentle funk derived from northeastern Brazilian forro and the samba. A few are novelty pieces demanding an amusing coordination of the band, with tiny one-note contributions from each musician positioned one after the other. His lyrics experiment with phonemes, happy accidents of language, lessons from modern history and philosophy. One was an advertisement for his record, inspired by Thomas Edison's techniques of self-promotion.
But Mr. Ze isn't glib; he's an eager communicator. At one point he encouraged the crowd to sing an unrecognizable melody. Then he revealed that it was a harmonic inversion of the famous melody refrain from the Beatles' "Hey Jude." "I want to be in a partnership with you," he beamed. "I propose that we make a plagiarism from a well-known song."
Mr. Ze has a marvelous visual sense, which accelerated in the second half of the show: during one song he wore a jacket held together by Velcro seams, and slowly tore it all off as the tune became distraught. Toward the end of the set, he and the cavaquinho player, Jarbas Mariz, put on plastic suits and hard hats and beat out a tick-tock rhythm on each other's heads. As a finale, they started up two metal-buffers -- the machine that finishes the job when you get keys cut -- and used them to play agogo bells, making a kind of metal-shop carnival rhythm, with sparks flying in the darkness.

ASIA
 
JAPAN: MILITARY PACT APPROVED -- The upper house of Parliament approved contentious legislation strengthening military cooperation with Washington. The law will make it easier for Japan to back American military forces in any confrontation with North Korea or other military crises in the region. China, which has been nervous about steps to improve Japan-U.S. military ties, announced it was "deeply concerned" about the legislation. Nicholas D. Kristof (NYT) 

SOUTH KOREA: KIM PICKS NEW CABINET -- In the first major shuffle of his Cabinet since taking office in February 1998, President Kim Dae Jung, left, replaced 11 of his 18 ministers in a move seen as a sign that he is determined to push on with promised economic reforms and improve relations with North Korea. Lim Dong Won, 65, was named Unification Minister, replacing Kang In Duk. The new Economy and Finance Minister is Kang Bong Kyun. (Agence France-Presse)
 
PHILIPPINES: U.S. PACT PROTESTED -- About 200 protesters scuffled with riot policemen outside the U.S. Embassy in Manila, demonstrating against a pact that would allow large-scale U.S. military exercises in the Philippines. The activists, of the National Democratic Movement, destroyed a plastic cover protecting the U.S. Government seal at the embassy's entrance. The Philippine Senate will vote on the measure next week. (AP)
 
EAST TIMOR: U.N. SENDING POLICE AIDES -- Blaming anti-independence groups for violence in East Timor, Secretary General Kofi Annan said he was sending up to 280 U.N. civilian police advisers to the Indonesian territory. In a report to the Security Council on a U.N.-organized vote on the territory's future on Aug. 8, Mr. Annan said he was considering assigning military liaison officers to "maintain contact with their Indonesian counterparts." (Reuters)
 
EUROPE
 
BRITAIN: INFORMATION BILL INTRODUCED -- The Government introduced a delayed and diluted freedom of information bill that for the first time would give the public the right to records held by the police, government departments and local courts and agencies. A campaign promise of the two-year-old Labor Government, the measure exempted broad areas like commercial interests and public safety. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
ITALY: PREMIER SHRUGS OFF THREAT -- Four days after a Government adviser was killed by terrorists claiming to be members of the Red Brigades, the emblem of the extreme left-wing group, a five-pointed star, was found painted on the wall of Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema's rented apartment in southern Italy. Mr. D'Alema shrugged off its significance. "I think these are unpleasant aspects of the times we live in," he said. Alessandra Stanley (NYT)
 
CORSICA: 4 CONFESS TO ROLE IN SLAYING -- Four Corsican nationalists have confessed that they played a role in the 1998 killing of Claude Erignac, the top French official on the island, the police said. They said a fifth man, the suspected gunman, is still on the run. The announcement comes as Corsica is still in turmoil over the arrest earlier this month of Mr. Erignac's successor on charges of ordering illegal acts. Marlise Simons (NYT)
 
GEORGIA: PRESIDENT TELLS OF COUP PLOT -- President Eduard Shevardnadze said a plot probably intended to overthrow his entire leadership had been uncovered, and that the ringleaders were based in Russia. Government officials said a group of "highly dangerous criminals" had been detained for plotting to kill Mr. Shevardnadze, survivor of assassination attempts in 1995 and 1998. The officials said those under suspicion included a high-ranking army officer, but they refused to say how many people were involved. (Reuters)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
COLOMBIA: RIGHTISTS KIDNAP SENATOR -- Colombia's main right-wing paramilitary group has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of an opposition senator in Medellin. Senator Piedad Cordoba, head of the chamber's human rights commission, has been active in efforts to bring about peace talks with left-wing rebel groups. But in a statement, the right-wing leader said the senator had put herself "at the service of guerrilla diplomacy" and demanded that his group take part in the talks, scheduled to begin soon. Larry Rohter (NYT)
 
MEXICO: JAILED GENERAL MOVED -- A dissident army general serving a 28-year jail sentence has been transferred involuntarily from a military to a civilian prison. Gen. Jose Francisco Gallardo was convicted by a court martial last year of destruction and theft of army property, but Amnesty International and other human rights groups say he has been persecuted for criticizing the military. The officer's supporters suspect he was transferred to end any contacts with military prisoners. Julia Preston (NYT)
 
CAYMAN ISLANDS: FINANCIAL REVIEW ACCORD -- The Government has agreed to a U.N. review of its financial systems, scrutiny that islanders hope will dispel notions that the Caribbean banking powerhouse is a haven for drug lords and other criminals. Finance Minister George McCarthy said the islands, the fifth largest banking center in the world, would seek certification under the Offshore Initiative begun in March by the U.N. Global Program Against Money Laundering, the first offshore center to do so. (Reuters)
 
AFRICA
 
ETHIOPIA, ERITREA: NEW BATTLE CLAIMS -- Ethiopia and Eritrea each reported that their troops had killed hundreds and wounded thousands in a battle lasting for three or four days, near the Mereb River, on the western front of their border war. Each side, claiming victory, accused the other of having gone on the offensive. (Agence France-Presse)
 
SIERRA LEONE: SHAKY CEASE-FIRE BEGINS -- A cease-fire went into effect in Sierra Leone's civil war, with each side claiming early violations. The truce began with President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah telling the nation it was a risk worth taking for peace. But a West African force backing Mr. Kabbah, and the rebel leader Foday Sankoh, traded accusations of breaches on the eve of the start of substantive peace talks in Togo today. (Reuters)
 
MALAWI: VOTE SET FOR JUNE 15 -- General elections will be held on June 15, the cutoff date set by Parliament after the high court overruled the initial choice, May 25. Simon Kambalame, spokesman for the Electoral Commission running the presidential and parliamentary poll, said close to a record five million voters had registered for the second multi-party elections since independence from Britain in 1964. (Reuters)

LIBYA, EGYPT: MUBARAK VISITS QADDAFI -- President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt held talks with the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, during his first visit to Libya since U.N. sanctions against it were lifted last month, the Libyan state television said. The report, monitored in Tunis, said Mr. Mubarak went to Mr. Qaddafi's residence as part of what the Egyptian called "regular consultations and visits." (Reuters)
 
IRAN: TROOPS 'RECAPTURE' PORT -- Iranian troops wrapped up maneuvers near the Iraqi border by restaging the recapture of a major port during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, state television reported. It said the troops entered Khorramshahr, restaging the port's liberation in 1982 after a 19-month occupation by Iraqi forces, and held a memorial ceremony for the war dead at the city's main mosque. Television showed artillery and tanks pounding the mock enemy and launching what appeared to be an unmanned reconnaissance drone. (Reuters)

DRIVE AGAINST CHILD LABOR -- The International Labor Organization is expected to adopt a convention aimed at banning the worst forms of child labor. The pact would require countries signing on to take immediate action against slavery, forced labor, sexual exploitation, child trafficking and hazardous work involving children under 18. The U.N. agency estimates that in developing countries some 250 million children between 5 and 14 work, about half of them full-time. Elizabeth Olson (NYT)

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Price SteadiesFor 30-Year Treasuries

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices were little changed yesterday amid speculation that economic growth will slow enough to keep inflation tame.
"The scare of the last couple of months has created an opportunity" to buy, said Paul Van Kampen, who manages $1.3 billion in fixed-income securities at NCM Capital Management Group Inc. in Durham, N.C. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 3/32, to 92 27/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.76 percent from 5.75 percent on Friday.
Last week, bonds staged their best performance since January -- a stand-out in a year when yields for 30-year Treasuries have risen 65 hundredths of a percentage point -- after the Federal Reserve reaffirmed its vigilance on inflation by saying it is ready to raise rates if consumer prices rise too much.
While reassured by the Fed's change in stance, some investors say a rate increase may not ultimately be necessary.
"We don't think inflation is such a big issue," said Alan Day, who helps oversee about $4 billion at Stratevest Group in Burlington, Vt.
Today's consumer confidence report and Thursday's second estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product are expected to show that the economy, while still strong, is growing more moderately after eight years of expansion.
The reports could ease inflation concerns, which have been mounting since the Government's Consumer Price Index for April posted its biggest increase in almost nine years.
The gain in Treasuries were capped as some investors refrained from buying before the Government's sale of $15 billion of new two-year notes tomorrow.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.864	97.677	High Rate	4.49%	4.57%	Coupon Yield	4.48%	4.56%	Low Rate	4.39%	4.47%	Median Rate	4.48%	4.56%	Total applied for	$27,267,522	$28,330,987	Accepted	$11,487,522	$11,553,737	Noncompetitive	$1,315,006	$1,040,062	

Both issues are dated May 27, 1999. The three-month bills mature on Aug. 26, 1999, and the six-month bills mature on Nov. 26, 1999.

HEADLINE: Assault With a Fiscal Weapon;
As Swindlers Branch Out, Victims Want to Be Heard

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
Myrna Barzelatto knows that what happened to her is not, technically, a violent crime.
After all, she was simply swindled out of her life savings -- hundreds of thousands of dollars -- along with other New Yorkers who lost a total of at least $20 million. They thought they were investing in ultra-safe securities backed by banks and real estate; instead, they were victims of a long-running Ponzi scheme orchestrated by a man they had considered a friend. 
 As she describes the betrayals, her constant worries about money, another victim's loss of a house, all the marriages bruised and retirements postponed, Mrs. Barzelatto says the same thing over and over: "This is a violent crime."
And a small but growing group of people would like to see it treated that way. The victims' rights movement, which two decades ago began demanding recognition and help for those who have suffered from violent crimes, is now turning its attention to those injured by white-collar crime.
Their advocates have already succeeded in persuading Congress to allow money from a special fund for crime victims to be used to help those injured by economic crimes, and the first federally financed pilot programs began last year. These efforts are likely to be expanded in coming years because of the growing recognition of "just how devastating these crimes can be," said Kathryn M. Turman, acting director of the Office for Victims of Crime in the Justice Department.
And the victims themselves are becoming increasingly assertive. They have begun to insist on their right to participate in court proceedings by speaking when the criminals who stole their money are sentenced. And they are setting up self-help groups, including one in Los Angeles for people whose credit records have been ruined by charge-card thieves.
Fueling the movement to assist these victims is a surge in their numbers. For while violent crime has plummeted nationwide, white-collar crime against individuals has risen sharply, according to law enforcement officials.
The crimes range from securities frauds to sweepstakes schemes to identity theft -- using someone's Social Security number or other personal data to apply for credit cards, loans or even a fake driver's licenses.
"There are more swindles, more frauds," said Robert M. Morgenthau, the District Attorney in Manhattan. The strong economy and booming stock market help explain the trend, he said, adding, "Honey attracts bears."
New uses of technology, especially Americans' infatuation with the Internet, have contributed to a shift to defrauding individuals from defrauding institutions, like savings and loan associations or, as in the big insider trading cases, the overall stock market.
"One thing that has dramatically changed is the availability of mass technology that lets those with criminal motivations reach a much wider audience of victims," said James K. Robinson, Assistant Attorney General for the criminal division of the Justice Department.
While there are no government statistics on the incidence of financial crime, complaints to watchdog groups and regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission have jumped by 20 percent in two years. Last week, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that it was setting up a special complaint center for Internet fraud that would collect data and analyze trends.
In a survey of American households, almost 40 percent of respondents said they had been defrauded in some way in the last year, the National White-Collar Crime Center, a clearinghouse and training center for law enforcement groups, reported this month. Though most complained of consumer rip-offs like unnecessary auto repairs, dozens of the 1,169 who replied in the survey said they had lost money through Internet schemes, credit card fraud and investment swindles.
Groups and government agencies that help crime victims say they have been slow to respond to this flood in part because the victims themselves are often too embarrassed to come forward.
Jane Y. Kusic said she fell into a deep depression after she and her husband, a lawyer, invested in a Florida real estate development that turned out to be fake and cost investors about $100 million. While her experience prompted her to become a professional consultant on financial crimes, Ms. Kusic, who is based near Washington, points out that most people who lose big sums must put all their energy into trying to stay afloat financially.
Many victims of con men speak of the betrayal as the psychological equivalent of rape.
"I will never get over this -- it is far worse than a rape of the body," said one woman who said she was sexually assaulted at gunpoint earlier in her life, before losing her savings in the same scheme that entrapped Mrs. Barzelatto. "Every moment I'm reminded, every waking moment," said the woman, who spoke only on the condition that neither her name nor the amount of her losses be printed. After a lifetime of hard work, she said, she now worries about making the payments on her medical insurance.
Stories like this do not surprise those who counsel victims of financial crimes. "When I talk about how the impact can be as serious as with violent crime, some people's eyes glaze over, but I've had attempted suicides," said Debbie Deem, who manages the victims' assistance program for the United States Attorney in Los Angeles.
The victims of financial crimes are a diverse lot. Senior citizens often fall prey to telemarketing frauds, but people in their 30's and 40's complain most often that they have been defrauded over the Internet, according to the National Consumers League. And at least one Federal study suggests that young, well-educated people are the most likely to fall for swindles.
Nor are victims of financial crimes always well-to-do.
"If you are poor, and told you have won $1 million in the lottery, that's appealing to everyone," said Marta Sotomayor, executive director of the National Hispanic Council on Aging, which runs a fraud prevention program.
There are still few programs to help victims of economic crimes. That frustrates people like Lisa Curtis, the victims' advocate in the Denver District Attorney's office, which has one of the most active of such programs (one of its cases just led to a 96-year sentence for a man who ran a fraud ring).
"We're considered second-class citizens," Ms. Curtis said.
Slowly, government and private groups have begun to respond to the needs of these victims. Two years ago, Congress made the legal change to permit money in the Federal Crime Victims Fund to go to programs that help those injured by economic crimes, although the victims themselves cannot receive direct financial aid. Previously, this money could be used only to help those hurt by violent crime, though most of the money in the fund comes from fines paid by white-collar criminals.
The first federally financed programs after the Congressional change began last year. In October, the Office for Victims of Crime in the Justice Department released a video for Federal employees called "Victims of Fraud: Beyond Financial Loss" to show how devastated these lives are, Ms. Turman said.
The Justice Department is also financing some demonstration programs, like one run by the Oregon Division of Senior and Disabled Services that sends counselors to the homes of older people whose names turn up on "mooch lists" -- lists of people who have fallen for schemes in the past -- seized from illegal telemarketing operations.
On the private side, the California Public Research Interest Group helped Elsie Strong, a California businesswoman, set up a support group for victims of identity theft. Ms. Strong says it took her years to clear her credit record after someone took out five charge cards in her name, ran up big bills and stopped making payments.
And the National Center for Victims of Crime has set up a special association for lawyers who specialize in representing crime victims who turn to civil courts to try to recover money after they have been defrauded. The formation of the legal association alarms some prosecutors, who worry that it will encourage victims to sue them for not pursuing cases even when the evidence is weak. Just the process of having to notify all the victims in a big fraud case is an overwhelming undertaking, some complain.
Prosecutors lobbied successfully for the narrowing of a proposed constitutional amendment on victims' rights sponsored in the Senate by Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, and Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, to exclude victims of financial crimes.
The narrowing has caused a split among victims' rights groups, with some, like the National Center for Victims of Crimes, withdrawing their support for the amendment, said David Beatty, director of public policy for the center.
But the biggest dream for those who have suffered from financial crime is not a constitutional amendment; it is getting some money back, preferably from the people who stole from them. That seldom happens.
Judges do sometimes order people who are guilty of financial crimes to make restitution to their victims. Victim Services, a nonprofit agency that handles many of the restitution orders in New York City courts, is pushing prosecutors to ask for repayment more often, "because the sense of accountability is so important," said Paula A. Rogowsky, program director for the Brooklyn Criminal and Supreme Courts.
Even when repayment is ordered, victims usually collect only pennies on the dollar of what they are owed or get nothing at all. The perpetrators have frequently spent all the cash; in many cases, prosecutors suspect, they have hidden the assets. Some try to use bankruptcy protection to make it harder for their victims to collect anything.
"What we were finding is that by the time we get there, there is nothing left," said Melinda L. Haag, deputy chief of the general crimes section in the Office of the United States Attorney in San Francisco. Ms. Haag directs a pilot program that tries to deal with this problem by assigning fraud investigators to track the assets of suspected perpetrators before they are indicted.
Though the program is only a few months old, it is already attracting the attention of people like Mary Jo White, the United States Attorney in Manhattan, who prosecutes hundreds of white-collar criminals a year. She supervised the case against Gerald P. Hirsch, who pleaded guilty to six counts of mail fraud in the scheme that victimized Myrna Barzelatto and faces a prison term of about four to six years.
Ms. White hopes to meet with fellow prosecutors to explore ways of improving restitution to victims of financial crimes. Getting money back, she said, "will make them feel better than anything."
Mrs. Barzelatto would agree. From her home in White Plains, she is helping to organize her fellow victims, who hope to speak at the July sentencing of Mr. Hirsch. While she hopes he gets the longest possible sentence as a just punishment for all the harm he has caused, she said, "I'd be very happy to let this guy go free if it would let me have my money back."

A few notable white collar criminals of yore.
 
Charles Ponzi
An Italian immigrant to the United States, he popularized a pyramid scheme shortly after World War I in which he swindled $15 million from 40,000 people who thought they were investing in postal reply coupons. In fact, Mr. Ponzi was pocketing most of the money, paying early investors with cash from new investors. After spending 10 years in prison, he was deported to Italy, worked for an airline that failed, and ultimately died as a pauper in Rio de Janeiro in 1949.
 
Robert L. Vesco
Mr. Vesco, with 41 others, was charged by the S.E.C. in 1972 with the misappropriation of $224 million from four Swiss-based mutual funds, then the largest financial fraud in history. He fled the United States to avoid prosecution but is serving a 13-year sentence in Cuba, where he was convicted in 1996 for bilking investors with an unproven drug to fight cancer and arthritis.
 
Ivar Kreuger
The son of a Swedish match manufacturer, Mr. Kreuger parlayed earnings from the match business into a worldwide financial empire using persuasion, deception, forgery, and a tangle of interlocking holding companies. When he committed suicide in 1932, his empire collapsed, leaving thousands of investors with a total of $585 million in claims that could not be redeemed.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
An Argentine 'Domino Effect' on Brazilian Stocks

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, May 24

 BODY:
When news of pressure on the Argentine peso started to scroll down the computer screens on trading floors here last week, traders mainly chuckled, stoking the historic rivalry between Brazil and its neighbor to the south.
They're not chuckling anymore. 
 The Bovespa stock index for the Sao Paulo stock exchange plunged nearly 4.89 percent today, its largest one-day percentage drop since the country's currency devaluation crisis in mid-January, as concern over Argentina's economic policies pushed the index to its lowest level in nearly a month. The decline was deeper than similar drops in stock markets in other Latin American countries, Argentina included. Worries over the return of a small tax on foreign investment in Brazilian securities and of higher interest rates in the Unites States contributed to the decline.
The pullback in the market, mainly because of factors abroad beyond the control of Brazilian policy makers, is denting a newly found optimism among investors, though it is not a surprise. In a conundrum that has often applied to Brazil in recent years, the country has often been among the first to pay for bad news coming from other emerging markets, or the United States, the largest source of Brazil's foreign investment.
This phenomenon is mainly a result of the size of Brazil, Latin America's largest country, and the relative sophistication of its financial system. Because there are so many Brazilian stocks and bonds in comparison with other developing countries, and because these securities are the most liquid, they are often the first to be sold.
"The domino effect is back," said Marcelo Cestari, the chief equities trader at Banco Mercantil do Brasil. "Everything seems negative again and there doesn't seem much we can do about it."
Oddly, the decline in markets here came on a day when the economy received a vote of confidence. Brazil abandoned a plan to swap billions of dollars of corporate debt for less risky securities supported by the Government, because investors shunned the transaction.
Although the scrapping of the deal is not positive for Goldman, Sachs & Company, the investment bank that designed it, it is positive as a measurement of restored faith in Brazil among foreign investors. The main reason for the swap not going forward is a general perception among investors that the chances are minimal for a wave of corporate bond defaults.
"There was a moment when panic reigned and people would have taken anything for Brazilian bonds," said Jonathan Binder, the senior investment strategist at Americas Trust Bank, a Miami-based institution with a varied portfolio of Brazilian debt. If the transaction engineered by Goldman, Sachs had been introduced a few months ago, in the aftermath of the currency devaluation in mid-January, Mr. Binder said, it might have succeeded.
Investors agreed to exchange only about $680 million of an eligible $19.6 billion of foreign debt issued by Brazilian companies for securities sold by an offshore company linked to the country's development bank. That was shy of the $1 billion bankers deemed necessary for the transaction to proceed. At the end of last week, officials from the development bank, known by its initials B.N.D.E.S., said they were confident of swapping at least $2 billion.
At any rate, the Government's aim with the deal, which was to ease Brazilian borrowing, is slowly materializing. A few top-tier banks like Banco Bradesco and Banco Itau have succeeded in refinancing their own borrowings in international markets. These institutions, in turn, have begun lending again to large corporate clients.
With overnight interest rates still high, though, at 23.5 percent, such financing does not come cheap. Even Brazil's largest companies pay an estimated 27 percent domestically on a one-year loan, compared with a rate of roughly half that amount if the financing were secured in more liquid international borrowing markets.
Yet with investors betting that most Brazilian companies will find a way to honor their obligations, the bond swap, although scrapped on paper, may have succeeded psychologically. "The deal calmed markets by showing that Government support was there," said Mr. Binder of Americas Trust Bank.
Such support is not a novelty. For several companies facing debt difficulties earlier this year, like the railroad MRS Logistica, the Government stepped in and engineered subtle bailouts through the use of pension funds for state-controlled companies and state-controlled banks.
"There somehow seems to be this intervention and problems are resolved," said Anne Milne, the head of emerging markets debt research at ING Barings in New York. She compared this strategy to that of neighboring Argentina, where the Government has done little to help.
So far this year, there have been six Argentine debt defaults, compared with two in Brazil.

Steelmaker Shares Plunge MEXICO CITY, May 24 (Dow Jones) -- Shares of Altos Hornos de Mexico S.A., Mexico's biggest steel maker, fell 29 percent today in extremely heavy trading as a major creditor sold its stock in the company, which had been held as collateral on unpaid loans.
Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival S.A. said in a statement that it took the action after several attempts to reach a repayment agreement failed.
Altos Hornos, known by its Mexican acronym Ahmsa, owes Grupo Financiero Banamex's bank division a total of $132.9 million. Ahmsa's total debt is estimated to be around $1.9 billion.
Financial pressure on the steelmaker has intensified in recent months as its unpaid debts have grown and steel prices have languished. Speculation has grown that the company would be sold or seek court protection from creditors.
Last month the company disclosed that it had missed a $39 million loan payment due April 16 and a $24.7 million payment due April 30. It owes $530 million in the next 12 months. Early this month Standard & Poor's lowered its credit rating on Altos Hornos from CC to D, the lowest possible.
Ahmsa shares closed down 86 centavos, to 2.45 pesos, or about 26 cents, on the Mexican stock exchange, and the selling contributed to a nervous mood in Latin American markets that pushed Mexico's main stock index down 2.5 percent. Nearly 75 million shares of Ahmsa were traded, half the exchange's volume.

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT: SUPREME COURT ROUNDUP;
Justices, 9-0, Find No Inherent Conflict Between 2 Laws on Disabled Workers

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
The Supreme Court today examined two Federal laws aimed at protecting disabled workers and concluded that contrary to a lower court's view, there was no inevitable conflict between them.
One was the Social Security Act, which provides benefits to people whose disabilities are so severe that they cannot "engage in any substantial gainful activity" for at least 12 months. The other was the Americans With Disabilities Act, which protects disabled workers from discrimination as long as they can perform their jobs' essential functions, with "reasonable accommodation" if necessary. 
 Some lower courts have ruled that because someone who has applied for or received Social Security disability benefits is by definition unfit for employment, such a person is either barred from suing for disability discrimination or faces special judicial hurdles in pursuing a disability lawsuit.
In a unanimous opinion today by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, the Court disagreed. The two laws appear "divergent," Justice Breyer said, but in context, they "do not inherently conflict" and "can comfortably exist side by side." He said the Social Security program, receiving more than 2.5 million claims for benefits every year, necessarily made broad determinations without a fine-tuned examination of an individual's situation -- for example, whether employees who cannot work without accommodations can return to work if their special needs are addressed.
The decision overturned a judgment won by a company that had dismissed a woman who tried to come back to work after a stroke. The employer would not give her the extra time and training she said she needed. She applied for and received Social Security benefits, at the same time suing the employer for failing to accommodate her under the Americans With Disabilities Act.
In ruling for the employer, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, held that the application for or receipt of Social Security disability benefits had created the presumption that a worker was not entitled to bring a discrimination suit against the employer. Only in "some limited and highly unusual set of circumstances" could the two laws not be seen as "mutually exclusive," the appeals court said.
In his opinion today, Cleveland v. Policy Management Systems Corporation, No. 97-1008, Justice Breyer said it was common in the legal system for people to pursue two alternative theories at once. To the extent that there was any apparent inconsistency in the disability context, he said, courts should not erect special burdens but should simply require the plaintiff to explain. He indicated that the explanation could be as simple as a medical condition that has changed over time. The case now goes back to the lower courts to give the plaintiff, Carolyn C. Cleveland, a second chance at her discrimination suit.
Beatrice Dohrn, legal director of the Lambda Legal Defense Fund, a gay rights organization that filed a brief in the case, said the decision could be particularly beneficial to people with the virus that causes AIDS. With drug therapy, Ms. Dohrn said, people with H.I.V. often "move in and out of being able to work" and often face discrimination when they do work. The decision, she said, "broke down a barrier that people with H.I.V. needed to get past."
The Court's other rulings today included these:
 
Nonprofit Groups
 The Court ruled unanimously that the Federal Trade Commission had jurisdiction to prevent certain nonprofit organizations, in this case a state dental association, from engaging in unfair competition or deceptive practices.
The Federal Trade Commission Act, which dates to 1914, gives the commission authority over the business practices of "persons, partnerships or corporations," with a corporation defined as an organization "which is organized to carry on business for its own profit or that of its members."
In this case, the trade commission found that the 19,000-member California dental association had unreasonably restricted trade by strictly limiting the types of advertising dentists could use. The nonprofit association challenged both the commission's jurisdiction and its findings, both of which were upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco.
In an opinion by Justice David H. Souter, the Court today agreed on the jurisdictional question. Justice Souter said it was sufficient that members received economic benefits from the association, like favorable insurance rates as well as lobbying, public relations and other activities.
But, Justice Souter said, the Court of Appeals made too cursory an analysis of the advertising restrictions before concluding that they had an anti-competitive effect. The case, California Dental Association v. F.T.C., No. 97-1625, was sent back to the appeals court for a new, more searching analysis.
The vote on that section of the opinion was 5 to 4. Justice Breyer, joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Anthony M. Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, said the Court of Appeals had properly found that the restrictions on advertising prices and quality claims had deprived consumers of useful information.
 
Property Rights
 The Court ruled, 5 to 4, that a property owner suing a local government for depriving him of his right to develop his property is entitled to have the case tried by a jury rather than solely by a judge.
The decision, City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes, No. 97-1235, affirmed a ruling by the Ninth Circuit and was a victory for developers, who view juries as more sympathetic than judges in this type of case. The developer in this case spent years trying to get permission to build houses on 37 acres of ocean-front property in California, eventually winning a $1.45 million award from a jury on the claim that the protracted proceedings violated its constitutional right to due process.
Justice Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, which was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and by Justices Stevens, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.

 BODY:
Like her late brother Gianni, Donatella Versace is no shrinking violet when it comes to revealing the more sensational aspects of her public life. Ask her about her diamonds, her famous friends or the time she flew a New York hairdresser to Milan to give her and Naomi Campbell extensions while they ate spaghetti in Ms. Versace's marble bathroom, and she will tell all.
The corn-haired Ms. Versace, who assumed creative control of the $560 million Versace fashion empire after her brother's murder in 1997, is similarly candid about her family's complex relations. When asked in March about a rift between her and Antonio D'Amico, Mr. Versace's companion of many years, she replied: "My relationship with Antonio is exactly as it was when Gianni was alive. I respected him as the boyfriend of my brother, but I never liked him as a person." Ms. Versace smiled. "So the relationship stayed the same." 
 But as with even the most public personalities, there are apparently limits to what Ms. Versace and her other brother, Santo, the oldest of the three Calabrian-born siblings and the company's chief executive, want revealed about their family and business -- and by whom. Last week in New York, lawyers for the Versaces effectively stopped the publication of a controversial biography that would have depicted Mr. Versace as a colossal talent who, behind the glamorous facade of palatial homes and celebrity-filled fashion shows, bullied employees and berated journalists who wrote unflattering reviews of his collections.
Along with depictions of promiscuity on the part of the designer, the book, which was in galley form and set for publication on July 1, also painted an unflattering picture of the life styles of the surviving siblings. It was this latter material that apparently prompted the threat of legal action.
Canceling a book so near its release date is not all that rare, but in the case of "Undressed: The Life and Times of Gianni Versace," an unauthorized biography by Christopher Mason, the decision by Little, Brown raises questions about the kinds of pressure, legal and otherwise, that a powerful fashion house can bring to bear on a publisher, an author and his sources.
Mr. Mason maintains that in their effort to stop his book, representatives for the Versaces got in contact with people whom he had interviewed and tried to convince them to recant their statements, in some cases, he said, offering legal documents for them to sign.
Just why Little, Brown, a division of Time Warner, halted publication is not clear. Michael Pietsch, the editor in chief (and Mr. Mason's editor), declined to comment, and referred questions to a spokeswoman. In a brief statement, she said, "In mid-March, we received letters" from the Versace attorneys "threatening legal action." She added that the publisher "agreed with Christopher Mason that it could not be published in its present form, and he withdrew it." She also said that because the book had been postponed once, last July, and thus had appeared twice in Little, Brown's sales catalogue, the publisher was opposed to another delay that could diminish interest in the book. "It would be impossible for Little, Brown to sell the book yet again," the spokeswoman said.
The Versaces, through their press agents, Ed Filapowski in New York and Emanuela Schmeidler in Milan, said that they were satisfied with the decision by Little, Brown to kill the book, which they said they had opposed from the outset.
When it was announced by Little, Brown on the day that Mr. Versace died that Mr. Mason had been signed to write a biography, to the grieving Versaces the author appeared to be an opportunist. The family have said they further resented the inference that Mr. Mason -- a freelance writer of style and architectural articles for a number of publications, including The New York Times -- was a close friend of the designer (all agree that they had met only a few times, in 1997).
Mr. Mason was shunned by the Versaces, and Mr. Filapowski said that his firm sent letters to potential sources asking them not to cooperate with him.
To make matters worse, at least for Mr. Mason, who accepted a six-figure advance, he had agreed to complete the biography in six months, and he was unable to do so, which is why the book was shelved the first time.
Two months ago, after bound galleys of Mr. Mason's manuscript had been sent to magazine editors for review, a report appeared in The New York Post saying that the author had hired ghost writers to draft chapters of his book. The suggestion that not all the reporting was his own seemed to be another strike against Mr. Mason's credibility. Mr. Mason said that it was the suggestion of editors that he employ ghost writers, though he said that most of that material was scrapped with the first draft.
On Monday, Mr. Filapowski said: "It is apparent that Little, Brown lost confidence in this manuscript. The manuscript is full of inaccuracies and misrepresentations and clearly could not be salvaged. We did what anyone else would do under the circumstances, which is to defend ourselves and our name."
From Milan, Ms. Schmeidler added that the objections of the Versaces were not based on unflattering depictions of the family, but rather on the veracity of Mr. Mason's reporting. "It's not about a good biography or a bad biography," she said. "It's about a serious biography."
But Mr. Mason and people familiar with the legal discussions that took place say that Little, Brown's decision to cancel the book had little, if anything, to do with the veracity of the reporting.
Beginning last December, Mr. Mason's manuscript went through an extensive legal review, he said, and again in early spring when attorneys for the Versaces threatened to take legal action if changes were not made.
A number of changes were made, Mr. Mason said, though some of the most unflattering material passed the initial scrutiny of Little, Brown's lawyers. "I felt completely confident about my reporting, and I had substantial documentation," Mr. Mason said. "I felt, sure, we were having problems, but they could be easily surmounted."
At the same time, Mr. Mason said, he began to receive "terrifying, whithering" phone calls from sources, about 10 in all, who he said told him they had been reached by the Versace attorneys or family representatives and told that they could face legal action if they didn't recant statements they had made to Mr. Mason.
"They were obviously extremely scared," said Mr. Mason, who on the advice of his own lawyer declined to give their names. "I certainly got the feeling that a lot of people were intimidated by the implications of talking to me for this book."
Mr. Filapowski denied that there were any attempts to intimidate sources.
Mr. Mason acknowledged that his project had been dogged by problems from the start. It had been his intention to ask Mr. Versace, whom he visited in Miami in the spring of 1997 after writing an article about his New York town house for The Times, to collaborate on a book. He had planned to see Mr. Versace in August at his home near Lake Como, in Italy, and was drafting a proposal when the designer was killed. "If he hadn't been interested, frankly, I don't know whether I would have done the book," Mr. Mason said.
Against his better judgment, he said, he agreed to write "Undressed" in six months. "I have to admit, you know, to a certain amount of a naivete in this," he continued. "Obviously, I wanted to do an extremely thorough, thoughtful, balanced, scrupulously researched account of Gianni's life. No one can do a book in six months."
Mr. Mason may have been out of his depths in other ways. Without a deep knowledge of the idiosyncratic fashion world, and because the Versaces effectively closed off access to many of the primary sources who could have given him greater insight into the family, Mr. Mason's perceptions may not have been fully informed. For instance, he seemed surprised when told of Donatella Versace's comment about Mr. D'Amico, which is typical of her brusqueness. "I'm amazed to hear her say that," he said.
Yet, after everything he has been through, he has at least seen one reality of the fashion business. "Image is so important to a fashion house," he said. "For the Versaces, I'm sure, it's an economic decision. I don't think it's just vanity. It's a giant commercial decision. It's business."
In recent years, the Versaces have successfully sued several British publications for libel, winning in court or settling for damages and a public apology.
Mr. Mason's publisher, despite canceling his contract, paid his advance in full, freeing him to sell the book elsewhere.
He added, sounding fatalistic: "They've won, basically. The book isn't coming out. They won."

HEADLINE: New King of Jordan Asserts Syria Wants Peace With Israel

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
King Abdullah of Jordan, ending his first visit to America since ascending the throne, said yesterday that he believed that Syria was now ready to make peace with Israel and that once Israel's new Government was installed, there would be "quick movement" toward peace.
But, he added, the key to a stable, peaceful and prosperous Middle East remained in reinforcing peace between Israel and its Palestinian neighbors. 
 "To have peace with Syria at the expense of Israelis and Palestinians without having their problems solved will only create more of a difficulty," the King warned.
The 37-year-old King discussed the need for peace and economic development in the region and at home in Jordan in a meeting with the editorial board of The New York Times. He spoke on his second day of a visit to New York and the final day of his 10-day trip to the United States.
Saying he was was "very happy" with the election results in Israel, in which the Labor Party leader, Ehud Barak, scored an impressive victory, the King said that the contest was not just an election of an individual, but a referendum on whether Israel should continue the peace process. "This is a new beginning," he said.
While the Syrian leader, Hafez al-Assad, had resisted many previous peace overtures from Israel, the atmosphere in Damascus had changed, King Abdullah asserted. "I think Syria realizes that it's missed the boat on several occasions and now here's an opportunity to start again," the King said. "And I don't think that another opportunity will come up again."
During his recent visit to Damascus, he said, Syria was "particularly forthcoming" in its desire to move forward with Israel, as were other Arab states. "The Arab world wants peace with Israel," King Abdullah declared.
When he was asked whether General Barak would give back to Syria the Golan Heights, which Israel has occupied since the 1967 war, the King said he usually replied to that question with a question: "Isn't it better to give up the Golan and conquer the rest of the Arab world? You give up on one side but there is so much to gain on the other."
At the same time, he added, while it was easy to seek a "quick fix, or a quick reward" by concentrating on Syria at the expense of the Israeli-Palestinian issue, focus had to be maintained on resolving the "original" conflict, he said. "You can very easily be blinded by the prize that a Syria-Israeli peace might afford and forget about the original problem," he said.
In an impassioned appeal shortly before he headed back to his capital, Amman, the King also urged the United States and its NATO allies to stay the course in Kosovo and insure that the refugees can return to their homes.
"You are doing this not just for Kosovo; you're doing this for the world," said the King, who has spent the last 10 days seeking economic help for his country and political support in Washington and New York.
Much depends on how the Balkans conflict is resolved, he said. Today and earlier in his visit, he said that how the conflict in Kosovo ended would be an indicator of American resolve throughout the world and would "set the rules" for other conflicts.
Since becoming King in February after the death of his father, King Hussein, who had been much admired in Washington, King Abdullah has tried to ease tensions with countries with which Jordan has had occasionally tense relations, including Syria and Iran.
President Mohammad Khatami of Iran, King Abdullah said, had "time on his side" and was "breaking down barriers" and creating a "sense of hope for the moderates." But, he added, toning down some of his earlier optimism about his turbulent region, moderating Iran "might take a very long time."
The young King, who was raised largely in England and who was partly schooled in the United States, comfortably fielded often skeptical questions at meetings yesterday and today with Jewish organizations, policy groups and the news media. Reiterating his view that economic development was key to a politically stable, peaceful region, he vowed that Jordan would reform and liberalize its economy to attract foreign and domestic investment within two years.
He seemed to have succeeded in winning many American hearts and minds, and was hopeful that he had made some progress in securing the debt relief which he said Jordan desperately needed. "This is our one big chance," he said.
After a dinner on Sunday night, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, who spent years mediating peace agreements between Arabs and Israelis, said he was "very favorably impressed" by King Abdullah, who he said exhibited "a certain strategic sense."
Melvin Salberg, the chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, with whom the King met yesterday morning, said King Abdullah was a "very open, direct person who I'm certain will advance peace." And, Mr. Salberg added, "I believe he's tough enough."

Old Masters' Voice Is in 6 Languages
How do you tell the world that the voice of the Met is announcing that there will be a lot more of the voice at the Met? 
 Why, send out talking invitations featuring -- What else? -- the voice of the Met, a k a PHILIPPE DE MONTEBELLO, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the baritone who has guided more than 70 audio tours in the last 20 years.
Roughly 500 invitations with miniature audio units were mailed to the usual media suspects. When the cards were opened, the voice declared, "Welcome to the 'Key to the Met,' the Metropolitan's comprehensive Audio Guide program. . . ."
Nearly 60 reporters went to the museum yesterday to hear Mr. de Montebello, live and in person, as he voiced his pleasure at the Met's new digital CD-ROM audio guide, which will interpret the collections in six languages. He recorded in five (English, French, Spanish, Italian and German) but not Japanese.
The talking invitations "got the Met a nice turnout," said MICHAEL R. BLOOMBERG, a museum trustee and the chief executive of Bloomberg L.P., the company that provided the recording studio where Mr. de Montebello taped the greeting heard in the invitations. Mr. Bloomberg not only paid for the talking cards at $5 apiece, but also underwrote the new audio-guide program with a $5 million donation.
His was not the only voice raised in support of the voice and its drawing power.
Mr. de Montebello's voice "is an incredible instrument," said Fran Reiter, president of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau. "Maybe it should be landmarked."
 
Personal Days For a Royal Friend
RUTHIE HENSHALL, the actress who takes over the role of the murderous vaudevillian Velma Kelly in the Broadway musical "Chicago" tonight, insisted on three days off in June. She wants to attend Prince Edward's wedding to SOPHIE RHYS-JONES on June 18.
"He's a great friend of mine," she said, "so I wouldn't miss it for the world. When you love somebody as a friend, you're happy for them when they find happiness."
And no, she is not sorry that someone else will be walking down the aisle. "I wouldn't want that job," she said, sounding as if being a royal-by-marriage was as much about employment as romance. "I like my freedom too much. I like being able to do what I like to do."
One thing she does not like to do is watch television in this country. "I find it so irritating, all your adverts," she said. "I don't want to watch a film and be interrupted for 20 adverts that get louder."
 
Hostility in Beijing
"Almost no one in China believes it was a mistake," JULIA CHANG BLOCH, the executive vice chairwoman of the American Studies Center at Beijing University, said of the May 7 bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
Ms. Bloch, in a talk at a Manhattan law firm on Friday, said that she had spoken with more than 100 Chinese since the bombing. "Only two believe it was a mistake," and neither of those were students, she said. The others, she said, "believe it was planned to test Chinese reaction, to destabilize China's rise as an economic power -- and that we're in Yugoslavia not to stop ethnic cleansing but to expand our global reach and that the bombing was to distract from the Kosovo peace process."
She also said that after the embassy bombing, some Americans prevaricated when taxi drivers asked if they were from the United States: "They say, 'No, I'm an Italian.' 'I'm a German.' "

New Giuliani Fund-Raiser and Her Handler

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
LAURA VAN HOVE, the new 32-year-old finance director for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's
likely Senate campaign, is considered such a pro that the Mayor's people are constantly saying how pleased they are to have her, etc. After all, she grew up in Iowa, where Presidential candidates turn up like corn borers, and where she met Bob Dole and the elder George Bush while she was at Iowa State. Since then, Ms. Van Hove has raised money for the 1996 Presidential race of Bob Dole, the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Pennsylvania Republican Party. She has also worked for three Senate campaigns.
But talking with her last week was a challenge due to the concerned presence of Bruce Teitelbaum, the Mayor's former chief of staff and now the executive director of Solutions America, Mr. Giuliani's main political action committee.
Mr. Teitelbaum sat in on the interview with Ms. Van Hove, in a conference room at the Solutions America office near City Hall, but did more talking than sitting. 
 "Can I just make an observation?" Mr. Teitelbaum said, minutes into the interview, before Ms. Van Hove had a chance to answer a question about Mr. Giuliani's big fund-raising dinner tonight, the unofficial opening of his anticipated Senate campaign. "I'm just going to interject."
Mr. Teitelbaum then said it is "infinitely more difficult" to raise money under the $1,000-per-person Federal election limits of a Senate campaign than it was under the individual limits of $7,700 in a Mayor's race.So far, Mr. Teitelbaum said, Mr. Giuliani has raised $743,000 for a potential Senate campaign that would require at least $10 million against his likely opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton. But tonight's dinner -- Georgette Mosbacher, Donald Trump, Linda J. Wachner and various city real estate interests are on the committee -- is expected to reap more than $1 million.
"We definitely expect to have more than 1,000 people at this dinner," Mr. Teitelbaum said.
But they still need to raise $9 million more, no?
At this point, Ms. Van Hove managed to get a word in edgewise. "The election isn't until November of 2000," she pointed out.
Mr. Teitelbaum then said that once Mr. Giuliani formally announced for the Senate, "it'll be easier." He said that Mrs. Clinton's potential candidacy had not hurt and might be helping fund-raising, and that Ms. Van Hove, who replaces two finance directors deemed inadequate by the Mayor's underlings, has been in place only since March. "We planned this dinner a week or two after she started, and the fact that she's not from New York, and wasn't that familiar with the terrain here, that put us at a certain disadvantage," Mr. Teitelbaum said. "But I think we've been able to overcome that."
Ms. Van Hove, who has blond hair, wore a red suit and remained poised and calm throughout the interview, was raised on a 450-acre farm in Iowa, where her family grew soybeans, corn and oats and raised cattle and hogs.
"It's very similar to Brooklyn," said Mr. Teitelbaum, who has brown hair and ate two bananas during the interview.
Mr. Teitelbaum managed to remain quiet while Ms. Van Hove recounted her pre-Giuliani past.
SHE went to Forest City High School, where she was a nun in "The Sound of Music," played the saxophone and piano, sang in the choir and competed on the speech team. She was 13 when Ronald Reagan made his first Presidential campaign trip to Iowa, in 1980, and she thinks her parents may have met him at a political meeting. She was too young to go, but watched the televised caucus circus every night.
At Iowa State, she majored in political science and economics, graduated in 1989, then went to work for the unsuccessful Senate campaigns of Tom Tauke, who ran against Tom Harkin in Iowa in 1990, and Jan Stoney, who challenged Bob Kerrey in Nebraska in 1994. In between she was the finance director of the successful re-election campaign of Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa. After the 1996 Dole race, she raised money from big donors for the Republicans, then for Steve Forbes, who plans a second run for President.
The Mayor's people liked Ms. Van Hove in part because of her experience with national Republicans, whose money they want to harvest for the Senate run.
Ms. Van Hove said she heard about the job with Mr. Giuliani through a friend from Mr. Dole's campaign. In February, she called Cristyne F. Lategano, the Mayor's communications director, who directed her to Mr. Teitelbaum. After an interview with the Mayor, Ms. Van Hove had the job, which she considers potentially more interesting than working in a Presidential campaign, particularly if Mrs. Clinton is in the race.
"I personally think she would be a great person to run against," she said.
Why?
"Because I think potentially,
ah ----."
Mr. Teitelbaum jumped in. "The reason I think it would be an interesting race, you could not get two people who are more polar opposites," he said. At another point, Mr. Teitelbaum spoke up as he was scribbling something.
"I'm making notes for you to do later," he said to Ms. Van Hove.
Ms. Van Hove glanced at the scratches.
"It's taken care of," she said.

NATO Bombs Disrupt Serbs' Water and Power
NATO warplanes hit electrical power transformers throughout Serbia in an effort to cut off the Yugoslav military's communication and supply links to Kosovo, according to Pentagon and NATO officials. But the attacks also had what the officials said was the unintended effect of disrupting water service to civilians, because the pumping system uses electrical power. A16
 
American and NATO officials said President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia was using money in Cyprus bank accounts and barges that come from Ukraine through Bulgaria and Romania to get oil. A17 

More than 10,000 ethnic Albanians fled from Kosovo into Macedonia overnight in the largest one-day exodus in three weeks. The rate of the expulsions suggested that Serbian forces might be making a final push to drive all ethic Albanians from Pristina, the provincial capital. A17
 
Gandhi to Lead Congress Party
Sonia Gandhi sent word to the Congress Party of India that she would lead them once again. An emergency meeting of party members, which had been called to try to woo her back, is now likely to turn into a coronation of Mrs. Gandhi as the party's unquestioned leader and its candidate for prime minister.

Schools Can Be Held Liable For Students' Harassment
The Supreme Court ruled, 5 to 4, that school districts could be liable for damages under Federal law for failing to stop a student from subjecting another to severe and pervasive sexual harassment. A1
 
The Court ruled unanimously that the police violate "the right of residential privacy at the core of the Fourth Amendment" when they take journalists and photographers into homes to witness searches or arrests. The ruling does not apply to situations in which journalists ride along with the police to report on activity in public places. A25
 
The Court said there was no inevitable conflict between the Social Security Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act in their efforts to protect disabled workers. A24
 
Drug Agency Chief to Retire
Thomas A. Constantine, 60, abruptly announced that he would step down as Administrator of the D.E.A., which he has led since 1994. Though he has sometimes forcefully disagreed with the Clinton Administration's favorable portrayal of Mexican cooperation in fighting drugs, Mr. Constantine said his decision was not motivated by political considerations.

Marshall Plan for Serbia

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "A Just and Necessary War" (Op-Ed, May 23): President Clinton's remarks that the European Union and the United States "must do for southeastern Europe what we did for Western Europe" after World War II intimate that he will lead a Marshall Plan to rebuild the Balkans' industry and social fabric. 
 Just as the Versailles austerity led to the German depression and the Nazis' popularity, Serbia's depression has excited ethnic hatred and Slobodan Milosevic's rise. Serbia's hyperinflation of the early 90's was worse than Weimar Germany's. The resulting angst has overflowed into crime, hedonism and the rhetoric of hate.

HEADLINE: Board Denies Bid by Doctors in New Jersey to Unionize

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
In a setback to doctors' efforts to unionize, the National Labor Relations Board's regional office in Philadelphia ruled yesterday that more than 500 New Jersey doctors working for a health maintenance organization were independent contractors -- not employees -- and therefore could not form a union.
As labor unions have sought to persuade thousands of doctors nationwide to unionize, the New Jersey case was widely viewed as an important test case because it concerned whether doctors contracting with an H.M.O. should be considered employees and thus have the right to form unions. 
 This was the second time that the doctors had made their case to the labor board's Philadelphia branch. But last August, after the local board rejected the doctors' arguments, the national board overturned that ruling and ordered a hearing to get a "fuller picture" of the relationships between doctors and H.M.O.'s. It was the first time the board had heard testimony on the issue.
The union the doctors sought to join, the United Food and Commercial Workers, argued that the doctors were employees of the H.M.O., the Amerihealth Corporation of New Jersey, because Amerihealth controlled many of the details of their work, such as the maximum wait for patients, the size of their waiting room and whether patients should undergo surgery.
Rejecting the union's argument, the labor board's regional director, Dorothy L. Moore-Duncan, concluded that the doctors were independent businessmen because they ran their own practices, were free to contract with other H.M.O.'s and worked at their own offices. In addition, she noted that Amerihealth had little control over the doctors because its patients represented just a small fraction -- normally 4 percent -- of their overall practices.
"The physicians lack the close economic relations and integration with Amerihealth that would support a finding of employee status," she wrote.
With yesterday's decision, Ms. Moore-Duncan rejected a petition by Local 56 of the United Food and Commercial Workers to hold an election in which 515 primary care physicians and specialists in Atlantic and Cape May Counties were to vote on whether to join the union.
Robert F. O'Brien, the union's lawyer, said the union was still debating whether to appeal the decision to the labor board's main office in Washington.
"The decision contains pages and pages of facts that strongly point to these doctors' employee status," Mr. O'Brien said, "but then it wrongly concludes that they're entrepreneurs, which flies in the face of the evidence."
Several officials from other unions said the Amerihealth doctors' situation represented an unfavorable set of circumstances for a test case. These officials said unions would have been better off to have asked the national labor board to examine a case involving an H.M.O. that maintained far more control over their doctors than Amerihealth did and accounted for far more -- perhaps 50 percent -- of the doctors' caseload.
G. Fred DiBona Jr., chairman of Amerihealth, said in a statement that yesterday's ruling "clarifies a question of considerable importance."
"The N.L.R.B. decision agrees with virtually every point we have made over the past 18 months," Mr. DiBona said, "including the facts the doctors own their own businesses, compete with each other, contract with a large number of insurers, make their own hours and are the sole beneficiaries of their successes."
But the United Food and Commercial Workers repeatedly insisted that the doctors were tantamount to part-time employees because the H.M.O. controlled so many details of their practice. For instance, Amerihealth requires that the doctors' offices maintain certain records, be open a certain number of hours each week and allow visits by Amerihealth inspectors.
Ms. Moore-Duncan concluded that the doctors' extensive independence from Amerihealth outweighed the amount of control the H.M.O. had over them.
Labor experts estimate that 35,000 of the nation's 700,000 doctors are in unions. The recent acceleration of efforts to unionize doctors have focused on salaried staff physicians at hospitals.
Occasionally, when private-practice physicians have sought to bargain collectively with H.M.O.'s over reimbursements or other matters, the doctors have been accused of violating antitrust laws, charged with being independent businessmen conspiring to restrain trade. Many private-practice doctors are urging Congress to enact an antitrust exemption that would let them bargain with H.M.O.'s.

HEADLINE: N.H.L.: ROUNDUP;
Dallas Evens the Series

BYLINE: By TARIK EL-BASHIR, By The Associated Press 

 BODY:

STARS 4, AVALANCHE 2
Joe Nieuwendyk wristed in a short rebound with 8 minutes 8 seconds left in the third period and Mike Modano scored a few minutes later, giving the Dallas Stars a 4-2 victory over the visiting Colorado Avalanche last night and evening the Western Conference finals at one game apiece.
 Nieuwendyk's fourth game-winning goal of the post-season sent Colorado to its first road loss of the playoffs. The Avalanche had tied a National Hockey League record with seven straight road victories. 
 The series moves to Denver for Games 3 and 4 tomorrow and Friday. Colorado is 2-4 at McNichols Arena this post-season.
 Goaltender Patrick Roy, who had carried Colorado to five straight victories since being down 0-2 to Detroit, faded in the wake of 45 shots -- the most he has seen in the playoffs since 1997.
 It was the most fired by Dallas since taking 56 in a triple-overtime victory in the first round.
 The Stars had 15 shots in the third period to one for the Avalanche.
 Roy wasn't only beaten by the All-Stars Nieuwendyk and Modano. He gave up a first-period goal to Dave Reid, who hadn't scored in his last 20 post-season games and to Sergei Zubov, who was shut out this post-season.
 Stars goaltender Ed Belfour was tested 19 times and he stopped 17. The Avalanche may not have taken as many shots, but Belfour turned away many very good scoring opportunities.
 Both Colorado goals came on rebounds, just as they did in the Avalanche's 2-1 victory in Game 1 Saturday. The Game 2 scorers were Sandis Ozolinsh on a first-period power play that gave Colorado a 1-0 lead and a diving shot by Milan Hejduk that made it 2-2 in the second period.
 
PHOENIX
Schoenfeld Fired
 Unable to advance past the first round of the playoffs, the Phoenix Coyotes fired Coach Jim Schoenfeld yesterday after two seasons with the team.
 The Coyotes were knocked out of the opening round of the playoffs by the St. Louis Blues, who came back from a 3-1 deficit to win the next three games. This season, the Coyotes (39-31-12) finished with 90 points, the second-highest total in franchise history. But the club's inability to advance into the second round of the playoffs most likely cost Schoenfeld his job.
 
ISLANDERS
Free-Agent Snag
 Several restricted free agents -- goalie Felix Potvin and captain Trevor Linden are among them -- may not get qualifying offers from the Islanders if the team doesn't reach a deal soon for a new arena with Nassau County. But Islanders officials were not optimistic yesterday that an agreement would be in place before the July 1 free-agency deadline.
 The owners don't expect a new deal imminently, said John Sanders, the Islanders' new president. If a new deal was in place for, let's say four or five years from now, the owners might be willing to make an investment.
 Sanders stressed the importance of a new arena to the economic survival of the Islanders. We have to make personnel decisions that make sense, he said.
 The Islanders said they would lower ticket prices for next season. with more than 2,300 seats to be priced at $15. Only about 300 were in that price range last season. TARIK EL-BASHIR

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: FUEL;
Oil Flowing to Yugoslavia Despite NATO's Exertions

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
As part of the campaign against President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, the Clinton Administration and NATO have tried to cut off his oil supply and his bank accounts.
It is a campaign that has not gone well, American and NATO officials said. Barges are filled with oil in Ukrainian ports and cross the Black Sea to chug up the Danube River through Bulgaria and Romania. To pay for it, Mr. Milosevic has been using money he secreted in banks in Cyprus during the earlier period of sanctions against Yugoslavia, the officials said. 
 The Administration and European Governments have appealed to Ukraine to shut down the trade and they have asked Cyprus to freeze Mr. Milosevic's bank accounts, American and NATO officials said.
During his visit to Washington last week, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, NATO's commander, raised alarms about the oil shipments traveling up the Danube and said that action needed to be taken to stop them. He said that route was increasingly being used because NATO had been somewhat successful in choking off the supply coming into Montenegro.
American officials said that they did not have a good fix on the volume of oil Mr. Milosevic was getting through the Danube route. But they did say that it was Russian oil, and that the deals were being arranged by middlemen who were making a tremendous profit because of the risks involved.
Asked how much oil Mr. Milosevic was getting, one Administration official said, "all he needs." Another official said that was an exaggeration, but he conceded that the Serbian leader was getting enough oil to keep his military machine going. A third official replied, simply, "too much."
The Clinton Administration and NATO have tried to deal with the matter quietly, fearing that making it a public issue could backfire.
When an oil embargo was last in effect against Yugoslavia, as part of a comprehensive sanctions regime from 1992 until the signing of the Dayton peace accords in 1995, Bulgaria and Romania were major conduits for oil in violation of the sanctions. (Greek and Italian oil companies were major suppliers, with most of their oil moving through Albania, a route that has now been largely shut down.)
But Washington and European capitals expect to have more success now. The Governments in Bulgaria and Romania have become more stable and have better-trained law enforcement agencies; above all, they have moved from their Communist pasts, expressing a strong desire to get into NATO and the European Union.
Still, Bulgaria and Romania have not done as much as the Administration believes they could.
Those Governments have argued that they cannot interfere with traffic on the Danube because it is an international waterway covered by the Danube Convention of 1948, which calls for free movement of ships. But American officials have dismissed those assertions, noting that the convention was signed by the Danube riparian states when they were part of the Soviet Union; West Germany was the one Danube state that did not sign.
Above all, American and NATO officials said, the major problem has been Ukraine, the source of the oil transportation.
Last week during meetings in Brussels, Boris Tarasyuk, Ukraine's Foreign Minister, was cordially but firmly told that his country must stop the barges from loading up with oil in the Ukrainian ports, a NATO official said.
Mr. Tarasyuk countered with complaints about the economic damage Ukraine was suffering because of the war against Serbia. He said that it had cost his country $220 million in lost trade, that Ukrainian ports alone had lost $12 million, and that a Danube shipping company in Ukraine was losing $313,000 a day. Who was going to compensate Ukraine for that, he demanded of NATO.
Nearly 90 percent of the Ukrainian population is against the NATO bombing, according to recent polls there, an American official said. For that reason, the Administration did not feel that it could make a public issue out of Ukraine's lack of cooperation.
In Cyprus, too, the Clinton Administration has been worried about upsetting the Government and so has not said anything publicly, but it is not happy that the Cypriots have refused to close the bank accounts belonging to Yugoslav companies.
With its secretive banking laws, Cyprus has become a major money-laundering center, especially for Russian organized criminal operations, American and European law enforcement officials said. European law enforcement officials said many of the continent's cigarette-smuggling operations use Cyprus.
American officials said they did not know how much Mr. Milosevic has in the accounts, in part because finding his assets has never been a priority of the C.I.A., several officials said.
But however much is in the accounts, the Cypriots have told the Clinton Administration and NATO that there is no legal basis for freezing them because there are no United Nations sanctions against Yugoslavia.
Of course when the earlier sanctions were in effect, Cyprus did not cooperate either, American and European officials said. "They always found loopholes," an American official said.
This evening, the Cypriot Embassy in Washington said that because of the country's desire to join the European Union, the Government was endeavoring to cooperate and was studying what it might do to freeze the accounts.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 26, 1999, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the continued flow of oil to Yugoslavia, despite NATO's cutoff efforts, referred incorrectly to the cold war political status of Bulgaria and Romania, signers of the Danube Convention of 1948 calling for free movement of ships. They were part of the Soviet bloc, not the Soviet Union.

NORTH KOREA: PERRY PAYS A VISIT -- Former Defense Secretary William J. Perry arrived in Pyongyang, the capital, to discuss the Clinton Administration's aims of easing North Korea out of its isolation. Mr. Perry, who is reviewing North Korea policy on behalf of President Clinton, is the highest-ranking American to visit North Korea since the Korean War. Although North Korea honored him with an evening reception, the highest officials it sent were deputy ministers. Nicholas D. Kristof (NYT)
 
NORTH KOREA: KEY AIDE PLANS CHINA TRIP -- North Korea's No. 2 leader will make an official visit to China from June 3 to June 7, Chinese officials announced. It will be the first high-level visit since China angered its ally by establishing relations with South Korea. Kim Yong Nam, head of the Supreme People's Assembly and No. 2 in the Workers' Party, is expected to seek more aid from China. Erik Eckholm (NYT) 

CHINA, PHILIPPINES: A CLASH AT SEA -- China accused the Philippine Navy of ramming one of its fishing boats and sinking it, but Manila said it was an accident and expressed regret. The sinking was the latest incident to mar relations between the two countries, already soured by squabbles over isles and reefs in the South China Sea. The sinking happened near Scarborough Shoal, which is claimed by Manila and Beijing. The shoal is north of the Spratly Islands, also the subject of dispute. (Reuters)
 
INDONESIA: 6 REBELS SLAIN IN SUMATRA -- Officials said separatist rebels killed six people in the northern Sumatran province of Aceh. Tensions have risen in advance of June 7 general elections, with rebels opposing participation in the vote. In a separate incident in Sumatra, witnesses said the police near the city of Medan fired into a crowd of people protesting for greater land rights, wounding a number of them. Seth Mydans (NYT)
 
THAILAND: EUROPEAN TALKS OPEN -- Representatives of the European Union and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations opened a meeting in Bangkok that had been delayed for more than a year over Europe's objections to the participation of Myanmar, formerly Burma, a new member of the Asian bloc. In a compromise, Myanmar's representative is barred from taking part in formal meetings. Seth Mydans (NYT)
 
EUROPE
 
BRITAIN: A SHIFT ON DRUGS -- Citing new figures that show 30 percent of crime in Britain is committed by addicts seeking to support their drug habit, the Government said it was shifting resources from dealing with the consequences of abuse to its treatment and prevention.

POLAND: SLAVE LABOR PACT REPORTED -- Germany has agreed that Nazi-era slave laborers from Poland should get the same compensation as those living in other countries, the Government chief of staff, Jerzy Widzyk, said after meeting with German officials. More than 400,000 Poles are seeking more than $2 billion in compensation. Poland and other East and Central European countries had feared that their slave laborers would receive less than those now living in the U.S. and Israel. (AP)
 
TURKEY: 8 REBEL KURDS REPORTED SLAIN -- Security forces killed eight Kurdish guerrillas loyal to the captured rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan in clashes in eastern Turkey, officials said.

MEXICO: 3 KEY AIDES QUIT -- Three deputy Interior Ministers and several other officials quit their posts to join the campaign of Francisco Labastida Ochoa, left, who resigned last week as Interior Minister to seek the presidential nomination of the governing party. Newspaper editorials said the mass resignations had plunged Mexico's most important ministry into a state of chaos. Sam Dillon (NYT)
 
PANAMA: A U.S. PULLOUT -- The U.S. withdrew the 400-soldier 245 Support Battalion, bringing the number of U.S. military personnel in Panama to about 3,200, officials said. The troops will be redeployed in the U.S. and Europe as part of Washington's efforts to comply with the 1977 Panama Canal treaty, under which the U.S. will hand over control of the waterway by Dec. 31.

MIDDLE EAST
 
ISRAEL: SETTLEMENT ACTIVITY -- The Peace Now movement said the nucleus of three new Jewish settlements had been set up near the Palestinian-ruled city of Nablus, in the northern West Bank, in a rush to grab occupied land before Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak takes office. The group said the move was intended to create "facts on the ground," and urged Mr. Barak to put a stop to illegal settlement activity. (Reuters)
 
IRAQ: U.S. JETS IN NEW ATTACK -- U.S. warplanes bombed a communications site after being fired on by antiaircraft artillery in the no-flight zone over northern Iraq, according to a statement from the Incirclik air base in southern Turkey. Iraq said buildings were damaged in the raids, but the Iraq News Agency did not say whether the buildings were used for civilian or military purposes. (Reuters)
 
IRAQ: U.N. TELLS OF DROUGHT -- The worst drought on record in Iraq has cut crop yields to half of last year's totals, a U.N. report said. The Iraqi Government usually refuses to give figures or estimates on agriculture, making the U.N. report particularly significant. The report predicts that feed will become more expensive, affecting livestock and poultry production. It also expected further increases in consumer prices of dairy and meat products. (AP)
 
AFRICA
 
KENYA: PLAN FOR A FREE-TRADE ZONE -- Heads of state ended a meeting in Nairobi of the 21-nation Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa by announcing a plan to turn the regional trade bloc into a free-trade zone by Oct. 31 next year. The bloc, which stretches from Egypt to Swaziland, but excludes South Africa, has a population of some 380 million and a gross domestic product of around $155 billion. (Agence France-Presse)
 
NIGER: COUP OPPOSITION RETRACTED -- The 16-member Economic Community of West African States meeting in Togo backed down from punishing Niger for the assassination on April 9 of President Ibrahim Bare Mainassara. After overnight talks, the group's foreign ministers decided to retract an earlier call by Sierra Leone, Mali and Benin to deny recognition to the new military junta in Niger, led by Maj. Daouda Wanke, above. (Agence France-Presse)
 
CONGO: A THREAT TO BURUNDI -- The Congolese army chief, Faustin Munene, has threatened to attack the capital of neighboring Burundi and accused the Burundian Army of helping Congolese rebels. "Congo will not hesitate to attack Bujumbura, which, by the way, is only a few kilometers" from Congolese territory, he said. President Laurent Kabila has long accused Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda of supporting the rebels, who control much of eastern Congo. Mr. Kabila receives military support from Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Chad. (AP)

HEADLINE: Lecture Trail In the U.S. Is Attracting Netanyahu

BYLINE: By JOEL GREENBERG 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, May 25

 BODY:
Withdrawing from active politics after his electoral defeat, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will give up his seat in Parliament and most likely write a book and go on the lecture circuit in the United States, his spokesman said today.
The spokesman, David Bar-Illan, said Mr. Netanyahu was planning to announce his resignation from Parliament on Thursday at a meeting of his Likud Party. Mr. Netanyahu stepped down as head of the Likud last week when he conceded defeat to Ehud Barak, the Labor Party leader. 
 "He's not going to be an active member of the party or in Parliament," Mr. Bar-Illan said. "He has a book contract, and he has very attractive offers for lectures. So I suspect that would be the route he will take."
Since conceding defeat barely half an hour after the polls closed on May 17, Mr. Netanyahu, 49, has said nothing in public and largely disappeared from public view.
A photograph issued by the Government Press Office showed him smiling and relaxed with his family at a staff farewell party in his official house, and a newspaper picture today showed him waving as he went house hunting here with his wife, Sara. Mr. Netanyahu is to remain in office until Mr. Barak forms a Government.
Mr. Bar-Illan said Mr. Netanyahu had bounced back in the week since his loss. "He's very buoyant, very up," Mr. Bar-Illan said. "He's internalized the defeat, and he's looking forward."
As Mr. Barak has begun talks on forming a Government, Mr. Netanyahu has cut back his work hours, canceling a Cabinet meeting on Sunday and an earlier gathering of aides to discuss security issues. Although those meetings will resume, they will not produce significant decisions, in deference to Mr. Barak's incoming administration, said another spokesman for Mr. Netanyahu, Aviv Bushinsky.
"Activity has gone down to a minimum," Mr. Bushinsky said in a radio interview. "I think the Prime Minister and the ministers are acting responsibly by avoiding decisions that will bind the incoming government."
Mr. Barak's One Israel bloc, which includes Labor and two allied parties, held its second day of exploratory talks with other parties on forming a coalition. Mr. Barak is said to be seeking as broad a coalition as possible to insure stability, including the Likud as well as Shas, an ultra-Orthodox party of Sephardic Jews, families from North African and Middle Eastern countries, that has grown to become the third largest in Parliament.
Mr. Barak's voters have flooded his office with faxes and E-mail that demand that Shas be kept out of the coalition. The Shas leader, Aryeh Deri, has been sentenced to jail after having been convicted of bribery, and the party's campaign was peppered with sharp attacks on the justice system. Mr. Deri remains free while he appeals his conviction to the Supreme Court.
Mr. Barak has refused to rule out Shas, provided that Mr. Deri resigns -- a demand that Shas negotiators resisted today. Likud members said Mr. Barak's team had told them that they would be senior partners in Government if they joined his coalition.
Shlomo Ben-Ami, a Labor lawmaker who is on the One Israel negotiating team, said by working for a broad coalition Mr. Barak was trying to avoid the mistakes of his predecessors.
"We've learned a lesson from the last seven years," Mr. Ben-Ami told Israel Radio. "During the four years of the Rabin Government, dramatic, important moves were made in the peace process and economic growth. But in the end they were perceived as rule by half of the people over the other half, and the moves were cut short."
"Then," Mr. Ben-Ami added, "there was a Government in which the other half ruled, and the result was a serious culture war, deep division and stalling of the peace process. The lesson is to try and heal these rifts, to build as wide a coalition as possible. But not one that is paralyzing. One that creates a consensus for solution of both internal and external problems."

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE;
Going From Yogurt to Developing Office Space on Staten Island

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
"Yogurt is really sour milk," Richard Nicotra said a few days ago. Mr. Nicotra has become the leading private developer of office space on Staten Island in recent years, but as the man who founded the 250-store Everything Yogurt chain 23 years ago, his heart is still very much in the yogurt business.
The first store opened in 1976 at 51 Broadway in Manhattan. "We got the product in liquid form from Colombo Yogurt in Massachusetts and we put it into an ice cream machine to freeze it and whip it," Mr. Nicotra said. "We had vanilla, strawberry and peach. It was a big day when we could manufacture chocolate frozen yogurt." 
 More recently, his big days have come in the real estate line. Altogether, he has signed tenants for 500,000 square feet of office space -- 115,000 square feet completed, 75,000 square feet in construction and the rest in the development stage. The buildings are in the 415-acre Staten Island Corporate Park, in the northwest corner of the island near the West Shore Expressway.
As president of the privately owned Restaurant Systems International, Mr. Nicotra has brought his restaurant business beyond yogurt into juice bars and salads and wrapped sandwiches. The company and its franchisees had systemwide sales of $50 million last year. But it is as president of the Nicotra Group that this Staten Island native and resident has become a leading developer.
The project he has under construction is a four-story, 75,000-square-foot building nearing completion at 900 South Avenue amid much surrounding woodland. The building is named the Park, and occupancy is to start in August.
South Avenue within the corporate park is a broad street two miles long divided by a median with sizable trees. It was built mainly with city money 20 years ago when the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was investing $70 million to develop the Teleport, a satellite transmission site and office center with a million square feet of office space and 3,000 workers. AT&T Local Services, with 2,400 employees, is the main tenant of the Teleport.
Driving south from the Staten Island Expressway to the Teleport, a visitor passes intermittent development sites on the right and then an expanse of 265 acres of wetlands and uplands that have been designated as city parkland.
Mr. Nicotra has been the leading customer for the commercial sites that the city was willing to sell for development. His first project, 1000 South Avenue, on city land bought in 1988, was a 40,000-square-foot building in which Everything Yogurt itself operates in 10,000 square feet. The rest of the space is leased by various service firms.
In 1995 Mr. Nicotra bought 4 1/2 acres of city land for a second building, the Atrium. "I saw there was a market on Staten Island for Class A space," he said.
He leased out 90 percent of the 75,000-square-foot building before completion, he said. There are nine tenants, including State Farm Insurance, Allstate Insurance and Metropolitan Life. The biggest tenant turned out to be Anthem Health and Life Insurance Company of New York, formerly Home Life Insurance. Anthem took 15,000 square feet when it moved from Piscataway, N.J.
The current project, 900 South Avenue, will have parking for 250 cars, some outdoors and some covered. The Nicotra Group bought the 2.5-acre site from the city for $1 million two years ago.
Four tenants have already signed leases, Mr. Nicotra said, at rents of about $23 a square foot a year. Among them is American Express, which is moving an office now on Forest Avenue in the Mariners Harbor section of Staten Island into 10,000 square feet, or half a floor, and doubling its space in the process. Merrill Lynch, now in New Springville, Staten Island, is expected to sign for 12,000 square feet, Mr. Nicotra said.
Major corporations are not alone in wanting Class A space. The Nicotra Group will build and operate executive suites suitable for sole-practitioner lawyers, who can use shared conference space and secretarial services and pay modest rents, normally about $1,000 a month. His most ambitious project lies ahead. Two years ago the Nicotra Group was selected by the city's Department of Economic Development, through a request for proposals process, to develop a 20-acre site in the park, formerly a stable and its grounds, with 300,000 square feet of new space.
The $50 million project is to include a six-story, 160-room business class hotel, a conference center, a day-care center, 300,000 square feet of office space and two restaurants, built in phases. As in other Nicotra projects, the architect is Land Planning and Engineering Consultants, a Staten Island firm.
Acting favorably on the request of the Borough President, Guy V. Molinari, the state's Department of Transportation has agreed to build a new exit on the northbound lane of the West Shore Expressway (Route 440) at Glenn Street to serve the project, which has been named the Gardens. At present, the nearest exit on the highway is two miles from the site.
The Nicotra Group is not the only park developer. Another project in the offing is called Southport Plaza, which is to have almost 200,000 square feet of space. George Kaye, the longtime owner of Superior Confections Inc., a Staten Island manufacturer of chocolate novelty products, is under contract to buy the site on South Avenue of 15 acres from the city.
Mr. Kaye said that about half the space would be used for manufacturing and exhibition space by a new family-owned company, Supreme Chocolatier Inc., and the rest would be leased out.
The land is near the prospective new service road to the expressway at Glenn Street.

HEADLINE: From Kosovo to 'Potato City,' Idaho, the Hard Way

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: BOISE, Idaho, May 25

 BODY:
As Mirsade Bejiqi and her family flew from Fort Dix to their new home here, she braced herself for loneliness and isolation. Perhaps nobody would bother meeting them, a handful of near-penniless refugees from Kosovo hurtling toward Potato City, as she called Idaho's capital.
How would she find her family's luggage? the 20-year-old Ms. Bejiqi wondered. Maybe somebody would show up to meet the Bejiqis, but how would she recognize him? 
 As it turned out, Boise recognized her. Forty people showed up at the Boise airport on Thursday night to greet her; her father, Ajet Bejiqi, a factory worker driven out of Pristina less than two months ago; her mother, Bukurije, and her three brothers.
Leaders of the Islamic Community Center came out to meet them, bringing translators, and so did the head of the local refugee resettlement agency. Rabbi Daniel Fink of Boise's Congregation Ahavath Beth Israel and his wife, Laura Rappaport, also a rabbi, who led the push for the synagogue to sponsor some refugees from Kosovo, were there. The family that was to shelter the Bejiqis for their first two weeks here -- and chronicle the experience for a newspaper -- welcomed them along with reporters and television crews.
"It was for me, like, amazing," said Mirsade Bejiqi, the eldest of the Bejiqi children and the most proficient in English.
Overnight, it seems, the roughly 4,000 refugees who have landed at Fort Dix, N.J., in the last few weeks have become emblems of the Kosovo cause. Resettlement agencies across the country report the kind of overwhelming outpouring of sympathy for victims of the Serbian campaign against Albanians in Kosovo that eluded the 78,000 refugees from other wars and slaughters who reached the United States last year.
"I've never heard this before from people, this wanting to do something," said Lisa Reeves, director of the Agency for New Americans, which brought the Bejiqis here. "We're very excited to be the first city in America to settle the Kosovars."
Though more than 700 of the refugees had been settled with relatives across the United States, the Bejiqis and two families sent to Seattle and Sarasota, Fla., were the first to leave Fort Dix to make their way on their own in the United States.
"When we publicly said that we'll receive some families from Kosovo, people really did start to call," Ms. Reeves said. Her agency has sponsored refugees from Bosnia, Congo, Rwanda and Russia, and Kurds from Iraq. This year, it is bringing 165 refugees to this city of 150,000.
Many of the nonprofit groups that resettle refugees in the United States, accustomed to toiling in obscurity, were astounded by the flood of interest. Touched by the sight of families trudging from Kosovo over the mountains to Macedonia and Albania, Americans began showering resettlement agencies with donations, volunteers and offers of clothing, jobs, toys and places to stay.
"There is a certain amount of competition out there," said Richard Parkins, national director of the Episcopal Migration Ministries in New York. "The reality right now is there will not be a sufficient number of refugees for all of the groups that want to be involved in the resettlement."
Some resettlement officials believe the public has responded so strongly because the Albanians from Kosovo are seen as victims of a government with which the United States is at war. Others suggest that the interest, unlike the lesser concern for black refugees of, say, Sudan, is racial, although Bosnians, who are also European, never prompted the same outpouring.
All agree that daily television coverage of Serbian atrocities has fueled much of the reaction.
The selective sympathy does not go unnoticed by less-cared-for refugees of other conflicts.
Bashkim Selace, 29, a chip maker for Micron Technology, fled to the United States from Albania in 1988. Eager to help the Kosovo refugees, he went to the Boise airport to translate for the Bejiqis but could not help remembering his own landing in Boise. One man sponsored him, putting him alone with three other Albanian newcomers in an apartment.
"It was not quite a warm welcome," Mr. Selace said, "even though the guy tried. He did his best, but it wasn't anything like what the refugees now are receiving."
The people Mr. Selace met in his new home knew nothing of his ordeal to flee Communism by crossing the mountains into Yugoslavia. "Most people didn't even know where Albania was," Mr. Selace recalled. "They thought I meant Alabama."
Azad Abdullah, 22, fled Iraq 11 years ago, after Saddam Hussein killed 50,000 Kurds there with mustard gas. Before coming to the United States by way of Guam, he spent five years in Turkish refugee camps, where he said the authorities would shoot and sometimes kill refugees.
In Kosovo, "everybody knows what's going on," Mr. Abdullah said. "It's a hard story, a tragedy. But I feel like we've been through more, but we were not advertised."
For Boise, being among the first cities in America to embrace its own Albanian refugee family was a milestone.
Notwithstanding the Aryan Nation and other extremist groups living in the mountains of Idaho, Boise's leadership wants to shed its image as an insular, parochial place. Businesses like Micron Technology and Hewlett-Packard have begun a campaign to broaden people's attitudes about foreign cultures, many of which are finding a home in Boise.
Abdul Yunis, a Pakistani manager at Hewlett-Packard who heads the city's Islamic Community Center, said, "They're finding they can create a very tolerant and welcoming environment in the company, and recruit people from all over, but employees still have to deal with what's out there when they walk out the door at the end of the day."
Along the highways, billboards for Christianity warn motorists that it is the only avenue to heaven. Mr. Yunis figures that whoever put up the signs had not thought about how they looked to Boise's few thousand Muslims and Jews.
The city is already home to 1,000 or so Bosnian refugees. Unemployment here is low and housing is affordable. Because of low interest rates and a first-time homebuyer's program, scores of Bosnian refugees have bought houses for roughly the same amount they had been paying in rent.
Ajet Bejiqi, 45, said his first priority was to learn English and find a job. This week, resettlement workers will test the Bejiqis' English and help them apply for medical benefits, food stamps and cash assistance.
In the meantime, the family has been settling in, with members of Congregation Ahavath Beth Israel taking the Bejiqis on a retreat in the mountains over the weekend and to Ponderosa State Park.
The family seemed grateful for the attention and warmth but ached for the friends they had made on their journey from Kosovo.
"I need to thank these people," Mirsade Bejiqi said, "but they are not so close to me. I love my people more than anyone in the world."
Ajet Bejiqi said he had been struck by how much Boise looked like Pristina. But as he prepared to begin a new life, the home he lost felt more distant than ever. "Spiritually, Kosovo is very far away now," he said.
Mirsade Bejiqi offered advice for other refugees expected to follow them to Boise: "Forget all the bad things. Start a new life here. And whenever it's better, we'll go back."

HEADLINE: Housing and Confidence Data Buoy Realtors

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
Home resales beat expectations in April, and consumer confidence rose for the seventh consecutive month, suggesting that the economy will continue to grow as consumers spend more on homes, cars and merchandise.
"All the economic indicators are still strong," said Fred Flick, vice president for research for the National Association of Realtors. "Consumers are carrying this economy." 
 Existing homes sold at an annual rate of 5.24 million last month, the realty group said. Although that is 3.3 percent less than the record rate of 5.42 million in March, it exceeded analysts' forecasts of a 4.99 million pace for April. A month ago, the realty group had estimated that the March rate would be 5.05 million.
Higher mortgage rates are not doing much to slow demand, the realty group said. It expects home resales for the year to top 5 million, which would exceed the 4.97 million resales last year and make this the fourth consecutive record year for that industry.
One reason for the optimism is that consumer confidence rose this month to 135.8 from a revised 135.5 in April, according to the Conference Board, which is based in New York. That is close to the 30-year high of 138.2 set last June.
The housing and confidence numbers could add to inflation concerns. Last week, the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee announced that it was leaning toward an increase in the overnight bank lending rate; the panel left that rate unchanged at 4.75 percent.
"If they continue at these levels, it really raises the chance that we're going to get a tightening of credit," said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist with ABN Amro North America Inc.
Demand for housing has not been dented much by higher borrowing costs. Mortgage rates have risen five consecutive weeks, increasing the average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage last week to 7.23 percent. That is the highest level in 18 months and up from 6.75 percent at the beginning of February, according to Freddie Mac.
The rise in consumer confidence suggests that consumer spending will not fall much from the 6.7 percent annual rate of growth in the first quarter, the largest since 1988.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Hope RidesHigh on $2.5 Billion Equity Issue by Korea Telecom

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 25

 BODY:
One of the surest signs that South Korea has won back the confidence of international investors will show up on Wednesday when shares of Korea Telecom, the country's leading telephone carrier, begin trading for the first time.
The company plans to sell $2.5 billion worth of stock, the first equity deal in South Korea to exceed $1 billion. It could have sold upward of $10 billion worth, said Alok Sama, head of the high-technology and telecommunications group for Asia at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which is underwriting the deal. 
 The largest equity offering to come out of South Korea previously was by the Korea Electric Power Company, widely know as Kepco, which raised $655 million in March.
Kepco and Korea Telecom are among the 11 state-owned companies that the South Korean Government selected for privatization after the country's economic collapse in December 1997.
Less than a year ago, Mr. Sama said, Morgan Stanley would have had trouble coaxing investors into swallowing $600 million worth of Korea Telecom stock, but times have changed. "Korea is the flavor of the month, flavor of the year, whatever you want to call it," he said.
He said the offering was helped by the large quantities of investor cash sloshing around the globe, which have pushed even the depressed Japanese stock market to double-digit gains this year. Moreover, shares of telephone companies have outperformed most stock indices this year. Demand for wireless communications capacities like mobile telephones and wireless data transmission is huge and growing in South Korea.
Some analysts have mildly criticized the company for changing some of its corporate accounting policies in such a way as to improve its operating profits. But the changes Korea Telecom made were within those allowed by local regulations and were disclosed in the company's prospectus. In addition, although some of the changes would not be acceptable under United States accounting standards, similar practices are used by telephone carriers elsewhere.
Mr. Sama took issue with the suggestion that any accounting changes had inflated earnings, pointing to Korea Telecom's acceleration of depreciation charges on some assets and other restructuring charges. "If anything, earnings have been artificially depressed," he said, "and in any case, earnings aren't what people are looking at."
He said investors were more interested in what price the stock would be as a multiple of its cash flow, which is considered by some to be a more important measure of value.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Shares Again Fall Steeply; Nasdaq Loses Nearly 3%

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stocks slumped for the fourth consecutive session yesterday as a selloff continued in technology and Internet issues.
Aside from a further steep drop in Brazilian stock prices, traders had little fresh news to influence their decisions. While the threat of higher interest rates continues to hang over the stock market, bond prices actually edged up yesterday. 
 "The feeling that the Fed has moved toward a tighter stance doesn't give people much optimism, and Brazil is not in great shape," said Bob Gasser, head of United States equity trading at J. P. Morgan Securities. "But there is nothing on the horizon that would have suggested we couldn't have rallied back" from Monday's steep slide.
Indeed, few analysts were willing to view the recent pullback as more than a long-awaited correction, particularly in technology and Internet stocks, which have fallen from extraordinarily hih levels. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index has lost nearly 10 percent since its peak on April 26.
"This correction is largely a function of declining Internet stocks," said Laszlo Birinyi of the research firm Birinyi & Associates. "The market is fine, but for the time being pressure from Internet selling, both direct and indirect, and the fact there is no news lets gravity assert itself."
Technology and Internet stocks that trade on Nasdaq suffered most yesterday. Led by big declines in market favorites like Intel, Cisco Systems and Yahoo, the Nasdaq composite index fell 72.76 points, or nearly 3 percent, to 2,380.90.
Internet shares have been harder hit. TheStreet.com's Internet stock index fell 26.35 points, or 4.6 percent, to 550.33. Since a peak on April 12, the index has lost 30 percent of its value.
It was a bad day to varying degrees in almost every corner of the market. On the New York Stock Exchange, losers outnumbered winners by almost 2 to 1. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 123.58 points, or 1.16 percent, to 10,531.09, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 22.25 points, or 1.7 percent, to 1,284.40. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks slumped 5.94, or 1.35 percent, to 434.45.
Particularly hard hit were issues like Amazon.com, Ebay and America Online. Amazon fell 5 15/16, to 111 9/16. Ebay dropped 19 5/16, to 163 15/16. And America Online declined 4 1/2, to 115.
Paul Cook, lead portfolio manager of the Munder NetNet Fund, which has a little more than $2 billion in assets under management, said profit taking, the threat of higher interest rates and a supply of new issues were putting pressure on stocks.
"The fourth and first quarters were particularly strong" for these stocks, he said, "and 38 new names have come public since the start of the year. And since these are high-multiple stocks, they are going to suffer if interest rates move higher."
Analysts said the weakness in Internet stocks was also a likely catalyst for a drop in the Dow and the S.& P. 500 during the final hour of trading. Investors facing margin calls in Internet stocks may have been forced to sell Dow stocks to meet them, Mr. Birinyi said.
A spokesman for Charles Schwab, Mo Shafroth, said: "In the last couple of days, when the Nasdaq takes a dip, it is often the case that there is an increase in margin calls. I can't quantify how much margin calls are up, but it is more than a little and less than a lot."
The Dow was led down by weakness in cyclical stocks like Alcoa, which fell 3 1/2, to 56 13/16, and financial shares like J. P. Morgan, down 3 11/16, to 133 1/16, and Citigroup, which dropped 2 3/8, to 62 3/4.
Intel led the Nasdaq and S.& P. 500 lower, falling 3 1/16, to 52 7/8. Cisco was another big loser, falling 5, to 104 3/8.
Bank and financial service stocks, punished on Monday after an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston put out a sell signal on several money-center banks, were losers again yesterday. Bank of America fell 2 7/8, to 62 3/4. First Union, which cut profit estimates yesterday for a second time this year, fell 4 5/16, to 45 5/8. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette shed 4, to 64 5/8. And Charles Schwab lost 9 3/4, to 96 5/8.
Utility stocks, often used as a safe haven during times of broad market weakness, did well again yesterday. The Dow Jones utilities average advanced to a fifth consecutive record, rising 1.05 points, to 328.48.
Among individual issues, American Electric Power rose 5/8, to 43 11/16. Con Edison gained 5/8, to 49 3/8. And Duke Energy rose 3/4, to 60 1/8.

Treasury Prices Rise
 By Bloomberg News
 Bond prices were little changed yesterday, gaining support from falling stocks, declines in commodities and waning corporate debt demand.
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose 5/32, to 93. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.74 percent from 5.76 percent. Yields on two-year notes, the most actively traded Treasuries, rose to 5.26 percent from 5.24 percent.
Treasuries fell for most of the day as reports on consumer confidence and home sales suggested that the economy was going strong, keeping alive concerns that growth might spur inflation.
Bonds bounced back as stocks fell in afternoon trading, making less-risky Treasuries attractive. Waning demand for corporate debt also bolstered the Treasuries' appeal.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of one-year bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures )
 
Price . . . 95.319
High Rate . . . 4.63%
Coupon Yield . . . 4.87%

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Warningby First Union Draws Heap of Scorn

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
In glitzy, futuristic television advertisements, the First Union Corporation has been proudly promoting itself as "The Mountain." But the ground beneath that mountain is trembling.
First Union, the nation's sixth-largest bank, which was built through costly, rapid-fire acquisitions, surprised investors and employees yesterday when it warned that profits for the second quarter and the year would fall far below previous estimates and that 1999 would be less profitable than 1998. It was the second time this year that the bank, based in Charlotte, N.C., has had to revise its earnings estimates sharply downward -- leaving the bank's credibility in tatters, its financial outlook clouded and its ability to remain independent in doubt. 
 "For years I complained about the prices they paid for acquisitions, but I always said they ran a good bank," said Thomas K. Brown, a money manager with Tiger Management in New York. "But now they're having serious problems running the basic bank -- the wheels are coming off the cart."
The bank, citing difficulties generating revenue and looming problems in its loan portfolio, said earnings for the year would be $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion, or $3.40 to $3.50 a share. Those figures are well below revised projections made by the bank in January that caused bank stock analysts to lower their estimates to $4.02 a share for the year, from $4.29. Last year, First Union earned $3.7 billion, or $3.77 a share.
The stock market was unforgiving yesterday. In almost seven times the normal trading volume, First Union shares plunged 8.6 percent, to $45.625, the biggest drop in eight years and well below the stock's 52-week high of $65.9375.
First Union, along with its rival, the Bank of America Corporation, has been one of the most free-spending acquirers in banking. Its acquisition spree has contributed to a merger boom that has put the bulk of the country's banking assets at a handful of banks with national ambitions. So heated is the competition between First Union's chief executive, Edward E. Crutchfield Jr., and Bank of America's chief executive, Hugh L. McColl Jr., that each appears to be trying to outdo the other with ever-bigger purchases. Their rivalry even extends to dueling skyscrapers. First Union is building a 30-story office tower in Charlotte and has hinted that a 100-story tower may be on the way. Bank of America is busy erecting a 45-story skyscraper in Charlotte.
But the towering First Union facade cloaks a failure to attain the financial goals promised in its merger binge, mounting managerial woes and low morale amid the layoff of thousands of workers -- layoffs deemed necessary for the bank to meet earnings goals associated with acquisitions.
First Union's $17 billion takeover of the Corestates Financial Corporation last year was one of the most expensive in banking history relative to the size of the target. First Union acknowledged yesterday that a financial payoff from that merger "lags original expectations."
Last year, First Union also bought Money Store Inc., which lends to people with troubled credit histories, for $2.1 billion. In a maneuver criticized by many stock analysts, First Union later took a $2.2 billion "accounting adjustment" for the takeover that allowed it to spread the cost of the acquisition over 25 years and thus avoid an earnings hit. First Union said yesterday that the Money Store acquisition had also disappointed.
Nonetheless, until earlier this year many analysts were willing to give First Union the benefit of the doubt and accept earnings projections proffered by the company.
"This is a tale of ego run amok," Mr. Brown said, "and it says a lot about how easily Wall Street buys into whatever earnings figures management feeds it." He was referring to the ego of Mr. Crutchfield, who once derided Mr. Brown as "that little red-haired boy" and banned the stock analyst from company headquarters because of Mr. Brown's skepticism about First Union's acquisition strategy.
Other analysts were also critical yesterday of First Union's performance. "This company has squandered its credibility with Wall Street," said David Berry at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. "You cannot escape the conclusion that they have trouble doing budgets over there."
A First Union spokeswoman said Mr. Crutchfield was taking questions only from analysts yesterday and declined to be interviewed. But analysts said he had told them in a conference call that the bank would now forgo acquisitions because they no longer made economic sense. But the hunter could become the hunted, with Wells Fargo & Company, the Bank One Corporation or the Chase Manhattan Corporation eventually putting the depressed stock of First Union in their sights.
John R. Georgius, First Union's president, said in an interview that his job was secure. He said First Union's board had supported every acquisition and was "very confident that our business fundamentals are solid." He also said his bank had had "many years of consistent performance" and planned to meet its revised earnings projections.
Though First Union said it would add $90 million to $110 million to its loan loss reserves of $600 million, Mr. Georgius noted that that figure was still relatively small given the bank's $130 billion loan portfolio.
Encouraging investors and analysts to look on the bright side, First Union made one surprising announcement yesterday. The bank, which has invested so heavily in brick-and-mortar branches through its acquisitions, said that its best opportunities for growth would be on the Internet.

HEADLINE: Clinton Sets Safety Goals For Truckers

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration today set a goal of reducing deaths from truck crashes by 50 percent over 10 years and promised quick action on safety questions that had stymied it for years, including revising the 62-year-old rules on how many hours a day a driver can work.
"Up to this point, very little focus has been placed on the needs of the drivers,"Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said in announcing the goal. "It's always been, for the most part, the bottom line." 
 The current rules, written long before the age of transcontinental truck routes, call for drivers to have 8 hours off after 10 hours of driving or 15 hours of work, which can include loading and unloading or other duties. The rest hours can be split into two parts, the shorter as little as 2 hours, and can be taken in a cab's sleeper berth.
The National Transportation Safety Board, which estimates that 750 to 1,500 deaths annually occur in crashes in which trucker fatigue is a factor, has put new rules on hours on its "most wanted" list of safety improvements since 1990.
The Transportation Department proposed new rules in 1995 but, unable to win consensus among labor, business and safety groups, has not moved forward. Mr. Slater said that unless the pace was increased, no new rule would be written before President Clinton's term ends.
And the existing rule is widely disobeyed, Transportation Department officials say.
Kenneth Mead, the inspector general of the department, said the industry's economic structure, with drivers widely paid by the mile instead of the hour, would have to change to make the system safer.
"They don't drive till they're exhausted because they want to," Mr. Mead said.
He has recently detailed a series of problems with the department's Office of Motor Carriers. In 1998, Mr. Mead said, more than 20,000 violations were cited by investigators, but only 11 percent resulted in fines; and of those, fines paid were only 46 percent of the dollar amounts initially assessed. The average final payment was $1,500, he said.
Under legislation that took effect this year, fines for serious violations of trucking rules, formerly limited to $1,000 each and $10,000 per accident or incident, are now set at $10,000 each, with no ceiling. And fines for record-keeping violations, formerly $500 each with a cap of $2,500, are now $5,000 each, with no ceiling.
Federal statistics show that the number of accidents per million miles traveled has fallen steadily, but the number of deaths is stubbornly high, because the industry is booming.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 5,398 people died in crashes involving heavy trucks in 1997, nearly all of them in a car, van, pickup or other light vehicle, not the heavy truck.

HEADLINE: Philanthropy Rose 11% in 1998, Report Says

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Pushed by a healthy economy and the rising stock market, charitable giving by Americans climbed 11 percent to a record $175 billion last year, according to estimates in a report made public yesterday.
The figures represented the third consecutive year of double-digit growth and strong gains for many charitable organizations. The only area that showed a decline was arts, culture and humanities. In contrast, donations to environmental and wildlife groups and health and human service organizations grew by 20 percent or more. 
 "Many people speculate that we're entering the golden age of philanthropy, and as practitioners, many of us are experiencing that," said Jimmie R. Alford, chairman of the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel, whose nonprofit arm, the AAFRC Trust for Philanthropy, publishes the report, Giving USA.
"We're seeing some unprecedented gifts," added Mr. Alford, a fund-raising consultant in Skokie, Ill.
Despite the gains, the new figures are sure to stir debate over how generous Americans really are. Although charitable giving kept pace with rising incomes last year, it did not come close to matching the hefty increases in the stock market in 1998, when the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 27 percent.
"The very top group could be giving 10 times more than they do and not impair their wealth at all," said Claude Rosenberg, a former investment adviser in San Francisco who set up the Newtithing Group, a nonprofit group that encourages people to think of donations in terms of their wealth, not their income.
Individuals did raise their giving 10 percent last year to $135 billion, according to the 1999 edition of Giving USA. As always, individuals accounted for most of the giving: 77 percent of the total in 1998.
Bequests added $13.6 billion, an 8 percent increase. Giving by foundations showed the biggest gain last year, rising 23 percent to $17 billion. Foundations are required by law to give away an amount equal to 5 percent of their assets. Corporate giving, $9 billion, rose 9 percent, and amounted to 1 percent of corporate pretax income in 1998.
While individual giving rose slightly relative to personal income last year, reaching 1.9 percent for the first time since 1973, officials of the association acknowledged yesterday that income might not be as useful a yardstick as it has been in the past.
"Income is almost beside the point when personal wealth has increased so sharply," said Nancy L. Raybin, chairwoman of the AAFRC Trust for Philanthropy.
Paul G. Schervish, director of the Social Welfare Research Institute at Boston College, called wealthy individuals a sleeping giant for philanthropy. He said many such people were planning for future philanthropy through bequests or programs like Fidelity Investments' Charitable Gifts fund, which lets individuals create tax-deductible pools of money that function somewhat like personal foundations.
Ms. Raybin said many individuals also contributed directly to personal foundations last year. Gifts to foundations totaled $17 billion in 1998, a 16 percent increase.
Four other areas of giving showed especially large gains: environmental and wildlife organizations (up 28 percent to $5.3 billion), human services (up 27 percent to $16.1 billion), health organizations (up 20 percent to $16.9 billion), and public benefit organizations, including civil rights, public affairs, consumer protection and scientific development groups (up 30 percent to $10.9 billion).
The only area of giving that declined was arts, culture and the humanities, where contributions fell almost 1 percent from the previous year, to $10.5 billion.
Religion remained the largest area of giving, with $76.1 billion in donations last year, up about 5 percent from 1997.
Education represented the second largest area of charitable donations, with $24.6 billion in gifts, an increase of 11 percent from 1997.

HEADLINE: Clinton Has a Few Fine Words for Gore

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: EDINBURG, Tex., May 25

 BODY:
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore crossed paths here today, a public pairing that inadvertently highlighted just how far the Vice President had to go in matching his mentor's political skills.
The President, in a warmly received 19-minute introductory speech, heaped praise on his designated heir. The Vice President followed, giving a speech about economic development in poor neighborhoods that went on twice as long as Mr. Clinton's and was laden with bureaucratic phrases about applications, blueprints and empowerment. 
 It was less than two weeks ago that the President openly told a reporter that he was worried about Mr. Gore's so-far-undeclared Presidential campaign and that Mr. Gore needed to loosen up. Today was their first joint appearance since, creating a moment that invited comparisons.
Andrew M. Cuomo, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, who is close to Mr. Gore, accompanied the President here for the Fifth Annual White House Community Empowerment Conference and could not help acknowledging the gap in their communications skills.
The President is "a master communicator of historic proportions," Mr. Cuomo said. Mr. Gore, he added, meaning to praise him, is "a very effective communicator."
The President and his tutee met here at this sun-baked border town for an event intended to promote the Administration's establishment of "empowerment zones," depressed areas where tax breaks and investment have lured businesses and helped create thousands of jobs.
It was also a platform for Mr. Gore to promote his candidacy, and he was the host. Mr. Clinton stopped by on his way to a vacation in Florida.
The conference setting was an effort to boost Mr. Gore's standing with Hispanic voters. It was here in the backyard of Gov. George W. Bush, the leading contender for the Republican Presidential nomination, in a heavily Hispanic area.
The stage was set, unusually, with the official seals of both the President and the Vice President. And Mr. Clinton spent most of his introduction praising Mr. Gore as an equal partner in the successes of the empowerment zones across the country.
"Because of his unparalleled combination of creativity and energy, experience and determination, I asked the Vice President to take the lead in turning this vision we had into reality," Mr. Clinton told the audience of a few hundred people assembled from these zones.
"It was a challenge, as all of you have seen, that he embraced passionately," Mr. Clinton said.
Mr. Gore then held the podium for 40 minutes. While Mr. Clinton had spoken vividly, with flowing hand gestures, about the Administration's efforts at economic development, Mr. Gore focused on the grant applications and the theory of community.
Mr. Cuomo, son of another recognized master orator, said that while Mr. Gore had had "a very factual, technical area" to cover, he had still been effective.
"You have the material you have," Mr. Cuomo said. "We all have our own style."

HEADLINE: Do State Lotteries Dupe the Poor?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Living Off the Daily Dream of Winning a Lottery Prize" (front page, May 22): 
 It is one thing to "allow" individuals to gamble as they wish; it is quite another for states to encourage such proclivities when the costs bear so heavily on the poor.
Moreover, the example of New Jersey's property tax as a more equitable way of increasing state revenue is misleading. The data you report show that low-income households pay a little more than $400 a year in property taxes while those with at least twice that income pay less than $600. Property taxes paid by high-income families are likely to include taxes on rental property. Such taxes are regularly shifted to renters when housing is in high demand, thus disguising the actual regressive nature of the tax.

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR SECRETS: THE WHITE HOUSE;
President's Sober Response Assures Public of Counterespionage Measures

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
The White House responded in a low-key and respectful manner to the release today of the Cox Committee report on Chinese nuclear espionage, acknowledging that a serious security breach exists while assuring Congress and the public that the Administration is working hard to improve security.
President Clinton said he shared the concerns of the panel's nine members about what the report described as a pattern of successful Chinese espionage against the nation's nuclear secrets and offered assurances that the Administration has been moving to adopt many of its recommendations. 
 "First, let me say that I am particularly appreciative of the careful and bipartisan manner in which the committee did its work," said the President, speaking at an unrelated domestic policy event in Texas. "Like many other countries, China seeks to acquire our sensitive information and technology. We have a solemn obligation to protect such national security information, and we have to do more to do it."
The accommodating tone of the White House reaction arises from the gravity of the charges in the Cox Committee report, signed by all the panel's Republicans and Democrats, including Representative Christopher Cox, a California Republican and the panel's chairman. The President's aides, who have known of the panel's major conclusions for several months, concluded that challenging the committee's findings would not give sufficient weight to the seriousness of the allegations and could be politically damaging.
In remarks to reporters and in a written response to the Cox Committee findings, Administration officials stressed that many of the suspected losses of sensitive technology occurred before Mr. Clinton took office. and repeated earlier assertions that the White House took swift and decisive action when it learned of the security breaches.
The White House's written response noted that security at the national weapons laboratories, where it is suspected that the most serious breaches occurred, "has been a long-term concern, stretching back more than two decades."
Bill Richardson, the Secretary of Energy, whose department overseas the weapons labs, said at a press conference today, "This Administration has acted on the problem; previous Administrations didn't act." He added, "Now, this is not a partisan issue; this is a bipartisan problem that we are trying to fix."
Mr. Richardson called the Cox report "an important, valuable piece of work," yet noted that he had begun moving aggressively to improve security and counterespionage surveillance at the national weapons labs long before the report was released.
"We have undertaken a total overhaul of the Department of Energy counterintelligence program," Mr. Richardson said.
"I do take issue with one component of the Cox report," he added, "and that is that we have taken enormously aggressive action to deal with the problem. We are fixing the problem. I can assure the American people that their nuclear secrets are now safe at the labs."
The Administration response, fashioned over weeks of consultations among officials of the National Security Council, the White House counsel's office, Cabinet officers and the President's top political advisers, is in marked contrast to its handling of myriad other investigations launched by the Republican-led Congress.
The White House has responded to prior inquiries by attacking them as partisan and has accused Republicans of dredging up trivial matters to embarrass the President.
In this case, however, the White House has sounded a more conciliatory note, in part because the nine-member Cox Committee's four Democrats all endorsed its findings.
The Administration also does not want to turn relations between the United States and China into a political circus that could set back the President's policy of "strategic partnership" with Beijing for years.
Mr. Clinton said he will not allow reports of Chinese nuclear espionage to derail his policy of economic and diplomatic engagement with Beijing because his policy is in the United States' interest. He said the United States had strict controls in place to limit the transfer of sensitive technology to China, a statement at odds with many of the conclusions of the investigative committee.
"I strongly believe that our continuing engagement with China has produced benefits for our national security," the President said.
A White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the allegations of Chinese nuclear spying were of a different nature than last year's impeachment charges and earlier investigations into Whitewater and other matters.
"There's a recognition that we are dealing with serious issues," the official said, "but we view them as issues that are longstanding ones and that require steps to deal with, and we're taking them."
Instead of mounting a hostile defense, the White House is pleading for understanding.
"We don't think it's valuable for anyone to point fingers in a way that detracts from work that should be done," the official said.
But the White House did not completely abandon the field to Mr. Cox and his conclusions. Included with the White House's written response was a sheaf of newspaper articles and opinion pieces that attacked the committee's findings and The New York Times's reporting on them.
Among them are two columns by Lars Erik Nelson of the New York Daily News, who accused The Times of conducting a "lynching" of Wen Ho Lee, the former Los Alamos laboratory worker still suspected of nuclear espionage. Mr. Nelson also wrote that Mr. Clinton has gotten a "bum rap" over the issue of the theft of nuclear secrets.
The clippings also include reports from The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times, based on interviews with Administration officials and outside intelligence specialists, that question the severity of the technical losses. Other clippings include columns defending the Administration's policy of strategic partnership with China, including one by Henry Kissinger, the architect of American engagement with Beijing.
Mr. Clinton, seeking to tamp down the passions that debates on China always inspire, said today that he wanted to address the problem of nuclear security breaches without damaging relations with the most populous nation on Earth.
"I want to assure you and all the American people that I will work very hard with the Congress to protect our national security," he said in Texas, "to implement the recommendations and to continue our policy of engagement because both of them are in the national interest."

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR SECRETS: THE OVERVIEW;
Spying Charges Against Beijing Are Spelled Out by House Panel

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH and JAMES RISEN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
A long-awaited Congressional report that describes a pattern of systematic and successful Chinese espionage to learn American nuclear secrets was released today, and President Clinton said he agreed that national security should be improved.
The contents of the report, which have been seeping out in recent days, were unanimously approved by the five Republicans and four Democrats on the panel, the Select Committee on U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People's Republic of China. 
 Speaking in Texas at an economic conference sponsored by Vice President Al Gore, the President said his Administration agreed with "the overwhelming majority" of the report's 38 recommendations, which call for stronger intelligence, security and export-control programs.
China has consistently denied the allegations of spying, and the investigation has further strained relations between Washington and Beijing.
The committee's criticisms of the Administration's policy of easing technology exports to improve political relations could also become an issue in the Presidential campaign. The report has already drawn a call from the House majority leader, Richard Armey, for the resignation of the President's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger.
The three-volume report, on slick paper with color photographs, concludes that China has stolen design secrets for all seven nuclear warheads now deployed on American missiles, enabling Beijing to leap years ahead and modernize its nuclear weapons. Excerpts, pages A21-22.
The report says that "systematic" Chinese nuclear espionage began 20 years ago and almost certainly continues, but that it has not altered the military balance between Washington and Beijing because China still has few nuclear missiles.
But the committee warns that China is exploiting stolen secrets to develop a modern and more mobile nuclear ability that could pose a threat to American troops and allies in Asia and the Pacific.
Top Republicans outside the panel criticized Mr. Clinton, saying he should have reacted more quickly to initial reports of Chinese spying. George W. Bush, Elizabeth Dole and Senator John McCain joined in that criticism. Mrs. Dole said, "Previous administrations must share in the blame, but this Administration knew more and still chose not to take action."
The committee itself struggled to maintain a bipartisan spirit, but one of its Democrats questioned a key conclusion of the report, that the thefts had put China's nuclear weapons design information on a par with that of the United States.
The report criticizes the practices of two American satellite companies -- Hughes Space and Communications International Inc. and Loral Space and Communications Ltd. -- for sometimes subordinating national security to the "bottom line."
And it offers a new view of efforts by the Chinese military to funnel money to a Democratic fundraiser in 1996: that the money, given by a Chinese military officer, Lieut. Col. Liu Chaoying, who met President Clinton at a benefit in 1996, "was an attempt to better her position in the United States to acquire computer, missile and satellite technologies."
At the news conference, committee members stressed that national security had taken priority over partisan rancor. "Our final report shows Congress can work well together," said Representative Christopher Cox, a California Republican and chairman of the panel. Representative Norm Dicks of Washington, the ranking Democrat, said, "Chris Cox and I agreed that nine members could be Americans first, putting aside partisan considerations."
But another Democratic member, Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, questioned whether the finding that stolen secrets had put China's design capabilities "on a par with our own" was accurate.
The President, in his remarks in Texas, also pledged to continue his policy of engagement with Beijing. His promise to improve security was backed up by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who said, "I am trying to clean up a mess."
At its core the report presents two intertwined tales: of China's "insatiable" appetite for American military technology, and of Washington's laxity over sensitive exports and security at weapons laboratories.
The committee began its inquiry looking at a narrow subject: what was China learning from American companies who used Chinese rockets to launch satellites? But midway into its inquiry the committee turned to the reports of nuclear espionage.
In recent weeks, leaks of some of the findings about espionage have caused a furor in Congress. In response, the White House has emphasized that the suspected spying occurred during both Republican and Democratic administrations.
The report criticizes the looser controls on technology exports, a cornerstone of President Clinton's commercial diplomacy, but does not assign blame for lax security at the laboratories. A principal finding is that the United States did not become "fully aware of the magnitude of the problem" until 1995.
The committee interviewed 150 witnesses and reviewed 500,000 pages of documents. But it faulted the cooperation it received from the Administration and from Hughes and Loral as less than complete.
Specific complaints involve the failure of some Cabinet departments to turn over some documents or allow some interviews and the fact that Mr. Berger took 40 days to respond to a written question about when President Clinton was informed about the spying reports.
Mr. Berger originally told the committee that the President was informed in early 1998. But this month, long after the report was completed, Mr. Berger changed his account and said he had briefed Mr. Clinton in July 1997.
A senior aide to Mr. Berger attributed the delay and inaccuracy to poor staff work and distractions from the bombing of Iraq, which began days before Mr. Berger's reply.
The committee relied on Mr. Berger's first account, saying the President was not briefed until early 1998 "even though" the scope of the problem was first uncovered by intelligence officials in 1995. The officials then briefed Mr. Berger in 1996.
Mr. Berger is not considering Representative Armey's request that he resign, a White House aide said.
About 30 percent of the report remains classified. The version made public today often uses words like "may" or "could" or "possibly." Mr. Cox said in an interview, "An unfortunate byproduct of the rewriting process is that apparent speculation and opinion enters the report whereas in our final, classified report there were only facts."
These are some of the report's findings:
*The Chinese Government has 3,000 "front" companies in the United States, but American agencies seem to have little knowledge about their existence or activities. In the 1990's, China stepped up its use of front companies for espionage.
*China stole thermonuclear weapons information, possibly from a weapons laboratory, in the mid-1990's. This is in addition to its acquisition of design secrets on seven nuclear warheads, including the neutron bomb and the W-88, the most advanced, miniaturized warhead.
*China has stolen information relating to American re-entry vehicles, which shield warheads as they return to earth.
*China illegally obtained ballistic-missile guidance technology that it has exploited for its own weapons.
*China illegally obtained American research on electromagnetic-weapons technology related to satellites in the late 1990's.
*China's agreement to allow monitoring of its use of American exports, which was announced in Beijing in 1998, is "wholly inadequate" in general and "useless" in the case of advanced computers.
The report said Washington's policy of allowing businesses to police their own technology sales, taken in the first Clinton Administration, has not worked because national security interest "simply may not be related to improving a corporation's 'bottom line.' "
On the subject of aid by American satellite manufacturers for Chinese scientists, the committee found that in 1993, 1995 and 1996 the companies "transferred missile design information and know-how" to China "without obtaining the legally required licenses." The "illegally transmitted" information has improved the reliability of China's civilian and military rockets and "is useful for the design and improved reliability" of future Chinese ballistic missiles.
President Reagan first approved the launching of American commercial satellites on Chinese rockets in 1988. But the committee found that his decision was based on two outdated factors: "Insufficient domestic launch options in the aftermath of the Challenger disaster" and the belief that China "was a strategic balance against the Soviet Union in the context of the cold war."
So the report calls for strengthening American rocket-launching abilities, improving the monitoring at foreign launch sites and tightening Federal scrutiny of commercial space insurers and satellite exporters.
Buried in the report is a timely warning: The committee noted the lack of procedures to detect or prevent the movement of classified nuclear weapons information to less secure computer systems at the weapons laboratories.
It was not until last month that the Energy Department, which owns the labs, took drastic actions to address that issue. That came days after officials reported that several years earlier, a scientist at the Los Alamos laboratory suspected of spying for China had transferred virtually the entire history of United States nuclear weapons testing and development to an unsecure computer system.

Titan Homes to Reopen

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Workers at Titan Homes in Waterville, N.Y., will return to their old jobs in a new factory on July 5.
A fire destroyed the old Titan factory on Jan. 19. Titan's parent company, Champion Enterprises, drew national attention when it announced that it not only intended to rebuild but that it would keep all 200 workers on its payroll while it did so. 
 Champion is the nation's largest maker of mobile homes. Titan Homes is one of the area's largest employers and an economic bedrock for Waterville, a village of 2,300 people 60 miles southeast of Syracuse.
The new, larger 180,000-square-foot building will cost about $6 million.

Congress Is Told to Invest In Reform of the I.R.S.

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
Reform of the Internal Revenue Service will fail unless Congress makes steady, annual investments in training and technology, the tax commissioner said today as he repeatedly, but gently, told Congress that years of budget cuts for the agency must end.
Charles O. Rossotti, the tax commissioner hired to remake the agency, warned that efforts to make the tax agency friendly to customers, as he calls taxpayers, could not be financed solely by cutting spending on audits, collections and investigations of criminal tax fraud. 
 "Doing business the same way while the economy grows and resources decline will eventually undermine the whole tax system," Mr. Rossotti said.

HEADLINE: Importance of Being Persuasive;
Daimler-Chrysler Merger Made an Art of Making a Case

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

 BODY:
Jurgen E. Schrempp, the man who reigns over DaimlerChrysler, has a weak spot for trial movies.
One of his favorites is "Twelve Angry Men," in which one juror painstakingly reverses the others' views on the guilt of a murder defendant. 
 To Mr. Schrempp, the tale is, at heart, a training film in persuasion. "It helps me put my arguments into words, focus on people," he said.
The power of persuasion is a valuable commodity for corporate chiefs hoping for a front-row seat in the global marketplace -- people like Mr. Schrempp.
Orchestrating complex mergers across borders and cultural divides takes a lot more than management skills -- it takes the political knack to win over a wide range of people, often with sharply conflicting agendas. And Mr. Schrempp, the intense German chief executive who last year brought about the world's largest completed industrial merger, may best exemplify this blending of skills.
"Running a global, multicultural business is half stomach and heart, and the other half is brain," said Mr. Schrempp, who started as a mechanic, then ran Daimler-Benz divisions in South Africa, the United States and Germany. "You've got to see your goal clearly," he said. "But you've got to deliver it just as clearly to clients, employees, shareholders, politicians, labor unions, analysts, the media."
Indeed, on May 4, 1998, three days before the world learned of the merger between Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest company, and the Chrysler Corporation, Mr. Schrempp, 54, practiced what he preached in a suite at New York's Four Seasons hotel.
Pacing the room, he made his pitch repeatedly before a dozen investment bankers, public relations experts and corporate lawyers. Their task was to critique his soon-to-be-public presentation to shareholders, the news media and the world -- until he had it right.
"Today, every company has many constituent groups," said Gershon Kekst, who has been in public relations 40 years and was one of that dozen. "The publicity that is good in America is not so good in Europe."
If anything, the era of globalization, the Internet and multinationals has intensified the need for specialized skills in communications. "There are so many interest groups that can disrupt the process," said John D. Bergen, president of the Council of Public Relations Firms in New York, "that public relations now gets in on the strategy level."
Nor, of course, does the process stop with the merger. Ten months after the birth of DaimlerChrysler, Mr. Schrempp was still trying to convince his many audiences that it was a good idea.
"Networking consumes 40 percent to 50 percent of my time," Mr. Schrempp said in March in an interview in Montreux, the Swiss resort town. He had just returned from Tokyo, where he had flown secretly to tell Nissan Motor executives that he was backing away from a merger. "Face is important in Japan. You have to do it in person."
Clearly, he was still thrilled by the success of the initial public relations campaign for the Chrysler deal. While the merger has faced some rough patches, that campaign, by all accounts, was second to none.
The two corporate relations teams worked for months with three public relations firms: Kekst & Company and Golin Harris/International of New York and Bell-Pottinger Communications of London.
The work was supplemented with soundings from a few top executives, friends of Mr. Schrempp, including James D. Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, and Sir John Browne, head of BP-Amoco-Arco, who sits on the company's board, and influential people like the Washington lawyer Vernon E. Jordan Jr., the former Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal and the former Senator Sam Nunn.
It emerged that the principal concerns included the need to address the reaction of American Jews to Daimler's involvement with slave labor during World War II; Chrysler's focus on diversity in the work place, to which Germans are not as dedicated, and employees' fear of being "Germanized" or "Americanized."
Much of the advice was bounced back and forth in private conversations with three advisers -- Christoph Walther, who heads DaimlerChrysler's corporate communications; Mike Taylor of Bell-Pottinger, an old friend of Mr. Schrempp from his days in South Africa, and Mr. Kekst, whose activism in Jewish causes was a plus.
The result was a confidential 36-page plan that set forth every detail with military precision.
Drums rolled on May 7 last year when Mr. Schrempp and his counterpart at Chrysler, Robert J. Eaton, made calls to President Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany to tell them of the merger -- the first of 147 big calls, including one to the next Chancellor, Gerhard Schroder.
The message was tailored to the audience. To Mr. Kohl, Mr. Schrempp described the merger as a great boon to Germany's largest company and the country's industrial power. But the Socialist-leaning Mr. Schroder asked, "But are you laying off any workers?" To which Mr. Schrempp said. "I can give you my word there will be no layoffs."
Mr. Schroder went on to ask if the company would be German. Absolutely, Mr. Schrempp assured him.
Mr. Eaton, meanwhile, was implying to President Clinton that it would be a merger of equals.
The issue of slave labor was debated in a meeting on April 30 last year attended by Mr. Schrempp, Mr. Eaton, Mr. Walther and Mr. Kekst.
Mr. Schrempp said that in 1986 Daimler commissioned a study on its role in slave labor and published the results. It also erected a memorial at its Stuttgart headquarters. Now, though, he knew that would not be enough. A few weeks later Mr. Schrempp came up with the notion of creating a compensation fund.
Lower-level executives around the globe made 10,000 more calls that day to unions, community leaders, managers and politicians.
On the announcement day, Mr. Walther's team sent out 140,000 E-mails; letters and gifts like watches were delivered to all 428,000 employees of both companies; briefings for 950 analysts were held in London, Frankfurt and New York; news conferences, interviews and television appearances were conducted for 502 journalists on four continents; 5,000 videos were beamed by satellite to television networks and thousands of champagne corks popped.
"By the time that day was over, we had spent $25 million," Mr. Walther said over breakfast during the Geneva Motor Show in March.
Only so much can be done by outside professionals. At a certain point, much depends on the boss. "Ego does not drive the effort, but they couldn't do it if they didn't have the ego," Mr. Kekst said.
With Mr. Schrempp, the dream of bigger things emerged early. In his 12 years in South Africa, he developed a sense about the politics of race and the price of ignoring human rights issues.
In Germany, he broke away from the technocrat-patrician posture typical of German business leaders into a high-visibility, contentious Anglo-Saxon style.
After he became chairman in 1995, he made another splash by warning that profits would be disappointing -- an implied criticism of his predecessor's management, at odds with traditional German discretion.
It was no coincidence that he hired Mr. Walther in April 1995 from the tobacco industry -- no stranger to controversy and attacks -- just as he planned a painful revamping that cost 40,000 jobs. "If we ever sponsor a professorship, it has to be in political engineering," Mr. Walther joked about his boss's style.
Controlling and shaping a corporate image creeps into nearly every corner of a chief executive's day. Mr. Schrempp's speaking engagements, booked through 2000, are choreographed for the "highest-leverage effect with the right audience, the right time and the right topic," Mr. Walther said. Audiences will range from those at the Detroit Executive Club to the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to top universities and various foreign affairs forums. Carefully researched speeches, produced mostly by Bell-Pottinger and the corporate relations department of DaimlerChrysler, delve into car making, human rights and the environment.
Richard J. Wolff, manager of Golin Harris/International, says cross-border operations are creating a market for a new kind of communications skills. "That is beyond the commodity level of public relations, the issuing of press releases and arranging conference calls to journalists," he said. "Look at Schrempp. He is an international business leader. He needs to be surrounded with professionals who are comfortable in history and culture, linguists and thinkers with a broader sphere of knowledge."
Indeed, Mr. Kekst and Mr. Harris employ partners with doctorates in history, economics, accounting, marketing and law, and many have been put at Daimler's disposal.
In the sumptuous surroundings of Montreux and the success of the initial phase of the merger, criticism was hard to ferret out. DaimlerChrysler showed every sign of living up to the goals the merger set forth: innovation, global growth, job creation, social responsibility and equality.
Over the last couple of months, though, the equality goal has taken a beating. The Americans have murmured ever louder that they are becoming second-class citizens, and Mr. Schrempp has left little doubt his team is first among equals.
"It is a German show," said one Detroit-based Chrysler executive. "I guess it was inevitable. Someone has got to run the show, but how are Chrysler's best ideas ever going to reach Schrempp if they go through an exclusively German filter?"
Indeed, top Chrysler managers, including Mr. Eaton, have declared themselves lame ducks, agreeing to leave in a little more than two years.
Some say the culture mismatch may make no difference.
"The two cultures don't even intersect," said Jerry Flint, a longtime automotive journalist. "They are not even on the same planet. They have merged, but it doesn't mean they are making each other's cars or designing or marketing or selling each other."
But this does not help morale and may, in the end, hinder the merger. Some American executives say they fear Chrysler's lean, dynamic, fast-moving style may be hobbled by the more deliberate, stodgy German process of management by consensus.
Above all, a close confidant of Mr. Schrempp said that the German chief executive must sooner or later tell people that he and he alone runs the company.
In other words, the heavy reliance on his charisma and the positive glow from the merger are coming to an end. To keep it going now, the other Mr. Schrempp has to come out, perhaps swinging.

HEADLINE: A New Arts Center Opens Against All Odds

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

DATELINE: NORTH ADAMS, Mass.

 BODY:
There is likely to be a huge sigh of relief in this corner of the Berkshires on Sunday with the opening of the $37 million Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art after 13 roller-coaster years and a last-minute scramble to install the giant artworks it was designed to display. MASS MOCA, as the center has become known, is a marriage of art and urban renewal fraught by politics, economic constraints and uncertain artistic ambitions.
The 13-acre grounds and cross-disciplinary programs (summer offerings include the premiere of Walt Disney's latest movie, "Dinosaur," and video and dance performances) have been designed to give this sleepy, economically depressed town more attention than it has drawn since its days as a bustling manufacturing center in the late 1700's. 
 Just days ago installers were scurrying to hang Robert Rauschenberg's immense " 1/4 Mile or 2 Furlong Piece" in a gallery as long as a football field, screw together fluorescent light fixtures for a series of works by Dan Flavin and attach neon numbers to a piece by the Italian sculptor Mario Merz so they would appear to trail behind a bright red motorcycle placed 20 feet high on a wall. Outdoors, workers were laying cobblestones in the courtyard and cleaning up months of construction debris.
That MASS MOCA is opening at all is a striking accomplishment. "MASS MOCA has had more lives than a cat, more ups and downs than an elevator," said the Mayor of North Adams, John Barrett 3d. He lobbied for the project from the start, excited by the prospect of creating about 100 new jobs and attracting 120,000 visitors a year to a blue-collar town that had always played second fiddle to neighboring Williamstown.
"It's giving this city credibility for the first time since the last turn of the century," Mayor Barrett said. "I could see from Day Three that MASS MOCA could transform the community. It already has."
Being in the midst of the Berkshires' lively arts scene, nearly four hours from New York and three hours from Boston, gives MASS MOCA hopes of luring a ready-made audience. Two million people a year already visit cultural institutions in this part of Massachusetts, like Tanglewood in Lenox, summer home to the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, and the Williams College Museum of Art and the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, both in Williamstown.
The new contemporary arts center is made up of a collection of light-filled 19th-century factory buildings, home of the Sprague Electric Company until 1984, spread across carefully planned outdoor spaces. Abandoned mills and overgrown courtyards have been renovated to house 19 galleries, a 10,000-square-foot black-box theater, an outdoor cinema, two courtyards for performance art, 5,000 square feet of rehearsal and production space and 60,000 square feet of office and retail space. There are also outdoor artworks like "Tree Logic," a series of upside-down trees by the Australian artist Natalie Jeremijenko paid for by the Clark Art Institute.
"We have yet to have an artist who comes here who doesn't have a big idea," said Joseph C. Thompson, MASS MOCA's director since 1988. "These buildings have a heft that invites large gestures."
Still, few institutions have faced as many problems trying to open. Over the years the project has been referred to MEGALO MOCA to a doomed white elephant. There was controversy over the commitment of millions of dollars in state money, skepticism about the arts center's ambitions and concern regarding its ephemeral collections.
The center's genesis is described by Thomas Krens, now director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan, who ran the Williams College Museum of Art from 1981 to 1988. He said the idea of the center came to him on Nov. 14, 1986, at 7:30 P.M.
"I was driving on this highway between Cologne and Frankfurt. I had just left an art fair in Cologne where there was this young dealer from Hamburg who couldn't afford a booth so he rented an abandoned factory building. I was in the midst of building an addition to the Williams College of Art, and I was aware that 17,000 square feet wasn't enough. I didn't have the capacity to show large works of art. So I'm driving down this highway and I have an insight, a flash."
 
So, 'You've Got This Old Mill. . . .'
When he returned to Williams, Mr. Krens went to see the Mayor.
"Krens showed up in my office and said, you've got this old mill you're trying to get rid of that could be turned into a museum," Mr. Barrett recalled. "He talked about how they were doing projects like this in Los Angeles. A week later he came back with someone from the Dukakis administration" in Boston.
Originally, Mr. Krens had a different site in mind, but then Sprague Electric closed and its complex was for sale. (The buildings were given to MASS MOCA in 1994 by American Annuity Group, which absorbed Sprague.)
The notion of transforming abandoned factory buildings into an arts center was not new, but getting the government to underwrite a museum meant to help an economically depressed city was a novel achievement. Mr. Krens has since pulled that off in Bilbao, Spain, and the Dia Center for the Arts is doing the same in the depressed Hudson River town of Beacon, N.Y.
Mr. Krens enlisted Mr. Thompson, a Williams graduate, to help gather statistics and do feasibility studies. With the backing of Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Legislature in 1988 approved a $35 million grant for the project. There was talk that important collectors would promise portions of their holdings for long-term loan to the museum, among them the Italian industrialist Count Giuseppe Panza di Biumo, who had more than 200 artworks from the 1960's and 1970's. Mr. Thompson was named director of the museum and Mr. Krens chairman of a cultural development commission.
Then catastrophe struck: Mr. Krens left Williams to become director of the Guggenheim, and support for large-scale government-financed projects was coming under fire as the state economy crumbled.
At first it seemed that the Guggenheim connection might improve the situation. Mr. Krens started seeing MASS MOCA as a satellite of the New York museum. But the Guggenheim was facing financial problems and the museum's board was not eager to take on new projects. Then in 1991 the Guggenheim bought the Panza collection for $30 million, though it agreed to lend parts of it to MASS MOCA.
In 1988 Governor Dukakis, a strong supporter of the project, was running for president. But as his campaign fell apart, so did the Massachusetts economy, recalled Mr. Thompson. Worse, contemporary art was getting a bad name and support for government arts funding collapsed. "We were getting slaughtered," Mr. Thompson said.
In the last days of his term Mr. Dukakis released part of the promised $35 million. But when William F. Weld became Governor in 1991, he overturned the approval, questioning the project's reliance on public funds. He later relented on the condition that the project raise $12 million privately.
In five months Mr. Thompson gathered 650 pledges totaling about $1 million. "Most of the money came from up and down Main Street," he said.
 
A Long Wait For Money to Build
 Over the years, with pressure to keep the project broad-based and economically viable, and with artists crossing over into video and performance art, the vision of MASS MOCA has changed. "It was no longer just a museum but an arts center," Mr. Thompson said.
But it took another two years to get the first check from the state, $18 million for the first phase of the construction. Since then the state has released another $4 million and Mr. Thompson has raised the rest from private sources. Then came the issue of what to put in the enormous galleries. The Guggenheim no longer seemed a reliable partner, so Mr. Thompson began looking elsewhere.
One resource was the Dia Center for the Arts, with its collection of 1960's and 1970's works. Dia, run by Mr. Thompson's friend and colleague Michael Govan, was seeking a large space to house its permanent collection to free up its building in the Chelsea section of Manhattan for special exhibitions.
Mr. Govan, like Mr. Thompson, is a Williams graduate and, also like Mr. Thompson, is a Krens protege.
 
A Setback, Then New Lenders
"We considered MASS MOCA, but it wasn't a perfect fit," said Mr. Govan. But it took time to reach that conclusion, and for months, Mr. Thompson said, he counted on Dia's collection to fill its galleries. Instead, Dia decided to stay closer to home, preferring a similar situation in Beacon, an hour's drive from Manhattan.
Then Mr. Krens stepped back into the picture, pulling together major works from the Guggenheim's collection for loan. Other institutions have lent as well, including Dia.
"We're more than a lender," said Mr. Krens. "I'm the founder of MASS MOCA, I lobbied for its money. We're a collaborator."
Mr. Thompson said the Guggenheim had sent four staff members to help MASS MOCA with its installations.
The new arts center has just one curator and no art of its own. Mr. Thompson intends for it to stay that way, at least for now. "We're an open shop, a platform for institutional collaboration," he said. "We don't plan to form a collection because we couldn't begin to compete with the Museum of Modern Art or the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. But we'll commission works and if something feels right then we'll try to acquire it.
"There's so much good work that needs to be seen that never gets a proper home."

HEADLINE: In America;
Public vs. Private Gore

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
Al Gore was critiquing his own performance. He knew he had not done well. He had been onstage Tuesday afternoon with Bill Clinton, who makes it look so easy. The President was the warm-up act in Edinburg, a town of 40,000 near the southern tip of Texas. He praised the Vice President. He got the crowd ready. And then the spotlight moved to Mr. Gore.
The speech was a snooze, and was immediately panned by the reporters in attendance. Even Andrew Cuomo, a staunch Gore ally and a good friend, damned the Vice President with faint praise. "The President," said Mr. Cuomo, "is a master communicator of historic proportions. I believe he is one of the best ever. The Vice President is a very effective communicator." 
 In an interview a few hours after the speech, Mr. Gore said, "I think I went too long today." He told me he had been "carried away" by the personal stories he had heard in Sebastian, a poverty-stricken border town that has benefited from the enterprise zones championed by Mr. Gore.
He said, "I wanted to share those stories and that put an extra 10 minutes into the speech, which I should have whacked out of the back end." But by the time he got to the back end, he couldn't find a spot to make the cut. So he stayed with the lengthy prepared text.
The truth is that the speech, over all, was not very good. The personal stories were well received, but the speech was unfocused and was laden with far too many personal greetings and too much bureaucratic jargon. Al Gore has some good ideas, but you wouldn't have known it from the speech on Tuesday.
The Vice President needs a couple of crackerjack speechwriters and he needs a ruthless editor. Fast.
During the interview, in response to questions about education and the economy, Mr. Gore displayed the kind of persona -- intelligent, energetic and committed to progress -- that would likely serve him well if it were exhibited more often in public.
"My whole theme," he said, "is to keep the prosperity going and use it to make sure that nobody's left behind." What must be recognized, he said, is that education and the economy are inseparable as policy matters "because we are in an information age, and that's more than a cliche, it's a reality."
He noted that more than half of American businesses had trouble filling job vacancies because of a lack of qualified applicants. He noted that in a comparison of some 20 countries, 12th graders in the United States ranked near the bottom in math and science. Other performance levels are comparably dismal. It is evident, said Mr. Gore, that if the U.S. is to continue leading the world economically it cannot continue to lag so far behind in the education of its children.
Mr. Gore spoke quickly and at times passionately. He said too many American schools were overcrowded, too many teachers were overburdened and too many school buildings were in disrepair. His top priority as President, said Mr. Gore, would be to bring a level of improvement to the nation's schools that would be so great as to seem "revolutionary."
That may be. But Mr. Gore will never be President if he does not get his act together. Whether you agreed with Ronald Reagan or not, he had a clear and concise message. John F. Kennedy had brilliant speeches penned by Theodore Sorensen and others. Mr. Gore will never have the charisma or the performance skills of a Reagan or a Kennedy, but there is no reason for him to be unable to formulate and articulate a clear and compelling message.
You call on the experts, you craft the message, and then you travel the country pounding the message home. Mr. Gore has one advantage. He actually has a message he believes in.
Near the end of the interview, Mr. Gore said: "I say to groups out there, 'Look, if you don't want a President who's going to take the oath of office on Jan. 20 at high noon 2001 committed heart and soul to moving Heaven and earth to bringing revolutionary change to our schools, vote for somebody else. But if that's what you want, I'd like to have your support for me and for this agenda.' "
Not bad at all. That's a lot better than losing your audience in the first 10 minutes by introducing every two-bit bureaucrat and party functionary in sight.

HEADLINE: Envoy to North Korea Delivers Clinton Letter

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, May 26

 BODY:
North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, received a letter today from President Clinton brought by a special envoy to the isolated Communist country, the official North Korean news agency reported.
The envoy, William Perry, delivered the letter through Kim Yong Nam, head of North Korea's legislative Supreme People's Assembly, according to the Korean Central News Agency, which was monitored in Seoul. 
 Last week, White House officials said that Mr. Perry's mission was to deliver a proposal that the 50-year-old economic embargo against the country be lifted gradually in exchange for a series of major concessions, including an agreement that the North will end its long-range missile program.
It is still unclear whether the enigmatic North Korean leader plans to meet Mr. Perry in person. Washington hopes for such a meeting.
Mr. Perry arrived on Tuesday for talks aiming to persuade the North Korean leadership to abandon its suspected nuclear arms and missile development programs. He heads the highest-level United States delegation to travel to North Korea during the rule of Kim Jong Il, who took over following the 1994 death of his father, longtime ruler Kim Il Sung.
Kim Yong Nam, who is also North Korea's second-highest official in the ruling Workers' Party, received Mr. Perry and other American delegates at the North Korean legislative hall.
North Korean television footage carried by South Korea's MBC-TV showed Mr. Perry shaking hands with Kim Yong Nam before officials from both sides sat down facing each other across a long conference table.
Mr. Perry then handed President Clinton's letter to Mr. Kim. Typed on the yellow cover was, "His Excellency, Kim Jong Il, Supreme Leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Pyongyang."
The footage later showed Mr. Perry and his party watching a performance by North Korean acrobats.
South Korean news media have speculated that in his personal letter, Mr. Clinton urged Kim Jong Il to make concessions on weapons proliferation, promising the famine-stricken North both economic assistance and improved relations with Washington as rewards.
Former President Jimmy Carter and Congressional delegations have visited North Korea, but Mr. Perry is the first to make an official visit representing the President of the United States.
This week, an American inspection team visited an underground building outside Pyongyang. North Korea is suspected of using the site to revive its nuclear weapons program, which was suspended under a 1994 accord with Washington.

HEADLINE: Have We Forgotten The Path To Peace?

BYLINE: By Jimmy Carter; Jimmy Carter, the 39th President of the United States, is chairman of the nonprofit Carter Center, which seeks to advance peace and health around the world.

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
After the cold war, many expected that the world would enter an era of unprecedented peace and prosperity. Those who live in developed nations might think this is the case today, with the possible exception of the war in Kosovo. But at the Carter Center we monitor all serious conflicts in the world, and the reality is that the number of such wars has increased dramatically.
One reason is that the United Nations was designed to deal with international conflicts, and almost all the current ones are civil wars in developing countries. This creates a peacemaking vacuum that is most often filled by powerful nations that concentrate their attention on conflicts that affect them, like those in Iraq, Bosnia and Serbia. While the war in Kosovo rages and dominates the world's headlines, even more destructive conflicts in developing nations are systematically ignored by the United States and other powerful nations. 
 One can traverse Africa, from the Red Sea in the northeast to the southwestern Atlantic coast, and never step on peaceful territory. Fifty thousand people have recently perished in the war between Eritrea and Ethiopia, and almost two million have died during the 16-year conflict in neighboring Sudan. That war has now spilled into northern Uganda, whose troops have joined those from Rwanda to fight in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire). The other Congo (Brazzaville) is also ravaged by civil war, and all attempts to bring peace to Angola have failed. Although formidable commitments are being made in the Balkans, where white Europeans are involved, no such concerted efforts are being made by leaders outside of Africa to resolve the disputes. This gives the strong impression of racism.
Because of its dominant role in the United Nations Security Council and NATO, the United States tends to orchestrate global peacemaking. Unfortunately, many of these efforts are seriously flawed. We have become increasingly inclined to sidestep the time-tested premises of negotiation, which in most cases prevent deterioration of a bad situation and at least offer the prospect of a bloodless solution. Abusive leaders can best be induced by the simultaneous threat of consequences and the promise of reward -- at least legitimacy within the international community.
The approach the United States has taken recently has been to devise a solution that best suits its own purposes, recruit at least tacit support in whichever forum it can best influence, provide the dominant military force, present an ultimatum to recalcitrant parties and then take punitive action against the entire nation to force compliance.
The often tragic result of this final decision is that already oppressed citizens suffer, while the oppressor may feel free of further consequences if he perpetrates even worse crimes. Through control of the news media, he is often made to seem heroic by defending his homeland against foreign aggression and shifting blame for economic or political woes away from himself.
Our general purposes are admirable: to enhance peace, freedom, democracy, human rights and economic progress. But this flawed approach is now causing unwarranted suffering and strengthening unsavory regimes in several countries, including Sudan, Cuba, Iraq and -- the most troubling example -- Serbia.
There, the international community has admirable goals of protecting the rights of Kosovars and ending the brutal policies of Slobodan Milosevic. But the decision to attack the entire nation has been counterproductive, and our destruction of civilian life has now become senseless and excessively brutal. There is little indication of success after more than 25,000 sorties and 14,000 missiles and bombs, 4,000 of which were not precision guided.
The expected few days of aerial attacks have now lengthened into months, while more than a million Kosovars have been forced from their homes, many never to return even under the best of circumstances. As the American-led force has expanded targets to inhabited areas and resorted to the use of anti-personnel cluster bombs, the result has been damage to hospitals, offices and residences of a half-dozen ambassadors, and the killing of hundreds of innocent civilians and an untold number of conscripted troops.
Instead of focusing on Serbian military forces, missiles and bombs are now concentrating on the destruction of bridges, railways, roads, electric power, and fuel and fresh water supplies. Serbian citizens report that they are living like cavemen, and their torment increases daily. Realizing that we must save face but cannot change what has already been done, NATO leaders now have three basic choices: to continue bombing ever more targets until Yugoslavia (including Kosovo and Montenegro) is almost totally destroyed, to rely on Russia to resolve our dilemma through indirect diplomacy, or to accept American casualties by sending military forces into Kosovo.
So far, we are following the first, and worst, option -- and seem to be moving toward including the third. Despite earlier denials by American and other leaders, the recent decision to deploy a military force of 50,000 troops on the Kosovo border confirms that the use of ground troops will be necessary to assure the return of expelled Albanians to their homes.
How did we end up in this quagmire? We have ignored some basic principles that should be applied to the prevention or resolution of all conflicts:
* Short-circuiting the long-established principles of patient negotiation leads to war, not peace.
* Bypassing the Security Council weakens the United Nations and often alienates permanent members who may be helpful in influencing warring parties.
* The exclusion of nongovernmental organizations from peacemaking precludes vital "second track" opportunities for resolving disputes.
* Ignoring serious conflicts in Africa and other underdeveloped regions deprives these people of justice and equal rights.
* Even the most severe military or economic punishment of oppressed citizens is unlikely to force their oppressors to yield to American demands.
* The United States' insistence on the use of cluster bombs, designed to kill or maim humans, is condemned almost universally and brings discredit on our nation (as does our refusal to support a ban on land mines).
Even for the world's only superpower, the ends don't always justify the means.

Japan Officials Get Tough With U.S. Financial Firms

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 26

 BODY:
For years, American officials have called on Japanese regulators to be tougher on the financial services industry here, but they hardly expected that the result would be raids on American companies.
Japanese officials respond that they are scrutinizing the Americans because Japanese companies had hidden losses and engaged in deceptive practices after American financial experts advised them of the latest methods. 
 Thus, Cresvale International Ltd., owned by Princeton Economics International Ltd., became the latest foreign target on Monday, as Japanese regulators made a snap inspection and stepped up the intensity of their inspections, just days after they had marched into Lehman Brothers.
The regulatory authority, the Financial Supervisory Agency, was spun off from the Finance Ministry a year ago, and it is trying to show that it is cracking down on financial misconduct. The Finance Ministry had often tolerated financial misreporting -- or even tacitly hinted to banks to file deceptive reports -- and the lack of clear and reliable financial information and tough regulation is often blamed for some of Japan's banking problems. The new regulators in particular are trying to demonstrate their role as tough watchdogs in preparation for a more intense and embattled environment under Japan's financial deregulation, called the Big Bang.
Japanese banks, securities firms and insurance companies have complained that the Big Bang liberalization means they face powerful foreign competition at just the time when many Japanese companies are staggered by losses, bad debts, and stricter rules.
Though regulators have been poring over the books of Japanese banks for more than a year, they have long neglected the foreign banks. Indeed, Cresvale, which specializes in brokering and underwriting equities and bonds in Japan, was last inspected five years ago.
John C. Gracey, branch manager of Cresvale in Tokyo, said on Tuesday that the examination was "routine." Still, the sudden audit of Cresvale, so soon after regulators swooped into the Tokyo offices of Lehman Brothers last Thursday, also suggests that the regulator's 160 inspectors are close to ending their examination of Credit Suisse First Boston, which has been the focus of regulatory scrutiny since January.
Regulators are expected to wind up that investigation by the middle of next month and are weighing penalties and temporary suspensions for some of the company's operations. Officials at the Financial Supervisory Agency are also dogged by the memories of American penalties imposed by the Federal Reserve Bank on Japan's Daiwa Bank, after a rogue trader was found to have hidden around $1.1 billion in losses.
Though that penalty was $340 million and some in Japan would like to impose a similarly tough penalty this time against Credit Suisse, there are legal rules here that appear to limit penalties in Japan to much smaller sums, possibly as little as $1.2 million.
Derivatives, which have been an extremely profitable business for foreign firms in Japan, have long been a gray legal area of finance in Japan. Foreign executives are watching the Credit Suisse case closely because they worry that Japanese regulators may be trying to make up for ambiguities in the law. Japanese officials respond that international compliance standards should be adopted in Japan as well, even if the laws are vague.
The investigation into Credit Suisse had been complicated by the initial response of panicky employees in Credit Suisse's Tokyo office, who virtually within a day after Japanese auditors began inspecting the books in January began shredding important documents that might have revealed violations by the firm.
After Credit Suisse executives told auditors in February of the document destruction, Japanese regulators became more suspicious and wary of other potentially evasive tactics that the firm might adopt. Credit Suisse, worried about its reputation and about clients walking away from the firm, recently suspended two senior executives and cut bonuses of others. And last Friday, it publicly apologized for any misconduct that may have obstructed the investigation.
Japan's regulators have been looking into the accusations that Credit Suisse and other firms, perhaps even Lehman Brothers, may have helped Japanese financial institutions, like Long Term Credit Bank, conceal losses through a convoluted path of transactions that has taken advantage of Japan's loose accounting rules. Those accounting rules, which Japan is now modernizing, have long allowed Japanese companies to obscure their books.
Neither Credit Suisse nor the Financial Supervisory Agency will officially comment on any such transactions.
The exact reasons for the Government's inspection at Cresvale has not been disclosed. The firm was acquired from a British investment bank in late 1995 by Princeton Economics International, a global economic research and advisory company based in New Jersey.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Time isn't money if you are a parent badly in need of both.

BYLINE: By Michael M. Weinstein 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT CLINTON'S Council of Economic Advisers issued a report this week that it hopes can turn the notion of a "time crunch" into a rallying cry for the Administration's agenda for families.
Mothers, the report shows, are spending substantially more time working for pay today than they did 30 years ago, leaving them less time to spend at home with their children. The same day that the council released its report, the President proposed that states use surplus unemployment insurance money to subsidize parents who take time off to care for a new child. 
 Few will take exception to the report's data, though there will be critics of its recommendations. The council presumes without citing data that the time mothers spend working out of the home creates a worrisome amount of stress and that the report provides statistical spine for Government-led solutions. Perhaps. But the recommendations appear weak-kneed and unfocused.
Based primarily on the Government's annual survey of 50,000 households, the report says that the percentage of married women with children who work for pay soared to 68 percent in 1996 from 38 percent in 1969. By 1996, almost two-thirds of single mothers worked for pay. Between 1969 and 1996, two-parent families increased their annual hours of paid work by about 20 percent, and single parents increased their hours by about 30 percent. At the same time, the share of single-parent families more than doubled. Single parent families, the report says, are at greater risk to be "cash strapped and time poor."
The data do not document how parents spend their time at home. The council estimates, however, that the combination of increased hours of paid work and of the shift toward single-parent families has reduced the maximum amount of time that parents make available to their children by 22 hours a week in recent decades.
By piling one interesting statistic on top of another, the council highlights drastic changes in American family life over a brief period. The council's findings are unlikely to prove controversial. Its interpretation of those trends will be.
The council says the trends on work outside the home "present significant policy challenges to private employers and government." Many economists will argue that employers have ample incentive to accommodate the needs of parents without nudging from Washington. After all, why would employers balk if workers preferred flexible work hours and generous maternity leaves to higher wages? The fact that the percentage of full-time workers with flexible work schedules roughly doubled in only six years, between 1991 and 1997, is evidence that employers do respond to the needs of working parents.
But there are sound economic reasons to question whether markets will provide the mix of fringe benefits and wages that working parents seek. Lawrence F. Katz, a labor economist at Harvard University, says there is the possibility that problems of "adverse selection" interfere with employer decisions. Companies might want to offer generous maternity leaves, for example, but fear that if they move first they will attract a disproportionate share of job applicants who seek the maternity benefits but no long-term tie to the company. If so, Mr. Katz says, "even employers who want to provide generous benefits will not do so."
Christopher Ruhm, an economist at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, says that his studies show that when Europe imposed more generous leave and other benefits, the percentage of women entering or remaining in employment rose. "If European employers were already providing the right mix of benefits and wages, you would not expect women to react to a change in rules."
The council's report offers four policy recommendations: flexible work hours; income support, like high minimum wages, for low-wage workers; affordable child care and after-school care, and encouragement of two-parent families. But the menu of recommendations is vague, poorly focused and full of self-congratulatory language. A higher minimum wage, for example, might be a dandy anti-poverty measure, but it does little to solve the problem of time crunch.
There are effective alternatives, says Prof. Claudia Goldin, an economic historian at Harvard. "The report's feeble recommendations overlook the obvious place where Government can make a difference, the public schools," she said. "The reason that that public schools don't open until 8 or 9, close at 2 or 3 and stay shut during the summer is historical. The hours no longer make sense." The most direct way to help working mothers, she says, "would be to open schools earlier, keep them open into the evening and make them available during the summer."
Professor Goldin's idea makes so much sense, one wonders why middle- and low-income families have not voted for schools to open longer in local elections. They surely wield a majority in many communities. If working parents are unmotivated to pry open the school door in exchange for higher taxes, perhaps they are not suffering as much stress and frustration as the council implicitly assumes. That would provide a ripe topic for another council report.

Euro is SeenFalling Below The $1 Level

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Where's the bottom for the euro?
That was the question yesterday as Europe's single currency plunged below $1.05 for the first time. The euro is now down 10 percent since it began trading at the beginning of the year at $1.17. 
 While some currency strategists expect the euro to stabilize near its current level, they are warning that it could break through the $1 barrier. Michael Rosenberg, head of global foreign exchange research at Deutsche Bank, said that "99 in '99 remains a possibility,"
For American tourists preparing for European trips this summer, the decline could not be better timed. The euro's fall is mirrored in the value of the 11 currencies it represents, including the German mark, the French franc and the Italian lira. Credit card charges for tourists are in euros, and there are euro traveler's checks. But cash is still in the old local currencies. Paper euros and coins will be introduced in 2002.
The news is not so good for American exporters, however, whose products are becoming more expensive in Continental Europe as the dollar rises in value. Britain and three other nations in the European Union -- Greece, Denmark and Sweden -- are not part of the euro.
In New York, the euro settled at $1.0455 yesterday, down 1.4 percent from $1.0601 on Tuesday. The dollar slipped slightly against the Japanese yen, to 122.17 from 122.70.
The reason for the euro's weakness is simple: the American economy is continuing to grow briskly while the economies of the euro members, especially Germany and Italy, remain sluggish at best. Vibrant worker productivity in the United States and the belief that the potential for growth here is much better in Europe also helps the dollar.
Those advantages for the dollar have been heightened by the widening of the differential in interest rates here and in Europe, which also attracts investors. Since last fall, for example, the spread between rates on two-year Treasury notes here and in Europe has gone from six-tenths of a percentage point to 2.7 percentage points, Mr. Rosenberg said. The recent move by the Federal Reserve to lean toward higher interest rates helped widen that spread.
Then yesterday, investors traded with a new worry about the euro. Late on Tuesday, the European Commission approved an increase in the size of the 1999 Italian budget deficit to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product from 2 percent. That move was seen by some strategists as a weakening of the fiscal discipline that is supposed to be one of the pillars of Euroland, the nickname for the countries that are linked together behind the euro.
"That is a sign of fiscal imprudence," said Jeremy Fand, senior foreign exchange strategist at BankBoston. He is forecasting that the euro will fall to 90 cents by the end of the year.
Robert Sinche, the senior currency strategist at Citibank, is not as harsh in his interpretation, noting that the stability agreement for the euro restricts government budget deficits to 3 percent of gross domestic product, and Italy is still below this key level.
But he says that this restriction on government spending means there is little hope European governments can put together a stimulus program to jump-start their economies. This means the only lift can come from another interest rate cut by the new European Central Bank, which reduced its benchmark rate by half of a percentage point in April. And the anticipation of such a move, which would just widen the gap between interest rates in United States and Europe, is weighing down the euro.
Mr. Sinche and other analysts also said that the NATO campaign against Yugoslavia was also undermining the euro. The threat of a land war is one negative. Paying for it, and the rebuilding of Kosovo and Yugoslavia, given the euro nations' tight fiscal restrictions, is another.
Mr. Sinche, however, is forecasting that the American economy will slow in the second half of the year, while Europe should begin to rebound. Because of this, he is forecasting that the euro will end the year in the $1.05 to $1.10 range, above where it is now.
The decline of the euro can be nothing but an embarrassment for the leaders of its 11 constituents and the European Central Bank, which is overseeing the currency. Still, several officials said they were not worried about the decline.
Wim Duisenberg, the president of the European Central Bank, said the euro's decline was "not at all unnatural, also not at all unexpected" given the sluggish economic growth in Europe, according to Bloomberg News. But he added that "recovery is under way, be it very slowly."
Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the European Union commissioner in charge of monetary affairs, also sought to diminish the effect of the euro's decline by pointing out that the euro -- and the currencies it represents -- were at the same level where they were a year ago. "The euro's current level is not worrying," he told Bloomberg News.
While the currencies are close to where they were a year ago, they are not as strong as he implied. The German mark, the French franc and the Italian lira are all down about 5.5 percent.

HEADLINE: To Surprise of Many Experts, Housing Boom Keeps Rolling

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: MEMPHIS

 BODY:
Now that she has taken the plunge, Ptosha Ford likes to pull off Shelby Drive, on her way from her job as a hospital nurse, and visit the construction site of her new home. A yellow earthmover, parked for the night, has cleared the weeds and grass from her small square of land on a cul-de-sac. And Ms. Ford, still in her white uniform and white shoes, walks gingerly across the dusty earth, inspecting the day's progress.
"My boyfriend is upset about me building this house," said Ms. Ford, who is 29 and lives with her parents. "He kind of wanted us to wait until we could do something together. But I didn't want to wait, and I didn't think I could. It has to do with the low interest rates and me working on my independence." 
 Against all expectations, the housing market is continuing to boom. Around the country, home construction and sales of existing homes from January through April ran well ahead of the similar period in 1998, itself a strong year. And the slight weakening last month seems unlikely to reverse the trend unless interest rates move noticeably higher.
Home prices are rising, too, and home ownership has reached its highest level in history: 66.7 percent of America's households.
All this flies in the face of forecasts that housing would begin a long decline in the mid to late 1990's, once the baby boomers were past their big home-buying years. The much smaller succeeding generation, experts predicted, would buy or build many fewer homes, and prices would fall, undermining the chief investment of most Americans. Just the opposite has happened.
The lowest sustained mortgage rates in a generation are a big reason why. In Memphis, which exhibits most of the characteristics of the national housing market, it is almost as cheap to buy or build a house as it is to rent one. Paying only $5,000 down for her $118,000, three-bedroom home, Ms. Ford snagged a 5.87 percent mortgage, which translates into payments of just $850 a month for 30 years. She thought of sharing a rental apartment with two or three friends. "They, too, are buying their own homes," she said.
But low interest rates are not the only reason housing has defied predictions. Childless single people in their 20's, like Ms. Ford and her friends, are buying more homes than anyone had ever expected. Other forces have also kicked in. Jobs are plentiful, which means that in larger households, more members are working and can contribute to home purchases. Immigrants are big buyers. Lenders are demanding down payments that are a smaller percentage of a home's cost.
Further, federally guaranteed mortgages are more generous, with the ceiling now as high as $209,000, up from $176,000 last October. A new $500,000 tax exemption on profits from home sales fosters greater turnover of existing homes. And rising home prices have encouraged many people to move up to larger homes, often in newly built suburbs farther and farther from downtown.
"You have not had conditions this favorable for home ownership since the 1960's," said Eric Belsky, executive director of the Harvard Joint Center on Housing Studies, "and people everywhere are jumping in."
The rich are cashing in their stock market profits to build the million-dollar homes that are appearing in Memphis for the first time, sometimes on plots where smaller homes were torn down. And lower-income people are buying more factory-made mobile homes -- 370,000 last year -- than at any time since 1973, when baby boomer families were piling into the housing market.
So was the forecast wrong that housing would weaken? "The booming stock market and economy are apparently more than offsetting the depressing effects of demographics," said N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economist. His much-quoted 1989 study, published with David N. Weil of Brown University, predicted that the 1990's would be a bad decade for housing.
Mr. Mankiw still holds to this forecast, if not for the 1990's then soon enough. "The demographics will persist, one would expect; they do not change quickly," he said. "But the stock market and the economy do."
 
Older Couples Turn To Small Homes
Still, the housing boom has a demographic wind in its sails that Mr. Mankiw and Mr. Weil had not anticipated. The immigrants who arrived in waves in the 70's and 80's have become eager home buyers. Some baby boomers, renters for years, are finally buying, Harvard's Mr. Belsky says, now that low rates have made home ownership more affordable. Older couples, taking advantage of the 1997 law that exempts from taxes the first $500,000 in profit from a home sale, are increasingly selling the large houses in which they raised their children. In their place, they are purchasing smaller homes, sometimes two smaller homes, one of them a vacation retreat.
One Memphis builder, Baum & Company, has built a whole neighborhood of three-bedroom homes on tiny plots for such customers. "I've put up 14 of these houses and I don't think I've sold any to people with children," said Lee Baum, driving a visitor through Allenby Lakes, a treeless suburban development where homes are still going up near an artificial lake. "Look," he said, "there are no kids on the streets."
Home construction nationwide, as a result of such trends, proceeded at an annual rate of 2.16 million units in the first quarter. Not since the mid-1980's, when many baby boomers were still in their prime home-buying years, has the number been so high. Sales of existing and recently built homes were even more robust in the first quarter, reaching an annual rate of nearly 6 million, a record. And prices are rising smartly in most of the country, including the New York City area, where home sales have jumped and new home construction has also risen, although not by as much as in other areas because of a shortage of plots.
Minorities have been big participants in this thriving market, if not building like Ms. Ford, who is black, then buying the homes of white families who move to larger, newly built homes in the suburbs. Home ownership has risen to a record 46.9 percent of black households from 42 percent in 1992.
Ms. Ford exudes confidence. Four years out of nursing school, with a degree in psychology, she earns $44,000 a year at Methodist Central Hospital as a nurse and nursing instructor. In a city whose unemployment rate is under 4 percent, she takes as a given that she could land another job in a minute at one of Memphis's other hospitals.
While the house being built for her will be mid-sized, at 1,904 square feet, it will mimic the luxuries of larger homes. Vaulted ceilings and tall, arched windows will grace the dining room, living room and master bedroom. The master bath will feature a Jacuzzi bathtub, "his" and "her" sinks and a walk-in closet and dressing area. "Soft Southern architecture," the builders call it. But these are features common in new housing everywhere in the United States, from mansions to cottages.
"If you buy, you want to get what you want," Ms. Ford said, reflecting a preference among young people for what Juliet Schor, a Harvard economist, calls a higher level of perceived luxury than older houses offer. "The high ceilings give the rooms a traditional style," Ms. Ford said. "I am going to decorate with cherry wood and leather."
 
State Program Helps Get a Lower Rate
Her income qualified her for a Tennessee state mortgage program for first-time home buyers that supplements Federally guaranteed mortgages. The mortgages are currently available at a 7.23 percent interest rate, if the mortgage is less than $151,900 in the Memphis area. (The Federal ceiling was lifted in January from $128,250.) With her $5,000 down payment, she shaved the rate even further, to 5.87 percent, thanks in part to a state subsidy. And despite her boyfriend's protests, she jumped in, worried that rates would rise if she delayed.
"He has to wake up and smell the coffee," she said, "and realize that a male can still be head of a household while a woman goes ahead and takes care of the financial obligations."
Her neighbors in South Pointe, a year-old development on the southeastern outskirts of metropolitan Shelby County, are mostly two-earner families -- other nurses, dealers at the crowded gambling casinos in nearby Mississippi, machine-shop workers, self-employed immigrant families, employees of Federal Express, which has opened a huge new facility nearby. Only 15 of the development's 122 homes are still unsold or not yet built, the least expensive listed at $99,990.
"You need to be earning somewhere around $3,000 a month" -- $36,000 a year -- "to handle the payments on that home, assuming a 7 percent mortgage rate," said Preston Pittman, a salesman for Bowden Building and Design, the builders.
America's poorest families have been largely left out of the housing surge. Households with annual incomes under $25,000 -- about one-third of the total -- generally cannot afford monthly mortgage payments on most homes here or elsewhere. That is true even with the low interest rates and the expansion of Government housing programs, according to lenders, housing experts and public officials.
"You can put a person into a house who cannot financially make the payments, and in the long run you do that person a disservice," said Andrew Cuomo, Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. "So you draw a line in the sand: For those who cannot be homeowners, how do you help them pay the rent?"
There is a risk to America's home-buying spree. Home construction accounts for 4.5 percent of the nation's economic activity, and 10 percent or more when all the furnishings and appliances are thrown in. This makes the national economy vulnerable to a downturn in housing. That would happen, some economists say, if mortgage rates rose above 8 percent from the present average of 7.23 percent for a 30-year mortgage.
"There used to be a saying, that in housing demographics was destiny," said Chris Varvares, a partner at Macroeconomic Advisers Inc., in St. Louis. "That was always a white lie, because you knew that economics had a bearing as well, and it does now."
 
The Market Power Of Federal Express
As in much of the nation, the economics could not be more favorable these days in Memphis, a transportation center on the Mississippi River where Federal Express has its headquarters. Its 30,000 local employees, representing 5 percent of the area's work force, are everywhere in the housing market. "Take them away and this market weakens," said Dick Leike, an owner of Crye-Leike, the city's largest realtor.
Some FedEx employees are migrating to Collierville in the southeast, where the recently built Nonconnah Parkway has opened up a rural area to new suburban housing tracts. Near the parkway's far end, FedEx has built a huge research center, staffed so far with 2,000 people -- half the projected number -- earning $60,000 a year on average. And in the fields at either end of the modernistic campus, new homes that sell for $250,000 or more have sprung up, each on a small plot that features a patio and some shrubbery rather than much grass.
"People don't want to be constrained by property," said Linda C. DeBerry, FedEx's managing director of Human Resource Development.
That is one part of the FedEx housing market. Interview Robert B. Carter, the 39-year-old chief technology officer for FedEx's holding company, and it turns out that he occupies a category making its debut in Memphis. "We are kind of moving up in housing," Mr. Carter said -- to a $1 million, 6,000 square foot, 6-bedroom home that he and his wife are building in a gated community in suburban Cordova. They are shedding a 4,000-square foot, four-bedroom home bought six years ago.
In a city where $500,000 buys a mansion, eight homes in Memphis have been completed so far this year with a sales price of at least $1 million, compared with four new homes built for that price in all of 1998. "Chances are we would have stayed put if we could not have built something appreciably different," Mr. Carter said. His stock portfolio -- particularly FedEx shares, which have doubled since last fall -- made the move possible. The new house, he said, is "an affordable, fun project."
Talk to Sally Davenport about the housing behavior of FedEx workers, and it turns out that Ms. Davenport, a FedEx media specialist, represents another national trend: the empty-nester. With her daughter in college, she has used the new $500,000 tax exemption to trade down and pocket a nice gain, tax free. Last summer, Ms. Davenport, who is 50 and earns more than $50,000 a year, sold the home in which she had raised her daughter for $137,000 and bought a smaller, three-bedroom house built only 5 years ago for $115,000.
"I was very aware of trying to hit interest rates at just the right moment," she said, adding that an important attraction of her new home is "the master bath with the Jacuzzi I always wanted and the walk-in closet I never had before."
Ms. DeBerry, the FedEx human-resources executive, sees another national trend right in her own department. In the last two years, she says, she has brought in seven new staff members in their 20's -- five of them single and two married but childless -- and all have bought homes. In the past, she said, the singles would have rented.
"I love it when they buy," Ms. DeBerry said, "because that is more likely to tie them to the community and the company."

The lowest mortgage rates in a generation have helped to increase home ownership to a record 66.7 percent of all households and have fueled a home-construction boom. As a result, home prices are on the rise. Minority home-ownership has risen and young people are buying in unexpected numbers.

U.S.-EuropeanUnion Talks On Privacy Are Sputtering

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 26

 BODY:
After months of negotiations that had appeared headed for success, the United States and the European Union have veered away from each other in a dispute over privacy protection that could disrupt trans-Atlantic electronic commerce.
European authorities continue to insist that the United States fails to provide enough consumer protection from companies that collect and often re-sell personal information. 
 The issue is important because the European Union issued a directive last year that in theory prohibits companies from transmitting personal information to countries that do not offer "adequate" privacy protection.
No one has tried to enforce the prohibition yet, and several European countries have not even passed national laws to carry it out.
But the issue has alarmed many companies, because the directive applies to activities as varied as airline reservations, banking and on-line shopping.
American officials, led by the Commerce Department, have been trying to persuade European officials to accept a system under which American companies would adopt a code of good behavior and be allowed to regulate themselves.
Until recently, both sides seemed intent on reaching a compromise in time for a meeting of President Clinton and European leaders in Cologne on June 21.
But as the negotiators prepare for a key meeting in Brussels on Friday, officials on both sides say the discussions have bogged down. If they fail to reach agreement on Friday, their chances of doing so before the meeting are low.
"We are right back to the old story that they want us to invent a regime that looks like theirs," said David L. Aaron, Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade, in a telephone interview. "Well, we aren't going to do that."
Publicly, European officials say they remain open to a compromise in the next few weeks. "I can tell you there are problems, but the gap is consistently narrowing," said John Mogg, the European Commission's director general for financial services and the top European negotiator.
In the last few days, experts on both sides have become skeptical about a deal. While American officials complain that Europe is trying to impose "data czars" on the United States, European officials charge that American proposals would water down their protections to the point of meaninglessness.
"Americans still have the illusion that they can change the directive, but they can't," said Spiros Simitis, a law professor at Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt and an adviser to the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, on the privacy directive.
At the heart of the dispute are deep differences about the need for governments to protect privacy, particularly when it comes to the use of personal information as a marketing tool.
The European Union's directive requires that companies that collect personal information, whether through routine business transactions or through tracking the sites a person visits on the Internet, must fully disclose what they will do with the information and give people a chance to say no.
It also requires that companies give people access to data files about them and give them the right to correct errors.
In principle, American officials say they agree completely. But they also argue that any system needs to be flexible, and they have adamantly rejected demands to set up quasi-public enforcement authorities.
The American proposals call for giving companies "safe harbor" from the directive if they publicly embrace the European principles themselves. Companies could join self-regulatory associations, like the Better Business Bureau, or simply make formal public commitments to the principles on their own.
The two sides are also squabbling over how much time companies should have in order to comply with the European rules. The United States is pushing for about two years, and the European Union wants to offer only six months.

HEADLINE: A Pyrrhic Victory for Albany

 BODY:
On Tuesday, a Republican county legislator named Thomas Morahan defeated a Democratic county legislator named Kenneth Zebrowski for an open seat in the New York State Senate. As a result, the Republican majority's control of the Senate will rise from 35-25 to 36-25. For this, the Legislature killed a tax worth $360 million to New York City.
Even in a legislative body with a notoriously warped decision-making process, the saga of the Rockland County Senate seat represents a new low. In an attempt to score points for their candidate in a close contest, the Republicans who control the State Senate announced earlier this month that they were going to pass a bill repealing the New York City commuter tax, which imposes a modest levy on people who work in the city but live elsewhere. 
 The Republicans, including New York City's Mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, expected the Assembly Democrats to protect the city's interest and allow the repeal bill to expire in limbo. But Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver stunned everyone by announcing that he intended to help the Democratic cause in Rockland County by passing the bill. Many of his New York City members supported the idea, delighted at the chance to upset Mr. Giuliani.
Now the game-playing is over. Control of the State Senate is unchanged. Commuters, who are already the beneficiaries of a huge state property-tax reduction program, will get a small boost in their take-home pay. The courts will almost surely give the same boon to Connecticut and New Jersey commuters. Unfortunately, when the economy turns down, the city will have several hundred million dollars less revenue each year for services, either for poor neighborhoods represented by many Democrats who supported repealing the tax or for the Manhattan business districts where so many commuters work. When New York City becomes an unpleasant place to do business, the economic engine that drives the region begins to falter.
Mr. Giuliani will probably be long gone from City Hall when that happens. But when the legislators' constituents start complaining about lost services, more dangerous streets and threats of corporate departures for southern climes, perhaps they can console themselves with the memory of how angry he looked when they socked it to him on the commuter tax.
