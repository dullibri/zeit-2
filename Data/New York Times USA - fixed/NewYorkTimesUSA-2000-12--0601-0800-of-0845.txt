HEADLINE: Bush's Debt?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "When the Economy Slows" (editorial, Dec. 20): 
 Whether or not a recession is truly looming, a $1.3 trillion tax cut is ludicrous, especially when one considers that 40 percent of that tax cut would be enjoyed by the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers.
In view of all the challenges that face a new president, that George W. Bush's priorities lie primarily with those of immense wealth tells us that perhaps this is simply part of his "debt" to those who helped put him in office.

HEADLINE: November Factory Orders Up 2.3%, Led by Aircraft

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
The Commerce Department reported today that factory orders rose 2.3 percent in November after a 6.5 percent drop during October.
A surge in aircraft orders led the increase. Excluding transportation equipment, orders rose 0.4 percent in November after falling 3.1 percent during October. 
 Spending on durable goods, unadjusted for inflation, fell 1.2 percent in November, the same as October. General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler sold fewer new cars and trucks in November, and trimmed production to reduce inventories. The appliance manufacturer, Whirlpool, plans to cut as many as 6,000 jobs, or 10 percent of its worldwide work force, because of sluggish sales.
Spending on nondurable goods was unchanged after rising 0.4 percent in October. Retailers' same-store sales rose 3.5 percent in November as the chains cut prices on clothing and other items to attract holiday shoppers. Ann Taylor Stores said earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter would miss forecasts because of the early markdown of prices on velvet clothing and other holiday items.
Consumer spending rose in November, led by higher utility costs, while incomes recovered from the previous month's decline, the department said.
The 0.3 percent increase in spending on goods and services last month followed a 0.4 percent rise during October, the report said. Adjusted for inflation -- the result largely of rising energy prices -- spending rose 0.1 percent, the weakest performance since a similar increase in March. Incomes rose 0.4 percent in November after a 0.1 percent decline in October, when farm subsidies dropped. Even with the rise in incomes, consumers cut back their spending on automobiles and other expensive products.
The personal savings rate fell to a negative 0.8 percent during the month, the lowest on record, from a negative 0.7 percent during the previous month. The savings rate weighs current income from wages, salaries, businesses and government payments against spending. It does not account for borrowed money, income from investments, or withdrawals from prior savings.
Meanwhile, disposable income, or the money left over after taxes, rose 0.3 percent in November after dropping 0.3 percent in October.
Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of economic output, and the Federal Reserve's efforts to combat inflation with higher borrowing rates have restrained the pace of growth. On Thursday, Commerce Department figures showed economic growth was the slowest in four years during the third quarter.

Canada Strengthens Internet Privacy

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Dec. 22

 BODY:
A new law to protect personal information disclosed through electronic transactions will take effect in Canada on Jan. 1, and it will eventually affect all domestic companies and those in the United States that have Canadian subsidiaries.
Initially, the new law, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, will cover only companies that are federally regulated -- mainly banks and airlines. But by 2004, anyone doing business in Canada must comply. 
 Under the law, the consent of consumers would be required if their personal information was used commercially -- and it would be illegal to use data gathered in the past without that consent. Consumers will also have the right to review any information about them that is on file.
A privacy commission is being set up to investigate violations, while protecting whistle-blowers, and to take law-breakers to court if necessary.
"Canada is committed to the digital economy, and it is important to build trust in it," said Brian C. Keith, a lawyer at Borden Ladner Gervais in Toronto. "I'm telling clients that even if the legislation doesn't apply to you now, don't go to sleep. If this legislation doesn't apply, other laws will."
Elizabeth McNaughton, a lawyer at Blake, Cassels & Graydon, another Toronto law firm, agrees. Companies have not thought through the full range of privacy issues, she said. "It's not limited to electronic means of commerce," she said. "It's as much an issue for people who fill out ballots at the supermarket."
According to a survey by Michael Geist, a law professor at the University of Ottawa, half of the commercial World Wide Web sites in Canada do not have a privacy policy, and many of the existing policies are weak. Of 259 sites surveyed this summer, 40 percent did not indicate whether personal information could be given to a third party.
Canadians have been more reluctant than Americans to buy goods or make other financial transactions on the Internet. Although Canadians spend more time online, a 1998 study found that only 12 percent with Internet access had made an electronic purchase, compared with 39 percent in the United States. Canadians were more concerned about disclosing personal information, and not being able to examine goods.
Companies must not only set up procedures for disclosure and consent, but also name someone responsible for privacy matters.
Mr. Keith of Borden Ladner said he did not think foreign subsidiaries would find it difficult to meet the new standards, although it could be a big undertaking for, say, a financial company.
There has been plenty of warning. The American Express Company of New York is among those that have already complied with the new Canadian law. Ms. McNaughton of Blake Cassels said she thought that other companies in the United States that have well-developed privacy policies would have no problem meeting the Canadian standards.
European companies already operate under similar rules. Canada's legislation has been pushed ahead partly to protect the trans-Atlantic flow of commercial information.

Where It's Dark and Cold Outside, and Inside, Too

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: TBILISI, Georgia, Dec. 21

 BODY:
This was not supposed to be yet another bitter winter in the gracious and fraying capital of this lovely and distressed country.
An American energy company, the AES Corporation, bought the city's electric system last year and promised that Tbilisi's 1.2 million residents would no longer spend most of their winter days in darkness and their nights shivering without heat. 
 But overcoming the obstacles, from a broken-down power generating system and vast corruption to the effects of a summer drought and Russian meddling, proved too difficult. The electric system -- tweaked, massaged, seemingly held together with baling wire -- meets little more than half the demand.
So people persevere through another winter with five or six hours of electricity a day, even less than in previous years. Essential services like hospitals, government offices and the subway have steady supplies; everyone else must improvise.
One government official admitted that he runs a line from his office to his nearby apartment. Restaurants, hotels and businesses of any size rely on gasoline-powered generators, and some have switched to natural gas for heat, despite the expense.
The three-fourths of the population who cannot afford gas huddle around wood-burning stoves and sleep beneath layers of blankets. Shop owners who do not have generators sit glumly in ice-cold stores illuminated by candlelight.
Outside the capital, things are grimmer. Many places have gone without any electricity for weeks, a condition described by an official at the state Energy Ministry as "full darkness."
Vazha Javakhishvili, who lives in Natakhtari, a village 12 miles north of Tbilisi, said people grew so angry after two months without electricity that they blocked the main street.
"Now we have electricity a few hours most nights, so it's better," Mr. Javakhishvili said as he stood outside the small apartment where he and his wife, Sopiko, live with their 6-month-old daughter, Nino, and a tiny electric coil for heat.
The perennial shortage has political implications for President Eduard Shevardnadze, the West-leaning veteran of the Soviet era who has guided Georgia through a civil war and transition to independence but who has been unable to halt the economic slide. So far the opposition has remained muted, but there have been signs of unrest.
Last winter, protests did not start until February or so. But early this month, about 100 people took to the streets in the center of Tbilisi for several nights, blocking intersections with burning tires and chanting antigovernment slogans.
"It reminded me of the chaos during the civil war," said Ekaterine Khvedelidze, a translator and Tbilisi native. "It was very frightening."
The demonstrations stopped after the minister of internal affairs warned that the authorities had videotapes of the demonstrations and that leaders could face punishment.
The unrest also carries implications for foreign investors, who are badly needed but remain wary of the deep economic troubles.
AES, by far the largest outside investor, bought 75 percent of Tbilisi's electric company, acquired power generators and refurbished a system neglected since the collapse of the Soviet Union a decade ago.
The company is the target of populist anger here, but Mr. Shevardnadze praises it and reminded Georgians last week in a radio address that the country could not have afforded the $224 million invested so far by AES. "Had it not been for the above-mentioned investments," he said, "the Georgian energy sector would have collapsed completely."
AES, based in Arlington, Va., operates electric power systems in 24 countries, including others in the former Soviet Union. Its officials knew they were in for a rough ride in Tbilisi, but there have been a few surprises.
"This is the toughest business we've got," said Michael Scholey, the general director here. "You don't see the combination of problems anywhere else."
Mr. Scholey ticked off the list: The state-owned utility was collecting only about 10 percent of its bills from its 400,000 customers. Its only computer was used for payroll; customer accounts were kept in hand-written ledgers. Sometimes ledgers for entire apartment blocks disappeared, along with any possibility of billing the users.
A quarter of the customers did not have meters, and the meters that did exist were often faulty after years of neglect. Transformers sprouted illegal connections by the dozen.
And some thieves were more brazen. Mr. Scholey said a deputy minister in the government, whom he declined to name, had a personal transformer to heat his swimming pool and was never billed. Untold other people and businesses bribed collectors to look the other way.
Even Mr. Shevardnadze conceded that widespread corruption contributed to the crisis. He said several former officials had been arrested and others were under investigation.
As new meters are installed as part of a $45 million project, payment rates are rising, topping 80 percent in some districts. At the same time, people are learning to conserve because now they pay for what was once free.
But new meters will not generate electricity, and efforts to increase the amount of power have been hampered by poorly operating generators. The supply has also been hurt by a summer drought, which left hydroelectric stations without enough water to operate at full capacity.
Matters were not helped when Russia, which sells gas to the AES for its generators, halted the service for four days this month in a price dispute. AES was about to run out of gas and shut down the system when the flow was resumed after high-level talks in Moscow.
Mr. Scholey is optimistic that the company is making progress, and he said he expects to meet Tbilisi's demands next winter, a claim that evokes skepticism in some quarters.
"That's what AES said?" asked a woman who works in a hotel that relies on expensive generators. "That would be funny, if it weren't so sad."

HEADLINE: Figuring Dues: From Each According to Its G.N.P. (Back in '46)

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

 BODY:
The scale of assessments for member countries to finance the United Nations was set up in 1946, in theory according to each nation's ability to pay.
But Edward C. Luck, who has written about the history of the organization, said, "The ink wasn't dry on the charter before the U.S. and other countries started complaining" about what should be their fair shares, which were calculated according to each member's contribution to the world's gross national product. 
 Because of Europe's postwar devastation, Washington initially consented to pay slightly more than 39 percent of the regular budget, but just for a year. It was agreed that the United States' assessment would be pegged at 33 percent thereafter, in part so the United Nations would not have to depend for financial survival on a single country.
In those early days, the United Nations had only 55 members, compared with 189 today.
In fact, it took nearly a decade for the United States' assessment to fall to 33 percent. This was because experts at the United Nations kept insisting the United States ought to pay more, according to Mr. Luck, who is the executive director of the Center for the Study of International Organization, which has links to New York Law School and Princeton University.
In 1972, the General Assembly reduced the American share to 25 percent, and the minimum charged to the poorest countries was cut in half, to two one-hundredths of 1 percent. In 1978 this minimum was halved again, and was recently cut to one-thousandth of 1 percent, a share paid by struggling countries like Burundi, Cambodia and Equatorial Guinea.
China, a permanent member of the Security Council, pays slightly less than 1 percent.
The debate over who owes how much has been complicated by the cost of United Nations peacekeeping, which began with a one-time assessment of members for a mission in the Sinai in 1973. But far from being a one-time cost, "it locked into position for 27 years and never moved," said the United States representative, Richard C. Holbrooke, who described today's agreement as the first reform of peacekeeping.
While Washington has been at odds with the United Nations over the exact amount it owes, the United States' assessment has been less than 30 percent of peacekeeping expenses since 1973, said Steven Dimoff, vice president of the United Nations Association of the United States, a research and support organization.
The United Nations calculates that the United States is now about $1.3 billion in arrears, after its payment of $217 million earlier this week. Washington calculates a lower figure.
While the United States has been accused of being the most conspicuous debtor, other countries have been reluctant to pay up. In the early 1960's, Russia, France and other countries refused to pay for peacekeeping in Congo, and were taken by the United Nations to the World Court, which ruled against them.
Britain, Canada and the Scandinavian countries have been among the few members habitually scrupulous about paying their share of the operating costs of the United Nations.

HEADLINE: Rich Nations Will Forgive Debts of 22 Of the Poorest

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
The United States, Japan and European and other industrial powers have agreed to forgive loans to 22 of the world's poorest countries this year, fulfilling a promise to accelerate debt relief and to give a token of the West's unprecedented prosperity to the poor.
The debt-relief program, announced today by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, is a victory for an eclectic coalition of religious organizations, celebrities and watchdog groups that put pressure on wealthy nations and international lenders to help the poor nations cope with globalization. 
 Many of the people in the countries granted debt relief -- all in Africa and Latin America -- live on $1 a day or less. Charity groups have argued that it is both economically inefficient and morally wrong to require the governments of such countries to devote large shares of their revenue to paying back foreign lenders.
The push for debt relief began in Europe in the mid-1990's and grew steadily through this year, when a worldwide protest campaign persuaded nearly all rich nations to move far more quickly than they had in the past. People as diverse as Pat Robertson, the religious broadcaster, and Bono, the rock star, lobbied to advance the cause.
President Clinton and the Republican-led Congress competed to claim credit for providing the $435 million required to fulfill the United States' obligation under the global forgiveness program this year, an amount that was fully financed in the budget for 2001.
Wealthy nations have devised a rigorous program of granting, distributing and monitoring debt relief to ensure that money no longer used to pay off debts will be employed in constructive ways to improve education, health care or economic development.
The effort to guard against waste has meant that debt relief comes only after a nation completes a long process. To date, only one of the 22 nations that have been granted relief, Uganda, has received all the benefits promised.
International finance officials have said they will wipe out two-thirds of the total debt the poorest nations owe to foreign governments and multilateral lenders, a debt stock that is estimated to have a value of $125 billion if it was paid today. So far, some $20 billion of that amount has been forgiven. At least a dozen more nations are considered eligible for relief in the future.
The World Bank and the I.M.F. had raced to complete cumbersome reviews and provide relief to at least 20 nations by the end of this year, doubling the number they had reached in September. The goal has had symbolic value for religious organizations in the year 2000, a Jubilee year for the Roman Catholic Church.
The goal of 20 was set by European nations in September and initially met with skepticism from the Clinton administration and some I.M.F. officials, who doubted that so many nations could complete the necessary applications in time.
In fact, the bank and the fund relaxed some requirements and eliminated a few hurdles to meet and then surpass the goal, bank officials have said. But officials stressed that the main conditions imposed to ensure that the money was used well remained in place.
"To ensure that the relief is translated into poverty reduction, the beneficiary countries must continue with their economic, social and governance reforms," James D. Wolfensohn, the World Bank's president, and Horst Kohler, the I.M.F.'s managing director, said in a joint statement.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers welcomed the news that 22 nations had been granted relief. But he warned that it was just one element of what wealthy nations must do to help the poor. He warned that health problems like AIDS and inadequate education reduced poor countries' ability to take advantage of money they saved in debt payments.
"Our challenge now is to build on the momentum of the extraordinary coalition that came together around debt relief to help every country seize the opportunities that global economic integration affords," Mr. Summers said.
The 22 nations receiving debt relief are Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia in Africa; and Bolivia, Guyana, Honduras and Nicaragua in Latin America.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Nasdaq Soars To Finish Off Brutal Week

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The Nasdaq composite index jumped 7.6 percent yesterday as bargain-hunting investors snapped up technology stocks that had dropped sharply in recent weeks.
It was the Nasdaq's fifth-best daily percentage gain ever. But because of the hard hit that technology stocks took earlier in the week, including a 7.1 percent loss Wednesday, the Nasdaq was still down 5.1 percent for the week. 
 Cisco Systems, which plunged 12.6 percent on Wednesday after it was downgraded by Merrill Lynch, rose for a second day, climbing $2.63, to $41.50. Qualcomm, which had fallen 11.3 percent since Monday, rose $9.19, to $85. Microsoft, which had dropped 28.5 percent in the last week and a half, jumped $3, to $46.44. And I.B.M., which was off 14.1 percent in the last week and a half, jumped $7.44, to $89.
Among other technology stocks helping lift the three major indexes were Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and Oracle.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 148.27 points, or 1.4 percent, to 10,635.56. The technology-heavy Nasdaq surged 176.90 points, to 2,517.02. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 31.11 points, or 2.4 percent, to 1,305.97. The gains came in relatively heavy volume for the last trading day before Christmas, with 1.09 billion shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
I.B.M. rose after a Salomon Smith Barney analyst said speculation that the computer company would miss its sales or profit forecasts was off the mark. But the Ford Motor Company dropped $1.38, to $22.81, after it said Thursday that its fourth-quarter profit would come in about 10 cents below forecasts of 74 cents a share because of slowing economic growth and consumer spending.
Yesterday's rebound, however, cannot be read as a signal that the stock market has finally hit bottom. That still depends on how much more the economy slows and how quickly the Federal Reserve moves to stimulate growth by cutting its short-term interest rate target.
"I don't believe that we have seen the bottom," said Thomas McManus, equity strategist at Banc of America Securities. "The news on earnings is still very negative, surprisingly negative for an earnings bear, which I have been for eight months. My numbers are probably too high."
Mr. McManus also said that President-elect George W. Bush's comments about the possibility of a recession and disagreement from the Clinton White House are not helpful for consumers or stocks. "It is not encouraging to see politicians arguing over the state of the economy," he said.
In addition, investors still have to get through another week or so of fourth-quarter earnings preannouncements in the first part of January. If the negative tone of this month's announcements continues, stocks could be pushed lower.
For the week, the Dow was up 1.9 percent, and the S.& P. 500 index fell 0.5 percent. With just four more trading days to go in the year, the Dow is down 7.5 percent, which would be its worst performance since 1981. The Nasdaq is down 38.2 percent, on the way to its worst performance in its history. And the S.& P. 500-stock index is off 11.1 percent, its worst year since 1977.
While Fed policy makers unexpectedly shifted their bias to cutting interest rates from raising them at their Tuesday meeting, they have not yet cut their benchmark federal funds rate from 6.5 percent. The sell-off in the stock market on Tuesday after the Fed said that it would not change the rate and again on Wednesday indicated that many investors were hungering for a cut.
Given the recent signs of the economy's slowing, more economists and analysts are saying the Fed will cut interest rates when policy makers meet at the end of January.
But Mr. McManus said there was talk in the stock and bond markets now that the Fed would reduce rates before its scheduled session at the end of January, given the rapidity of the economic slowdown. The Fed rarely moves on interest rates between formal policy-making meetings. But it has done so, most recently in the fall of 1998, during the Russian financial crisis.
"I think the market will definitely be extremely disappointed if the Fed does not cut rates by Groundhog Day," Mr. McManus said.
Several government reports yesterday added to the portrait of an economy that has slowed sharply from the 5 percent growth pace of 1999 and the first half of this year. Orders for durable goods rose 2.3 percent in November, after a 6.5 percent drop in October. Although the increase was a little larger than the 1.5 percent expected, it still reflects how wary consumers have become.
The Commerce Department also reported yesterday that consumer spending rose 0.3 percent in November. But much of the increase went to pay for higher utility bills, which analysts say have been cutting into spending for household and other goods and holiday gifts.
The Commerce Department reported Thursday that economic growth in the third quarter slipped to 2.2 percent at an annual rate, the weakest quarterly growth in four years.
The slowing growth and the prospect of a Fed rate cut before the end of January helped drive Treasury interest rates lower in a trading session shortened by a holiday. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note rose 7/32, to 105 21/32, as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, slipped to 5 percent, from 5.03 percent on Thursday. That is its lowest yield since February 1999, when longer-term interest rates were rising after reaching 30-year lows in October 1998. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.39 percent, from 5.41 percent on Thursday.
Clearer signs of a slowdown in the United States and the sharp decline in the stock market also helped the euro to rise against the dollar. From the inception of the euro in January 1999 until last month, the currency had fallen as investors preferred to put their money into the United States.
But now the euro has jumped almost 12 percent against the dollar since its record low in October, including an increase yesterday to 92.52 cents from 91.43 cents on Thursday. At this level, the euro is already as high as some forecasters predicted it would rise in 2001.

HEADLINE: A Voice of Protest Rises for Itself;
WBAI Resists Superiors Who Say It's Stuck in the 60's

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
The trouble began late last month when the out-of-town brass showed up in the offices of the venerable radio station WBAI in Manhattan for what was assumed to be a routine performance evaluation, then proposed unceremoniously that the general manager take a new job elsewhere that did not then exist.
When the general manager declined, she was told that after 20 years at the station, she would be unemployed as of Dec. 31. Most of the staff quickly vowed to fight her firing. Demonstrations and petitions ensued. Now WBAI-FM (99.5), and its parent, the Pacifica Foundation, are on the brink of civil war. 
 At a time of consolidation in the radio industry, WBAI is a defiant exception -- a throwback to a time when community radio flourished, a holdout against homogenization, on intimate terms with its listeners (who might even want to hear an exclusive five-hour broadcast of a speech by Fidel Castro).
Now it is embroiled in what is simply the latest in a series of confrontations between Pacifica, which pioneered listener-sponsored broadcasting in the United States, and staff members at its five stations, which have served for a half-century as what one historian called the voice of the left on the radio.
Underlying the conflict are two forces: the foundation's desire to broaden Pacifica's audience and ensure the network's future, and programmers' suspicions that what the foundation really wants is to trade in the old audience and become a slightly more liberal version of National Public Radio.
"The national office believes that we represent an outre politics; let's put it that way," said Matthew Finch, the director of arts and cultural programming for WBAI, which gets a small percentage of its $3 million budget from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. "That we are too far out on the fringe and too negative. That is something that I do know has been said in those halls."
Kenneth A. Ford, vice chairman of the foundation's board, insisted in an interview that no one on the board had ever suggested giving "a milquetoast appearance" to Pacifica's programming. But he also said, quoting an industry guru he would not name, that Pacifica "had a mission at one time and had a credible voice but now it has gone from being insignificant to irrelevant."
"That says we need to change the way we're doing things," Mr. Ford said. "It's bad enough when you're insignificant; but when you're irrelevant, you're nonexistent. You must ask the question: Do we serve just a few people and their interests? Do we serve people who are locked in time in the 60's, or do we try to stay current and expand and grow to bring in new people under the Pacifica umbrella?"
Pacifica was conceived in 1946 by a group of conscientious objectors as a network of grass-roots, alternative stations free of corporate control and dedicated to peace. It introduced the Beat Generation to the airwaves, challenged McCarthyism, held on-air debates on the arms race and was investigated by the House Un-American Activities Committee.
WBAI, which joined the network in 1960, became one of the first stations in the country to interview a former agent about life in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said Matthew Lasar, a historian and author of "Pacifica Radio: The Rise of an Alternative Network" (Temple University Press, 1999). That broadcast, Mr. Lasar said, earned Pacifica its own F.B.I. investigation.
Later, WBAI reporters were the first to cover the Vietnam War from North Vietnam. The station was a leader in the free-form radio movement, a spontaneous broadcasting style that became popular in the late 1960's. Yoko Ono was once the station's record librarian, one staff member said. In the station's heyday, Richard Avedon photographed the staff.
"If it wasn't for Pacifica's five stations, the left wouldn't have been on the radio," said Mr. Lasar, a visiting assistant professor at the University of California at Riverside and a former reporter for a Pacifica station. "It's really the voice of the left. For many people in the network, the struggle is whether it will continue to be the voice of the left."
The foundation owns the licenses to stations in Berkeley, Calif., Los Angeles, Houston, Washington and New York. Dozens of affiliates also take some of Pacifica's national broadcasting -- its network news and "Democracy Now!," a public-affairs program produced at WBAI that Mr. Lasar said was the most successful venture in alternative-radio history, reaching some 700,000 people a week.
In the years since the 60's, the number of WBAI subscribers has declined to 17,500 today from about 30,000. But the station continues to pride itself on serving as an "early-warning system" for what members of its staff witheringly call the corporate media, aggressively covering issues like police brutality and the shortage of affordable housing in New York.
In recent weeks, some staff members have wondered what set Pacifica's executives off. Was it that exclusive broadcast of Castro's speech last September at Riverside Church? Or the Saturday afternoon special on a march for the Palestinians in Washington? Or the extraordinary half-hour grilling given President Clinton when he called WBAI on Election Day to get out the vote?
On Nov. 28, Bessie M. Wash, executive director of the Pacifica Foundation, arrived in New York to meet with Valerie Van Isler, WBAI's general manager, who has told others she expected a performance review. Instead, Ms. Wash offered her a job in the Pacifica national office in Washington with the title of executive producer of national programming.
When Ms. Van Isler turned it down, Ms. Wash told her she would be out of a job, according to Bernard White, the WBAI program director. He said he called Ms. Wash the next day to object, then met with her several days later. She agreed to explain her actions on the air the following Tuesday, Mr. White said, but did not appear on time. She finally met with the station's staff that afternoon.
At that meeting, it became apparent that some staff members had complained about Ms. Van Isler to Ms. Wash, Mr. White and others said. But, he said, Ms. Wash had never discussed the matter with him or others in the station's management. If Ms. Van Isler was to go, Mr. White and others said, the station, not Pacifica, should have the right to determine when and how.
Ms. Van Isler has been general manager for 10 years.
"The issue is not whether this is the best general manager this station has ever seen," Mr. Finch, the arts director, said. "It's the process by which they made this move and the timing of it that are alarming."
Ms. Van Isler would not discuss her situation, saying only that she had filed a grievance against Pacifica. Ms. Wash did not respond to repeated requests for an interview. Instead, the foundation on Dec. 14 issued a four-paragraph announcement of a "reorganization of key positions," stating simply that Ms. Van Isler had been offered the new job "as part of Pacifica's vision to restructure the organization and bring in some new leadership."
The statement said Pacifica would begin a search for a new general manager.
Meanwhile, most of the staff members are said to have signed a statement refusing to honor Ms. Van Isler's firing or cooperate with a successor. A petition is circulating among listeners. There have been on-air discussions, anguished meetings, plans for a broadcast teach-in and talk of a vigil at the offices at 120 Wall Street if Pacifica tries to move Ms. Van Isler out.
At a meeting on Dec. 12, dozens of members of the station's staff, racially diverse but mostly middle-aged, jammed a conference room in the office. In the crush, a table loaded with people collapsed. Various staff members, a dissident Pacifica board member and a lawyer for Ms. Van Isler spoke about their dealings with Pacifica's management and board.
"Many of us believe that the intention of Pacifica is to consolidate all the radio stations and then begin to change systematically the programming," Mr. White said at the meeting. He added: "This is not a joke. They are serious about what it is they want to do. We've already seen how at some radio stations they've already done what it is they want to do."
In March 1999, Pacifica fired the general manager of KPFA, the Berkeley station, two weeks before its 50th-anniversary celebration. When protests followed, Pacifica warned employees not to discuss the firing on the air. When they did so anyway, one was fired and another was pulled off the air in midsentence. Eventually, Pacifica temporarily shut down the offices.
More recently, Amy Goodman, a "Democracy Now!" host, filed grievances against Pacifica's program director alleging harassment and censorship -- charges Pacifica denied. Among other things, she says Pacifica withdrew her show's credentials to cover the Democratic National Convention after she took Ralph Nader onto the floor of the Republican National Convention to offer commentary.
Some WBAI staff members insist they are not opposed to change. The problem, they said, is how the change has come.
"Many of us for years have been saying we must adjust to survive," said Sidney Anthony Smith, WBAI's operations director. "The notion that we are 60's fossils who are intransigent to any rational change is simply untrue. But this change must be done humanely and with patience, since these have always been our traditions."

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Plunges, Especially Among the Affluent

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence plunged in December, but not evenly across the population. The nation's more affluent families are turning out to be the most pessimistic, apparently because of the sinking stock market. The less affluent, not as heavily invested in stocks, are not yet so directly affected by the slowing economy.
Those are the latest findings of the Consumer Research Center at the University of Michigan. Released yesterday, the survey is the most authoritative reading so far of how Americans are reacting in the Christmas season to the slowing economy -- and, in reacting, contributing to the slowdown. 
 "Not many people have yet personally experienced the slowing economy except through the stock market," said Richard T. Curtin, director of surveys for the Consumer Research Center. "But they are getting negative signals in the workplace, from their neighbors and in the mall. Then they listen to the news and hear someone confirm what they are concerned about."
That more or less describes Nancy Ward, a 47-year-old paralegal interviewed while shopping at Faneuil Hall Marketplace in Boston. The slowdown for her is apparent in the workplace. "My husband and I do real estate law, so we do a lot of closings, and we are seeing closings slowing down," she said, explaining that she is more price conscious now when she shops. "I've also been reading in the papers that there are a lot of layoffs in the bigger companies, so it is just a matter of time."
For all the signs of a slowdown, there are strengths, too. While the University of Michigan reported the fall-off in confidence, the Commerce Department said yesterday that personal income was holding up, as was consumption, despite a slowdown in Christmas sales. Personal income rose 0.4 percent in November, and consumption expenditures increased 0.3 percent. Although outlays for merchandise fell, spending on services more than offset the decline.
The confidence index fell to 98.4 this month from 107.6 in November, the fourth-largest one-month drop since the survey went monthly in 1978. The three larger drops came before the 1980 and 1990 recessions. While the pessimism was broad-based in those years, this time it is mainly among households with annual incomes of more than $50,000 -- the households, in sum, with much of their wealth invested in stocks. These are America's biggest spenders, and cutbacks on their part because of declining confidence could indeed hurt the economy.
Households with less than $50,000 in annual income, on the other hand, are just beginning to turn pessimistic. "Their strong income and job prospects led them to overlook rising gasoline prices," Mr. Curtin said, "but now they are beginning to feel threatened at work" and the news media reports amplify their worries.
Trying to talk an economy up or down is hardly a new phenomenon. Franklin Roosevelt's fireside chats during the Depression were a famous attempt to lift spirits and encourage economic activity. Until they did an about-face this fall, corporate executives, Wall Street forecasters and Federal Reserve policy makers were publicly bullish. The Clinton administration never missed an opportunity to point proudly to the booming prosperity, and now it says the Bush camp is making matters worse by calling attention to the slowdown and to the risk of recession. The Bush camp wants to suggest that a recession would be President Clinton's fault.
Mr. Bush said Thursday that he was simply being a realist in considering the dangers ahead, "and if there are warning signs on the horizon, we need to pay attention to them." But Gene Sperling, President Clinton's economic adviser, said the Republicans were "creating anxiety" unnecessarily.
"As one moves from a campaign to running the government," Mr. Sperling said, "part of the transition is understanding that you are not just an outside commentator but what you say can itself have an impact on confidence and stability, and talking down your own economy is a serious mistake."
Can an economy in fact be talked down? Can pessimism publicly expressed be self-fulfilling? Neither Mr. Curtin nor Lynn Franco, his counterpart at the Conference Board, which also surveys consumer confidence, finds much evidence yet that people are responding to pessimistic talk. What is more, random interviews yesterday with shoppers in Seattle and Boston turned up little evidence that people were altering their behavior as a result of pessimistic news media reports.
"I honestly believe there is a downturn, but it is at the beginning so it does not really affect you yet," said James Simpson, 32, a real estate developer in Phoenix, visiting in Seattle. He added that he sold all his stocks six months ago, which is why he is not feeling an effect.
Still, if bad news persists, the impact will come, according to Thomas Smith, a director of the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago. "What we are hearing has the potential for weakening consumer confidence," he said. "But I don't think the message has been taken into the hearts and minds of the American people so far."
The impact from talking down an economy comes gradually; it takes time for the pessimistic talk to be measurable in the consumer confidence numbers, but eventually it has an effect, said Daniel Yankelovich, chairman of DYG, a polling firm.
Norbert Schwarz, a University of Michigan psychologist, describes the process. "It is impossible," he said, "to consider all the information that is relevant; so people truncate the information search early, as soon as they have a few bits of information that seem relevant." That makes them vulnerable to pessimistic media reports. "The reports increase the accessibility, as we call it, of pieces of similar information already in memory," he said.
Much depends on the eye of the beholder. "You can tell two different stories about this economy," Dr. Schwarz said. "You can emphasize the sharp slowdown, as we are doing, or you can say that while growth has slowed, the economy is still strong. I am from Germany where they consider 2 or 2.5 percent growth like we have here very good. Depending on which aspect you are focusing on, people's confidence comes out very differently."
The economy is in fact hurting, no matter what the perspective. Indebtedness hangs over consumers and corporations. Capital spending is weakening, loans are harder to obtain and defaults are rising. But even after sharp declines, car sales and home construction -- two economic pillars -- are as high as they were in the 1980's. And while layoffs abound, so do jobs; the unemployment rate is a very mild 4 percent.

Factory Orders Rise 2.3%; Consumer Spending Climbs
The Commerce Department reported that factory orders rose 2.3 percent in November after a 6.5 percent drop in October. A surge in aircraft orders led the increase. Excluding transportation equipment, orders rose 0.4 percent in November after falling 3.1 percent in October.
Consumer spending also increased in November, led by higher utility costs, while incomes recovered from the previous month's decline, the department said. Page C4. 

Canada to Adopt Privacy Standard
A new law to protect personal information disclosed through electronic transactions will take effect in Canada on Jan. 1, and it will eventually affect all domestic companies and those in the United States that have Canadian subsidiaries. Initially, the new law, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, will cover only companies that are federally regulated -- mainly banks and airlines. But by 2004, anyone doing business in Canada must comply. C2.
 
Korean Banks Near Formal Merger
Two of South Korea's largest and strongest banks, Kookmin and Housing and Commercial, moved closer toward a formal merger despite a union walkout that shut many branches. The merger would form South Korea's largest bank, with assets of 167 trillion won ($136.1 billion). C2.
 
Major Powers to Forgive Debt
The United States, Japan, Europe and other industrial powers have agreed to forgive loans to 22 of the world's poorest countries this year, fulfilling a promise to accelerate debt relief and to give a token of the West's unprecedented prosperity to the poor. A6.
 
A Dysfunctional Utility Deregulation
California's great experiment with utility deregulation relies on the wisdom of the marketplace to keep things running, but as the threat of utility bankruptcies, sharply rising electric rates and dimmed Christmas lights grip the state, the marketplace has no clear idea of what to do. Worse yet, it seems, neither does anyone else, from political leaders who have every incentive to keep California's economy humming, to the agencies charged with keeping the lights on. A1.
 
Real Media Dismisses Executive
Real Media, a New York-based Internet advertising sales and technology company, replaced its chief executive and laid off 10 percent of its work force after a major investor objected to the company's recent performance and ordered a restructuring in return for any additional financing, company officials said.

HEADLINE: Last Noel for Some Dot-Coms;
Traditional Chains Making Inroads in the Online Market

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
For Internet merchants, this holiday season is bringing little joy, and not much comfort, either.
Online retail sales are up again, with estimates of the increase over last year varying from 50 to 100 percent. Visa says 3.5 percent of the spending on its credit cards over the holiday season has been done online, double the share last year, and almost five times that of 1998. 
 Still, online spending, like holiday sales over all, is falling short of many predictions. And the number of people shopping online is leveling off, according to a New York Times/CBS News Poll, indicating that Web merchants looking to get big fast are having to wring more revenue from existing customers.
Moreover, Internet shoppers have flocked increasingly to affiliates of conventional stores -- Wal-Mart Stores, Kmart, Toys "R" Us, J. C. Penney and Best Buy -- compounding the difficulties of the increasingly endangered Web start-ups that led the way last year.
The most prominent casualty has been eToys, the phenomenon of last year's holiday season, which reported last week that its quarterly sales would fall 50 percent short of expectations. The company, whose value has fallen to $25 million from $11 billion in 14 months, put itself up for sale.
After conceding the lead to start-ups, traditional retailers have built Web sites this year with the sort of broad inventory they offer in stores. The Internet accounts for a small part of their sales -- perhaps 2 to 3 percent in the case of Toys "R" Us -- and like most Web start-ups, they are losing money at it. But the retailers consider it an important and profitable part of their long-term business.
Meanwhile, as dot-com companies heavily cut advertising to conserve cash, or close altogether, the Web addresses of the traditional companies have become the most visible Internet promotions -- on television and in their stores -- and seemingly the most stable.
"There has been a flight to quality," said Chuck Davis, the chief executive of BizRate, an online research company. "For the bricks-and-clicks companies," he said, referring to store chains with online operations, "this is their first real holiday. For the dot-com pure plays, this is their last holiday."
Amazon.com has continued to thrive (if not profit), with sales expected to be $1 billion for the quarter, 58 percent more than last year and far and away the largest on the Net. But even after a $300 million spending spree to build five automated warehouses, Amazon has not been able to keep up with the demand as pockets of customers -- it will not say how many -- discover that their orders are weeks late and may not arrive in time for Christmas.
"Usually, they are as fast as Chinese food in New York," said Barry Bryant of Brightwaters, N.Y., a high school teacher who still has not received half the items he ordered from Amazon on Dec. 9 despite the promise of immediate shipment. "I think they booked far more business than they can handle."
Whatever gains Web merchants are experiencing this year, in fact, appear to be coming largely from people like Mr. Bryant, experienced online shoppers who are spending more this year, rather than from first-time buyers.
In the New York Times/CBS News Poll of 1,048 adults conducted Dec. 14-16, 19 percent said they had or would buy gifts online this year. That is not meaningfully more than the 17 percent who gave that response a year ago. More broadly, those who say they have ever bought something on the Internet increased to 31 percent from 25 percent a year ago. The survey had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
BizRate, similarly, found that only 10 percent of Web shoppers this month are making their first purchase online.
Measuring how much money was spent online is an imprecise art, especially because most online stores do not release sales figures. And even now there is a wide range of estimates of last year's online spending.
This year, Visa estimates that $2.5 billion was spent online with its cards from Nov. 24 to Dec. 20, up 103 percent from a year ago. Since Visa has 54 percent of the card market and nearly all online purchases are billed to credit or debit cards, that implies total spending of about $5 billion.
BizRate estimates that total online spending was about $5 billion from Nov. 20 to Dec. 18. But that represents only 50 percent growth from BizRate's calculation of last year's sales, less than the 81 percent increase it expected.
The biggest drag on online sales, BizRate found, came from computers. Online sales of computers, BizRate's largest category, rose by only 40 percent from a year ago.
The Internet-only retailers that appear to be doing the best are those that reflect the Web's role as the nation's flea market. EBay, the auction site, continues to thrive (although its best month is typically January, when people unload unwanted gifts). And Half.com, an eBay unit that sells used merchandise at fixed prices, has become the No. 2 online store in its first year.
Online retailers, like their shopping mall counterparts, blame the uncertain economy, the falling stock market and even the endless election for dampening shopping enthusiasm.
The online stores have far more trouble than a few dimpled chads, however. Once investors decided they wanted to see profits rather than growth, the money that had fueled the dot-com boom simply dried up. Many sites shut their doors, and others have cut back sharply, at a cost.
"We spent half a year spending zero dollars on marketing," said Michael Krupit, chief executive of CDNow, the online music store recently purchased by Bertelsmann. "We lost tremendous momentum." Holiday sales at CDNow will be lower than last year, he said.
Other sites have dealt with the tough times by raising prices.
"Last year we were selling thousands of Palm Pilots at cost," said Katherine N. Vick, president of Cyberian Outpost, an online computer dealer. "We are not in that business any more." Over all, the company expects to double its gross margin from last year's holiday season while increasing sales by 60 percent.
That said, not all the online promotions have disappeared this year. A number of online retailers, including Amazon, offered free shipping for much of the holiday season, at least for larger orders. Some analysts say eToys' reluctance to match these offers contributed to its shortfall.
In any case, even for the Web retailers left standing, the demise of former competitors is not an unmixed blessing.
"We would love to have thriving competitors because their advertising drew more people online," said Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon.com.
Indeed, to counter the skepticism from customers (and investors), Amazon took the unusual step of placing an up-to-the-minute count of how many items it had shipped on its home page. (To date, Amazon's Delight-o-Meter has counted 31 million shipments, up from about 20 million last year.)
"We wanted to show people in a very real way that lots of people are doing this and that Amazon.com is reliable," Mr. Bezos said.
Reliability was a problem for other Web sites last year, especially toysrus.com, then Amazon's rival and now its partner. This year, it is Amazon itself that has fallen behind.
"We have a collection of orders we are running a little slow on," Bill Curry, an Amazon spokesman, acknowledged. He declined to quantify that collection. He cited a variety of causes, like late shipments by manufacturers.
Planet Feedback, a site that passes consumer complaints and compliments to companies, said that reports of problems of delayed shipment at Amazon have increased from an average of 23 percent of the comments on that company to 40 percent, a much faster increase than at other online stores.
Indeed, the rest of the industry appears to be doing better than last year. BizRate finds that 87 percent of online shoppers say they are satisfied with the timeliness of their shipments, up from 74 percent a year ago.
In fact, overall satisfaction is higher at Internet-only stores than at the bricks-and-mortar affiliates that are doing so well online this year, according to a joint study by BizRate and Robertson Stephens, the brokerage firm. Most notably, Walmart.com, which has had a 490 percent increase in traffic to become the fourth-most-popular online store, scores significantly below average on the study, said Lauren Cooks Levitan, online retail analyst for Robertson Stephens.
"Maybe it is because they are attracting newer online shoppers, but Wal-Mart's customers are less satisfied and say they are less likely to shop there again," she said.
But customer satisfaction, Ms. Levitan said, does not seem to predict success. EToys, she noted, topped her satisfaction polls and many others.
"They had built a better mousetrap," she said. "What we understand now is the consumer didn't care."

HEADLINE: AFTER LONG FIGHT, U.N. AGREES TO CUT DUES PAID BY U.S.

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 22

 BODY:
After weeks of bitter negotiations, members of the United Nations agreed in principle today to reduce American dues for the first time in more than a quarter century. If accepted by Congress, the deal will remove the primary irritant between the United Nations and Washington just as a new administration prepares to take over.
The immediate reaction in Congress was positive, and diplomats said that only a few details remained to be settled before the General Assembly formally approved the accord. 
 "This is a tremendous achievement for the United Nations," said Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke, who has spent almost all of his 16 months as representative here fighting to get two scales of dues -- one for the regular United Nations budget and another for peacekeeping -- realigned by 188 other nations. Some of those nations would have to pay substantially more to make up for American cuts.
In Washington, Senator Jesse Helms, the leading Congressional critic of the United Nations, welcomed the development. "I consider it a real leap forward," he said, singling out Mr. Holbrooke for praise.
Relations with the United Nations had worsened when a Republican Congress was elected in 1994. By 1995, Congress was actively legislating against American involvement, reducing payments in violation of treaties and demanding that the United Nations reform.
The American debt to the organization mounted to a level nearly twice the annual operating budget. Anger grew among other member nations, which watched Americans expect support for their policies while the organization faltered under the debt.
Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's ambassador, called the deal a "huge breakthrough" and said that if it had not been for Mr. Holbrooke's determination, there might have been "shards on the ground" and no deal.
Mr. Holbrooke changed the terms of the debate, arguing that all nations should have their assessments revisited because the world had changed since payment scales were reviewed in the 1970's and changing economic realities had to be reflected.
The peacekeeping scale of assessment had not been changed since 1973, though periodically the United Nations' regular operating budget had been adjusted. But Mr. Holbrooke did not get everything Congress demanded.
He did win approval of a cut to 22 percent of the United Nations regular budget, from 25 percent. As to other payments for peacekeeping, the American share was cut to 27 percent from 30 percent, but still exceeds the 25 percent level set by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. To make their point, the senators had tied up payment of American debts, which the United Nations calculates at more than $1.3 billion now. Under an agreement that the committee struck with the Clinton administration in 1997, arrears could not be released until the 25 percent level was reached. Two years earlier, Congress passed a law saying the United States would not pay more than 25 percent for peacekeeping. This has added an automatic increase in arrears ever since. That law would have to be repealed.
When the shape of today's deal became apparent last week, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the committee's ranking Democrat, said he would fight for acceptance, despite the shortfall in the peacekeeping budget demand. He said the reduction in regular budget assessments to 22 percent was crucial to the committee.
The final resolution of the General Assembly did not include a European proposal that would have made the continuation of lower American dues conditional on Washington's payment of all arrears by 2003. In any case, Congress and the United Nations disagree on the amount of arrears. But member nations did leave open the possibility of reversing today's decision if there was reason to do so at the next review.
"If things go wrong in the next three years," Mr. Greenstock said, "then the General Assembly will come back to the question."
With the United States and the European Union locked in firm positions, concessions from a variety of nations, many of them prospering, were the key to striking a deal. They included Thailand, Singapore, South Korea, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, the Czech Republic, Poland and Persian Gulf oil states.
On the regular budget, the United States made the transition to higher assessments easier to swallow by offering to pick up the $34 million that other nations would have to make up during the first year of lower American payments.
The money was made available to the State Department by Ted Turner, the founder of CNN, through his United Nations Foundation. In 1997, Mr. Turner stunned the organization with a pledge to give $1 billion over 10 years to a variety of United Nations programs, with emphasis on the environment, health and aid to women and girls in developing nations.
The grant to the State Department is in addition to that $1 billion gift, and had to be made through the State Department because individuals cannot pay a country's dues.
Mr. Holbrooke said today that opposition to United States demands in the United Nations had been fierce for months. "As the year drew to a close, resistance became more and more intense," he said.
Other diplomats said that while many countries would have been willing to reduce American payments even further as a way to weaken the fiscal influence of the United States, they were defiant about making any adjustments under an ultimatum from Congress.
Mr. Greenstock said today that a number of larger developing countries like India and prosperous nations like Canada thought it was "politically unwise to have one power holding such a whip over the U.N." But the Europeans argued that it was naive to think that the United Nations could readily make up for a large financial gap.
"Into the mix stepped Ted Turner," Mr. Holbrooke said. "Six weeks ago, after I had briefed him and some of his associates on the problem, Turner, with his characteristic combination of vision and energy, and a profound understanding of the leveraging effects of a dramatic bequest, said if the $34 million difference that this amounts to is the make or break, I will contribute that money on a one-time-only basis."
"As the year grew on, country after country passed its national budget, based on the assumption we would still pay 25 percent," Mr. Holbrooke said. "And so countries all over the world came to us and said, we've already budgeted the money, and we can't pick up the extra. So Ted Turner's offer in hand, we began to talk to individual countries and then two days ago the group. Then came the brutal discussion about how to distribute the money."
That slicing of the Turner sweetener was still going on at the last minute today.
In addition to the American reduction, Japan asked for and got a cut of one percentage point, to 19.5 percent of the regular budget. That means that the United Nations will have to find new sources to provide 4 percent of the operating budget. Russia and China voluntarily increased their payments, though marginally. When complicated calculations were made of nations' capacity to pay based on economic strength, Britain, Denmark, Greece and Ireland all saw their regular dues go up, although in total the European Union added only 0.3 percentage points to its bill.
Regular budget assessments form the base for calculating peacekeeping bills, a system that has now become even more complex, by introducing a sliding scale of discounts depending on ability to pay.
A number of countries -- among them Israel, Cyprus, Malta, Hungary and Slovenia -- voluntarily gave up discounts immediately. Others agreed to give them up in the future.

HEADLINE: THE 43rd PRESIDENT: THE REGULATIONS;
Bush Aides Plan a Hard Look At Clinton's Final Regulations

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Aides to President-elect George W. Bush put the Clinton administration on notice today that they would scrutinize the many regulations being issued by President Clinton on his way out of office, and they said they might alter rules with which they disagreed.
At the same time, lawyers and lobbyists sympathetic to the Clinton administration said Mr. Bush would have many tools available if, as expected, he wanted to delay, modify or rescind some of the regulations after he took office on Jan. 20. 
 In the last few weeks, the administration has issued a blizzard of rules, dealing with everything from the privacy of medical records to the pollution spewed by diesel-powered trucks and buses to the prevention of repetitive-stress injuries in the workplace.
Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the president-elect, said today that the Bush transition team was "carefully reviewing each and every regulation that is issued here in the waning days" of the administration.
"They've been busy beavers in the administration with these last-minute executive orders and last-minute regulations," Mr. Fleischer said.
Without commenting on the merits of any initiative, Mr. Fleischer said Mr. Clinton's executive orders could be "undone at the stroke of the pen" of the new president, while "regulations can be undone through regulation."
William Kovacs, vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, said Mr. Clinton was "trying to put the next administration into a regulatory straitjacket." In most cases, the new administration must show cause and invite public comments before rescinding regulations issued in final form by Mr. Clinton.
Conflicts of this sort have occurred in the past. Soon after Ronald Reagan succeeded Jimmy Carter in 1981, the Reagan administration rescinded a rule that required automatic seat belts or airbags in new cars. In 1983, the Supreme Court ruled that the action of the Reagan administration was arbitrary and capricious.
In revoking a rule, the court said, a federal agency must follow the same procedures that applied when it issued a new rule. It must supply "a reasoned analysis for the change" and "must articulate a satisfactory explanation" for its decision, the court said in the 1983 case, Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v. State Farm Mutual.
Linda Ricci, a spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management and Budget, said: "Our rules are a product of serious, substantive work with lots of scientific analysis. We believe they will stand up in court."
In effect, the Supreme Court set criteria for new presidents to follow in rewriting regulations. But even without formally changing the rules, a new president can take many steps to switch course.
Gary D. Bass, executive director of O.M.B. Watch, a consumer group that monitors the Office of Management and Budget, said: "If the new president wants to undermine regulations that protect public health, safety and the environment, he can do it. He has many levers to pull -- so many, it would amaze the public."
Here are some examples:
*A new president can declare a moratorium on new rules for two or three months, as President Reagan did.
*A new president can place a low priority on enforcement of rules with which he disagrees.
*The president can give states more responsibility for enforcing federal health, safety or environmental standards, without providing much additional money.
*A new president can set new standards for cost-benefit analysis, so federal officials pay more attention to the costs of new regulations.
*A federal agency can postpone the effective date of new regulations that have been challenged in court. The United States Chamber of Commerce and other business groups, for example, have sued to block the ergonomic rules and to overturn a new rule that denies federal contracts to companies that have violated labor or environmental laws.
*Under a 1997 law, agencies must send their rules to Congress for review 60 days before they take effect, and Congress can kill the rules. Congress never did this under Mr. Clinton, who could have vetoed any "resolution of disapproval."
But Mr. Bush as president might cooperate with Congress to kill certain regulations he opposes.
Mr. Bush said this week that he wanted "less regulation" as part of his program to head off any recession. And in the campaign, Mr. Bush said he wanted to reduce the burden of federal regulations in education, health care and the environment.
David C. Vladeck, a lawyer at the Public Citizen Litigation Group, a nonprofit law firm, said the new president would probably issue an executive order establishing a framework for all federal regulation, as Mr. Reagan did in February 1981 and Mr. Clinton did in September 1993.
Mr. Vladeck said he expected Mr. Bush to establish a standardized method of analyzing the costs and benefits of new regulations. Agencies like the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration now use somewhat different techniques.
Robert W. Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, said: "Bush will take cost-benefit analysis more seriously than the Clinton administration has. He will ask for a more careful accounting of the costs and benefits of proposed rules and alternatives. Cost-benefit analysis now is often a charade."
Mr. Bush has vowed to shift regulatory power from the federal government to the states.
In educating children, he said, "states will be offered freedom from federal regulation, but will be held accountable for results." On health care, he said, he will "remove federal regulations that restrict state flexibility in designing programs for the uninsured." On environmental issues, he promised to discard "the 30-year-old federal model of 'mandate, regulate and litigate.' "

HEADLINE: Drug Makers Design Studies With Eye to Competitive Edge

SERIES: MEDICINE MERCHANTS/How Research Benefits Marketing

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and JEFF GERTH

 BODY:
By almost anyone's standards, the cholesterol-lowering pill Pravachol is a blockbuster. With $1.7 billion in worldwide sales last year -- $1.1 billion in the United States alone -- the drug is Bristol-Myers Squibb's top-selling product. But it is also a medicine with an inferiority complex.
Pravachol belongs to a class of drugs, statins, that are the most widely prescribed drugs in the United States. Bristol-Myers Squibb, with its pioneering research on the drug, helped create the booming statin market. But a more powerful newcomer, Pfizer's Lipitor, leads the pack in sales. 
 Last year, Bristol-Myers executives took a calculated risk, committing tens of millions of dollars for a comparison of Pravachol to Lipitor. They gave their study a catchy acronym, Prove It. They also lined up one of the most famous names in cardiology to oversee it, Dr. Eugene Braunwald, a Harvard Medical School professor who wrote the leading textbook on heart disease.
"It's a risk for them," Dr. Braunwald said.
Dr. Christopher Cannon, the study's principal investigator, said, "Bristol-Myers Squibb is standing up and saying, 'We stand behind our drug and we're going to support this, and if it turns out that the other guy's drug wins, then we've done a service to cardiology."
But some prominent heart specialists, as well as an expert in clinical trial design, say Prove It may not be the gamble it appears. They argue that the design of the study makes it likely to find that, even though Lipitor brings cholesterol levels lower, the two drugs work equally well in preventing heart attacks and death. In that case, Bristol-Myers sales representatives could use the findings to persuade doctors to prescribe Pravachol.
Both the company and the Harvard investigators say the study is valid. Yet the debate over Prove It, familiar in cardiology circles, offers insight into a larger issue in pharmaceutical research: the way that marketing concerns sometimes shape scientific studies.
As a new president is inaugurated and Congress returns to work, the cost of prescription medicine is likely to once again be high on the national agenda. Statins, for instance, cost as much as $3 a pill, more than $1,000 a year. The drug companies, which spend $25 billion a year on research and development, say they need prices that will generate enough profit to underwrite the risky business of discovering life-saving medicines.
But while pharmaceutical research can save lives -- the early studies on statins are a case in point -- companies also use science to help sell drugs. Prove It, for instance, grew out of an unsuccessful effort by Bristol-Myers to win government permission to claim that bringing cholesterol to ultra-low levels does not necessarily benefit patients. When the Food and Drug Administration refused, the company, hoping to bolster its case, initiated the study.
That is hardly unusual, said Dr. Stuart Pocock of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, an expert in clinical trial design.
"Companies put huge amounts of money in trials, which have to be directed toward what stands a chance of being in their interests," Dr. Pocock said. "And their interests are, in general, in danger of being in conflict with what are society's interests."
Most of the industry's research budget is aimed at getting new drugs to market. About 6 percent is spent on studies, like Prove It, which are conducted after a therapy is approved, according to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry trade group.
Pharmaceutical executives, including those at Bristol-Myers, describe research as a collaborative effort, with marketers and scientists working hand in hand to determine which diseases to attack, which therapies to pursue and which clinical trials to conduct.
"In a science-driven organization, the notion of marketing versus science is really a false dichotomy," said Dr. Andrew G. Bodnar, a vice president at Bristol-Myers Squibb.
The role of marketers grows once a therapy is on pharmacy shelves, Dr. Yale Mitchell, a senior director of clinical research at Merck, said.
"There, marketing can actually be helpful in identifying needs in the marketplace," Dr. Mitchell said. "They would bring that need to us, and we can decide if it is a worthwhile area to conduct trials."
How much influence drug marketers have on research and development varies by company, said Dr. Nelson Levy, a former head of research and development at Abbott Laboratories.
"But in all cases, marketing does have a major say in the size and focus of R & D spending."
 
Scrambling for a Niche
Nowhere is the weight of marketing concerns as evident as in the competitive market for pills that lower cholesterol, or as some cardiologists call it, the statin wars.
Six statins are on the market. The first, Mevacor by Merck, became available in 1987, followed by Pravachol, in 1991. The newest is Lipitor, which became available in January 1997.
All told, statin sales totaled $7.2 billion in 1999, with an estimated five million Americans taking the drugs. But their potential market is much, much bigger. Heart disease is the nation's leading killer, and cardiologists say many people who need statins do not take them. The drugs also hold promise for treating Alzheimer's disease and osteoporosis.
So companies are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into research involving tens of thousands of patients. They are seeking to learn whether statins can help select populations -- the elderly, people with diabetes, patients with normal cholesterol. If they do, the companies may use their findings to persuade the F.D.A. to permit them to advertise additional uses for their drugs, or indications, in medical parlance.
"The drugs are all relatively similar," said Dr. David Waters, chief of cardiology at San Francisco General Hospital. "Whether one sells better than another really depends on marketing, first of all, and secondly, research. So companies are scrambling to try and find a niche."
But the wrong kind of research result can threaten a company's bottom line.
Pfizer, for instance, recently announced the results of a study called Miracl, which looked at whether patients should take statins immediately after a heart attack. Scientists were deeply divided on the question. So the study, which compared Lipitor to dummy pills, "was a real gamble," said Dr. Waters, who sat on the steering committee.
As Lipitor gained market share, that gamble only grew. The Miracl trial was begun by Parke-Davis, the company that invented Lipitor, before the drug's sales took off. By the time the study was under way, Parke-Davis had a new parent, Pfizer, whose officials worried that a negative result would tarnish Lipitor's sparkling image.
"They asked us, 'What do you think the odds are that it will be positive or negative?' " Dr. Waters said. "The marketing guys were sweating."
As it turned out, there was no need to worry; the study found that Lipitor reduced patients' risk of subsequent heart problems and death by 16 percent. It has been accepted for publication in the New England Journal of Medicine, said Pfizer officials, who are elated.
"It's a groundbreaking finding," said Dr. Stephanie Kafonek, Pfizer's senior medical director for heart disease research. "The fact that it has worked is going to be a big boon to get physicians to treat aggressively and early, to better the care of patients."
 
Academia and Business Mix
In their quest to use research to sway the hearts and minds of busy doctors, the drug companies have important partners: academic physicians.
Just as sporting goods companies vie to retain big-name athletes to sell sneakers to the masses, pharmaceutical companies compete to retain big-name doctors -- the industry calls them luminaries, or opinion leaders -- to persuade a smaller target audience, physicians, to prescribe their drugs. As Dr. Mitchell, of Merck, said, "Physicians like to hear data from thought leaders."
So companies carefully cultivate their luminaries, offering them consulting fees and fancy perks. Pfizer, for instance, recently played host to prominent cardiologists for a consultants' meeting in Sydney, Australia, this summer to coincide with the Olympic Games.
Leaders themselves say that what attracts them to pharmaceutical research is not the perks, but the ability to do cutting-edge science.
"That's where the action is," said Dr. Antonio Gotto, a leading expert on statins and the dean of the Weill Medical College of Cornell University. "The most important studies that have been done in the statin field to date have been sponsored by industry."
But the marriage between academia and business is a delicate balancing act. With the pharmaceutical research budget outpacing that of the National Institutes of Health, university scientists are turning more often to industry for support, said Dr. W. Virgil Brown, a professor of medicine and cardiology researcher at Emory University.
Dr. Brown said he tried for months to persuade the national institutes to pay for a study on the role of polyunsaturated fats in preventing heart disease, but was unsuccessful. Eventually, he turned to Merck, which offered two grants totaling $66,000 -- tiny by the standards of drug research.
Dr. Mitchell, the Merck executive, said the grants were part of a company program designed "to field offbeat proposals" that have scientific merit, if not commercial usefulness. Dr. Brown saw it as an effort "to win good graces with me."
Dr. Brown and other academic scientists understand that companies conduct research with an eye toward the bottom line. At the same time, they say they often capitalize on pharmaceutical money to pursue independent ideas of their own.
"You want science as a search for the truth, but there are economic pressures that come into play," said Dr. Robert Vogel, director of clinical vascular biology at the University of Maryland Medical School in Baltimore. "We often tag on really good science to otherwise commercial trials."
In Prove It, the alliance with Dr. Braunwald was a natural one; his cardiology research group at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston has run some two dozen trials for various pharmaceutical companies, including Bristol-Myers.
But while the company was primarily interested in testing its drug against Pfizer's, Dr. Braunwald had other ideas. He was curious about the possible role of bacteria in heart disease, and whether antibiotics could prevent heart attacks. So he asked Bristol-Myers to let him study the question as part of Prove It, and the company agreed.
"We thought we could get a twofer," Dr. Braunwald said. "With all the money and all the effort of getting patients, there was a second question that was as interesting as the first, perhaps even more important."
 
Teaming Up in Research
By the time Bristol-Myers agreed to sponsor Prove It, the big questions about statins -- whether they could prevent heart attacks and reduce the risk of death in patients with high cholesterol and heart disease -- had been answered.
That is, in part, because the company had paid for so much groundbreaking research. No other statins has been studied in as many patients, for as many years as Pravachol, said Dr. Peter Libby, chief of cardiology at Brigham and Women's. "It has contributed tremendously to our scientific database."
But no sooner had these landmark studies been completed than Lipitor emerged as a rival.
All statins lower cholesterol. But Lipitor, experts say, lowers bad cholesterol about twice as much as any other statin. It is so powerful that scientists have coined a nickname for it: turbostatin.
This disparity in cholesterol lowering taps into a pressing scientific question about bad cholesterol: How low is low enough?
The National Institutes of Health publishes guidelines that imply patients should lower their bad cholesterol as much as possible. But most experts say there is no scientific proof that taking cholesterol below the institutes' guidelines, as Lipitor does, is of real benefit to patients.
Still, the guidelines have been a boon for Lipitor. With its marketers using the pitch that lower is better, Lipitor more than tripled its sales from 1997 to 1998. Pravachol's sales went up, too, but its market share began to slide.
And Lipitor had another edge in the marketplace: its inventor, Warner-Lambert's Parke-Davis laboratories, teamed up with Pfizer, a company known for its marketing prowess, to promote the drug. That, Dr. Gotto said, gave Lipitor "more marketing muscle than anybody else had."
Lipitor's success was a thorn in the side of Bristol-Myers executives; it irritated them to see a competitor piggyback their research. For instance, Dr. Bodnar said, Pravachol has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke in women. Carefully avoiding any direct mention of Lipitor, he complained that other statins "have succeeded in coming in and saying, 'Whatever Pravachol may do, we lower cholesterol more effectively, so it must be true that we do whatever they do.' "
So, Dr. Bodnar said, company officials examined their scientific database "to try to figure out what relationship, if any, there was between cholesterol lowering and benefit to patients."
They concluded there was none. But when they asked the F.D.A. to permit Bristol-Myers' marketing representatives to make that case to doctors, the agency refused.
"In their judgment," Dr. Bodnar said, "it was not absolutely proved beyond a reasonable doubt."
In November 1999, its appetite whetted by the phenomenal success of Lipitor, Pfizer initiated a hostile takeover of Warner-Lambert. A few days later, at a meeting of the American Heart Association, Dr. Braunwald and Bristol-Myers Squibb announced Prove It.
 
A Time for Criticisms
Whether Prove It will actually settle the lower-is-better question, however, is a matter of some debate.
The hypothesis of Prove It is that the two drugs are equivalent. Dr. Gotto, who chairs the study's data monitoring board, says Prove It is not large enough and will not last long enough to answer what he called the more important question of "whether or not an LDL reduction of 25 percent will get you as much benefit as an LDL reduction of 50 percent."
Bristol-Myers officials disagree.
"We designed to test equivalence," said Rene Belder, the company official overseeing the trial. But because patients on Lipitor will have substantially lower cholesterol, Mr. Belder said, "if everything goes well, we will show there is no need for cholesterol-lowering beyond" the institutes' guidelines.
As with virtually any study, the design of Prove It was constrained by the money available to perform it. Dr. Cannon, the principal investigator, said Bristol-Myers Squibb made clear at the outset that it was willing to pay for a moderate-size trial. Within those parameters, it was up to Dr. Braunwald and his associates to design the trial.
They decided to study 4,000 patients, all within 10 days of having had a heart attack. Half will receive Pravachol; the other half Lipitor. The patients will be followed for two years, or longer, to see how many suffer subsequent heart attacks or other heart ailments, and how many die.
"From the sponsor's point of view, they are obviously worried about their drug and how it sells," Dr. Cannon said. "From our point of view, this is a wonderful trial that will lead to a great understanding of how these drugs work."
But some cardiologists, including Dr. Waters, Dr. Vogel and others who consult for rival companies, criticize Prove It, as does Dr. Pocock, the London biostatistician, who examined a summary of the design at the request of The New York Times. All say the study is not structured -- or "powered" in the lexicon of biostatistics -- to uncover true differences between the two drugs, in part because Prove It will last only two years and other research suggests it might take three to five years to see a difference.
"The Prove It trial is a particularly extreme example of a study designed purely for marketing, rather than scientific purposes," said Dr. Steven E. Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, who is also conducting a comparison of Pravachol and Lipitor on behalf of Pfizer.
Dr. Vogel said, "The Prove It trial was designed from the start to show no difference."
Yet Dr. Pocock, while agreeing with this criticism, said it was inappropriate to single out Bristol-Myers Squibb. While Pfizer and Merck are trying to answer the lower is better question by conducting long-running studies of their own drugs, comparing a low dose with a high one, Dr. Pocock said he would like to see a long-running comparison of one statin to another.
"One will probably never know the answer to that question," he said, "because it is not in any company's interest to sponsor that trial."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "STEP BY STEP: How Statins Work"
Statins inhibit the production of cholesterol, a risk factor in heart disease.
 
1. Cells in the liver use an enzyme to produce cholesterol.
2. Statins inhibit the enzyme, but liver cells still need cholesterol, so they produce extra receptors 2/3 to collect LDL cholesterol, the bad type, from the bloodstream.
3. The new receptor sites gobble up the LDL cholesterol floating by in the bloodstream, leaving less of it to accumulate in blood vessels.

HEADLINE: In California, Woes on Power Set Off Clashes

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 22

 BODY:
California's great experiment with utility deregulation relies on the wisdom of the marketplace to keep things running, but as the threat of utility bankruptcies, sharply rising electric rates and dimmed Christmas lights grip the state, the marketplace has no clear idea of what to do.
Worse yet, it seems to many Californians, neither does anyone else, from political leaders who have every incentive to keep the state's economy humming to the agencies charged with keeping the lights on. 
 In fact, things have grown so tense that these people are lashing out at one another, and in some cases are barely on speaking terms.
California's usually mild-mannered Democratic governor, Gray Davis, has sharply criticized federal regulators for dragging their feet, calling them "armchair Washington bureaucrats." Calling the deregulation experiment a disaster, Mr. Davis has also complained that those in charge of the state's power grid are not doing their jobs.
The chief executive of that network, in turn, freely admits that he purposely did not consult with the governor when the system neared a breakdown in mid-December.
The utilities, which were big contributors to the governor's 1998 campaign, say he has been slow to react to a crisis he was warned about months ago. Consumer advocates are also mad at Mr. Davis for meeting privately with the executives to work out a rate increase. To make matters worse, officials in surrounding states are angry about being pressured to sell their own scarce power to California.
All this would be mildly amusing for spectators if the world's sixth largest economy and the center of the technology revolution were not at stake. "The interested groups don't care if they drive this state into recession," said Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow at the Davenport Institute for Public Policy at Pepperdine University. "Essentially we are going to take an economy the size of the United Kingdom and cut the juice so it doesn't function."
Few people predicted the straits that California would be in when it decided in 1996 to deregulate its utility industry. Then, the state had plenty of electricity and most people thought that new competition would lower prices for consumers and businesses alike. But energy companies, worried that the end of regulation would mean the end of guaranteed profits, stopped building power plants in California.
Ground zero for the energy crisis in California is a nondescript office park building in Folsom, a rural town 18 miles northeast of Sacramento.
It is the headquarters of the California Independent System Operator, the nonprofit group that manages 75 percent of the state's power grid. Two weeks ago Terry Winter, the chief executive of the independent operator, worried that his engineers were consumed with endless haggling for spare megawatts to avoid daily blackouts, went behind Mr. Davis's back and appealed to federal regulators to lift a price cap on electricity sold in California. That, he hoped, would keep the lights on.
Mr. Winter said that he and Mr. Davis have not talked for weeks -- it is only their staffs that speak -- despite the fact that wholesale electricity prices have skyrocketed and California's energy market was turning into "a big Turkish bazaar." Further, he explained, "If I called the governor, he would have said, 'Don't make the call.' So do I violate his order? I had people on the floor exhausted."
Mr. Winter might have learned that Governor Davis and his staff had been quietly negotiating with two investment banks to guarantee loans to ensure the state's utility companies remained solvent, buying more time. Once the banks heard the price cap had been lifted, exposing them to unknowable losses, they balked on the loans, Mr. Davis said.
"If you've concluded I'm not a fan of the Independent System Operator, you are right," the governor said recently. "We've been spending too much time doing their job for them." The political stakes are high for Governor Davis, who is calling for more control. That's because President-elect George W. Bush is preparing to name a new energy secretary and his free-market outlook collides with that of the governor. Governor Davis, who has already spoken to Mr. Bush about the energy crisis in California, has been seeking the counsel of experts recently and is expected to meet with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan next week.
"These guys are all under enormous political pressure," said former Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, whose administration backed the deregulation legislation in 1996. "You can escape blame by assigning it to someone else."
Meanwhile, the Independent System Operator, born of deregulation in 1998 with the blessing of utility companies, politicians and regulators, lurches from calm to chaos almost hourly.
At about 8 a.m. on Dec. 13, power generators from the Northwest, worried about credit problems at California's two largest utilities, Southern California Edison and PG&E, balked at sending the state much-needed electricity.
Panic spread through headquarters there as more than three million homes were expected to go dark.
Officials frantically called executives at power generators in the Northwest to "see what we could argue out of them," said the chief operating officer, Kellan Fluckiger. But as quickly as that crisis subsided, another surfaced. Governor Davis released the power generators' names, which are supposed to be kept private, angering one executive who threatened to cut off shipments altogether.
"Am I worried about people getting into accidents because they have no traffic lights? Of course," Mr. Fluckiger said that day, his eyes crimson from lack of sleep. "But I have no sense of what I need to do."
Just who exactly has the power to address the concerns with the power generators is the cause of much friction. With deregulation, the authority over the power plants was transferred from California officials to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which pursues a free market approach. This is frustrating to Governor Davis, who wants more control over the plants.
Some experts say the solution is not that complex. "I would advise them to take a break, say it isn't working and start all over," said Paul Joskow, the director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research.
But James J. Hoecker, the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said California needed to get its own house in order. "Our disagreement is over how to solve the problem," he said, "not what the problem is."
In fact, a quick resolution may be forced on state officials by Southern California Edison and PG&E, which are threatened by insolvency because skyrocketing wholesale power prices have left them with huge bills they cannot pass on to consumers.
"We need some leadership here," said John E. Bryson, chairman of Edison International, the parent of Southern California Edison, which today shed 400 contract labor jobs. "This has gone on for too long a time."
Some utilities, fearing they would not have enough money, have had to consider rationing power.
Whatever steps are taken to solve the financial crisis in the short term, everyone agrees that more power plants and stringent conservation are needed. "We've got a ton of power plants in the pipeline and all of them are good," said Daniel Kirshner, an environmentalist who is on the board of the System Operator. "But we have to get the religion that energy conservation is even better."
More supply alone, though, is not enough, said Harvey Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. He said his group wanted a ballot initiative for 2002 that would seek to impose a windfall profits tax on power generators and suppliers, and create a public power agency with authority to build and operate power plants.
"This was politics that got us into this mess and it will take us politics to get us out," he said.
That is little comfort to the engineers who are managing the electrical system this winter. On Tuesday, Mr. Fluckiger had a new crisis. A transmission line went out of service, making it difficult to transfer electricity from the deserts in the south to users in the north.
Now blackouts in Northern California are a possibility over the holiday weekend. I guess, Mr. Fluckiger said, "we would really be the Grinch who stole Christmas if we did that."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Baseball's Transfer of Power

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Twenty-five years ago yesterday, an arbitrator rendered a decision that forever changed baseball and the business of sports: he created free agency.
The ruling put in place the mechanisms that led to Alex Rodriguez's record $252 million contract and Manny Ramirez's $160 million deal two weeks ago. At the time, the decision provoked Charlie Finley, then the owner of the Oakland A's, to suggest a way to prevent such staggering salaries: annual free agency for all players to swing the baseball economics of supply and demand squarely on the side of supply. 
 "Maybe Charlie was right," Bowie Kuhn said recently, after the nine-figure free-agent contracts were signed. "I don't say that too often."
Indeed not. Kuhn, a former baseball commissioner, had perhaps never said so, certainly not in public, not about the owner who once labeled him "the village idiot."
On Dec. 22, 1975, Kuhn and Finley were on the same side, the losing one. Peter Seitz, then baseball's impartial arbitrator, created free agency when he supported a grievance filed by two players, Andy Messersmith and Dave McNally. With Marvin Miller, the players' labor leader nonpareil, agreeing with Seitz against the dissent of John Gaherin, the owners' chief labor negotiator, Seitz found that the renewal clause in players' contracts, paragraph 10 (a), lasted for only one year, and when it expired, so did the players' links to their teams. The reserve system, the 65-page opinion said, did not enable a team to retain a player with whom it did not have a contract.
No other decision has had a greater impact on the sports profession.
"It not only changed baseball, but it changed all sports," Kuhn said.
The decision may also be the most important labor-arbitration case because it has resulted in a greater transfer of wealth from ownership to employees than in any other case.
"The difference between winning and losing can be stated in billions and billions of dollars," said Richard Moss, the union's lawyer who argued the case. "I don't think you can find another labor-arbitration case that can say that."
Miller went a step further. "While I think the money impact is noteworthy and makes a good story," he said, "more was involved than that. The whole freedom issue has always gotten underplayed, the difference between being a piece of property your whole career and not. That's not the kind of thing you can measure against other cases."
The impact of the ruling is clear; how it came about is a murkier tale.
 
McNally's Role Was Crucial
 Andy Messersmith was a pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers who played the 1975 season under a renewed contract. He did not sign a new contract because the Dodgers refused to give him a no-trade clause. Dave McNally, who pitched for the Montreal Expos, also played that season with a renewed contract, until he retired in June.
Messersmith was the initial player in the case; McNally was added as a backup.
"His role was crucial," Miller said of McNally. "If he had not lent his name to the grievance, there's not much question that when the chips were down they would have met Messersmith's demand for a no-trade provision -- they had already met his salary demands -- and there would have been no case."
But as Moss saw the case, "It could've been Torre instead of Messersmith."
Joe Torre was one of two players -- Jim Bouton was the other -- who testified at the hearing. Torre, now the Yankees' manager, related his experience in 1969, when the Atlanta Braves renewed his contract at the maximum 20 percent cut and he responded by saying he would not play for them until they offered him the same salary he earned the previous season. Instead of calling Torre's bluff or giving in to him, the Braves traded him to St. Louis, where he signed a new contract and played for the Cardinals.
Had he not been traded and had he remained unsigned, Torre could have provided the players association with its test case six years earlier. On the other hand, the owners might have fared better at the time because Seitz would not have been the arbitrator. Seitz, who was not unknown in the world of sports arbitration, also served in the same role for the National Basketball Association.
"I had really serious reservations about Peter Seitz as an arbitrator," Kuhn said. "He was a nice guy; I liked him. I didn't think he was the right man to be handling a decision of that magnitude. I thought his credentials from his N.B.A. days leaned in the direction of the players."
In addition, Seitz had ruled a year earlier in favor of Jim (Catfish) Hunter in his breach-of-contract grievance against Finley, a decision based on a technicality that allowed the Oakland pitcher to sign with the Yankees.
"We thought before the hearing about discharging him," said Lou Hoynes, who was management's lead lawyer in the arbitration case. "I would have after what I saw in Hunter. The Hunter decision gave us a sense of Peter Seitz's view of the world. It seemed like he was hostile to ownership and the rules of the game. He was looking for a loophole to make the players free."
Either side can unilaterally fire an arbitrator with no reason needed, but Hoynes said most management people felt at the time it would have been "a public relations black eye" to dismiss Seitz. Once the case had been heard, with hearings on Nov. 21, Nov. 24 and Dec. 1, however, a person who was involved in the case said, some people in management wanted to sever Seitz before he issued his decision. But they never pulled the trigger.
They did so, on the other hand, as soon as he rendered his ruling.
"I can't say he was fired before the ink was dry," Miller said, "because we hadn't signed it."
Miller said that when he was handed the ruling, he turned to the decision page -- page 62. He said Gaherin did the same. Seeing that Seitz had ruled for the players, Miller recounted, Gaherin looked up and said, "Peter, I love you, but I'm firing you."
"What amazed me was he surprised Seitz," Miller added. "I would have thought an experienced arbitrator in a case like that would have expected it. I think what surprised Seitz was he hadn't kept his opinion secret. He had telegraphed it in advance, saying in effect, 'Take this case away from me; negotiate something.' He thought his opinion wouldn't be a surprise."
 
A Signal From Seitz?
 Seitz died in 1983, Gaherin early this year, leaving Miller, 83, as the only surviving member of the three-member panel that met at Seitz's Central Park West apartment on Dec. 8, 1975, two weeks before the ruling. The general understanding of that meeting has always been that the arbitrator signaled to Miller and Gaherin that he was prepared to rule against the clubs but would rather have the two sides negotiate a settlement of their differences over players' freedom.
But Hoynes disputed that notion.
"We didn't understand Peter to have given us a clear view of what his decision would be," Hoynes said in a recent telephone interview. "I wasn't in the room, but I know what we were told. We were told we might not be happy with the decision, but there were variables in the decision. There was a wide range of things. It was altogether unclear."
Others disputed Hoynes's recollection.
Barry Rona, who was the owners' chief labor lawyer, was not at that Dec. 8 meeting with Gaherin, but recounted what Gaherin told him about it.
"What Seitz was saying Lou chose to interpret and Bowie chose to interpret as Seitz being more flexible," said Rona, ESPN's senior vice president for business and legal affairs. "John and I read it differently. We had an internal debate over what signals Seitz was giving us. John and I felt he was giving us a negative signal. Marvin interpreted it the same way."
Miller concurred, noting that Seitz had also offered to reinforce Gaherin's position with the owners by writing a letter to Gaherin outlining his views.
"Would it be helpful if I sent a letter to you giving my feelings about the case so there would be no question about your making this up?" Miller quoted Seitz as asking Gaherin.
"It would be very helpful if I had a letter from you," Miller quoted Gaherin, emphasizing that the letter, four to six pages long, was sent to Gaherin, not him.
And then there was Gaherin's own view of the message he received from Seitz and delivered to his bosses at a meeting in Florida. "I knew we were going to lose," Gaherin said in an interview for the 10th anniversary of the decision.
Frank Cashen, then a member of the owners' labor board, confirmed Gaherin's message. "He did tell us which way he was leaning," Cashen said of Seitz.
With Kuhn and Hoynes opposed to the idea of negotiations, the owners did not give Gaherin and Rona permission to try to work out a settlement. They decided to let Seitz rule, then go back to court to have his decision overturned.
"They were convinced they could reverse in court," another lawyer said Hoynes told him.
Rona said that too many people on management's side, including Kuhn and Hoynes, were too close to the case.
"You really should take a couple steps back and let an outsider look at it and give you an evaluation," Rona said.
Instead they returned to what they perceived would be a friendly court, the United States District Court in Kansas City, Mo. They had gone there initially seeking to forestall the arbitration hearing.
"We thought it was a conservative court," Rona said. "It was researched pretty carefully going up to the Circuit Court of Appeals."
But the luck of the draw went against management. "We wound up before Judge John Oliver, one of the most activist federal judges in the country," said Moss, whose argument for the players had induced Seitz to rule for them.
Kansas City was also the home of Donald Fehr, whom the union hired as the local counsel for the arbitration appeal, and subsequently, as Moss's replacement as general counsel and then Miller's replacement as executive director.
The players won before Oliver and the appellate court. Free agency was theirs.
In 1975 Messersmith had a 19-14 record and a 2.29 earned run average following a 20-victory season in 1974. Once he was a free agent, he signed a three-year, $1 million contract with Atlanta. He also played for the Yankees and returned to the Dodgers, with whom he finished his career in 1979. But he was never as effective or as healthy as he had been before free agency, gaining a total of 18 victories in his final four seasons.
McNally, who earlier in his career had been a 20-game winner four times with Baltimore, was traded to Montreal before the 1975 season and retired in June of that year with a 3-6 record. He did not play again.
 
Advice Goes Unheeded
 Kuhn, in hindsight, said management "probably" would have benefited from accepting Seitz's advice and negotiating a settlement.
"At that point in that context," the former commissioner said, "you can always pull out of negotiations and say, 'Arbitrator, do what you're going to do.' But in that setting, probably something better could have been negotiated than was. But the difference could be tweedledee tweedledum."
In Rona's recollection, "given what Marvin was saying at the time, where he seemed to be in his own thinking," a negotiated settlement could have been "a lot more favorable to the owners than what they wound up with."
Even Miller said he could not go back 25 years and determine what he might have accepted at the bargaining table without Seitz's decision. He did know, he added, that he would not have compromised Messer smith or any player who had not signed a contract for 1976 based on the expected outcome of the arbitration.
But, Miller said, "We were ready to negotiate on everything else."
Moss, the union lawyer, said that what he recalled from the hearing "was Bowie Kuhn's testimony and how baseball would absolutely be ruined without the reserve system as we knew it then."
If the players won, Kuhn testified, baseball would not vanish, but it would struggle to survive. The commissioner foresaw the loss of clubs, the loss of employment for players and others, the loss of the ability to expand, the loss of minor leagues ("if not all of them, most of them"). And, he testified, "I think the loss of a major league is quite possible."
Six expansion cities and 150 additional jobs for players later, the major leagues still number two, and minor league baseball is flourishing.
Kuhn nevertheless maintains that his predictions would have been correct but for the workable system that emerged "with the very real cooperation of the players association and Miller."
Kuhn making complimentary comments about Miller and Finley is a development almost as dramatic as the growth in salaries the past 25 years.

HEADLINE: The Making of an 8-Year-Old Woman

BYLINE: By Lisa Belkin; Lisa Belkin, a contributing writer for the magazine, wrote about the child-free movement in July.

 BODY:
The rustic, eclectic house on the farthest outskirts of Chapel Hill, N.C., is a kaleidoscope of contradictions. In the office, where important scientific research is done, the computer sits juxtaposed with a sewing machine. There is a file cabinet for journal articles and one for ribbons and beads. A large pane of the window was accidentally hit by a pebble a few months back, and because there has been no time to replace it, the shatterproof glass remains marbled and glittering, distorting the view.
It is somehow fitting that Marcia E. Herman-Giddens looks through that mottled glass every day, reflecting on the hodgepodge of a debate that her research has wrought. In a breakthrough scientific journal article published three years ago, she confirmed what many mothers of preteen daughters already suspected -- that today's girls are growing up faster and entering puberty earlier than their mothers did. Since then, she has watched as all types of scientists -- from endocrinologists and primatologists to psychologists and anthropologists -- have scrambled to figure out why. Meanwhile, the musings of those scientists have gotten caught up in the times and taken on lives of their own. 
 "The 'why' is the important part," Herman-Giddens says as she sets up a slide projector and dims the lights. "We don't know anything if we don't know why." She takes the remote control in hand and runs through the prevailing theories.
Click. "Obesity. Our kids are getting too fat." This is the only cause on which researchers seem to agree -- that heavier girls enter puberty earlier.
Click. "Cow's milk. If I say that too loud, the dairy industry will be on me, but there are a lot of powerful hormones in milk."
Click. "Estrogen simulators in the environment, chemicals and plastics, I'm not a biochemist, but. . . ."
She pauses. "There are also some brand-new studies out saying that in households without biological fathers, girls seem to go through puberty earlier. Wow, that one is really interesting."
Click. The last slide is of a jeans ad from a magazine. The female reproductive system is exquisitely sensitive to external influence, she says -- as college women who room together know well, because their cycles often mysteriously fall into sync. "Can visual images also have a biological effect?" Herman-Giddens asks. "Does constant exposure to this sort of thing act as a premature trigger? I certainly think we need to find out."
Though the scientific method, with its emphasis on reproducible results, strives for purity, there rarely is such a thing. "Research does not always emerge from the laboratory; it emerges from the society" that surrounds that laboratory, says David Rosner, a professor of history and public health at Columbia. Rosner points to silicosis, a lung disease caused by the inhalation of sand. Little attention was paid to the disease in medical circles until the Depression, when unemployed sand-blasters started using silicosis "as a route to compensation." Soon there were hundreds of medical-journal articles on the subject, but by the 1940's, as employment picked up again, research into the disease had all but stopped.
Similarly, the current debate over the efficacy of mastectomy versus lumpectomy is in part a function of the women's rights movement and the consumer-patients' rights movement, says Dr. Barron H. Lerner, author of "The Breast Cancer Wars," to be published in the spring by Oxford University Press. Scientific research, he says, is always the result of "a multiple confluence of forces -- growing medical knowledge plus political will, plus thinking you can get it funded because it's trendy."
In other words, what we know is limited by what we think to ask. Scientific hypotheses necessarily reflect a moment in time. The parade of possible triggers that Herman-Giddens clicks onto her wall is also a list of society's front-and-center concerns. Obesity. Pollution. Food additives. Divorce. Soft porn. If we weren't worried about these things, we wouldn't think to investigate them. Puberty research, like so much scientific research, is a mirror onto our fears.
At the same time, research often hijacks the researcher and heads in unexpected directions, which is what happened to Herman-Giddens more than a decade ago. Back then, she was a physician's associate in charge of the child protection team at Duke University Medical Center. Her expertise was in abused and neglected children, and she was struck by how many very young patients, as young as age 7 or 8, were already sprouting breast buds and pubic hair.
Medical textbooks said that the onset of puberty occurred, on average, at age 11 in girls. That is the number used by pediatricians since 1969, when a British physician named James Tanner published his study of 192 girls living in an English children's home. Girls younger than 8, by these standards, would be considered "precocious" developers, so Herman-Giddens and her colleagues dutifully sent them off to endocrinologists for extensive and expensive work-ups. Rarely, she says, did one of those girls come back with a diagnosis of a harmful problem.
Why, then, were there so many early-developing girls in her clinic waiting room? Was early puberty perhaps more common among girls who were sexually abused? Once her eyes were opened to this possibility, Herman-Giddens began to notice that patients in the medical center's general pediatric population seemed to be developing earlier, too. She compiled a statistical analysis that found, in fact, that girls were entering puberty earlier. Even more striking was the fact that African-American girls were starting significantly earlier than white girls.
Herman-Giddens, collaborating with the American Academy of Pediatrics, followed that relatively small study of North Carolina girls with an extensive study of 17,000 girls across the country, and the results were the same: for white girls, the average age of onset of puberty, as measured by the appearance of breast buds, was 9.96 years, and for African-American girls, the age was 8.87 years. More specifically, close to one-third of African-American girls have started puberty between their 7th and 8th birthdays, and about 50 percent of that group has done so by their 9th birthdays.
Which means girls in otherwise normal health are entering puberty more than a full year earlier, on average, than was previously thought.
And this change, she warns, demands attention. "These are second-grade girls, some first-grade girls," she says, as she flashes a graph on the wall. "Is it going to keep getting lower? Are kids going to get to be 5 and 4 and 3? And is this supposed to be happening? I don't think so. I don't think that's what nature intended."
Last spring, I sat on a committee of parents from the local elementary school who wanted to improve the quality of food in the cafeteria. We munched grapes and carrots and drank bottled water while discussing the fat content of chicken nuggets and the caffeine content of iced tea. Eventually, the conversation turned to milk, and someone said: "Organic milk is a must. You know, all those hormones in nonorganic milk are the reason for early puberty." Everyone nodded knowingly. None of the mothers could tell me how they "knew" this; they just knew.
There is nothing more powerful than conversation. A fact may appear first in a scientific journal, but it is on the playground or at the office coffee machine that it takes hold. Conversation is the reason why 40 years ago a plate of eggs and bacon looked healthy, 20 years ago it looked toxic and now in some low-carb circles it is healthy again. Conversation is why a glass of milk might not look as wholesome to you as it did to your mother.
The chatter about milk certainly preceded Herman-Giddens. It may have begun with T. Colin Campbell, a professor of nutritional biochemistry at Cornell University and president and C.E.O. of Paracelsian, a company that develops technologies that measure dioxin in the environment. Campbell was reared on a dairy farm in Northern Virginia, drinking milk straight from the cow. He loved the farming life, he says, adding that his doctoral thesis was about "how to grow animals more efficiently so we can eat more of them and drink more of their milk."
But years of research, he says, have convinced him that meat and dairy products create more health problems than they prevent. His earliest post-doctoral research was conducted in the Philippines, where he noticed that it was the few wealthy children, with access to a milk-laden Western diet, who were developing liver cancer. Then, in the early 1970's, he began a study that would eventually filter into the popular psyche and give milk a bad name. Spending eight years in rural China, he found that cancer rates were high in those regions where milk was a part of the diet and far less common in regions where villagers consumed no dairy products. The breast cancer rate in particular, he found, was only 8.7 per 100,000 women ages 35 to 64, as opposed to the United States, where it was 44 per 100,000.
Campbell now eats an entirely vegan diet, substituting soy cheese and rice milk for dairy products. Although the mothers at my nutrition meeting were concerned about added hormones given to cows to produce extra milk, Campbell says his real concern is the nutritional makeup of the milk itself. Milk from any species, he says, is designed to make infants of that species grow. But what is good for a calf is not necessarily good for a human being. He says he believes that the nutrients naturally found in milk unnaturally stimulate reproductive and growth hormones in humans.
In the past few years, Web sites like NotMilk.com and organizations like Mothers and Others for a Livable Planet have spread Campbell's word (although he is not officially associated with either organization). The colorful NotMilk site delights in describing milk as a glass of "pus with hormones and glue." Its creator, Robert Cohen, who calls himself the Not Milk Man, keeps a list of diseases on the site that he believes are caused by milk. Cohen says he has not read the Herman-Giddens study, but in 1998, a year after that paper came out, he added the category of Early Sexual Maturity to his Web site.
There is nothing in Herman-Giddens's numbers that point to milk as a cause of early puberty. (She did suggest further study of other possible causes, like "hair products containing estrogen and placenta . . . and the increasing use of certain plastics and insecticides that degrade into substances that have estrogen-related physiological effects.") Nor does Campbell blame milk exclusively, saying the larger problem is "diets high in total fat and animal-based protein and low in dietary fiber and complex carbohydrate material."
But this lack of direct evidence has not kept groups like the Physicians' Committee for Responsible Medicine from warning of such a link and urging consumers not to drink milk, for this and other reasons. Says Amy Lanou, the group's nutrition director, "If you accept that human breast milk has biological effects, and we know that cow's milk is breast milk, then how can you not accept that it also has biological effects." It also has not kept mothers like Barbara Wilson of Asheville, N. C., from putting her 7-year-old daughter on a dairy-free diet "so she doesn't have the body of a grown woman by the time she's 10."
"This is how myths start," says Ruth Kava, director of nutrition for the American Council on Science and Health and a registered dietitian. "There have always been hormones in milk, and American girls have always had milk in their diets, so why would that cause a change in puberty all of a sudden. In fact, we're drinking less milk." (Peter Vitaliano, vice president of economic policy and market research for the National Milk Producers' Federation, confirms that milk consumption is going down, but he adds, "the consumption of dairy products as a whole is going up very slightly" because Americans have significantly increased their consumption of cheese.) While the Physicians' Committee for Responsible Medicine describes itself as a nonprofit health organization, Kava describes them as "an animal rights group" and points out that of their 100,000 members, only 5,000 are actually physicians. "There seems to be a certain delight in rebelling against things we've been told are good for us," she adds. "What we need is solid epidemiologic evidence."
Herman-Giddens agrees up to a point. "They're fanatic and they're loud, but that doesn't mean they're wrong," she says of those who question milk. "I used to drink milk three times a day." She explains that her mother, who is 5-foot-2, wanted her to be tall, "so she made me drink lots of milk." Now 5-foot-7, Herman-Giddens says, "I don't drink milk anymore."
Across the country, a group of researchers has been posing questions that have nothing to do with milk but everything to do another possible cause of early puberty. They have gone house to house in places like Tennessee and Indiana asking families with young daughters whether the girls' parents are living together, and if not, whether there is a live-in stepfather or boyfriend in their mother's life. The hypothesis that feeds all these questions is known as the "absent father theory," and it has not yet filtered into the popular culture, perhaps because it is too loaded or too hard for us to believe.
Evolutionary psychologists believe that one's childhood shapes later reproductive behavior. Children growing up in homes where stress is high and the parent-child bonds are weak see the world as a precarious place and their own survival as iffy. It would be in their Darwinian interest to reproduce early and often, increasing the chance that some of their offspring would survive. Children reared in homes where stress is low and parent-child bonds are strong would, in contrast, feel protected and view the world as safe. They would respond by waiting until they were older before having their own children, emphasizing the quality of the relationship over the quantity of offspring.
About 10 years ago, researchers at several separate universities took that theory one step further and wondered whether humans respond to family circumstances not just behaviorally but also biologically. Using existing data designed to measure familial stress and strength of family relationships, they began to cross-reference that information with the ages that girls in the same data set first entered puberty. "Lo and behold," says Jay Belsky, one of those researchers and now a developmental psychologist at the University of London, "those girls who matured earlier were the same girls who had more distant family relationships." While that is not proof that one fact caused the second, Belsky says, "I always say, 'It's not inconsistent with the theory.' That's a cautious way of saying that it's consistent with the theory."
With the publication of the Herman-Giddens data and the increased interest in causes of early puberty, researchers at Vanderbilt University, among others, set out to narrow Belsky's definition of "familial stress." To collect data, researchers visited the homes of subjects for several hours at a time, coding observed interactions between parent and child into such categories as "warm-positive" or "negative-coercive." The greater the level of positive, supportive interactions, the data showed, the later the girls, on average, entered puberty. More striking was the finding that "it was fathers more than mothers" who made the difference, says Bruce J. Ellis, one of the original researchers, who has since moved from Vanderbilt to the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, to continue this research. "It appears that the quality of the father-daughter relationship is the most important aspect of early family environment in relation to subsequent puberty."
At first glance, this seems to be a rare psycho-social result, in that it blames something on fathers instead of mothers. But Ellis and his colleagues go quite a bit further, saying that their data show that the absence of a biological father in a daughter's early life is associated with early puberty and that the presence of an unrelated male in a household, no matter how consistent, may speed it even more. He theorizes that this may all be because of pheromones, those mysterious secretions that can shape behavior.
"There's definitive evidence in humans that the female reproductive cycle is influenced by pheromones," he says. "And we know from experiments with prairie dogs and mice that animal puberty is influenced by pheromones." When the biological prairie-dog father is present, he says, puberty is inhibited. And when a prepubescent mouse is exposed to the pheromones of an unrelated male, puberty begins.
Ellis stresses that his theory will remain unproved when it comes to humans. For ethical and practical reasons, he says, "you can't experiment like that with human girls, so we can't know and may never know what would happen if we did, but we can show that girls who interacted more with their biological fathers when they were 4 to 5 years old go into puberty later."
Belsky said his fear used to be that his work would be seized upon by "intolerant politicians," who would see in it proof that divorce and cohabitation were frowned upon by biology, or that it would be attacked by the African-American community, which would read into it the accusation that certain behavior is affecting the health of African-American girls.
Bruce Ellis says that while "there is a positive message here -- fathers are important and can have a positive influence on daughters' lives" -- he is aware that "some people would disagree and construe any research demonstrating the importance of fatherhood as supporting conservative ideologies."
The outrage these researchers fear, however, has not materialized. So far, their work has been met mostly with silence. Belsky and Ellis each published their results in respected peer-reviewed journals, and yet it has not made a huge splash in the academic world. "Ours is not a popular theory," Belsky says. "It is treated like a biological determinism theory, and that gives it a bad name among some people. They think we're saying biology is destiny here, but this is a theory of nature, not nurture."
Whatever they are saying, it is not taking hold on the playgrounds or at P.T.A. meetings or in the research papers of other developmental scholars. The fact remains that while research tends to mirror our fears, we can't always handle what is learned. The absent-father hypothesis is "a theory that makes us look inward, and we don't tend to like to do that," Herman-Giddens says. "We like to point fingers at something simple, but we don't like to make complicated changes in our lives."
Mary Wolff's office is a cluttered space in Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. If her windows were clean, they would look out on the Hispanic community of northern Manhattan, where the girls she has been studying live. There is a simple solution to the problem of early puberty, she says: "Have your daughters play soccer."
In other words, keep them active and at a healthy weight. Wolff, a professor of community and preventive medicine at Mount Sinai, is one of a group of researchers who believe that puberty is "strongly associated with obesity." The pendulum of parental concern is constantly swinging, and for years we worried that our children were starving themselves to look like Kate Moss. That took our attention away from the fact that while anorexia is a very real problem for many girls, too many of our children are too fat. They are watching too much television, eating too much junk food and spending too little time running around outside. As a result, the percentage of children ages 6 to 11 who are considered overweight nearly doubled during the past 20 years.
Weight has long been known to affect the female reproductive system. Underweight girls tend to menstruate late, if at all, and overweight girls do so early. The reason, says Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, is possibly the protein leptin, which is produced by the body's fat cells and which is also required for normal reproductive function. "It's not the only factor required for puberty," he says, "but it may be permissive in that you need a certain level to allow puberty to happen."
Wolff, like most of the researchers in this area, started out doing something else -- in her case, studying breast cancer, specifically the reason for different rates of the disease among different ethnic groups. Along the way, she observed that Hispanic girls enter puberty later than African-American girls, and her current research is about why this is so. Her hypothesis is that the Hispanic diet includes more plant-based foods.
Dr. Catherine S. Berkey, a biostatistician at Harvard Medical School, has in turn focused much of her work on adolescent health, which led her to research obesity and puberty. Earlier this year, she published a study showing that diet and body size as early in life as age 1 or 2 are predictors of the onset of puberty.
But obesity causes all sorts of other bad things too -- diabetes and heart disease, for example, not to mention social problems -- and that knowledge hasn't resulted in a change in eating habits, so confirmation of a link between obesity and early puberty probably won't make a difference, either. Both Herman-Giddens and Campbell point to the school cafeteria as the best example of the fact that society does not respond quickly to complicated lifestyle change, no matter how compelling the scientific evidence.
"I think it's outrageous that schools have sold out to the soda companies," Herman-Giddens says.
"School lunches are disgusting and abominable," Campbell says. "Everything we know contradicts what is sold on a school lunch tray." What is the use of all this data, he wonders, if "no one listens."
Most of the slides in Herman-Giddens's tray are ads from magazines. As she flashes through the photos, she cuts back and forth through time.
Click. McCall's magazine, November 1950: a youngster, all white lace and frills, advertises "Five Gifts for Small Partygoers." She is probably 12 years old, Giddens says, "but she still looks like a little girl."
Click. Village Voice, March 2000: "Party Girls," says the ad for an escort service, showing "Chrissy and Little Sister Heather" wearing only stars on their nipples. The actual models are probably 18, given pigtails to look like "children," Herman-Giddens says, "but the point is children may see this. It gives the message, We want our children sexualized."
Click. A 7-Up ad from the 1950's: girls in pink taffeta ready for the prom. "Back then children looked like children."
Click. An ad for today's prom dresses: the outfit is slit up to here and down to there. The teenager wearing it rests her hand on a shirtless male model. "No one can look at these ads and say this is nice and healthy and the way I want my children to grow up."
Marcia Herman-Giddens's view of the world is a constant back-and-forth between how things are and how they used to be. She describes standing in line recently with her 12-year-old granddaughter when "I happened to notice that her eye level is exactly on the level with Cosmopolitan magazine. The headlines were '10 Ways to Drive Your Man Wild in Bed,' and my granddaughter was standing there, reading, looking at this half-naked woman. I'm thinking to myself, I wonder what in God's name is going through this child's mind. It's in their face, all the time, literally."
Considering the various theories has led her to develop a hypothesis of her own. "If you watch somebody cut a grapefruit from across the room, you're going to salivate," she says, "which is just one example of how what you see can have a biological effect on your body. We worry about what all the violence is doing to children. Well, what about all the sex? While we're doing all this research, we ought to be researching that."
True, she says, it sounds far-fetched, but no more so than the idea that the physical absence or presence of a father can influence the daughter. And she knows that, like fatty foods, racy media are something Americans are loath to give up. But research is valuable, even if it doesn't lead to change, she says, noting that the real challenge of such a study is finding a control -- a group of children who have not grown up surrounded by billboards advertising underwear. "Perhaps Amish children," she muses, "or Mennonites."
More practically and immediately, she is in the earliest stages of developing an extensive study that would pin down the timing of puberty in boys. At the moment, there is no definitive data on this subject, nothing that tells us if male development has accelerated, too.
If it has, that leads to more questions and more research. Could that be a reason for the seeming spate of violence committed by younger and younger boys? And if the age of puberty for boys has not accelerated and is still where studies put it, at about 12 years old, is this because the male reproductive system is less easily influenced by such triggers as nutrition, obesity and graphic imagery? Or does it mean, instead, that those are not really the cause, or not the only cause, of early female puberty, requiring science to look elsewhere?
Questions like these are more than familiar to Joan Jacobs Brumberg, a professor of history at Cornell University and the author of "Fasting Girls: The History of Anorexia Nervosa." Every disease or disorder, she says, has its own biography, and the story of anorexia is one in which treatment parrots changing times. In the 1870's, it was considered a "nervous" disorder, hence its name, and was fought with high-calorie feeding. In the 1920's, the hormonal theory gained popularity, because that was a time when medicine in general was infatuated with hormones. World War II brought talk of psychoanalytic treatment. Today, researchers wonder about the effects of the reed-thin models in the media, as well as why the disorder affects girls more than boys and whether psychopharmacological medications are the answer.
"Science in and of itself has some culture imbedded in it," Brumberg says. "How could it be otherwise?"
So where does that leave the rest of us who are not scientists but who are trying to figure out how the shifting, unsettling and sometimes downright contradictory results of all this research fits into our lives? Are we building our children's bones when we give them milk or are we fast-forwarding their biology? Are we providing a stable home life when we remarry -- or adopt a child or bear one by a sperm donor -- or are we creating hormonal confusion?
And if scientists disagree on so much of this, how are we supposed to decide?
We have two choices, neither one of which excludes the other. We can take the philosophical approach and view science with skepticism rather than disdain, remembering that each conclusion is just a momentary stop in the march of history. Or we can take the practical road and cling fiercely to the word "moderation." That means doing what feels right at the moment, keeping our ears open for evidence that it is not right and understanding that there is a good likelihood that we are somehow getting it wrong.

HEADLINE: New Wireless Network Set for Iona

BYLINE: By SAM LUBELL 

 BODY:
ON a recent Sunday night, Sarah Shinabery, a junior at Iona College in New Rochelle, went to the McSpedon Computer Lab to work on a paper about Al Gore's economic proposals. Like him, she was running out of time. Yet like many facing the finals rush, she had to wait in line for a computer with Internet access.
Soon that won't be necessary.
Thanks to a wireless system now being planned, students will be able to work anywhere on campus, including the school's expansive lawns. 
 The college said the campuswide wireless network will be installed over the next three years, making Iona one of the first colleges in the area to have such technology.
Once completed, the system will allow students with a laptop and the proper wireless card to gain access to the Internet from anywhere on campus. Computers will pick up wireless Internet signals from small transmitters installed inside or outside buildings. Computers will be available for lease at a discount rate, and the wireless cards will be sold through the college as well.
"This initiative will help make our students into lifelong learners who are adaptable to new technologies," said Joanne Steele, vice provost for information technology. "It fits perfectly with everything we're trying to do here." The system would cost about $400,000, she said.
The wireless system -- paid for by a contribution to the school's Capital Campaign -- will allow many more students to take advantage of the Internet than the current wired system, where access is limited by outlets. It also will let the school enhance its developing technology-based options, like distance learning and virtual classrooms, assignments done over school servers, and Web-based databases.
"We had reached the ceiling as to how much we could do with our hard-wired labs," Dean Warren Greenberg said.
Installation of the wireless network is planned in three stages. The first phase, to be completed next fall, is being offered to incoming freshmen and residential students, and includes all residential halls, libraries, the Murphy Technology Center, the Hagan School of Business and Spellman Hall, the student activities center. Phase 2, expected to be complete by fall 2002, will include the rest of the college's classroom and administrative buildings, while Phase 3 will encompass remaining areas of the school.
Only a few colleges, including Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and Drexel University in Philadelphia, now have wireless Internet systems.
"Technology is a tool. It's a tool that constantly changes," said James A. Liguori, Iona's president. "If you don't change with it, you'll probably be left behind at the end of the day.
"I suspect that within two or three years, a wireless technology initiative will not be new news," he added. "We want to be in front of this curve."
For students like Jason Ford, a senior, this is an encouraging attitude.
"Although I won't be here, I think it will be a great advantage," he said. "As a future alum, it's nice to look at how the school is advancing, and it gives you pride in the school."

HEADLINE: IN BUSINESS;
Visions of Big-Time Sports

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA ROWE 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
IN 26 years as a lawyer, David J. Meiselman says he has won more than $100 million in medical malpractice and personal injury suits and corporate litigation. More quietly, he has also amassed a client roster that reads like the table of contents in People magazine.
Liam Neeson, Judd Hirsch, Stacy Keach and Diana Rigg are listed as clients. His firm manages the estates of Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Jason Sehorn of the New York Giants and Michael Grant, the heavyweight boxer, call from time to time. 
 "It's a very nice thing when someone calls you because they trust your advice," said Mr. Meiselman, 53, whose firm here, Meiselman, Packman, Denlea and Eberz, represents some 200 sports and entertainment figures, as well as doctors and major corporations.
Andrew J. Spano, the county executive, trusts Mr. Meiselman's advice -- and celebrity contacts -- enough to have appointed him the head of the Westchester Sports and Entertainment Commission, an all-volunteer committee of prominent figures in real estate, law, business and the arts who intend to promote the county as a venue for sports and entertainment.
"There are promoters who want to do this kind of stuff here -- big events in Westchester -- but they didn't seem to have anyone to talk to to get the ball rolling," Mr. Meiselman said. So last winter, he approached Mr. Spano with his idea for the commission.
Apparently, one was needed. Jeff Benton, national sales director for the Professional Golfers Association Tour in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., has been involved with such events in Westchester for years and has always found it difficult to generate corporate interest.
"We love Westchester County, but we've had some frustrations there," he said. "We had Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe doing a Senior Men's Tennis Tour for five years at the Westchester Country Club, but we never got enough support from Westchester-based companies to keep it going, so we finally went down to New York City and now we do it there. They were crazy to let us leave."
Better promotion through Mr. Meiselman's group might be just the thing to bring back such high-profile events -- and their accompanying benefits to restaurants, hotels and the like, Mr. Benton said.
"I deal with these kinds of groups all over the country and they're great for the economy in their areas," he said. "David's a smart man and he's a good person to do this. But it's still in its infancy."
Essential to the effort will be finding a place to hold major events. Mr. Meiselman envisions building a 10,000- to 15,000-seat arena where Westchester fans could watch professional boxers and ballplayers instead of traveling to Madison Square Garden.
"If Nassau County can do it and the Meadowlands can do it, there's no reason we can't," Mr. Meiselman said. "I don't think you should have to drive to the Bronx or Manhattan to watch professional sports."
Others have had the same idea.
Harris Schwartzberg, a developer in White Plains, is working with the mayor of Mount Vernon to build a 12,000-seat stadium for minor league hockey, arena football and college basketball. Nothing has been completed -- including the financing, which would be largely private -- but Mr. Schwartzberg said several Westchester executives have approached him about buying luxury suites and he hopes to open the stadium in mid-2003. Mr. Meiselman has met with Mr. Schwartzberg to discuss the proposal.
Meanwhile, Mr. Meiselman and his associates are speaking with Mr. Benton from the P.G.A. to ensure that the Buick Classic tournament, played annually at the Westchester Country Club, remains there after the current contract expires in 2002. They would also like to bring in a circus for children and a "Tour de Westchester" bike race.
"We've heard rumors that the Guggenheim is looking for a northern branch, maybe up here," Mr. Meiselman added, barely disguising his glee, and vowing to have made "major headway" on some of these ideas by summer. "All this can be done," he said, "if people are inspired to do it. You just have to persuade people that it can be done."
Mr. Meiselman provides legal services to many of the entertainers he is trying to attract, like Feld Entertainment, which produces the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus and a host of other shows.
Lawrence E. Dwyer Jr., a member of the commission and head of the county's business association, said Mr. Meiselman's energy and enthusiasm -- coupled with his invaluable Rolodex -- made him a natural leader for the effort.
"Because he has clients in this business, we don't have to reinvent the wheel," Mr. Dwyer said. "But David's not an easy guy. He's a tough guy. He's very strong-willed and very knowledgeable. He didn't get this because he's a nice guy and everybody pats him on the back."
Indeed, Mr. Meiselman can be a formidable opponent in the courtroom and in the boardroom, former associates say.
"He knows where your weakness is and how to exploit your weakness," said one former colleague. "If you've been on the other side of litigation with David, you've had a tiger by the tail."
Lawyers who have worked for him have described him as a "self-promoter" who runs his firm with "an iron fist." Mr. Meiselman is not deterred by such remarks.
"It's my job to be a warrior for my clients," he said. "That's how I look at it. I'm a paid peacemaker, but if I can't make peace, then I am paid to make war. That's what litigation is. It's war."
In addition to being a mover, shaker, lawyer and sports agent, Mr. Meiselman is also a decorated former Marine who served in Vietnam before entering law school. The military, he said, developed in him the discipline essential to realizing his visions.
In his first five years as a lawyer, Mr. Meiselman said he tried 24 civil cases and never lost.
Among the cases he is most proud of is winning a $13.7 million verdict for a man who lost his leg in a wood chipper, the largest cash award ever granted by a Westchester jury (it was eventually reduced to $6.5 million). The presiding judge in that case, Samuel G. Fredman, joined Mr. Meiselman's firm this year.
This is something of a pattern. His first boss in law, Howard Finkelstein, found him so capable that even after he had left Mr. Finkelstein's firm in Newburgh to start one of his own, Mr. Finkelstein hired the 20-something lawyer to represent him in a legal dispute.
"He has a charming personality, very likable, but teamed with it is a keen insight and perspective as to human beings," Mr. Finkelstein said. "It's knowing personalities and knowing human nature. David has his pulse on that. It's what enables him to do a good job. There are dealmakers and there are deal killers, and he's a dealmaker."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
A Real-Life Family Drama in the Yiddish Theater

BYLINE: By NAHMA SANDROW; Nahma Sandrow is the author of "Vagabond Stars: A World History of Yiddish Theater" (Syracuse University Press). She wrote the books for the musicals "Kuni-Leml" and "Vagabond Stars."

 BODY:
THERE has been a quarrel in New York City's Yiddish theater world and, like the plots of both Yiddish stage offerings this year, it is a multi-generational family drama.
The real-life family is the Folksbiene (or People's Stage), at 85 the longest-lived, continuously performing Yiddish theatrical institution in the world. On one side is a matriarch, Zypora Spaisman, who is over 80 herself (she won't say by how much) and for nearly half a century the Folksbiene's mainstay. On the other side are Zalmen Mlotek and Eleanor Reissa, show business pros in their 40's who dreamed of breaking with the old ways in order to, in Mr. Mlotek's words, "ensure that the Folksbiene would live another hundred years." 
 As the Yiddish-speaking population aged, moved away or died, the Folksbiene's audiences steadily shrank. Mrs. Spaisman and her supporters believed that the theater's only hope for survival lay in serving the faithful with familiar, well-loved material. Others felt that new plays and new techniques offered the only hope of attracting new ticket buyers.
Early in the 1997-98 season, the Folksbiene Yiddish Theater's box office revenues were dangerously low. Mr. Mlotek and Ms. Reissa wrote to the board of directors proposing to save the institution by modernizing it. In the spring of 1998 the board named them co-artistic directors of the Folksbiene and eliminated Mrs. Spaisman's position of executive producer.
"We wanted the Yiddish theater to have a future, not to take it away from her," Mr. Mlotek said in a recent interview over coffee near Theater Four on West 55th Street, where the Folksbiene is in residence. "We wanted to honor her work, her stubbornness that had kept it alive. We wanted to make her a banquet, to dedicate the 1999 season to her."
Mrs. Spaisman resisted passionately. "They wanted to give me a nice party," she said the other day in her apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, "to get money in my name and give it to the Folksbiene. And I should step down. I have to be such an idiot?"
It is hard enough to make artistic decisions with two partners, Ms. Reissa said. "Three isn't possible. We wanted to have her on the board and as a consultant. Performing, if there was a part. We tried to give her honor. She's a formidable presence, she devoted her life to this, but it was just time for the theater to move on."
Things got worse. "My heart was bleeding," Mrs. Spaisman recalled. "They say I retired. I never retired."
Ms. Reissa described it this way: "We were struggling. All we had was the summer of 1998. We had to open that fall. We had an empty office, no computer and Zypora took the mailing list."
Mr. Mlotek added: "I was hoping for a collaboration of some sort with her, not to have it disintegrate into this acrimony. I've known her all my life. Let's make sholem. Let's make peace."
Mrs. Spaisman sees it differently: "The mailing list was my people. I developed it. And I walked out with it. I told them, 'You will never be the only Yiddish theater as long as I live.' "
And sure enough, Mrs. Spaisman now has her own troupe, the Yiddish Public Theater, most of whose cast members have appeared in Folksbiene productions.
In the tight Yiddish theater world, there have always been squabbles, but there have always been shows. For the public, the result is a happy one. This Hanukkah season, for the first time in years, New York has two Yiddish theaters. And it should be no surprise that both of this year's plays have happy endings.
The Folksbiene is presenting "An American Family" ("An Amerikaner Mishpokhe") through Jan. 21 at Theater Four. The production, adapted into Yiddish by Miriam Kressyn, is based on a Broadway play by Sylvia Regan, and directed by Ms. Reissa.
Crowded into a Lower East Side tenement apartment in 1910 live a widow, her three marriageable daughters, her young son, plus a boarder who sleeps rent free on the living-room sofa. While outside, as time passes, World War I, the Russian Revolution and the Depression are changing the world, inside, the family struggles with love and jealousy as it gathers around the piano for jazzy Yiddish show tunes like the rousing "Long Live Columbus." The family unit may be shaken and wounded, its members at odds, but the final curtain brings cohesion and even joy.
Through Jan. 14, Mrs. Spaisman's Yiddish Public Theater is presenting the classic "Green Fields" ("Grine Felder"), a pastoral romance set among pious Russian-Jewish farmers, written by Peretz Hirschbein and directed by Bryna Turetsky.
A gentle young scholar comes to tutor the farmers' children. Both farmers have marriageable daughters. While the families compete for the honor of a learned son-in-law, the potential bridegroom remains comically oblivious to their schemes. In the end, the young people sort themselves into happy couples; old friends re-establish harmony and become in-laws; the seasons for haying and apple-picking merge again with the yearly cycle of religious observance.
In his reviews in The New York Times, Lawrence Van Gelder praised the Folksbiene production for its "admirable staging" by Ms. Reissa and music direction by Mr. Mlotek, as well as the "uniformly excellent cast"; while the "crowd-pleasing" "Green Fields," Mr. Van Gelder wrote, is "a heartening augury of the survival of Yiddish theater into a new century," its eight actors, under the "assured direction" of Ms. Turetsky, each get a moment "to captivate the audience."
The Folksbiene was formed on the Lower East Side in 1915, when the Yiddish theater was young. That year in New York City alone there were 14 professional Yiddish theaters. By the late 1930's, when the creative peak was past, a repertory existed from popular to avant-garde and included a range of translations from other languages into Yiddish.
A sense that theater was integral to the heart of secular Yiddish culture encouraged many amateur companies; the Folksbiene, allied with a major fraternal organization, the socialist Workmen's Circle, was soon considered one of the best. And as the years went by, the community had more and more at stake in its existence. What the Holocaust and Communism did to Jewish culture abroad, restrictive immigration laws of the 1920's plus assimilation accomplished in the United States. There was a steady reduction in the number of young households for which the Yiddish language, a combination of Old High German and Hebrew with Slavic and Romance elements, was everyday speech. By 1956, the Yiddish-speaking population had so contracted that while there were still several shows a season, audiences were aging perceptibly, and it had grown harder to make a living as a Yiddish actor.
That was when Zypora Spaisman arrived in New York, joined the Folksbiene, whose fame had reached Poland, and began "the best years of my life." Mrs. Spaisman still moves across a stage deliberately, shoulders squared. She fights exhaustion; she fights gravity: she never slumps. When she is playing a comic wife or a tragic matriarch, her high cheekbones dramatize her fierce concentration, and she looks at the world through unimpressed Asiatic eyes, determined not to flinch. When anti-Semitism kept her out of Polish theater school, she joined an amateur group and supported herself as a midwife. Before and during the war she delivered "about 600 beautiful children -- all killed."
THAT first year in America not only did she win a role, she also marched into Macy's and got them to sell her furniture at sample prices for the theater lobby. She became a wife and mother but continued to perform every year. She sat on the Folksbiene's board of directors, sold tickets and washed the theater floors. "I was born to have a theater life," she said. "Hitler couldn't stop me. Stalin couldn't stop me. No one can stop me."
If Mrs. Spaisman represents the older generation of the Folksbiene family, Zalmen Mlotek was born into a different chapter of family history. Growing up in New York in the 60's, he studied conducting with Leonard Bernstein at the Juilliard School and at Tanglewood. Nevertheless, he describes himself with the proverb: "Dos epele falt nit vayt funm boym" ("The apple doesn't fall far from the tree").
Mr. Mlotek's father was the cultural director of the Workmen's Circle. His mother still writes a column about Jewish music in The Yiddish Forward. Little Zalmen stayed up in his pajamas to hear the stars gathered around his mother's piano, drinking wine and singing. He attended a Yiddish-speaking summer camp (Mrs. Spaisman was there, too, on the staff). By the time he became a teenager, he was helping his parents' friends by arranging scores for their shows. At 21, he did the music for his first Folksbiene production (Mrs. Spaisman was in it). He had already joined the family business.
Today, Mr. Mlotek increasingly devotes his life to music and musical theater with what he calls, in a musician's metaphor, "Jewish resonance." He is on the faculty of Yeshiva University's School of Music and directs the Lincoln Center Summer Klezmer All-Star Concert. With his cousin Moishe Rosenfeld he has created popular English-Yiddish revues, "The Golden Land" (1985) and "Those Were the Days" (1990). Part of the expanding international field of English and bilingual Jewish-interest musical entertainments, they were aimed at non-Jews, non-Yiddish-speaking Jews and even Jews who go out of their way to avoid a Yiddish show. Now the little apples are Mr. Mlotek's children. He speaks Yiddish to them at home, and the two oldest perform in his well-attended interactive musical revue matinees, "Kids and Yiddish."
In comparison to Mrs. Spaisman and Mr. Mlotek, Ms. Reissa is more like a long-lost kid cousin who has come home. When Ms. Reissa, who was born in Brooklyn, was trying to break into show business, she spotted a casting call for the chorus of a professional Yiddish musical. Though her parents were Holocaust survivors and Yiddish was her first language, she wanted Broadway, not Second Avenue. Still, she auditioned, got the part and charmed the public with her juicy Yiddish, vivid gestures and pretty legs. A month later, when the star became ill, she became the star. Since then, she has performed, choreographed and directed in Yiddish and English. And she discovered that performing in Yiddish, when Jewishness is simply taken for granted, can liberate an artist and audience to concentrate on a play's essential humanity. She also discovered, she said, relishing another of life's surprises: "I just like speaking Yiddish. Yiddish feels good in my mouth."
By late 1997, the Folksbiene was the only Yiddish theater in New York City, and Mrs. Spaisman, Mr. Mlotek and Ms. Reissa were trying to keep it alive. While Mrs. Spaisman worked in New York, Mr. Mlotek and Ms. Reissa were performing at the prestigious Berlin Festival of Jewish Song. Half a century earlier, amid the rubble of concentration camps, who could have imagined a Berlin Festival of Jewish Song?
Why not imagine further? In Berlin, Mr. Mlotek and Ms. Reissa drafted the proposal that the Folksbiene board would soon accept. They envisioned a Yiddish theater company for all generations, especially for young Americans newly attracted to klezmer, to Yiddish film festivals, to Jewish studies in college. The company would offer all the cultural activities that Yiddish-speaking communities used to take for granted.
The following summer, 1998, the New York Yiddish community buzzed. The new play by Ms. Reissa drew on experiences of her generation: therapy, crises of Jewish identity -- much of it far from the familiar repertory. She called the piece "Zise Khaloymes" ("Sweet Dreams"). Mrs. Spaisman called it "Bitter Dreams." Mr. Mlotek and Ms. Reissa felt frustrated. Mrs. Spaisman felt usurped. It became clear that she and this new Folksbiene could not work together.
On opening night, Folksbiene regulars were divided, many yearning for the traditional repertory. In his December 1998 review in The New York Times, Mr. Van Gelder called the show a "mixed blessing," and said " 'Sweet Dreams' has difficulty deciding what it wants to be." Nevertheless, according to Ms. Reissa, the proportion of ticket buyers under 65 rose to 45 percent, the highest in years, and the majority of those were non-Yiddish speakers attending the Folksbiene for the first time.
The following season, 1999-2000, Mrs. Spaisman absented herself while the Folksbiene presented a 1924 play from the canon, "Yoshke Musicant" (literally, "Yoshke, the Musician," and translated by the Folksbiene as "A Klezmer's Tale"). Mr. Van Gelder praised the show's "skillful direction" in his review, as well as the score's "sprightly musical direction" and the "talented supporting cast."
This season, 2000-2001, Mrs. Spaisman amazed the Yiddish cultural world by making New York the only city on the globe with two professional Yiddish theater companies. "I opened my own theater," she said calmly, "for my own people." Because of her, Yiddish theater is back on the Lower East Side. "In the end," Mrs. Spaisman maintains, "I am very happy."
Both theaters face the same challenges. First, where do they find actors? "There are still these champions around," Ms. Reissa marvels. "Zypora, Shifra Lerer, Mina Bern -- these artists who, God bless them, you give them a crumb and they give you a loaf of good bread." All three women are performing this season, but they are not enough. Both productions have younger actors as well, veterans of the Yiddish stage, though much or most of their experience is in English. But there aren't enough of them either. So out go the casting notices for people who have "some Yiddish," or "some German," or "a feel for languages." These new recruits -- some of whom are not Jewish -- learn Yiddish as they go along.
Mr. Mlotek argues that the Folksbiene has a mandate to enrich Jewish life for Jews who have grown far from their sources. This means beginning with the old Yiddish repertory, to nourish a public that still hungers for it and to preserve it for their grandchildren. The mandate, he says, also includes new plays, based on traditional material. He and Ms. Reissa, he said, are looking for plays about contemporary Jewish life and plan to sponsor readings of original scripts.
For Mrs. Spaisman the mission is simple. "I have a message in my life," she said. "To keep Yiddish alive; you're not allowed to throw it away. To go to the library, to take off the dust, to take the classics down. Not to let them die. To bring them back to light and not to forget. Because we have great plays, beautiful plays to show."
In Yiddish theater, no less than on Broadway, money is needed. The Folksbiene (its annual operating budget is $750,000) obtains some support from the New York State Council on the Arts and other foundation sources, while fans donate what they can. An expanded board, including Bess Myerson, may help.
Mrs. Spaisman's angels are Jechil M. Dobekirer and his wife, Sally A. Delson. Mr. Dobekirer is a former businessman and fund-raiser in the Yiddish world for Israel bonds. Mrs. Spaisman is also economizing (the company's annual operating budget is slightly more than $100,000) by renting the Mazer Theater at the Educational Alliance on East Broadway. But she worries that elderly audiences may have trouble maneuvering on an escalator in the F train station and she is trying to raise money to move the show uptown.
Most important: theaters need ticket buyers. It is estimated that there are only about 3 million Yiddish speakers in the world, a proportion of whom are the ultra Orthodox, who do not support theater. To lure audiences that include what Ms. Reissa calls "the Yiddish-impaired," the Folksbiene and the Yiddish Public Theater provide English, and English and Russian translations, respectively, via headsets and supertitles. At the moment, both theaters are playing simultaneously, but if the Folksbiene switches to fall and spring seasons, that won't be a problem, and in any case they are as likely to stimulate each other's ticket sales as compete for them.
In the end, families last the old-fashioned way. The Yiddish theater world has always encouraged weddings and babies, offstage as well as on. Of the veteran stars currently performing, Mina Bern and Shifra Lerer were married to well-known Yiddish actors. Mr. Mlotek met his wife when she was the Folksbiene stage manager. Last season, the Folksbiene cast produced two matches.
Since New York has two Yiddish theaters now, why choose? Why not, as the saying goes, "Dance at two weddings"?

HEADLINE: FILM;
Practicing Surprise, Finding Success

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT 

 BODY:
ELEVEN years ago, Steven Soderbergh's first film, "Sex, Lies and Videotape," won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, making him, at 26, the youngest director ever to win that festival's most coveted prize. The title quickly entered the tabloid-headline vernacular (it would gain new relevance during the long melodrama of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal), but the movie itself was, and remains, refreshingly unsensational. Its spare, mordant comedy of sexual betrayal and romantic confusion seemed to touch obliquely on a widespread sense of unease, though Mr. Soderbergh's script refrained from specifying the causes of this mood (AIDS? economic anxiety? generational exhaustion?) beyond the troubled relationships of its four main characters.
The film's extraordinary success was perhaps disproportionate to its merits, but sometimes it's necessary to make a big deal out of a small movie, if only as a gesture of revolt against the grandiosity of Hollywood. "Sex, Lies and Videotape" was a modest, well-made picture coming at the end of a decade dominated by loud, outsize blockbusters. Mr. Soderbergh, with the brave tactlessness of youth, was quoted in the press referring to two of the leading purveyors of such pictures, Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, as "slime, barely passing for human." He quickly became, like Spike Lee before him, a symbol and spokesman for the possibility that Hollywood's business as usual was not the only game in town -- that serious, intelligent movies could once again flourish on American soil. As Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote in a report from Cannes, Mr. Soderbergh's anointment as the latest golden boy of the emerging American independent cinema burdened him at the outset with high expectations and set him up for a backlash of deflationary second-guessing. "It's all downhill from here," he remarked dryly in his moment of early glory, as the offers poured in. 
 Happily, such pessimism, however facetious, has proved unwarranted. While the indie boom of the early 90's produced its share of hustlers, opportunists and flashes in the pan, Mr. Soderbergh's career has been as twisty as one of his movies. The seven features he made in the 1990's are astonishingly diverse in genre and style, ranging from the literary atmospherics of "Kafka" (his inevitable sophomore disappointment, ridiculed, unfairly, by some of the same critics who had championed "Sex, Lies and Videotape") to the tenderness of "King of the Hill," to the cerebral noir of "The Underneath" and to the low-key machismo of "Out of Sight," his 1998 adaptation of an Elmore Leonard novel.
While critics adored some of these movies, especially "Out of Sight" and "King of the Hill," large-scale commercial success eluded Mr. Soderbergh. But even as he courted a mass audience, and "Out of Sight" helped to turn George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez into movie stars, Mr. Soderbergh continued to make formally daring, intellectually challenging films like "Schizopolis" in 1996 and "The Limey" last year. As many of his contemporaries -- most notably Quentin Tarantino -- have spawned legions of imitators and flirted with mannered self-imitation, Mr. Soderbergh has remained stubbornly idiosyncratic and has resisted the temptation to repeat himself.
In the past year, he has shaken off the curse of precocious triumph and emerged from the limbo of being a hitless critics' darling, ascending at last to his rightful, if unexpected, place as a top Hollywood director. "Erin Brockovich," which starred Julia Roberts as a crusading paralegal, was the first movie of 2000 to make $100 million at the box office. One of the few films so far this year to be embraced by both audiences and reviewers (with a few dissenters, including this writer), "Erin Brockovich" is likely to pick up a handful of Oscar nominations. If it does, Mr. Soderbergh may be in the enviable position of competing with himself: his new movie, "Traffic," opens on Wednesday. It's certainly his largest, most ambitious movie so far, and it may also be his most accomplished.
The two pictures could hardly be more different. "Erin Brockovich" is essentially a vehicle for Ms. Roberts's acting talent and movie-star charisma, which fight each other to a draw. The movie's story is as linear and conventional as they come: rags to riches, triumph of the underdog, working class ugly duckling into high-powered legal swan. "Traffic," in contrast, is an ensemble piece, a dense weave of stories grounded not in a character but in a charged, topical theme -- the drug war, seen from all sides of the battlefield. But different as they are, and as much of a departure from his earlier work as each one seems to be, both pictures are stamped with Mr. Soderbergh's unmistakable, if sometimes elusive, style.
Over the years, Mr. Soderbergh has developed a striking visual and narrative approach and has honed his instinctive feel, already impressively evident in "Sex, Lies and Videotape," for the expressive capacities of the medium. At his best -- in "King of the Hill," "Out of Sight," "The Limey" and "Traffic" -- he marries thrilling technical precision with an unobtrusive respect for acting. While he has clearly been influenced by earlier filmmakers like John Cassavetes, Jean-Luc Godard and Orson Welles, he has avoided the traps of homage and pastiche, the glib quotations and presumptuous mimickings so irresistible to his contemporaries.
Mr. Soderbergh, with his studious attention to film language, his formalism and his thoughtful application of craft, is more modernist than postmodernist. Rather than trafficking in shock, his movies aim for the rarer, more valuable effect of surprise.
One astonishment of "Sex, Lies and Videotape" was its unassuming air of self-confidence. As he has matured, Mr. Soderbergh has demonstrated a remarkable ability to trust not only his own instincts but the abilities of his actors and the intelligence of the audience. He assumes, as few American filmmakers dare these days, that you will pay attention, and your attention is rewarded, at the minimal, pleasurable cost of momentary confusion. The opening of "Erin Brockovich" is a tour de force of disorientation, as Ms. Roberts's character endures a humiliating job interview, a car accident and the desperate anxiety of impoverished single motherhood. The scenes play with our sense of time and subvert the lazy sense of narrative rhythm inculcated by bad movies and commercial television. Mr. Soderbergh allows some scenes to play on for an extra beat or two, as though to capture the awkward pauses of everyday experiences, and cuts others short to create a feeling of dread and implication. The car accident, which other directors might foreshadow with hackneyed cross-cutting or portentous music, takes place at the far edge of the screen, just at the moment our minds have wandered in anticipation of the next scene.
In the long run, the film's small surprises can't quite compensate for its overall predictability, but "Erin Brockovich" at least proved that Mr. Soderbergh's vision could assert itself within conventional parameters. It could just as well be argued, though, that he had already proved as much at least three times: in "King of the Hill," a coming-of-age story set during the Great Depression; in "Out of Sight," a romantic crime caper; and with the spare, almost classical revenge plot of "The Limey."
YET even though each of these movies, like "Erin Brockovich," ends up exactly where you might expect, they arrive at their destinations circuitously, collecting moments of unanticipated whimsy and pathos along the way. "The Limey" tells a simple, familiar story -- a British ex-con played by Terence Stamp arrives in Los Angeles to avenge the death of his daughter, which he believes was caused by a shady music producer played by Peter Fonda. But the director uses the plainness of the story as an opportunity to linger over telling details and explore its rich subtext. The movie, with its jump cuts and its forays into fantasy (Mr. Stamp's character imagines the death of his antagonist many times before it happens), becomes an extended meditation on the puzzling relationship between personal and historical time. Specifically, it's about the 60's, a much-mythologized decade evoked not by costumed flashbacks but by the flickering shadow of Mr. Stamp, a young, brash, beautiful star of the period, in clips from one of his old movies.
The story in "Traffic" is almost dizzyingly complex, with three main narrative lines, a dozen major characters, too many strong performances to list and nearly 100 different locations. The action takes place in Tijuana, San Diego, Cincinnati and Washington, and Mr. Soderbergh, who was the cinematographer (credited under a pseudonym) as well as the director, has used a variety of filters and film stocks to give each place its own look and texture. The cast includes Soderbergh stalwarts like Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman, as well as Michael Douglas, Amy Irving and, most astoundingly, Benicio Del Toro in two languages, Spanish and English.
A director who began his career with a deft chamber piece has now at last attempted a symphony. Is it a populist art film or an especially arty popular movie? Is Mr. Soderbergh an independent who has infiltrated Hollywood, or was he always a mainstream director in maverick's clothing? Such questions are based on rather wobbly distinctions, the kind Mr. Soderbergh, early on, seemed likely to uphold. Now, at the top of his game, he may help to abolish them, which would be good news indeed.

HEADLINE: Bush's Birthplace? It's Deep in the Heart of . . . New Haven

BYLINE: By DICK AHLES 

 BODY:
IT'S taken 211 years, but Connecticut has finally produced a president of the United States.
True, George W. Bush pulled up stakes and moved to Texas at an early age -- the age of 2 to be precise -- but his birth in New Haven on July 6, 1946, makes him a Connecticut native and the only one ever elected president. Good luck getting him to acknowledge that. 
 Mr. Bush was born in Connecticut just as his father, who had delayed college to serve as a World War II Navy pilot, had completed his sophomore year at Yale. George W. was born to Barbara and George Bush in what was then Grace-New Haven Community Hospital and is now Yale-New Haven Hospital. The new baby's first home, according to Herbert Parmet, his father's biographer, was 37 Hillhouse Avenue, a one-family house that had been converted into apartments for veterans and their families.
"Not to make too much of the postwar housing shortage," the elder Bush has written, "but there were a dozen other veterans' families sharing the house with us -- each with one child, except for Bill and Sally Reeder, who had twins. That made 40 in all."
But the neighborhood was good. Charles Seymour, the president of Yale, lived next door at 43 Hillhouse Avenue, which is still home to Yale presidents. The Bush homestead still stands and is presently occupied by the Yale Economics Department.
Christopher Collier, the state historian, said one reason Connecticut failed to produce a president in more than 200 years has been its small population and its few electoral votes, which now stand at eight and will be down to seven for the next presidential election in 2004. (Of course, Calvin Coolidge, a native of Vermont, with just three electoral votes, won the presidency in 1924.)
Bill Curry, a Democrat who was a former state comptroller and ran for governor of Connecticut in 1994, said the explanation had more to do with the state's traditional sensibilities.
"To become president, one must put oneself forward in a way Connecticut Yankee society has never smiled upon," he said. "And besides, we were too busy creating insurance."
When George and Barbara Bush later went to Texas with young George W., they were following a Connecticut tradition. There was a tendency in the past for some of the state's best and brightest residents to wander. In 1831, according to Albert Van Dusen's history, "Connecticut," a third of the members of the United States Senate and a fourth of the House of Representatives had been born in Connecticut, but elected to office elsewhere.
That same year, after his famous tour of America, Alexis de Tocqueville, attended a Fourth of July party in Paris where he noted how many people from Connecticut represented other states in Congress and toasted the state as "the home of the clock peddler, the schoolmaster and the senator. The first give you time, the second tell you what to do with it and the third make your law and your civilization."
Actually, Connecticut and Texas go way back. Among the Connecticut people who preceded the Bushes to Texas were the Austins -- Moses, a native of Durham, and his son Stephen, who grew up in Colchester. In 1822, Mexico's government gave Moses Austin, a lead miner and dry goods dealer, permission to establish the first American settlement in Texas. Moses Austin died before his 300 settlers arrived, but Stephen eventually established the settlement. The city of Austin is named for him. (Almost 200 years later, his fellow Nutmegger, Mr. Bush, installed his campaign headquarters there.) Stephen Austin also ran for president -- of the Republic of Texas -- but he lost to Sam Houston.
And there's more. The first governor of Texas to live in the governor's mansion that is now home to Mr. Bush was Elisha Pease, governor from 1853 to 1857, according to Eric Travis, librarian at the Austin History Center. Pease was born in Enfield.
Despite the rich history between Texas and Connecticut, Mr. Bush doesn't seem inclined to admit to his Connecticut roots. His official biography on his campaign's Web site says he "was born on July 6, 1946, and grew up in Midland and Houston, Texas." It tells us that Mr. Bush has a dog named Spot and cats named India, Cowboy and Ernie. There is no mention of Connecticut.
After Mr. Bush chose Dick Cheney as his running mate last summer, the two went to Mr. Cheney's hometown of Casper, Wyo., where they reveled in their westernness, with Mr. Bush telling the crowd "Dick was born in Nebraska and I grew up in Midland, Texas," again failing to mention that he was born somewhat to the east of Midland, a fact that especially surprises Texans.
"Are you kidding?" said Mr. Travis of the Austin History Center when told of Mr. Bush's past. "Was he really born in Connecticut?"
 A spokesman for the Bush-Cheney campaign in Austin said he could not explain Mr. Bush's tendency to omit his birthplace.
Certainly, it could all be about politics. An archivist at the George Herbert Walker Bush Presidential Library in College Station, Tex., where George W.'s birth certificate is filed, said Texas politicians are proud of their Texas roots and unlikely to admit being born anywhere else.
As Mr. Travis said, "Not being born in Texas wouldn't help anyone running for office here."
Mark Effron of West Hartford, the vice president for news for the Post-Newsweek Stations, got to hear Mr. Bush's response about his birthplace first hand when they met at a convention in Seattle last year.
Mr. Effron told him that he understood that Mr. Bush was born in New Haven. Mr. Bush put his arm around Mr. Effron and in a quiet voice said, chuckling, "Let's keep that our little secret."
Of course, gratitude, or the lack of it, may have something to do with Mr. Bush's reluctance to boast about Connecticut.
He didn't pick the best year to run for president in the old, home state. Connecticut's Republicans preferred John McCain in the primary and Al Gore easily won in the general election.
With Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut as Mr. Gore's running mate, the state had quite a representation in the presidential election this year.
Taking third place nationally, of course, was the Green Party's Ralph Nader, who was born in Winsted.
This year, Connecticut was going to make the White House no matter what.

HEADLINE: COUNTY LINES;
Toward a More Aerobic Santa

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

 BODY:
IT'S a little late to be bringing this up, but as we head toward the Yuletide finish line here, I wonder if the, well, iconography of the season isn't in need of a little freshening up.
I don't want to step on any toes. I realize there's a lot of affection out there for Santa Claus, reindeer, elves, eggnog, mistletoe and all the other familiar trappings of the holiday season. I understand that there are plenty of things -- Thanksgiving, Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, aspirin, Coke with lemon -- that have been around a long time but work just fine the way they are. 
But, with all respect, it's hard to think of any product, company or marketing campaign that puts on the same face now that it did more than a century ago.
Every now and then even the most trusted symbols or logos -- Campbell's soup cans, say, or Aunt Jemima -- take on a new look and life goes on. Some people thought the world would end when this newspaper added color and now no one can imagine the paper coming out in just black and white.
I'm no marketing expert, but it doesn't take a genius to see two indisputable things about the commercial environment.
First, most Americans now live in suburbs, not in cities or on farms, which is why most ads are pitched to people who live in places like Westchester County. Second, we're a culture that worships youth and the dollars that kids spend. So with that in mind, if you're the C.E.O. of North Pole Inc. you have to wonder if you're really getting your message out to the right demographic.
If we're going to try to think outside the box here, let's start with Santa Claus. Sure, he gets the under-7 vote. But from the red leisure suit and creepy beard to the aerobically challenged physique and couch-potato affect, it's hard to think of a less contemporary product spokesman for anything other than the National Cholesterol Council.
Now, I'm not advocating this, mind you, just offering some thoughts for discussion or cogitation. But might it not be time for a somewhat more up-to-date spokesman? One approach might be someone like Bill Cosby -- familiar, likable and stylishly multicultural.
Or to be a little more proactive in going for the teenage dollars, maybe some MTV-ready personality like Tom Green, the lovably gross and obnoxious Gen X (or is it Y?) whatever he is. Or I could imagine an exciting new spokesman, someone called, say, Sammy the Stuff Guy, who would sprint around malls in red and green Nike spandex, high-fiving kids and passing out CD's, nose rings and tattoo kits.
Same with the elves. There's probably a reason there's not much elf marketing going on these days. Maybe Sammy could hang around with a boy band in cargo pants and pastel fleece vests, the Christmas Elvises. That would keep the sidekick motif but bring it a bit more up to date.
And the reindeer. I'm not exactly sure what the difference is, if any, between reindeer and those hoofed creatures running around your neighborhood eating rose bushes, rooting through garbage and colliding with minivans. But trying to reach a suburban audience with deer imagery is like trying to reach the handgun control people with Charlton Heston ads.
If we want an animal presence, I'd recommend something more Lands' End or Eddie Bauer-like -- maybe a black Lab or a golden retriever. And if the goal is transportation maybe a customized Land Rover -- the Sammy Wagon -- or he could travel on one of those Razor scooters, great once again for those high-energy mall appearances.
Mistletoe? Eggnog? Bing Crosby and Perry Como singing "White Christmas"? You're building a marketing campaign around this?
Like the Republicans in Florida, we're probably saved by the bell this time. It really is too late to order a fair recount of the iconography in time for this year's holiday.
And it's possible that just like it took New Coke to make everyone fall back in love with original Coke, the main effect of bringing in a hipper cast of characters would be to pump up the approval ratings of Santa, the elves, famous reindeer, etc.
So we'll stand pat for now.
But if the economy goes into the tank next year and they need to goose the Christmas numbers a little, remember where you heard this first.

HEADLINE: On a Pier in Philadelphia, Luxury Apartments

BYLINE: By MAUREEN MILFORD

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
Unlike the waterfronts in historic East Coast cities that developed their harbors as attractions for residents and tourists, Philadelphia's bleak eastern edge is experienced by most people as a blur as they rocket by on Interstate 95.
Because the highway parallels the Delaware River, it has served as a psychological and, to a point, physical barrier to redevelopment of the city's colonial gateway. 
 Now, with construction of a $75 million apartment building -- the first high-rise residential development actually on the river in the city's more than 300-year history -- the wall may be beginning to disappear.
Construction began this fall on Dockside, a 16-story apartment building on Pier 30 South, a finger pier just downstream from the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. When it opens in late 2001, the project, which is being developed by the DePaul Group of Blue Bell, Pa., will add 240 luxury apartments to a downtown begging for high-end rentals.
This sprawling city has experienced large population losses in the last four decades, but central Philadelphia has been gaining residents in recent years, said Paul R. Levy, executive director of the Center City District, a business improvement organization.
In the 1990's alone, the area had an increase of 5,000 people, a 7 percent jump, to a total of about 75,000. Philadelphia now has the nation's third largest downtown residential population, behind New York City and Chicago, according to a study by the University of Pennsylvania and the city.
Center City encompasses an area of about two square miles from the Delaware River west to the Schuylkill and from South Street north to Spring Garden Street. But those boundaries are expanding with the influx of new residents from suburbia and other states, Mr. Levy said. The Dockside development, on Christopher Columbus Boulevard near South Street, is sure to answer some of the pent-up demand for downtown apartments, he said.
There has been no construction of new luxury apartment buildings in the area since the 1980's, said J. Paul Williams, president of Axiom Inc., a Philadelphia-based market research and appraisal company.
The result: occupancy rates for downtown apartments now stand at 98 percent, while rents have been climbing by 3 to 4 percent a year since 1993, Mr. Williams said. Today, a 470- to 530-square-foot studio apartment in Philadelphia rents for $900 to $1,100 a month. A two-bedroom 1,200-square-foot unit rents for about $2,500.
"In the better apartments, vacancy is limited to the time it takes to recarpet and repaint the unit," Mr. Williams said.
Besides adding upper-end rental housing to this city of roughly 1.6 million, the construction of Dockside and the recent completion of a 350-room Hyatt Regency hotel on Christopher Columbus Boulevard at Penn's Landing are evidence that the four-mile stretch of riverfront at Center City is coming into its own, city watchers say.
"It's finally going to happen," said City Councilman Frank Rizzo Jr., whose larger-than-life father, the late Frank Rizzo, was mayor when the quasi-public Penn's Landing Corporation was created in the 1970's to revitalize the waterfront.
COMBINED, the apartment and hotel developments represent $150 million in private investment on the river, the biggest so far. The previous residential construction on the river occurred in 1985, when Piers 3 and 5 North were converted to condominiums, said Dominic Sabatini, who has headed the corporation for 20 years.
Through a 99-year lease with the city, the corporation controls 11 finger piers, including the one for the Dockside. The company also has charge of 37 acres between Market and South streets that were created with fill and dedicated in 1976 as Penn's Landing, for the city's Quaker founder, William Penn. The area now includes walkways, a boat basin, a restaurant, the Independence Seaport Museum and the Hyatt.
The proposed centerpiece for Penn's Landing is a $300 million Family Entertainment Center. It will include an 18-screen theater, shops, restaurants, a children's museum and an aerial tramway connecting the Philadelphia and Camden waterfronts.
Ground is expected to be broken early next year, but Philadelphians will believe it when they see it. For decades, one ambitious project after has been announced with great fanfare, only to fizzle. When the Simon Property Group of Indianapolis, the most recent developer of the retail and movie component, signed on in 1997, it said the project would be finished in 2000.
James J. Cuorato, the city's commerce director, said the project delays are a result of having four separate parties involved in the overall development: Simon; the Penn's Landing Corporation; the Please Touch Museum, the children's museum; and the Delaware River Port Authority, which is building the aerial tram. The agreements involve such issues as air rights, liability, maintenance, security and construction cost allocations, he said.
City Councilman Frank DiCicco, whose district includes Center City and the riverfront, remembers that when he was a child, the waterfront had an old world charm even when it was well into its downward spiral.
"My father used to take me down there, and we'd go to the wholesale fish markets," Mr. DiCicco, 54, said. "There were cobblestone streets and trucks and pushcarts. Even though it was junky looking, it had a certain ambience. You knew it was part of the city's history."
Three years after William Penn started Philadelphia in 1681, the first wharf was built on the Delaware River. By the 1720's, the port was second only to London in the amount and value of tonnage handled, according to Walter Licht, professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania. "The city hovered around the port until after the signing of the Constitution," Professor Licht said.
By the 1820's, the city's commercial district began to move west and the port lost commercial prominence to New York City. But the waterfront remained a center for shipbuilding and manufacturing. Indeed, the river has been called "America's Clyde."
As Philadelphia began losing its industrial base in the 1920's, the waterfront slid into decline, with large industrial sites blighting the landscape, Professor Licht said.
Once efforts to redevelop the riverfront were under way in 1967, it became clear Interstate 95 would be a problem. Construction of the highway through Philadelphia was stalled for years by litigation brought by nearby residents worried about views. Then, when the partially covered interstate was completed in the late 1970's, there was no direct access to the waterfront.
THAT changed in 1991, with the building of access ramps to Christopher Columbus Boulevard. Two pedestrian bridges over the interstate were constructed to connect the waterfront with downtown, and two other bridges were built for both pedestrians and vehicles.
The initial site for the Dockside apartments was Pier 9 North, but the plans were abandoned after residents in Piers 3 and 5 North objected. Pier 30 South was offered as an alternative.
The finger pier had been used most recently as parking for the Moshulu restaurant, a four-masted ship, moored next door at Pier 34 South. The restaurant closed earlier this year after the tip of Pier 34, used as an outdoor nightclub, collapsed into the river, killing three people. It was one of the piers along the river not owned by the Penn's Landing Corporation.
Leonard S. Poncia, director of development at DePaul, called the pier collapse a tragedy but said it would not affect the Dockside development. Indeed, the developers are driving 450 pilings into the pier with the Moshulu as backdrop.
To accommodate residents of nearby Queen Village, just west of Interstate 95, who said the original design would impair views and the openness of the area, the developers agreed to set the building back 80 feet from the street and to create and maintain a public park in front.
The building's design resembles an ocean liner at berth. Because the narrow pier measures roughly 530 feet long by 120 feetwide, the structure will be offset to soften the bulky appearance and break up the length of the interior corridors, said John Thrower of Bower Lewis Thrower Architects in Philadelphia. The building steps down facing the city.
Each apartment -- whether it is a 669-foot studio or a 1,912-square-foot three-bedroom unit -- will have a terrace. Apartments on the fourth floor, which is the first level above the 370-car garage and approximately 55 feet above street level, will have terraces ranging from 1,000 to 1,400 square feet.
Plans also call for an indoor-outdoor pool, fitness center and community room. Rental rates have not been set, but early estimates have ranged from $1,800 to $4,000 a month. "I have no doubt it will be rented long before it's complete," Mr. Thrower said.

HEADLINE: DOWN THE SHORE;
Wildwood's Name Game

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS 

 BODY:
Caught up in the swirl of slapping a corporate name on every civic monument and festival, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority has turned to a Los Angeles sports marketing company to look into the possibility of selling the naming rights to the new Wildwood Convention Center and the two convention facilities in Atlantic City.
Yes, fans will root for their favorite college team on New Year's in the Nokia Sugar Bowl, the FedEx Orange Bowl and the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl. Millions watch the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. New Jerseyans will go to the Continental Airlines Arena to watch the Nets and the Devils. But somehow, the Laura's Fudge Wildwood Convention Center or the Mr. Peanut Convention Hall in Atlantic City doesn't seem to make it. 
 Mayor Duane Sloan of Wildwood is skeptical about what the Envision Corporation of Los Angeles might do to jazz up the name of the convention center that is rising on Wildwood's boardwalk, which is expected to be completed in about a year.
"I just don't think this is the right thing for a community such as this to do," said Mayor Sloan. "And besides, my take on this from an economic standpoint is that it isn't going to be feasible to sell the name for enough money to a corporate entity to be worth that agency's time."
Considering that even the fire department concedes there have been a disproportionate number of fires on the boardwalk, maybe Wildwood should name the center after a flame retardant.
As it stands, the Sports and Exposition Authority has contracted with Envision, the sports marketing subsidiary of the Anschutz Corporation, which controls Qwest Communications and several Los Angeles sports franchises, to determine whether it is feasible to sell the naming rights to the three South Jersey convention centers. Indeed, the $150,000 contract with Envision may well be nearly as much as the yearly take could be for those rights.
In St. Paul, a city with about 50 times the population of Wildwood, naming rights for its convention center went to a local corporation, Touchstone Energy, for $2.35 million for 10 years, or $235,000 a year. Milwaukee has 600,000 people and Atlantic City has 40,000, and Milwaukee's convention complex is now the Midwest Express Center (for the small airline) for $566,000 a year for 15 years.
But then, St. Paul doesn't have a two-block-wide beach like Wildwood's and Miss America doesn't stroll the boards in Milwaukee -- so the Sports and Exposition Authority says it wants to examine the options.
"Naming arenas and stadiums has been standard industry practice for a decade," said a spokesman for the Sports and Exposition Authority, John Samerjan. "Historically, it has not as true in convention centers until the last two years or so. Our board just decided to investigate the possibility."
In 1996, the Sports and Exposition Authority took the name of former Gov. Brendan Byrne off the arena in the Meadowlands and sold the rights to Continental Airlines for $29 million over 12 years. And in the past it has explored selling naming rights to the Meadowlands Race Track -- though is not doing so at the moment. Under the original building agreement, Giants Stadium will retain its name as long as the Giants want it so.
Envision worked the deal to sell the naming rights to the new arena in Los Angeles to the Staples office supply company, and it also got Polaroid to spend $75 million over 20 years to name the new showplace that will hold the Academy Awards the Kodak Theater.
"What you are seeing now is that companies and property holders are using naming rights as revenue streams," said Rob Yowell, vice president of sales for Envision. "This isn't going to be $75 million, to be sure. But it may exist at lower levels and may accomplish the goals of raising more money for the centers."
Mr. Yowell said that probable candidates for naming rights to the Wildwood and Atlantic City convention centers would be either regional companies or a firm that might deal with conventioneers or planners around the country. Most lucrative contracts for arenas come because the name will get mentioned on television or in print because college or professional sports teams play there or stars hold concerts there.
Mr. Yowell admitted that would probably not be part of the scheme in selling naming rights in Wildwood or Atlantic City.
"But exposure is still the name of the game," he said. "We're sure some company will see the value in it for them."
Mayor James Whalen of Atlantic City put it like this: "It's a reality of life these days that part of the financial underpinnings of these buildings involve naming rights. I understand the sentiment to keep it named after Atlantic City. There are things we shouldn't do, like name it after a tobacco company or a Connecticut casino. But these buildings generally operate in the red, so if you can get some money in naming rights, you might be able to address the red ink."
Still, Mayor Sloan of Wildwood is both skeptical and frustrated by the mere effort.
"Unless there is going to be some outrageous financial incentive, it doesn't benefit anyone here," he said. "It makes us look like we are selling out. We need to promote the names of Wildwood and Atlantic City, not some corporate entity. We worked so hard to get these facilities, now we shouldn't cheapen them."

Newark's Vanishing Skyline

 BODY:
AN air horn shrieked out a warning as the countdown hit the one-minute mark before the explosives were timed to go off on a recent early Saturday morning. Charges had been carefully set at strategic structural points in the buildings. The count was picked up again at 10 seconds and could now be heard from the radios of police and demolition workers standing about 500 feet away. When the count ran out, there was momentary pause followed by a flurry of loud cracks. A second later, a plume of smoke and dust bloomed. Another series of cracks rang out along with deeper booms as a second series of explosives detonated. There was a slight pause, and then the whole building seemed to tremble like jelly, before melting down into a cloud of dust.
When the dust settled, what had been the 21-story Hill Manor (bottom) in Newark emerged as a huge mound of rubble. The building had been turned over to the Newark Housing Authority, which contracted to have the building taken down. The site was being cleared for new low-density homes. 
 The high-rise complexes built in the 50's for lower-income families had become unmanageable and crime-ridden by the 1980's and were considered icons of failed urban housing policies. For more than a decade Newark, with the help of federal financing, has been working to replace the high-rises with town-house-style construction.
Since the program in Newark began, high-rise buildings with more more than 3,700 units have been demolished in implosions. Two of the Columbus Houses (top) were imploded in 1996. The shape of one building imploded in 1994 was still visible in the rubble (right). By 1995, new town houses (below right) had been built nearby when the last two high-rise buildings in the complex were taken down.
In 1997, a couple watched from of a car (above) as four buildings in the Hayes Homes complex were brought down. At the Edward Scudder Homes, a youngster (below left) took along a souvenir brick after a building was taken down in 1996. The following year a police officer (above right) kept young spectators away from the wreckage of another building.
In the next year and a half, seven buildings in the Stella Wright Homes are scheduled to be demolished with explosives.

Tenants Suspect a Plot In a Plan to Replace Windows

BYLINE: By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
From the windows of his home in Graham Court Apartments, perhaps Harlem's most majestic apartment building, Laconia Smedley has seen 40 years of change.
The guardhouse is gone. The wooden doors that led from the building to the courtyard have been replaced with metal ones. And four stained-glass chandeliers, which once hung outside, have been taken down. 
 Now the landlord wants to replace the building's 400 original mahogany windows with aluminum ones. But tenants say the renovation is unnecessary. They also say it is a ploy to drive up the rent, which can be increased if certain work is done to the building.
"We just want repairs," said Mr. Smedley, 65, who is chairman of the tenants association's landmark committee. "Nothing would replace the grandeur of the wood."
Joshua Frankel, who works for the landlord, the Graham Court Owners Corporation, said the repairs were necessary.
"What exactly they think we can do to these windows is beyond me," he said. "I gain nothing except a reduction in heating costs by putting in these new windows."
Graham Court, on Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard between 116th and 117th Streets, was built in 1901. Its two- to five-bedroom apartments with Italian tile floors and at least two fireplaces have been home to some of Harlem's best-known musicians, actors, intellectuals and athletes, including Earl the Pearl Monroe and Danny Glover. Monthly rents in the 100-unit building range from $157 for longtime tenants to $1,500 for newer arrivals.
The building became a landmark in 1984, and thus alterations to its exterior must be approved by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. In 1996, the landlord received permission to install new windows after an inspection found that 20 percent of them were beyond repair.
The tenants association conducted its own survey last summer, to which 55 tenants responded. Only two wanted their windows replaced. Most wanted them repainted and repaired. Still, Mr. Frankel said the company planned to install the aluminum windows and seek rent increases.
The tenants have enlisted the support of Community Board 10. They are hoping that the Department of Housing and Community Renewal will reject the owner's request for a rent increase. But officials at the housing department say it is unlikely that the agency will intervene before the new windows are in place. SHERRI DAY

HEADLINE: The New A B C D's of Alphabet City

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN

 BODY:
NOT too long ago, the name Alphabet City evoked images of burned-out buildings, rubbish-strewn lots, squatters and drug dealers. These days, the marketers of the high-priced condomiminiums and luxury rentals that are sprouting everywhere in the neighborhood are more likely to refer to it as the East Village, of which it is only a part, or to sweep it into the even-broader domain of the Lower East Side.
But whatever its title, it has been clear for some time, as prices soar and crime rates tumble, that the area encompassing Avenues A, B, C and D from 14th Street to Houston Street has acquired a patina of affluence and stylishness even as it remains a bastion of middle class dwellings and subsidized housing. 
 "In the last year and a half, I would guess 1,000 new units of housing have been built here," said Harvey Epstein, a Legal Aid Society lawyer and chairman of the housing committee for Community Board 3, which has jurisdiction over Alphabet City. "When rents skyrocked throughout Manhattan a few years ago, landlords in this neighborhood realized what an opportunity they had to make a real profit, so from Avenues A to D, there is construction of new housing on every space available. There is also a lot of rehabilitation of existing housing to get more market rate tenants into buildings."
Indeed, it is impossible to take a stroll around the avenues and their connecting blocks without encountering concrete being poured, foundations for new structures being sunk, and old town houses and tenements undergoing facelifts.
What's more, the kind of buildings rising now would probably have been unthinkable even five years ago.
Andrew J. Gerringer, executive vice president of Douglas Elliman, the real estate services firm, said: "We convinced a developer who was building a rental at 217 East Seventh Street to make it a condo instead. We thought it was time. There were enough high-end rental people coming in and paying $2,000 a month for studios." That judgment paid off. All but one of the 16 units in the building were either sold or spoken for within two months. Developed by BFC Partners, the six-story brick structure has amenities like a rooftop satellite, Internet access and stainless steel kitchens. Asked who had been drawn to pay prices ranging from $185,000 for a studio to $545,000 for a two bedroom apartment, Linda Rubin, a vice president at Douglas Elliman and the broker for the property, said, "Mostly people in their 30's, who are single or married but don't yet have children and are not planning to stay there forever. They're first-time buyers."
Brian Becker, the director of trading operations for MarketXT, an electronic brokerage firm, who lives on the Upper East Side, made an offer on a two-bedroom apartment there the day the building went on the market. He had been searching for a condo for about a year, he said, concentrating mainly on Chelsea, SoHo and the Flatiron and Union Square districts.
"I think I was the first person to see it and the first to commit," he said. "It was exactly what I was looking for. I have always been a fan of new space, and this was exactly what I was looking for."
The price? A bargain, he said, at $525,000. "There is nothing like that anywhere else," he said. "I had also put a bid in on a loft on 12th Street and Broadway. There they were looking for $600,000. That needed a new kitchen and bathroom."
Besides, said Mr. Becker, who is emigrating from York Avenue uptown: "I will spend a lot less time and money in cabs. Whenever I go out to do something, it's generally down there."
Indeed, it was the astonishing proliferation of restaurants, bars and clubs, art galleries, fashion boutiques and furniture shops on Avenues A and B in the last few years and now increasingly on the less discovered Avenue C that sparked the real estate boom. And it, in turn, served to lure even more upscale enterprises.
Matthew Haly had a certain sophistication about the real estate market when he decided to open the Furniture Joint, an antiques and upholstery shop on Avenue B between 11th and 12th Streets, with his fiancee, Laura Swain. He only recently left a job as a salesman with Benjamin James Associates, a real estate brokerage firm.
"Four new buildings have gone up in a four block radius of here, and there are a lot of young professionals moving in," he said, as he finished scraping the baseboards of the shop, which he renovated himself.
That, he figured, would offer him a ready-made pool of buyers for his wares, a far cry from the patrons of a former establishment on the premises, a bodega known to be a front for drug dealers.
When Gwen LeMoine Sabahi, a hairdresser and makeup artist, opened Parlor, a salon on Avenue B between Sixth and Seventh Streets, a year and a half ago, she recalled: "People would say, 'What, you're going to charge $50 a haircut? Do you know where you are?' Now I charge $80."
Ms. Sabahi said she had intended to employ only one other hairdresser, mainly to keep her company. Instead, she now has a staff of six.
That the shop is up to the moment is demonstrated by a new service being offered there: makeup parties with Kevin Posey, a makeup artist who has signed on for "Sex and the City" next season.
"This is a pattern we see in a lot of emerging neighborhoods where people want to live," Mr. Gerringer of Douglas Elliman said. "Once a retail presence is established -- a 24-hour community, lights and activity -- then people see it is safe and come in and rent."
Lisa Ramaci, who is doing graduate work in American decorative arts at Sotheby's, was a first-hand witness to the decline of Alphabet City that took place in the 1980's and the revival that began in the mid-1990s.
In 1980, along with five other people, she homesteaded an abandoned six-story tenement at 11th Street and Avenue B that lacked water, electricity, windows and plumbing. "We took showers in the fire hydrants," she said.
She bought two of the apartments from the city in 1988 for $500 and rebuilt them using a manual published by Reader's Digest. "I remember the first Saturday night I spent there in June 1980," she said. "I walked over to Avenue A because I wanted to orient myself to my new neighborhood. I looked north and south, and there was not a car, not a truck, certainly not a cab. The only people I saw was the occasional forlorn junkie."
Now, she said, not exactly happily, "Saturday night on Avenue A looks like Times Square on New Year's Eve." As for prices, she went on: "In 1980 a guy rehabbed a building on 11th Street and Avenue A, and he charged $325 for a one-bedroom. We were outraged. That was extortion, and we didn't believe anyone would pay it. Today, you can't get a parking space for $325 a month. Studios rent for $2,200, and new co-ops in a building at 10th Street and First Avenue are starting at $400,000."
Jack Bick, owner of S. Charatan Realty, said he was often astounded by the levels rents were reaching. Citing a range of $1,300 to $1,400 for studios, $1,700 to $1,800 for one bedrooms and as much as $3,000 for two and three bedrooms, he said, "I think landlords are getting more per square foot down here because they divide the apartments up," carving up already small rooms.
SION MISRAHI, president of Misrahi Realty, a brokerage firm specializing in small buildings on the Lower East Side, agreed that rents were skyrocketing. It took him only three months earlier this year to fill 24 apartments after a gut rehab at 629 East Fifth Street, between Avenues B and C, where one bedrooms rent for $2,000 and three bedrooms for $3,400. "The renters are either young upwardly mobile professionals or are being subsidized by their parents," he said. "In fact, their parents could buy the building."
With New York University increasingly spilling into the Lower East Side, many of the rental apartments are being taken by students, who band together to split the rents. The presence of so many lounges and clubs gives them a wide choice of hangouts.
"Students, being what they are, don't want to live in dorms for four years of college," said Susan Vaughn, chairwoman of Community Board 3 from 1995 until last May. "There is nothing affordable in the West Village. Landlords have found them to be exceptionally willing tenants, and that has had a great effect on the housing market. The population has become younger, wealthier, probably better educated."
Landlords are partial to students because their tenancies are finite: when they graduate, they move out, and that provides opportunities to raise the rents for the next class.
However, the consensus is that no matter how high prices rise nor how common signals of affluence like limos and nannies become, Alphabet City will always rank economically a notch or two below Chelsea, SoHo and other downtown neighborhoods.
According to data kept by the Real Estate Board of New York, the average sales price for condominiums in Alphabet City in the first three quarters of this year was $432 per square foot. In Chelsea it was $501, in SoHo, $536, and in Tribeca, $503.
"People are willing to pay money to live there but not as much as elsewhere," said Steven Reisman, an associate broker with Halstead Properties, who has a 2,000-square-foot loft at 95 Avenue B at Seventh Street listed for $599,000. "That is a very good value. In the West Village, that would get $1.2 million."
The differences are attributed, in part at least, to Alphabet City's out-of-the-way location, a 15-minute walk from the nearest subway. With its low-rise profile devoid of glitzy towers and its persistent young-artist aura, it simply does not lend itself to white-glove luxury. That is all to the good, say local denizens who fear the threat of gentrification.
"It is good to have a mixture and to have the new," said City Councilwoman Margarita Lopez, who represents most of Alphabet City. "But at this point I feel the construction of privately owned buildings is beyond the reach of regular New Yorkers. With rents over $2,500 for studios, who is moving in?"
She does not believe displacement of longtime residents has yet occurred to any significant degree, but she fears that it could. "I don't know who can afford the new housing, and that worries me," she said.
Like others, she also laments the disappearance of merchants catering to basic needs: hardware stores, shoe stores, children's clothing shops and bodegas, whose owners are driven out by escalating rents. "The only banking facility here now," she said, is the Lower East Side People's Federal Credit Union on Third Street and Avenue B.
With almost no vacant land available, there is little room for grandiose construction. "Developers won't put in something big unless the cost to construct can be justified in terms of sales prices or rentals," said Deborah Beck, executive vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York, adding, "For a building of six stories, it only pays if you get the land for next to nothing."
For the time being at least, it does not seem likely that the working-class, struggling-artist image of Alphabet City will be erased in a tide of gentrification, its skyline altered by high-rise towers, its longtime residents driven out. Though the neighborhood is seen as a magnet for the young, there are several homes for the aged, with at least two more on the drawing boards. And, even with its new image of affluence, there still remain squatters here and there.
There are simply too many rent-regulated apartments scattered throughout the area to permit mass displacements or demolitions. In addition, a number of moderate-income and low-income buildings have been put up recently, are under construction or are in the planning stages.
For example, the first 18 tenants moved in earlier this month at a new low-income building at 535-541 East Fifth Street between Avenues A and B, an attractive red brick structure with cut stone trim, porticos and lintels and an oak and glass door.
Developed by the Lower East Side People's Mutual Housing Association, "it is geared to people earning 40 percent of the median income," said Mary Spink, executive director of the organization, which builds low- and moderate-income housing in the Community Board 3 area. "With the median income for a family of four at $56,200," she said, "40 percent would be $22,480, and for one person it would be $15,740."
She received 8,000 applications for the 30 apartments, half of them one bedroom (rent: $325 a month), half two bedroom ($455 a month).
THE association acquired the land from the city for $1 but received no other government subsidies. It will make up the shortfall by renting the ground floor of the building to Cabrini Medical Center for an adult day care program.
"The headline writers who talk about this as the land of caviar are wrong," said Carol Abrams, the spokeswoman for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. "This is a neighborhood that will have a permanent economic mix because low-income housing there has been preserved as well as augmented."
Much of that, she continued, has been done under the auspices of her agency. "From 1994 to the present, during the Giuliani years, we have completed 1,166 units of either rental or home ownership in 152 buildings from Houston to 14th Street on the letter avenues," she said, "and we plan another 326 units in seven buildings."
Another barrier to large-scale gentrification is the sheer number of city-financed housing projects that occupy virtually the entire eastern side of Avenue D, including the 15-building Jacob Riis complex and the 16-building Lillian Wald complex, and that are scattered throughout the rest of the area. The Riis houses are undergoing repairs, and major renovation is scheduled for the Wald houses next year.
Noting that the last new Housing Authority project went up in 1996, Howard Marder, the spokesman for the agency, said: "Unfortunately, all the scaffolding you see now is for renovation. We would be thrilled to put up more public housing throughout the whole city."
The term "affordable" has become something of a mantra among civic organizers, housing advocates and politicians in the area, but what it means depends on who is using it.
To Councilwoman Lopez, who gives higher priority to low-income housing than she does to moderate-income facilities, it means an ample supply of apartments renting for less than $800 a month.
To Donald Capoccia, managing principal of BFC Partners and a founder and vice president of the New York State Association for Affordable Housing, who has on occasion tangled with Ms. Lopez, "affordable" has a far higher ceiling.
"As dire as it sounds, a $250,000 apartment in a new building south of 96th Street has somehow become affordable housing," he said.
Mr. Capoccia estimates that since 1982 he has put up 450 housing units in Alphabet City, some of which are market rate. He is the developer of the condominium at 217 East Seventh Street and has another 22 condominiums under construction at 416 East 11th Street between First Avenue and Avenue A.
He is also doing a 10-unit condominium building at 619 East 11th Street between Avenues B and C in cooperation with the New York City Housing Partnership's new homes program for households earning between $30,000 and $72,000 a year.
On a larger scale, he is building an 80-unit rental project in conjunction with the New York State Housing Finance Agency that will also house the Gethsemane Garden Baptist Church, which had owned part of the land, and have 6,000 feet of commercial space. Of the apartments, 80 percent will be offered at market rates, with the rest reserved for low-income tenants. The building will stand between East Seventh and Eighth Streets on Avenue C.
Mr. Capoccia recently completed 100 moderate-income town house duplexes with rear yards and roof decks in nine buildings on six sites on East 11th and East 13th Streets called Del Este Village.
"The average price for a three-bedroom 1,300-square-foot unit is $131,000, and the income can't exceed $73,000," he said. The duplexes have a small cottagelike ambience, rear yards and roof decks, two or three bedrooms and separate individual laundry rooms in each apartment.
Beatrice and William Romanello were among the families whose names were drawn in a lottery for the duplexes, and not a moment too soon, Mrs. Romanello said, explaining: "We were living in a loft at 19th Street and paying $1,400 rent. The landlord wanted to raise it to $3,000. We would have had to leave the city."
The Romanellos, parents of six grown children, including a disabled daughter who lives with them, were able to buy their three-bedroom duplex for $140,000 with a monthly maintenance fee of $400. Mr. Romanello is a retired electrician.
Though she speculated that she is oldest person in her small complex, Mrs. Romanello revels in the youth-oriented surroundings. "It's so exciting around here," she said. And when the crowds become excessive, "I live in my house, not on the street."
Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, a photographer and filmmaker whose studio and home are in the onetime rectory of a Roman Catholic church at Second Street and Avenue A that was razed in 1959, has been witness to the tides of change that had brought drugs and crime to the area in some years, artistic expression and community energy in others.
"I don't think this will ever be taken over by affluence," he said. "Giant Upper West Side apartments simply don't exist here, and you can't gut the tenements because people won't move out. But you are seeing more and more families with young children, and it has become a wonderful place to grow up."
"The thing to understand is that neighborhoods change," he continued. "It is important to preserve buildings and keep an eye on architecture and history, but stores and people and businesses come and go, and there is not much you can do about it."

Giving Christmas Back to the Young

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
THE place was the Toys "R" Us in Midtown Manhattan, a few days before Christmas. It was full of shoppers among a dazzling array of Barbies and bicycles, radio-controlled cars and dogs, monsters who sang and laughed. Everyone seemed to be finding what they wanted, but the looks on many faces suggested the deliberation one would bring to choosing schools or pediatricians, not toys.
There are plenty of reasons shopping for Christmas toys can be a pain: the time, the money, the crowds, the slow subway trains. Add to the list the condition of being a parent who thinks too much. 
 It is a condition characterized by the belief that every choice we make for our children carries great weight. Heaven forbid a toy just be fun. We have to develop everything from their spatial skills to their social consciousnesses.
Many parents and people who work with families see the rampant seriousness as worse each year. Fueling that seriousness, they say, is an economy good enough to buy lots of toys, a particularly New York quest for perfection and the guilt of parents forced to work harder than ever. Parents also say they must take every opportunity for their children because the world is increasingly competitive.
"Parents think that if they control every aspect of their children's upbringing, they can control how things turn out in life," said Joyce Poster, a psychotherapist who has several children as patients at her practice in Riverdale in the Bronx and the Upper West Side. "So it's not just a toy, it's the perfect toy.
Some people said that the long-running presidential decision showed how unpredictable life could be and aggravated the parental urge to help children excel.
"People think there's less and less of the pie unless you come from wealth, like George Bush," said Sharon Thomas, who lives with her husband, 3-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter in Morningside Heights. "People also feel that even money is not always enough, it's how smart your child is perceived to be."
One has to find the humor in it all, said Robert Bravo-Weber, who works for a public relations firm in Chelsea. He has two sons, 10 and 14.
"We think, boy, because my parents didn't give me a Lego set at 4 that's the reason I'm not the world's best engineer or architect," he said.
"Now you have to buy and play computer games with your children that help with SAT scores," he continued. "We need to cool out about this stuff."
Others, like Ms. Thomas, agree that an occasional lightening of parental solemnity is good. She rebels in small ways, like allowing her children time to play without toys by just using their imagination.
Mr. Bravo-Weber, though, admits that his family has fallen victim to rampant seriousness. One year, his wife bought a black doll for their son because she wanted him to have more exposure to people who looked different from their family, which is Latino.
"He didn't like the doll," he said. "The fact that he dumped Buddy didn't mean anything. Half of his friends now are of another race."
A friend confided to me the other day that she had made three Christmas lists: the toys her 8- and 10-year-old sons wanted, what she thought they should have, and what she was reading in the parenting magazines and the toy Web sites about the best choices. Christmas Day would be fun, she said. Preparing for it was not.
Too many of us lack confidence in our instincts. We can afford to slip up now and then. Give the kids some junk food. Let them watch a little silliness on television. Buy your testosterone-soaked son more trucks.
At Toys "R" Us, I spoke with Michelle Reynolds, who has a grandson and three grown children. She talked about the good old days, when kids made lists and the parents simply said yes or no. Now, there are so many toys out there, she said, that parents are hard pressed to discern what is junk and what is worthwhile.
"We have to really watch with the video games," said Ms. Reynolds, who lives in the South Bronx. "Some are demonic toys that can really influence our young people. You can't just give your kids what they want, you have to give them what's good for them."
Marilyn Williams, a paralegal who lives on the Upper West Side and has a daughter, 8, and a son, 3, said even the choice of where to buy can be hard. There are general toy stores, educational stores, the Internet.
Recently, she bought a planetarium online, but then read a review on Amazon.com that gave it two stars out of five. She ended up lugging it back to the store.
"It is draining, and maybe we are putting too much thought in it," Ms. Williams said. "Maybe our mothers just got the list and said O.K."

The Floor Under Wages: How Low Can It Fall?

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
THE Clinton years are almost gone, and with them the best hope for strengthening the minimum wage. Not that he had much success. The minimum wage today helps fewer people than when President Clinton took office in 1993. And George W. Bush's team seems willing to let the dwindling continue. Employers, not the government, would once again decide how low pay could fall, as they did until the Depression. 
 All this is happening almost sub rosa. No politician openly challenges a New Deal law that has put a floor under wages for two generations, lifting millions of people out of poverty. An outright repeal is not a political option. Instead, the death blow is coming through inaction. Even stingy employers no longer balk at paying a minimum wage stuck at only $5.15 an hour, the present level.
The Clinton administration had been pressing since 1998 for a $1 increase, to $6.15 an hour, in 50-cent installments over two years. The Republicans resisted, but finally agreed to the increase in late August, if the Democrats would accept various tax cuts as a quid pro quo -- particularly for small business. That is where most minimum-wage workers are employed. The Democrats consented, but in the end the Republicans insisted on more quid pro quo than President Clinton would accept, and Congress adjourned without raising the minimum.
"We are coming back next year and we will ask for a larger increase," said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who has pushed to raise the minimum. The senator would not say how much more than $1 the next bill would request. "We will run the numbers over Christmas," he said.
It is painfully evident that $1 is no longer enough. Even among economists like Kevin Murphy of the University of Chicago, who worry about the impact on hiring, a $1 increase no longer risks making low-skilled workers too expensive to hire. "You are simply ratifying what has already happened in the marketplace," he said.
The statistics illustrate how quickly the minimum wage is drifting toward oblivion. Adjusted for inflation, it has declined steadily in value from a high of $7.66 an hour in 1968 to today's $5.15. Nearly half the deterioration came during the Reagan years. Measured another way, when the Democrats proposed the $1 increase in 1998, the benefit would have gone to 10.1 percent of the work force. That was the percentage earning between $5.15 and $6.15 that year. This year, only 6.8 percent would have benefited directly from the same increase.
A booming economy has moved many people's wages above the minimum, and this trend continued in the third quarter despite a slowing economy. But 6.8 percent of the work force is still nearly nine million workers, and these are the people the minimum wage was intended to protect, particularly when the economy turns down. "The whole point of minimum-wage policy is to make sure that no one is paid a privation level wage," said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
A single mother of two who is leaving welfare, for example, must earn $6.45 an hour at a full-time job simply to reach the official poverty level of $13,423 for a family of three. That $6.45 is also the maximum pay for the bottom 10 percent of the work force, and Mr. Bernstein would set the minimum wage at this 10th percentile level. Until the early 1990's, the minimum wage often tracked the 10th percentile, without a measurable effect on hiring. Then it fell again, despite a 90-cent increase in two steps, in 1996 and 1997, to the present $5.15.
Getting back to the 10th percentile in 2002 means raising the minimum next year by roughly $1.50 an hour. That is a popular number among Democrats, according to Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council in the Clinton White House. Such a proposal in the next Congress, he said, "would put a strain on many moderate Republicans who won't want to be seen as unwilling to give hard-pressed workers in their districts a needed raise."
Conservative Republicans are more resistant. "They are more of the view that when you increase the minimum wage, you hurt unskilled people trying to get into the work force and certain industries that rely on these people," said John Feehery, a spokesman for House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert.
Mr. Bush shares these sentiments. He would sign a bill increasing the minimum wage, says Ari Fleischer, a spokesman. But he would require that the bill include a radical "opt out" provision. Any state would be allowed to opt out of the federal minimum and substitute its own, lower minimum if the legislature and governor decided that an increase in the federal minimum would be a "barrier to employment."
That would be a huge breach. A national standard 65 years old would be cracked, and the minimum wage would disappear.

Why Banks Can Avoid A Hard Landing

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
THE volume of problem corporate loans is rising. Individual debt levels are at record highs. And the economy is slowing. So why are investors so sweet on bank stocks?
From a trough in early March, the Keefe Bruyett & Woods Banks index is up more than 30 percent. Since the end of last year, it has risen more than 13 percent. 
 James K. Schmidt, lead portfolio manager of the John Hancock Financial Industries fund and the John Hancock Regional Bank fund, took time last week to discuss expectations for the new year. Following are excerpts from the conversation.
 
Q. Last week, the Federal Reserve said it was more concerned about the risks of a slowing economy than a rise in inflation. Would rate cuts in 2001 help banks?
 
A. Most investors overestimate how important interest rates are to banks. A long time ago, changes in rates used to be important, but now banks can balance their sensitivity to rate changes by matching assets and liabilities. That said, a drop in rates should be a slight help to earnings.
 
Q. There is talk that the economy could do more than just slow a bit, that it may even fall into recession. Do you share that view?
 
A. I am looking for a slowdown in growth to around 1.5 percent to 2 percent. That slowdown will lead to higher problem loans than we have had, but the numbers will not be draconian, so profitability will continue.
 
Q. How rapidly are problem loans rising? Are they likely to be as much of a risk as they were in the late 1980's and early 1990's?
 
A. There has been a lot of news lately about higher nonperforming assets and cuts in bank earnings estimates. The Fed numbers for the third quarter show the ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets increased from 0.67 percent to 0.7 percent. Over the course of my career, the average for that ratio has been 1.5 percent. This number is still very good, even though it will probably go up in the fourth quarter.
 
Q. What was that ratio in the early 1990's, with those problem real estate loans?
 
A. In 1990, the ratio was 2.94 percent. It rose to 3.02 percent the following year. It was worse for savings and loans: in 1991 the ratio was 3.96 percent.
 
Q. Are banks overextended in any particular area of the economy?
 
A. There is no obvious severe loan area that would correspond to the energy, farm, real estate and developing-country loans of the 1980's. People thought credit card loans would be a problem, but they have held up.
To date, the biggest problem has been large, syndicated, shared credits to large, highly leveraged companies.
 
Q. If the economy slows but doesn't stall, what sort of profit growth do you expect from banks next year?
 
A. Some people are estimating that profits will be up 10 percent to 12 percent. In the aggregate I think that will be hard for most banks to do. I don't anticipate big credit problems, but they will be worse than this year. So profit growth of 6 to 8 percent is probably a better range. That range might go up to 9 to 12 percent in 2002.
 
Q. Bank stocks did well from 1995 to 1998, in part because of mergers. The pace has slowed. Do you expect it to pick up again?
 
A. To me, the arithmetic for mergers looks good. But it only works for a handful of major banks. The stocks of premier banks, Wells Fargo, Firstar, Fifth Third, sell at substantial premiums to some medium-sized and smaller banks. That means they could pay a substantial premium and still have the deal be accretive to earnings.
 
Q. Are there other bank stocks that you like?
 
A. I like Commerce Bancshares in Kansas City. Barring a severe recession, they will not have credit problems. Seacoast Banking Corporation, in Stuart, Fla., has a very attractive franchise. I also like Cascade Bancorp in Bend, Ore.
Cuts in interest rates probably make savings and loans a better play than the banks. Of the thrifts we like Astoria Financial in Lake Success, N.Y.
 
Q. In addition to your regional bank fund, you manage a broader financial industry fund. Are there brokerage or credit card company stocks that you like?
 
A. Brokerage earnings can go away quickly, but they can also come back quickly. Right now, conditions in the stock market are about as bad as they can be. Even if the Nasdaq isn't any higher in 12 months, at least it isn't going down any further.
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which is down from $110, is worth a look. And Merrill Lynch is a big holding. Among regional brokerages we like Tucker Anthony.
Our favorite credit card company is MBNA. They are quite sophisticated in their underwriting and their ability to model losses and delinquencies. But if the economy were to fall into recession and the unemployment rate had a big jump, my attitude would be different.

Sharing the Bounty: How Much Is Enough?

BYLINE: By JAMES SCHEMBARI; James Schembari is an editor at The Times. His column on the prime earning, spending and striving years appears the fourth Sunday of each month. E-mail may be sent to jimschem@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THE pastor of my church called last month and asked if I would be willing to get up in front of the congregation to discuss, as he put it, "my journey" to increased charitable giving.
My first thought was, "Don't we hear enough on that subject from you?" My second was, "You've got the wrong guy." I decided not to give that talk, although I did agree to play one of the three kings in the Christmas pageant. 
 I figured that the pastor had noticed the bigger checks my wife and I started putting into the collection basket earlier in the fall, and that he was hoping that I would inspire others to do the same.
Indeed, our giving had gone way up, but not because I wanted it to. My wife, Christine, had insisted on it. She noted that our stock holdings and 401(k) plans had appreciated, that our suburban house had jumped in value and that the two of us were working. We had much to be thankful for, she said, and we could certainly afford more than the 2.4 percent of our income that we had been giving for the last three years.
Frankly, 2.4 percent sounded fine to me. After all, we still have to pay for the college educations of our four children, and our own retirement is less than 20 years away. In my opinion, now is not the time to be giving away money. Let's talk again, I said, after the children are out of college.
Besides, when I checked two years ago, I had found that baby boomers contributed, on average, just 1.9 percent of their incomes to charity. We were doing better than average, I told Christine smugly. What else could she want?
The answer was 10 percent. "Net or gross?" I asked in horror. "Your choice," she answered, probably thinking she was offering a compromise. I chose net.
Of course, we are not the only people writing bigger checks to charities. Financial planners and charitable organizations say many boomers are rethinking their charitable giving, with the older ones, those in their late 40's to early 50's, now giving 2.2 percent of their incomes. Until recently, at least, the stock market and the economy have been robust, and planners say boomers are telling them that they want to give something back.
"I'm not seeing more people giving, but the same people are giving more because their incomes have increased," said Chris Cooper, president of his own financial planning firm in Toledo, Ohio. "Their giving has increased 50 percent over a 10-year period. Some are up as high as 15 percent of their income a year. Some have 20 to 60 charities on their list."
Many people aren't finished saving for their retirements or children's educations, either. Bill Ludwig, 45, a pharmaceutical sales representative in Sylvania, Ohio, has two young sons and is counting on his 401(k) plan and other savings to eventually pay their bills and otherwise finance his retirement. He writes quarterly checks to a list of charities and refuses to let those worries stop him from doing what he sees as his responsibility.
"I've been able to give more as I see that I can," said Mr. Ludwig, who contributes about 6 percent of his net income. "There are people in need, and I feel blessed that our family has been able to have a good life and there are certain causes that have touched my heart. If I can make their lives a little bit better, I'm happy to do that."
John Fletcher, 42, of Perrysburg, Ohio, who works for the Ohio Turnpike Commission, said he had increased his giving by about 25 percent over the last four years. "I'm fortunate, and a lot of people out there are not fortunate," he said. "I should be giving something back."
Sara Melendez, chief executive of Independent Sector, an association of nonprofit groups in Washington, said that boomers were indeed having an impact.
"The number of small family foundations in the last few years has mushroomed," she said. "I would have to think that part of that is the baby boomers."
But, sounding a lot like my wife, she also thought that boomers could be doing better.
"I think the average American is very generous to be giving 2 percent of their income, but the very wealthy people can afford more than 2 percent," she said. "People who have reached the conclusion that they are well off should be giving 5 percent."
She may have to wait. The decline of the stock market could slow charitable giving. "I think that the people who are very wealthy and got their money out in time, they're still giving," said Greg Daniel, the owner of Creative Financial Solutions, a financial planning company in Manhattan. "People who don't even want to hear about giving, they're not going to fund any of these foundations any more."
Does that mean he is getting calls from clients asking him to delay their charitable plans?
"No, there's no phone call," he said. "I just don't hear from them again."

Living Without the Treasury Market

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
THE pace of the long goodbye to the trusted Treasury market will pick up under the new Bush administration. So next year, investors will really have to learn to live with the rapid shrinkage of this venerable $3.4 trillion market.
"Investors are going to have to go to non-Treasury instruments -- to high-grade corporate bonds and the agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac," said James R. Capra, chairman of the Treasury borrowing advisory committee of the Bond Market Association, which provides Wall Street's view on how to scale the Treasury market down. 
 Before the new administration is dry behind the years, some old standbys are going to vanish while others become less visible -- and probably more expensive.
By the second quarter of 2001, if not earlier, the one-year Treasury bill will be retired. Legislation to make that possible was recently approved. Also by then, issuance of the popular two-year note will be curtailed sharply, possibly to $40 billion a year, or just $10 billion a quarter, from $120 billion a year, or $10 billion a month, now.
Officials are also considering ending the issuance of 30-year bonds, whose sales have already been slashed to a mere $15 billion a year from $47.2 billion in 1991. "That is a live possibility," Mr. Capra said. And the Treasury is likely to curtail, if not eliminate, Treasury inflation-protected securities, known as TIPS, that it began to offer just four years ago.
The government is also likely to buy back more outstanding Treasury securities. It bought $30 billion this year and could increase that to $40 billion next year.
To those who think that a recession and a $1.3 trillion, 10-year Bush tax cut would shrink government surpluses enough to save these cherished Treasuries: Think again. Almost no matter what happens in the next year or two, the surplus forecasts are still stacked in favor of a smaller Treasury market.
The surplus is projected by the Congressional Budget Office to be $268 billion for fiscal year 2001, which began in October. It could rise to $345 billion in fiscal year 2002 and to $685 billion in 2010. Even after John Youngdahl, senior economist at Goldman Sachs, updated those projections to reflect a full Bush tax cut and zero economic growth for the next two calendar years, there would still be a lot of surplus sloshing around: $245 billion in fiscal year 2001, $203 billion in 2002, $180 billion in 2003, $178 billion in 2004, $183 billion in 2005 and modest increases from there in the next five years.
"It would take exceptionally pessimistic economic assumptions relative to the current consensus to cut the surpluses by much over the next few years," Mr. Youngdahl said.
Adding to the squeeze on Treasuries is the declining total of maturing government debt, simply because the Treasury issued less as deficits shrank and surpluses grew. The last three-year note, issued in 1998, matures in May. Five-year note sales were cut back to quarterly, from monthly, in June 1998; the sale of two-year notes was reduced last May to $10 billion a month from $15 billion.
Paying off maturing debt will not absorb all of the surplus. So new debt sales will be curbed and more existing securities will be bought back.
"Market participants do not think that the bond market will disappear," said Lewis A. Sachs, assistant secretary of the Treasury for financial markets. "But over the course of the next year or two, even if the economy slows down, there is an increasing recognition that there will still be a meaningful paydown of government debt."
The changes expected next year should not be as disruptive as the announcement early this year of the cut in 30-year bond issues. That seemed to have caught investors by surprise, even though the growing government surpluses signaled that Treasury borrowing had to decline. In just two days, the yield on the 30-year bond plunged to 6.14 percent, from 6.42 percent, as investors finally realized that this bond, once a benchmark, would become scarce.
But because the reductions are concentrated in short-term Treasury bills and notes, Mr. Youngdahl said, there could be enough extra downward pressure on these Treasury yields to surprise some investors.

The Team Spirit At Work (Rah, Rah)

BYLINE: By FRED ANDREWS 

 BODY:
THESE four gents from New Zealand must have enjoyed themselves.
Over the course of two years, they met, among others, Michael Jordan, Mia Hamm, Joe Torre and Franz Beckenbauer, whom German soccer fans call the King. They sailed with Team New Zealand aboard Black Magic, twice winner of the America's Cup. They went through the paces with the American women's national soccer team, from buffet breakfast to chilling out with late-night pizza. Williams F1, the world's pre-eminent Formula One racing team, welcomed them into the pits at the Canadian Grand Prix. 
 Their odyssey delivered a book, "Peak Performance: Inspirational Business Lessons from the World's Top Sports Organizations" (Texere, $27.95), by Clive Gilson, Mike Pratt, Kevin Roberts and Ed Weymes. Except for Dr. Roberts, who is worldwide chief executive of Saatchi & Saatchi, the advertising empire, the authors are professors at the Waikato Management School at the University of Waikato in New Zealand.
The authors say businesses can learn a lot from sustained excellence in sports. They looked at nine of today's most successful franchises, from the women's soccer team, still fresh in the limelight, to the All Blacks, New Zealand's national rugby team and an international force for more than a century. Great players come and go, the authors say, but excellence rests on building a "peak performance" organization that in its totality is more powerful than any player, even Mr. Jordan.
Almost none of their lessons come from the playing field. Nor does the book explain the new economics of sport or how a cunning general manager plays his cards in the confusion of college drafts, costly free agents and payroll ceilings. There are no trade secrets here.
Rather, the authors look at the shapes and styles of organizations, from secretaries and ticket punchers to presidents, vice presidents and -- today's stars -- the people in charge of marketing.
The elite organizations all turn out to be small and informal, most fielding only a few hundred employees. The authors find them overflowing with secure, intelligent people who are free to do their jobs. Almost invariably, the employees say that they feel like family and laugh a lot. With thousands of applicants, the elite teams prefer loyal retainers and long-serving professionals. The San Francisco 49ers finally retired a 95-year-old usher at the insistence of his family.
The prose is visual and nicely descriptive, amazingly so for a management book by a team of authors. Anyone would be thrilled to sail with Team New Zealand, and the book brings an exciting afternoon to life. The engines roar in the Formula One pit. One wonders which author (or who else) applied the final polish.
The book would be more persuasive, however, if it were not such a valentine. These glowing profiles are all self-portraits. The authors say they accumulated 4,000 pages of interview transcripts. If they spoke with a single critic, or even an independent expert, it is not apparent. So these sports tourists troop through the locker rooms with their mouths agape. They are true believers, as reverential as NFL Films.
WHAT they offer is big-time sports through rose-colored glasses. They describe the United States Soccer Federation campaign to build up the women's team, but not the gross favoritism toward the men's. Even after winning the World Cup, the women's team went on strike over their woeful pay.
The authors admire the feeling of family that Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. created by treating every 49er as a prince. They never mention his guilty plea in failing to report a felony in a gambling fraud and extortion case. That episode forced him to turn over the team to his sister, Denise DeBartolo York.
Nor do they mention Carmen Policy, the team's president from 1991 to 1999. His genius at stretching the salary cap was considered a key to the 49ers' peak performance. This month, the National Football League fined Mr. Policy $400,000 for violating the salary rules in those years.
A weak chapter about the New York Yankees reads like a single day's visit. The authors describe Yankee Stadium and the streets around it. They talk in the dugout with Joe Torre. In the clubhouse, Roger Clemens has no time to chat, so they talk with Ed Yarnall, a left-hander coming back from an injury who would later be traded.
They delight to find a former receptionist's photograph among a display of Yankee greats and to discover a half-bust in the dugout honoring an equipment manager who served 58 years. Just the right message, they say.
But their book includes this howler: "Allowing people to do their job without unnecessary interference is undoubtedly a trademark of the Yankee organization."
Saccharin aside, the book offers an insider's clinic on how sports are embracing big-time marketing the world over. The United States Soccer Federation orchestrated the "Road to Pasadena" matches to lift the profile of the women's team before the World Cup. The German soccer titan FC Bayern Munich mails a million copies of its master catalog.
The Atlanta Braves, described as "an entertainment brand second to none in sports," are ever inventive and never content. The Braves were pioneers with Turner Field, a dazzling ballpark with banks of video games, a Braves museum, a retail store and a life-size baseball playground on the upper-deck roof.
Not all teams pursue the same box-office strategy. In plush times, the Chicago Bulls forcefully pushed season tickets, against the day when Mr. Jordan would depart. Only 4,000 of 22,000 seats went on nightly sale. Now in the N.B.A.'s basement, the Bulls play before thousands of empty but presumably profitable seats.
FC Bayern Munich, in a soccer stadium that is much larger, limits its season tickets to 20,000 to give millions of fans a better chance of attending a match (and, not incidentally, to sell more trinkets to a fresh audience).
THE strongest chapters may be two from home, on Team New Zealand and the New Zealand Rugby Union, parent of the vaunted All Blacks.
In 1995, after a century of amateurism, potential competitors forced the rugby union to add professionals to its edifice. It created the Super 12's league, a jazzier version of rugby, to attract new fans, particularly women, and it added the National Provincial Championship, for small-town, smash-mouth rugby played the old-fashioned way. With the All Blacks, the Super 12, the National Provincial Championship, the Black Ferns women's team and the New Zealand Maori Team, the staid rugby union reinvented itself as a "house of brands."
In winning the 1995 and 2000 America's Cup, Team New Zealand went for an informal, cohesive unit that brought together all the sailors, designers, sailmakers and others, a varied lot who usually stuck to their own cubicles. Where once the cup challenge was driven by the genius who designed the boat, designers and sailors now listened to one another, the sailors clearly the customers. Instead of requiring the crew to jockey for starting berths until the last minute -- which had proved very divisive -- Team New Zealand announced its lineup 18 months before the event.
The book closes with a theory: Peak performance begins with focus, which rests on an inspirational dream and on accepting "the greatest imaginable challenge." Peak performance also means "sharing the dream" with employees and fans. It implies an organization that feels like family, imbued with harmony, passion and flow. The final hurdle is attending to the smallest detail, inventing "game breaking" ideas and striving constantly to better the organization's previous best.
Those virtues would transform any business. The unanswered question is how to nurture them in a business setting. These elite organizations are propelled by the joy and excitement of sport. Where does ordinary business find the equivalent?

HEADLINE: The Nuts and Bolts of Bipartisanship

BYLINE: By Richard Darman; Richard Darman served, in the Reagan and Bush administrations, as assistant to the president, deputy secretary of the treasury, and director of the Office of Management and Budget.

 BODY:
With the election now settled, it is time to turn from the pursuit of power to its constructive use. It is unrealistic to expect a new era of bipartisanship. But is it too much to ask for one good year?
Conventional wisdom suggests that bitterness about Florida, a weak electoral mandate, and a closely divided Congress will make stalemate likely and the presidential victory hollow. Yet this possibility is so obvious it creates an opportunity to avoid it. Past examples of bipartisan success may suggest how. 
 Of course, stalemate has been the norm for much of the past decade; and it may continue. At least as likely, however, is the prospect that politicians will rise to calls for mutual accommodation merely by giving each other a little of this and a little of that -- tokens of ephemeral cooperation and a modest bipartisan mush.
But in the current context, neither stalemate nor tokens nor mush will do. Serious policy reform is needed. In a world where intellectual capital is increasingly important, America's education system is lagging. Our tax system, with higher rates and proliferating special-purpose provisions, risks a return to economic inefficiency and public alienation. Our health system, though superior in quality, remains costly and inequitable. Our Social Security system, in its present form, will not survive the retirement of the baby boom generation. And this is just the start of a long list of pressing challenges.
In the past two decades, despite divided government and polarized politics, our system has managed to produce bold bipartisan reform in four noteworthy cases: the 1981 Reagan economic program, the Social Security rescue of 1983, comprehensive tax reform in 1986, and the 1990 budget agreement. What these substantively very different cases have in common can help provide a guide toward a more productive future.
In all four cases, key parts of the political establishment were initially opposed to what was ultimately enacted. Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill and the Democratic House majority were adamantly opposed to the Reagan program in 1981. And they were not alone; much of the Republican leadership opposed the size of the Reagan tax cuts. On Social Security, neither Democrats nor Republicans would take the lead. They tried to pass the problem to a bipartisan commission; but the commission could not agree on a solution. On tax reform, the tax-writing committees of the Congress were highly skeptical. Almost every special interest lobby was organized to prevent reform. And on deficit reduction, Democrats opposed spending restraint and entitlement reform; while Republicans either opposed tax increases or conditioned them upon just what the Democrats opposed. How, then, in the face of conventional wisdom that said it couldn't be done, was historic legislation enacted? Four common elements are striking.
First, in none of the cases was the legislative process left to business as usual. Presidential staff invented and actively managed special processes to reach agreement and accelerate action. They negotiated side-by-side with key legislators. They did not accept -- nor did legislators enforce -- the separation presumed by the dictum "The president proposes and the Congress disposes."
Second, the executive branch developed, in advance, an explicit concept of its core coalition. For the Reagan revolution, conservative Democrats were linked with Republicans. For Social Security, the core was a centrist majority of the commission, President Reagan, Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker, and the Democratic speaker, O'Neill. For tax reform, the initial core involved a left-right linkage of reformers and President Reagan, which forced the bipartisan middle to join. And for deficit reduction, the strategy assumed that if the bipartisan leaders of the House, Senate, and executive branch would agree, the necessary majority would follow. Each coalition was adapted to its historical circumstance. All were bipartisan.
Third, most of the negotiating and coalition building was done in private -- often secret -- meetings at which trust could be built and built upon. These private trust-building sessions did not displace the open legislative process; they allowed it to function constructively.
Fourth, an outline for a policy bargain was developed in advance. In each case, the bargain was strong enough in substance to produce significant reform, while balanced enough in its politics to hold the coalition together.
And so, what might this mean for the current circumstance? Clearly, a bipartisan coalition will be necessary to govern. If a modest number of swing Democrats proves to be available, the coalition need not include the Democratic leadership. But one way or another, Democrats must be included. And to avoid the usual mush, special bipartisan negotiating procedures will have to be created -- bringing together groups of Congressional and executive leaders outside the conventional protocol. This much is straightforward.
 The harder issue is the substantive bargain. One variation might involve this trade: the Republicans would give a bit on the size of government in return for the Democrats allowing more market-oriented governmental action. This might mean, for example: a smaller tax cut than that proposed by President-elect Bush in the campaign, but one that emphasized across-the-board rate cuts; a larger education budget, but one that allowed more decentralization, accountability and use of vouchers; broader Medicare coverage, but through greater use of insurance premium subsidies; and the preservation of Social Security, but with a modest set-aside for individually controlled investment accounts.
If a superior bargain can be implemented, so much the better. But some such grand bargain should be pursued. Without it, the protracted contest for the presidency will have proved hollow. With it, the Florida fiasco could be left behind as a fitting close of an era of partisan excess. Having given the public sufficient reason for dismay, might not politicians conclude they owe the voters at least one good year?

HEADLINE: The End of the Party, or Is It?

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
DON'T panic.
The United States economy has gone from scalding to ice cold faster than a tenement shower. Every day brings another earnings warning, or 10. Despite a strong rally on Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average is on track for its worst year since 1981. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is on track for its worst year since 1974. And the Nasdaq composite index, its worst year ever. 
 Last week, Charles Schwab, noting that assets and trading at his brokerage firm were shrinking, cut his base pay by 50 percent and encouraged his employees to take as many as 20 days of unpaid vacation in early 2001. And Lucent Technologies just issued its fifth earnings warning this year.
But investors need not panic. Really.
Yes, the shocking decline in information technology and telecommunications stocks this year -- by more than 90 percent in many cases -- has vindicated the skeptics who called the Nasdaq's 86 percent climb last year unsustainable. Yes, investors put money into too many untested technology and telecommunications companies. Yes, earnings do matter, and slowing economic growth does affect technology spending. And, yes, even after the plunge, many technology stocks remain expensive by historical measures.
But beyond the technology sector, the stock market no longer looks so precarious. By a crucial valuation measure, the broader market is cheaper than it has been in two years, and many highly regarded strategists expect the S.& P. 500 index to have strong gains next year. Even some technology stocks may be bargains, although they are harder to find.
"The market is today undervalued, the S.& P. on the order of 15 percent or so," said Abby Joseph Cohen, the chief United States investment strategist at Goldman, Sachs. "The valuations are the best we've seen them in a long time." Ms. Cohen expects the S.& P. 500 to be at 1,650 at the end of next year, a gain of almost 30 percent from its close on Friday of 1,305.97.
Several other top strategists are also bullish, including longtime bears like Byron R. Wien, the chief United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. The overall market, which was 40 percent overvalued at the beginning of 2000, is now 10 percent undervalued, Mr. Wien said.
"The market has gone through a process of rationalization," he added. "I can do my job now -- people were encouraging me to retire at the beginning of the year."
This optimistic view, of course, plays down one danger advanced by a vocal minority: a recession in the United States. "We don't think this is an environment for an aggressive investment stance," said Douglas Cliggott, the United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan. "It looks like the first part of next year is going to be even weaker than what we've got right now."
Mr. Cliggott thinks that many of his counterparts are underestimating the risk of a recession. He predicted that the S.& P. 500 companies would have flat earnings next year, and his year-end 2001 target for the index is 1,400, markedly lower than that of most of his peers.
IF Mr. Cliggott and the bears are right, the market could be in for another long year. But their view fails to account for the measures that both the Federal Reserve and the federal government are likely to take to stimulate the economy next year, bulls say. Both monetary policy (a k a short-term interest rates, which are controlled by the Fed) and fiscal policy (the government's tax and spending manipulations to achieve a surplus or deficit) have been very tight this year. The Fed has kept real short-term interest rates high, and the federal government is running the largest surplus in its history.
Those policies have worked all too well in recent months to slow the economy. Early in 2001, they will be loosened, giving the economy a crucial lift, predicted Mary C. Farrell, senior investment strategist at PaineWebber. That move is even more likely because inflation remains low, productivity growth is still strong, and oil prices, an important contributor to inflation, are dropping.
"This is the longest expansion in our history," Ms. Farrell said. "It's maturing, it's slowing, but we should still get some reasonable growth next year. She predicted growth in the gross national product of 2.6 percent next year and global economic growth of 3.3 percent.
Those gains should translate into an earnings increase of 7 to 8 percent for the S.& P. 500 during 2001. That would be less than half the pace this year, but in line with historical averages, she said. Other bulls offer similar estimates for economic and earnings growth.
If they are correct, stocks should perform very well next year, said Donald G. Berdine, chief investment officer of PNC Advisors, which manages $65 billion in stocks and bonds. The decline in stock prices during the fall, combined with the climb in bond prices and the corresponding drop in yields, means that stocks are as cheaply valued as they have been since 1998, Mr. Berdine said.
At the beginning of this year, the 10-year Treasury bond yielded around 6.5 percent. The average S.& P. 500 stock, meanwhile, had a price-to-earnings ratio, based on projected 2000 earnings, of almost 30, or an "earnings yield" of about 3.5 percent. The earnings yield is the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio.
Usually, the 10-year bond yield and the S.& P. 500 earnings yield are about the same, and many analysts viewed that gap as a signal that stock prices were dangerously overvalued.
Now, earnings have risen and stock prices have fallen, so the average big stock has a P/E ratio, based on projected 2001 earnings, of 21, or an earnings yield of about 4.8 percent. And the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond has dropped to 5 percent. With the gap between stocks and bonds virtually gone, stocks are no longer expensive, said Ms. Cohen at Goldman, Sachs.
"It's a very interesting contrast as to where 2001 starts and where 2000 started," she said.
MR. BERDINE offered another reason for optimism -- the sheer amount of money available for investing. The cash holdings of stock mutual funds crept up to 6 percent of total assets in October, from a low of 4 percent in March and a recent average of around 5 percent, according to the Investment Company Institute, an industry trade group. That may look like a small difference, but because stock funds have about $4.3 trillion in assets, each percentage-point difference represents $43 billion in cash. Barring steep withdrawals by investors, managers will put some of that built-up cash into the market as this fall's nervousness subsides, providing additional buying pressure, Mr. Berdine said.
Still, no one is expecting a return to the wild markets of 1999 and early 2000, when technology stocks without earnings -- and sometimes without revenue -- would double in a few days and rise tenfold in months. "New bull markets always establish new leadership," said Fred Kobrick, one of the few money managers around who can draw on firsthand experience of the 1973-74 bear market. "The theme players are going to be very disappointed."
Mr. Kobrick, who manages almost $1.5 billion in assets, has had a miserable year. After gaining 86 percent in 1999, his emerging-growth fund, the Nvest Kobrick Investment Trust Emerging Growth Fund, which is focused on technology companies, has fallen 42 percent this year. He said investors had panicked and sold good and bad technology companies alike this year, just as they had bought them en masse in 1999. Next year, investors will resume distinguishing winners from losers, he said.
"Classic bull technology markets over history meant that some technology stocks were going up, some were going down," Mr. Kobrick said. "That's why, historically, technology has been hard to invest in." He expects semiconductor and semiconductor equipment manufacturers, which are off 50 to 80 percent from their highs, to begin the technology rally.
"Semiconductors led the market down, and they'll lead it back up," he said.
Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter, also says technology has more strength than many investors believe. "The business really hasn't slowed down much," he said. Personal computer sales will rise 20 percent worldwide in 2000, despite weakness among American consumers, he said.
"There is a flat spot here, but it's difficult to say things are actually going to go down," Mr. Murphy said.
Still, many other investment professionals are not so sanguine about technology; they contend that the sector as a whole remains overpriced despite its slide and that the remainder of the market offers better values.
"We've just thrown way too much money into the technology sector," said Ralph Wanger, chief investment officer at Liberty Wanger Asset Management. "Stocks got wildly priced, too much enthusiasm, and now we're all sobering up. You roll over in bed, and look at your portfolio and say, 'Hey, I brought that home?' "
Many big technology stocks remain expensive on a price-to-earnings basis despite their plunges this fall, especially because earnings estimates for the technology sector are coming down, said Charles L. Hill, research director for First Call/Thomson Financial. First Call tracks corporate earnings and analysts' forecasts.
Cisco Systems, the leading manufacturer of networking equipment, trades at 50 times its projected earnings for the fiscal year ending July 2001. EMC, which makes huge data storage systems, trades at 80 times its expected earnings for this year.
At the earliest, "the bottom for earnings growth for the tech stocks is going to be the second quarter" of 2001, Mr. Hill said. "There are some stocks where the multiples are too high."
SO what sectors are worth investors' attention?
Both Mr. Berdine and Mr. Wanger favor energy. Mr. Berdine likes independent electric power producers like AES, which is based in Arlington, Va., and operates power plants worldwide, and oil services companies like Schlumberger, which help oil companies find, develop and operate new fields.
"We have a substantial weighting in energy stocks, and we think that's going to be all right," Mr. Wanger said. "They're burning a lot of gas out here in Chicago." He expects oil prices to stay between $20 and $40 a barrel over the next several years, considerably higher than the $10-to-$20 range where they spent most of the 1990's.
A couple of veteran investment managers, meanwhile, advise investors not to worry even if there is a recession.
As long as individual investors have a reasonably long time horizon, they may not want to spend too much rejiggering their portfolios to find recession-resistant stocks, said Mark Greenberg, manager of the $550 million Invesco Leisure fund."Every company is affected by the economy," he said.
Instead, people should look for companies that can increase their earnings faster than the overall market or their peers in the same industry, no matter what the economy does, Mr. Greenberg said. Marriott International, the hotel company, is an example, he said. Because Marriott is expanding aggressively and has solid management and a strong brand name, he said, he expects the company to have above-average earnings growth over the next three to five years whether the economy is strong or weak.
Then there is Mr. Wien, who has been a strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter for years. "Buy old economy," he growled. "The only technology you buy is truly distressed. You don't buy any stocks that don't have positive cash flow. Buy value versus growth. Buy small and medium versus large. And I think you'll do well."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS;
A Strategy Built on Loaves Throughout the Land

BYLINE: By GRAHAM GORI 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
EVERY morning, in the working-class neighborhood of Diez de Abril, where unfinished concrete is the dominant decor, a sparkling white truck emblazoned with the name Bimbo stops at almost every corner.
A deliveryman wearing a Bimbo tie unloads loaves of white bread and carries them into a tiny mom-and-pop store. He greets the owner, stocks up the Bimbo bread display, collects the money, drives another block and repeats the process. 
 Grupo Bimbo is Mexico's largest baking company and the third biggest in the world, with sales of $3 billion last year and profits of $210.5 million. It has succeeded by lavishing attention on the smallest retailers in nearly every nook of Mexico for the last 55 years.
In Mexico City, with a population of 18 million or more, there are twice as many Bimbo delivery trucks as city police cars. Nationally, the company's 17,250 trucks deliver to many areas that lack running water or plumbing. It now controls nearly 95 percent of Mexico's packaged-bread market. In the minds of many customers, Bimbo bread is as Mexican as a corn tortilla.
Having conquered Mexico, Bimbo began looking abroad about seven years ago. It now sells bread, snacks and candy in almost every South American country, plans to buy a bakery in Brazil and has opened operations in Texas and California.
Now, having brought white bread to Mexico, Bimbo wants a bigger slice of the market where white bread has long been a grocery-store fixture: its executives are preparing to spend billions on a major acquisition in the United States.
In a way, Bimbo's aspirations north of the border represent a belated recognition of the Bimbo name -- a derivative of Bambi, which was a popular American cultural icon in Mexico when the company was founded.
It is not clear whether Bimbo has the experience to succeed in such a large expansion outside of its own country. But in the United States, where the market for white bread is barely growing and where small bakeries are routinely gobbled by larger ones, Bimbo has made it clear that it will be predator, not prey.
"We are always looking at opportunities to increase our presence in the Americas, where we are concentrating at the moment," said Daniel Servitje, Bimbo's president. "We are open to looking into ways to strengthen our position in the United States."
In 1993, Bimbo began buying bread bakers all over the Americas, including 4S Bakeries in California and Mrs. Baird's in Texas. In terms of size, Bimbo and its subsidiaries are the dominant players in most of the markets they have entered. But Bimbo executives have found difficulty in turning a profit outside of Mexico.
THE company's Latin American operations, excluding Mexico, will have operating losses of about $7 million this year on sales of about $250 million, the third consecutive year of losses. In the United States market, Bimbo is only expecting to break even this year.
"Their secret of success in Mexico has been market dominance," said Damian Fraser, an analyst at UBS Warburg in Mexico City."They don't have that outside Mexico. They've already bitten off more than they can chew. If they expand further, it will only make it more difficult for them."
Responding to rumors that Bimbo was preparing to buy a large bakery in the United States, Deutsche Bank published a report recently suggesting that any such decision would be a mistake. Its authors argued that Bimbo had become significantly bigger in the last three years, but not necessarily more profitable. They said it would be "challenging for the Mexican company to gobble up such a large company in the U.S. at a time when it is still transitioning towards stability itself."
Doubts about Bimbo's future expansion plans have not been lost on investors. The company's stock price has been in a general decline for more than a year.
The skepticism partly reflects the decreased popularity of white bread in the United States. Once the choice of the upper class, white bread has lost favor with health-conscious consumers, making bread shelves a highly competitive space at groceries. But Bimbo says it has the ingredients to survive in the United States.
Mr. Servitje countered every criticism aimed at his company, calling its poor performance in Latin America a result of strategic mistakes and a faltering economy, and attributing the drop in profits in the United States to a recent restructuring in California. Both markets, he predicted, will show earnings gains next year as Latin America continues to industrialize and its consumers turn to the convenience of packaged bread.
While he acknowledged that the United States market is far different, Mr. Servitje said his company has strong brand recognition among Hispanic consumers. An estimated 20 million Mexicans and Mexican-Americans now live or work in the United States; in Mr. Servitje's opinion, that means 20 million consumers with memories of Bimbo bread on their breakfast tables at home in Mexico. In addition, the Latino food market is growing robustly, at around 6 percent a year.
"What differentiates us from our competitors is that we are a Mexican-based company that will add products geared to Hispanic markets alongside Anglo products, or general market products," Mr. Servitje said. "One strong difference of our company is that we do have a special interest in the Hispanic market, and we are providing more products geared toward that segment."
Bimbo is already selling its bread and line of tortillas in Latino markets in the United States. Bimbo's wheat-flour tortilla, Tia Rosa, is the fastest-growing tortilla brand in the United States.
BIMBO'S strategy, Mr. Servitje said, is to buy a company with an extensive, well-developed distribution system, to continue producing the acquired company's existing brands, and to use the distribution channels to promote its own products in Latino markets.
"There's a greater recognition of Bimbo in the U.S. market," said Alberto Bercowsky, investor relations officer at the company. "We've already gained the two largest Hispanic markets, in Texas and California, and we're planning on moving on."
Mr. Bercowsky said Bimbo, which has $450 million to invest, is looking to buy one of the largest bakeries in the United States: Interstate Bakeries, the maker of Wonder bread and Hostess Twinkies; Earthgrains; Flowers Industries, which controls Keebler and Nature's Own (but recently agreed to sell its Keebler stake to Kellogg); or Bestfoods Baking, whose brands include Entenmann's and Oroweat.
For months, securities analysts thought that Bimbo was planning to buy Interstate, the largest bakery in the United States, with a distribution system that reaches more than 90 percent of the population. Both companies denied that there had been talks, but Interstate's recent announcement of its 12th consecutive quarter of losses reinvigorated speculation that it could fall into Bimbo's hands.
"Bimbo's desire to approach companies in the United States has continued to mature," Mr. Bercowsky said. "But it's undecided which of the four it will be. At this point I'd say that Interstate would be an error."
Whatever happens, Mr. Bercowsky said, "Bimbo is taking an aggressive stance and is looking to acquire, instead of being acquired."

HEADLINE: FIVE QUESTIONS for LARRY COHEN;
Renewing a Union in the New Economy

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
LARRY COHEN, executive vice president of the Communications Workers of America, is one of the labor movement's chief strategists in trying to unionize high-technology workers. He wants to develop models for new-economy unionism.
His union is seeking to organize hundreds of customer service workers at Amazon.com. It is involved in the first unionization vote at a dot-com company, Etown.com, a Web site that sells electronics. Most customer service workers there asked for the election, scheduled for next month, saying they wanted to join the communications workers. 
 His union has led an effort to organize workers at I.B.M., after the company angered employees with a plan to reduce pensions. The union has not won the right to bargain for I.B.M.'s workers, but the unionization drive helped persuade I.B.M. to reverse itself on much of the unpopular pension overhaul. STEVEN GREENHOUSE
 
Q. Considering that high-technology workers earn more than most other workers and are so highly skilled, why should they be interested in a union?
 
A. People involved in high-tech want more of a voice on work-related issues, like the kind of customer service they provide on the Internet or the phone. Many high-tech workers are also concerned about job security. When Amazon is moving customer service work to New Delhi, customer service workers in Seattle, many of whom have been at Amazon since the beginning, are worried that management is ignoring their concerns.
High-tech workers are aware that there's not a single high-tech C.E.O. or high-level manager who doesn't have a contract, detailing their country club membership, stock options, health care and salary of $1 million or $10 million. High-tech workers are smart, and they don't understand why they shouldn't also have a contract.
 
Q. High-technology companies are usually entrepreneurial, innovative and flexible, but unions usually resist entrepreneurship, innovation and flexibility. How do unions fit into the high-tech economy?
 
A. Unions usually take a different approach when it comes to high-tech workers. You don't try to bargain everything. When unions negotiate contracts for high-tech workers, they usually set just a floor, and most of the room is from there on up. Maybe just 30 or 40 percent of the compensation will be based on that floor. That leaves a lot of flexibility.
 
Q. With a lot of dot-com companies struggling, many managers fear that unionization will hasten the demise of their companies. What do unions bring to the party?
 
A. What unions bring is support for people at a company who feel they have a stake and don't want to be treated like a commodity. We're trying to build structures so that workers can interface with their managers with more confidence. People working at these companies are entitled to a voice, and companies are much more likely to succeed if their employees have a voice. Unionization absolutely should not increase the chances of a company's demise.
 
Q. Why have unions had so little success in organizing high-technology workers?
 
A. Six years ago, our union did not represent a single worker in cell phone communications, and now we represent 10,000 of them as members.
In terms of I.B.M., it has very traditional issues, relating to job security, pension and benefits, and of course there are concerns about cost-cutting. At I.B.M., many employees, working with us, have established the Alliance at I.B.M., to help give workers there a voice. The Alliance at I.B.M. has 1,000 members and 3,000 subscribers.
In the Amazon campaign, it's not easy. There, management is operating in a 1930's style. It's responding with fear. This is supposed to be a new economy but we have old-economy-thinking managers in terms of employee rights. Amazon is willing to accept workers if they have piercings or tatoos, but it's not willing to accept workers if they have a mind of their own.
 
Q. With so many high-tech workers jumping between companies or working as freelancers, how can unions help the high-tech work force?
 
A. At our affiliate, the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers, what sustains people is not collective bargaining, but creating a community of people. Maybe half these workers are freelance. Unions can provide a mix of social and educational activities, including hard-core training. We're providing classes in advanced Java script to improve people's skills.
Unions can provide information on job referrals and partnering for new people at a company. It's a matter of how do we create virtual and actual communities with other people like us.

HEADLINE: PRIVATE SECTOR;
A Lightning Rod in California

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO

 BODY:
WHEN a water shortage gripped California in the mid-1990's, Stephen L. Baum took to showering in a bucket. He would stand in the bucket under the shower, get wet, shut off the faucet, soap up, rinse and flush the toilet with the accumulated water.
Mr. Baum, the chairman of Sempra Energy, has asked his customers to take the same kind of conservation steps in response to the the current crisis gripping California -- spiraling natural-gas prices, coupled with an unprecedented shortage of electricity that has been widely attributed to a chaotic deregulation of the state's utility industry. 
 "I'm a persistent spokesman for addressing the demand side of the equation," he said in an interview early this month, when Californians were confronting the prospect of rolling blackouts for the first time. The blackouts remain a threat.
If Mr. Baum is looking to his consumers for help, it is hard to blame him. Sempra Energy, the parent of San Diego Gas and Electric and Southern California Gas, has been hit hard by California's energy crisis. During the summer, Sempra's customers were the first in the nation to pay free-market power prices: wholesale electricity costs skyrocketed and homeowners' bills doubled or tripled. And now Sempra's gas customers are facing winter bills that are likely to be 60 percent to 100 percent higher than last year's.
Mr. Baum, a former Marine and a career power industry executive, is under intense pressure, even if he does not show it. Sempra serves 21 million people in California and is one of the country's largest utility companies. Sempra employees have been harassed by outraged bill payers. The state has temporarily limited what Sempra can charge for power regardless of what the company must pay to buy it.
Mr. Baum, 59, has acknowledged that his salary, with bonuses, is likely to exceed $2 million a year, so he will not have any trouble paying his utility bill. Still, he has sought to practice what he preaches about conservation. In his La Jolla home, he has installed energy-saving fluorescent bulbs, timers on the dehumidifier and wine cooler and a special meter that lets his family save money by using electricity during off-peak hours.
But Mr. Baum also acknowledges that power conservation alone cannot solve California's energy crisis. He has been a leading proponent of changing the way deregulation works.
He wants temporary limits on what electricity wholesalers can charge the utilities. He wants the state to permit a rate increase. And he has suggested ways to help consumers buy the so-called time-of-use-meters -- the type he has in his home -- so they can benefit from using energy at off-peak times and through "negawatts," or credits for not using power. "Everyone talks about building new power plants, and everyone talks about price caps, but none of these things address the end user," he said.
Although Sempra has been forced to buy electricity at high prices, its problem is not as severe as that of California's two biggest utilities, Southern California Edison, which is a unit of Edison International, and Pacific Gas and Electric, a unit of the PG&E Corporation. Last Tuesday, Edison warned that it might have to seek bankruptcy protection. And Gov. Gray Davis has acknowledged that bigger electricity bills are inevitable because consumers must "bear some of the burden" of saving the utilities.
Sempra is in relatively good shape, partly because the company sold its California generating plants in July 1999, making San Diego Gas and Electric a distributor.
Under deregulation, that cleared the way for the company to raise consumer rates; Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric could not because they still own plants.
"We lifted the rate cap and nothing untoward happened for over a year," Mr. Baum said. "At which point, and this is my take on it, the generators and the other market participants figured out how to optimize their profits in the market."
Mr. Baum has seen the utility business from all sides. He started in the late 1970's as a lawyer for the Orange and Rockland Utilities in New York. He later became general counsel of the New York Power Authority, the state regulatory agency. In 1985, he moved to California and held a range of managing posts at San Diego Gas and Electric. He had been Sempra's vice chairman, president and chief executive before he was named chairman in September, succeeding Richard D. Farman, who retired.
Perhaps Mr. Baum's most notable achievement has been the diversification of Sempra, which has six subsidiaries besides its utilities. Among them are Sempra Energy Trading, an energy marketer, and Sempra Energy International, which develops projects abroad.
Sempra's non-utility businesses now provide about 30 percent of the company's earnings, compared with 1 percent or less a few years ago.
The diversification has earned Mr. Baum respect, not only from shareholders but also from employees. "When he arrived we were kind of laid back, doing business as a utility and not venturing into anything else," said David A. Moore, business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers local 465, which represents field workers at the San Diego Gas and Electric unit. "We were known as the small little utility to the south," said Mr. Moore, who has known Mr. Baum since his arrival. "He basically turned this company around."
But if the company is proud of its expansion, consumer advocates express concern that the company is putting its own interests before those of customers. "I was very supportive of changing around the economics of the industry," said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumer Action Network, a San Diego group that is critical of Mr. Baum and Sempra. "But I have a lot of difficulties with the way it's been done. These megaholding companies exercise way too much authority over the customer."
Mr. Shames said he believed that Mr. Baum was positioning the company to be sold -- something that Mr. Baum has denied.
Mr. Baum, who finds relaxation in the kitchen preparing gourmet meals, said he had no regrets about running Sempra at such a difficult time.
"I don't pine for going off and playing golf," he said. "I'm an adrenaline junkie. This is actually fine."

HEADLINE: An Interview With Bill Clinton

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from an interview of President Clinton in the Oval Office by The New York Times:
 
Q. The thing that seems to be a common thread that all your senior aides have said over time is that your greatest strengths are inexorably, I suppose as all human nature is, bound up in some of your potential weaknesses, and that the same aptitudes and appetites that have made you the most formidable political person of your generation have sometimes got you in trouble. I just wonder if you think there is any way that, over the last eight years, somehow America could have had the best of you without getting the worst of you, or is it all sort of wrapped up in one package? 

A. Oh, that's a judgment for somebody else to make.
 
Q. You don't want to take a ----
 
A. Yes. You guys were wrong about Whitewater. I wish we had the -- that Gertz sic Gerth piece was ridiculous, absurd on its face. I wish we could have had the great New York Times without that. It was like Wen Ho Lee, Chapter 1. I wish we could have had it. But we couldn't. So we still got The New York Times. Is the country better off for having The New York Times? Absolutely it is. Are we better off having The New York Times? Of course we are. I'll let -- the American people will have to make that judgment.
 
Q. Is it ever a kind of thing that you would like to take a good crack at some day in your own writings or your own thinking about this, some day when there's perspective? Because I sense it's ----
 
A. I might. I might. I've been -- nobody has any -- most people have no idea about what, personally, I've gone through for the last couple of years -- and I might do that. But I did the right thing not to do it -- this point, because the people hired me to do a job, and I got up every day and did it.
The price I paid for my personal mistake was, believe it or not, more than anything else, a profound personal price. I'm glad that I saved my family. I'm glad that my life is happy and in good shape, and I'm glad my country is still in good shape. But that whole episode was fundamentally a political move. It was not rooted in any established principles of Constitution, or law, or precedent. And so, you know, I didn't have time to be as personally reflective or harshly judgmental of myself, except for once, as I would otherwise have been inclined to do, because I was finding it too hard to save what we had worked for and the direction the country had taken.
And I just think that one of the things I hope -- and I saw it in this election -- I noticed that there was much less appetite for the politics of personal destruction in this election than there had been in many others, and I hope that maybe that's one of the consequences of all that I did, and maybe -- I mean, what we all went through, and maybe that will be something that's really good for the country over the long run. Maybe nobody else will ever have to go through this. . . .
 
Q. Is health care your biggest regret?
 
A. Well, I regret the fact that there are a lot of people in this country who still don't have health insurance. But we finally got the number of people without insurance going down again, for the first time in a dozen years, because of the Children's Health Insurance Program triggering in. So we're moving on it.
And I suppose on a policy front, that certainly ranks right up there. I wish we'd gotten -- I wish we'd been able to do more. But we got the number of uninsured people going down, and now we know how to do it, interestingly enough.
I think in the next year, I think the Congress ought to let the parents of the CHIP kids buy into it. I think they ought to let people over 55 buy into Medicare, as I proposed. There's three or four things you could do to dramatically reduce the number of people without health insurance in a piecemeal basis.
But let me say -- people say, well, why didn't you do that back in '94. The reason is, we didn't have the money to. If you want to provide health insurance, universal health insurance, there's only two ways to do it. It's not rocket science. You've either got to require the employers to offer the health insurance and then give a little financial -- a tax break to the people who have a hard time providing it, or you have to pay for it with tax money. And we had just raised taxes in the economic plan of '93 to get the deficit down. And we didn't have any money, so we couldn't raise taxes and we didn't have -- and the economy was not strong enough for the Congress to feel comfortable putting the employer mandate on it.
So I think -- that was my mistake. That wasn't -- I've always thought that my wife took too big a hit on that. That was -- I asked her to come up with a universal plan that maintained private health providers. And there aren't any other options, and neither option, frankly, in 1994 was politically doable in that Congress, and maybe not in the country by the time the interest groups got through mangling on it. So that was my mistake and it's one I have to live with -- like all my other mistakes.

HEADLINE: New Sprouts, Old Doubts for A.D.M.

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: DECATUR, Ill.

 BODY:
AT the sprawling headquarters of Archer Daniels Midland here, just beyond the rumbling and rattling of some of the world's biggest corn and soybean processing plants, top executives speak in glowing terms about the company's future.
A new A.D.M. is emerging, they say. It is a company that offers not just bulk grain but also a growing array of health and nutritional products like veggie burgers, soy milk, natural vitamin E and isoflavones, a soy extract that may reduce the risk of osteoporosis. It is also a company that will use its huge stocks of corn to produce renewable resources like biodegradable woods, plastics and fibers that could be an alternative to petrochemical products. And it is one that is willing to experiment with giant fish farms and specialized foods like hydroponic cucumbers. 
 What the executives do not want to talk about, though, is the past. They would like to bury talk about criminal investigations, F.B.I. tapes and Mark E. Whitacre, the former executive who blew the whistle on a huge price-fixing scheme at A.D.M. in the 1990's. That is history, the company says.
Although the company's stock price has jumped in recent weeks, few on Wall Street appear convinced that the new A.D.M. is all that different from the old one. The company, the self-proclaimed "Supermarket to the World," is still in the bulk commodity business, and its board and executive ranks are still believed to be controlled by the Andreas family, which owns less than 8 percent of the stock.
Five years after the price-fixing scandal and two years after the retirement of Dwayne O. Andreas, the legendary chairman who built A.D.M. into one of the world's most powerful corporations, the leadership -- and the future direction -- of the company remain in question.
In 1997, the board named G. Allen Andreas, Dwayne's nephew, to replace him as chief executive; two years later, Allen moved up to chairman as well. But in recent interviews, he has steadfastly refused to rule out the possibility that his 51-year-old cousin, Michael D. Andreas, Dwayne's son and onetime heir apparent, would return to the company after his three-year prison term ends in late 2002.
"I don't have any reason to respond until the circumstances change," Allen Andreas said in an interview two weeks ago. "His case is on appeal. He's maintained his innocence." Michael Andreas, the company's former vice chairman, was one of three top executives convicted of taking part in a global conspiracy to illegally fix the price of lysine, a widely used additive in animal feed during the early 1990's. On the tapes secretly recorded by Mr. Whitacre, who was head of the company's bioproducts division when he turned government informer, Michael Andreas was also heard making sexual and sexist comments about employees.
The $100 million fine that A.D.M. agreed to pay in 1996 to settle the government's charges was one of the largest price-fixing settlements in American history. But the company never admitted wrongdoing, and to this day it declines to say that its top executives were guilty of any crime.
"The board of directors made no judgment about the executives," Allen Andreas, 57, said last week. "Mick has been my close counsel and adviser. I had an excellent relationship with him," he said, referring to his cousin Michael.
If nothing else, those remarks suggest that the issue of who will ultimately lead Archer Daniels has not been resolved.
But the idea that Michael may return to the company -- either officially or unofficially -- does not sit well with big investors. "We would find this completely outrageous, if not immoral," said Theodore White, the corporate governance officer for the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the huge pension fund. "This underscores the fact that the longer you have a family running a public company, the more problems it creates. I think shareholders would flip if this happens."
Perhaps paradoxically, as A.D.M. searches for new leadership and a new direction, it desperately needs someone like Dwayne Andreas, who took control of the company in 1970. As its iron-fisted chairman, he dropped millions of dollars into the coffers of politicians of all stripes, to gain support for government programs that benefited his company -- price supports that helped increase the sales of high-fructose corn syrup, for example, and subsidies that helped create a national market for ethanol, a corn-based gas additive.
Yet as A.D.M. seeks to dispel notions that its fortunes were built on power politics and price-fixing, it needs to wield enough power to maintain its position as the world's premier agriculture company in a rapidly consolidating industry. "They're now at a crossroads," said David C. Nelson, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. "The world in the 90's changed faster than A.D.M.; they're playing some catch-up."
SINCE September, the company's shares have been climbing; they closed on Friday at $13.88, up almost 20 percent this year. But the movement has come largely because of optimism about growing demand for ethanol, the corn-based fuel additive, and soybean meal, which is fed to livestock. Most analysts say they are buying Archer Daniels as a bottom dweller to be prepared for an up cycle, not as a growth stock with long-term prospects.
"They do have a vision; it's just so far away," said Christine McCracken, an analyst at Midwest Research, an equity research firm based in Cleveland. "I just don't see any near-term catalyst in this story. It's really events, cycles. So you have to be a real Warren Buffett investor to stay with this."
Of course, the entire food industry has suffered a slump in the past few years. But few falls from grace have been as ugly as that of A.D.M., which suffered not only three senior executives being sent to prison, but also a huge drop in world commodity prices and shareholder meetings filled with angry questions about everything from the board's structure to the use of genetically altered crops.
Before its recent climb, the company's stock hit a 10-year low in September after another season of poor profits. Even now, the shares trade about 30 percent lower than they did in 1997.
And long-term growth prospects of A.D.M. remain relatively bleak, some analysts say, partly because it is already so big. A $13 billion company, it processes nearly one-third of the nation's corn, soybean and wheat crops and is one of the world's biggest cocoa producers. It also owns one of the nation's largest fleet of trucks, ships and rail lines.
The company's raw goods, bought from farmers, are processed at giant grain refineries that operate day and night. They produce the building blocks of breads, chocolates, vegetable oils and an array of other ingredients for products in every supermarket aisle.
Check the back of a bottle of Mrs. Butterworth's pancake syrup. The No. 1 ingredient is high-fructose corn syrup, which A.D.M. extracts from kernels of corn. It is the same sugar substitute that sweetens soft drinks. The company's ingredients are also in products like Skippy peanut butter, Hershey's chocolate syrup, Smucker's jellies and Campbell's soups. That is why A.D.M. calls itself the "Supermarket to the World."
But while those ingredients and grains are essential, food production nowadays is so efficient, so competitive and so commoditized that profit margins are slim.
NEIL E. HARL, a professor of agriculture and economics at Iowa State University, said the price-fixing scandal might have distracted A.D.M. at a time when other agriculture companies were reassessing their operations and broadening their focus.
"I think now, A.D.M. is playing catch-up and they're not sure where to go," he said. "They'd like to go into new businesses or move upstream toward the consumer. There's a growing realization that if you aren't close to the consumer, you're not going to go far."
That is precisely why General Mills, Pillsbury, Unilever and other food makers have divested themselves of some grain and milling operations to focus on branding and marketing higher-margin products. And it is why food processors like Tyson, Smithfield Foods and Conagra have moved up the food ladder, toward the consumer.
For years, A.D.M. has turned bulk commodities into more profitable goods like ethanol and high-fructose corn syrup. But it has not moved toward branded consumer goods. Though a strong backer of genetically altered crops, which executives say will revolutionize the agriculture industry, the company also chose not to acquire the seed or technology companies that are now developing the products.
Two major deals were considered, insiders say. In 1998, Monsanto, the chemical and biotechnology giant, looked at acquiring A.D.M. Later, DuPont contemplated such a move, according to press reports. Either deal would have tied together a major seed and chemical producer with a huge grain processor.
No deal was hatched, though, and some Wall Street analysts say it was probably a good thing, considering that biotechnology is now under fire.
Still, A.D.M. has failed to escape the low-margin cyclicality of its business. "You have to have realistic expectations," said Ms. McCracken at Midwest Research. "A.D.M. is never going to be Amazon.com. It's just not a high-growth company; it's a bulk processor."
However much they disagree with that assessment -- and they do -- executives at A.D.M. now have to convince investors that the new A.D.M. is a profit engine. As they see it, the company will achieve major growth through its nutraceuticals division, which sells natural vitamin E, isoflavones and other soy-based products believed to have health benefits.
As the country's population ages and becomes more health-conscious, health experts say people will look increasingly toward food supplements and substitutes for meats and dairy products. A.D.M. says its soy products will help fill that demand.
In a conference room at the headquarters, the company has been host to investors, analysts, reporters, food company executives and even Cuban dignitaries for lunches that show off multiple new prospects for using soy: the Midland Harvest taco filling, made with a soy meat substitute, a soy harvest burger, a soy pasta salad, soy-enhanced bread rolls and even a dairy-free soy ice cream.
The trouble is, the company's fortunes now are not tied to these relatively new products. Instead, they are linked to things like soybean oil, of which there is a global glut.
"The world is awash in vegetable oil," said Mr. Nelson at Credit Suisse First Boston. "We have the absolute worst market ever."
The problems began in Asia when an economic crisis swept the region in late 1997. That sent world commodity prices plummeting and eventually, over the next three years, helped clip more than $2 billion in revenue from the balance sheet of A.D.M., which sells a large portion of its products to the Pacific Rim.
Now, however, things are looking up. A recovery is under way in Asia, and in Europe, demand for soybean meal is rising because of a ban on bone meal in animal feed amid the scare over mad cow disease.
A.D.M.'s fate also depends on the ethanol factor. The demand and price of ethanol have surged with higher gasoline prices and could go even higher if Congress bans M.T.B.E., a gasoline additive that has been found to pollute water supplies. A ban might create a boon for A.D.M., which produces about 35 percent of the nation's supply of ethanol, the most likely replacement for M.T.B.E.
Potentially even bigger, however, are the company's plans to turn corn starch into other industrial goods -- like plastics, wood fibers, paper and other products now derived from petrochemicals.
Longer term, executives say, the company is investing in smaller technology companies and searching for joint ventures and new alliances with drug companies. It is also preparing a global network of grain elevators and processing plants that would segregate and process biotech crops in a way that analysts hope will be profitable.
"A.D.M. is trying to prepare itself for what will happen in the chain," Ms. McCracken said. "It's almost like the U.S. Postal Service; it's bulk service, but there's also Express Mail, so there's value there."
Indeed, A.D.M. has another plan. It says it will be one of just a few major grain handlers that will be able to efficiently track, segregate and ship to market genetically altered crops -- for which demand is increasing despite worldwide controversy over their safety.
"It's going to be a very complicated network," says Lewis W. Batchelder, a senior vice president at A.D.M. "Companies that don't have the infrastructure that A.D.M. has are going to have a difficult time pulling it off."
A.D.M. also wants to build closer relationships with farmers. Contract farming is already under way in much of the country, with farmers growing crops for companies like Frito-Lay, which wants a particular type of corn for its corn chips.
In the future, A.D.M. says it could help farmers choose their seeds, chemicals and fertilizers; line up the contracts and the financing; and even supply information about the weather, how best to plant a crop and the ideal date for harvest. Finally, A.D.M. would ship and process the crops.
It is unclear, however, whether farmers will agree to such a relationship. In the Midwest, many are already concerned about consolidation in the agriculture industry. The prospect of being contract farmers, tilling the land and taking orders from giant agriculture companies is even more troubling.
Unless companies like A.D.M. have control of a product from the farm to the processing plant, it will be impossible to get the growing number of specialty crops, like high-oil corn, to the market, Mr. Batchelder said.
THE company is also experimenting with several small-scale ventures. Here at the headquarters, in a giant hydroponic greenhouse, cucumbers slide off an assembly line to be carefully packaged and boxed for shipment.
About 500,000 heads of lettuce are also growing at any one time, year-round, in a space of just three-quarters of an acre. There is no soil, just a tray filled with a liquid nutrient solution that fosters faster growth.
"This is a kind of farm of the future," says Daniel Helfrich, the manager of the hydroponics division. "We can grow the same amount of lettuce in one-tenth the acreage."
The same facility also houses an enormous fish farm, home to more than 2.5 million tilapias, which are fed a diet of corn and soybeans. The fish farm is another, albeit small, outlet for the company's grains.
Feeding the planet is a mantra at this company. Indeed, its Web page, www.admworld.com, shows a running count of global population growth -- two and a half people a second, or about 80 million a year. A.D.M. is betting that the world's growing middle class will choose diets that mimic those in the United States, though analysts wonder who is going to pay for the food.
Skeptics also say that A.D.M.'s new initiatives will not amount to much in the next few years, and that the company still needs to show that it has cleaned up its act since the price-fixing debacle.
In 1998, under pressure from dissident shareholders, who complained about its insular nature and the influence of the Andreas family, the board's corporate governance committee recommended that a majority of the board and its committees be outside directors.
Now, most of the directors do come from outside, but many have close ties to the Andreas family, including Robert S. Strauss, the former chairman of the Democratic Party.
Dwayne Andreas, 82, serves as chairman emeritus and still has a board vote.
NOW leading the company, of course, is his choice, Allen, a former lawyer who has worked at A.D.M. for 27 years. (The board acknowledged that it did not interview any other candidates for the job.)
Allen has neither the fire nor the flamboyance of his uncle, but he is testy about the company's past. "This is five years ago, what do you want me to do?" he snapped when asked if the company ever admitted price-fixing and whether it would formally condemn actions by its own executives.
He would much rather talk about the future, stressing A.D.M.'s new mission statement ("to unlock the power of nature to improve the quality of life") and a new code of ethics and throwing around "new agriculture" lingo like renewable resources, nutraceuticals and functional foods. He foresees a planet that will produce much better food, for many more people, on much less land. And he sees a convergence of agriculture, food and pharmaceutical companies, with A.D.M. right in the middle.
"At some point, there ought to be a merger of interest between the pharmaceutical industry and the life sciences industry," he said. "We're in the life sciences industry; we're the largest producer of vitamin E, we're starting in vitamin C, and we have isoflavones. They need us to produce the foods that have good qualities."
Still, a question lingers: Will those products, and others, really make A.D.M. much less cyclical, as the company hopes? So far, Wall Street analysts are betting that the answer is no.

Thinking About the Day After Tomorrow

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS he has aged along with his generation, Bill Clinton, who likes to call himself the oldest baby boomer, went from thinking about tomorrow in his first national campaign to lamenting in his second that he had more yesterdays behind him than tomorrows ahead. Groaning at his sentimentality, his detractors -- his haters, really -- relished seeing him as the embodiment of what they considered his generation's immorality, self-absorption and instability.
That may have turned Mr. Clinton into a caricature of a caricature, but if so, it was partly his fault. Along with his self-image, his politics were consciously generational, from the moment he opposed President George Bush as a cold warrior ill-equipped to midwife a globalizing economy. His two terms tracked the arc of his ever-changing generation -- from scattershot, even reckless idealism to cautiously self-interested maneuvering, with a long, wasteful timeout for bad behavior and an increasing focus on finances. 
 "Each generation of Americans must define what it means to be an American," Mr. Clinton declared in his first Inaugural Address, as he seized the torch for his fellow boomers. Later, the country would learn that for this president "definitions" and "meanings" were starting, not ending points.
Under President Clinton, definitions changed. What it meant to be a Democrat, what it meant to be a Republican, what it meant to be the president, what it meant to be first lady, what it meant to be impeached, what it meant to say something "is" -- all these became more fluid.
Along with the political nomenclature, the world was also changing, and fast. Mr. Clinton is fond of noting that when he became president there were 50 sites on the World Wide Web. He still barely uses a computer, but he grasped early on how information technology could change society.
Mr. Clinton's own capacity for change was obvious from the moment he began campaigning. It was dismissed as chameleon slipperiness by his detractors and hailed as tactical brilliance by his supporters. It led both to underestimate him. Both saw him as emotionally weak, quick to agree with the last person who counseled him. He turned out to be ruthless and tougher than anyone who opposed him. He was seen as gross in his appetites and tastes -- and he can be -- but he also proved to be extraordinarily subtle, sometimes far more subtle than was good for him.
Mr. Clinton began with visions of an epic, big-screen presidency and ended up more like a celebrity promoter of cherished causes. But from the start, his critics and even his supporters underestimated how, while everything changed, he would cling to core goals -- expanding economic opportunity, negotiating trade agreements to promote growth and peace, making higher education a middle-class entitlement -- and would keep working toward them, albeit with ever-changing methods.
When Congress was with President Clinton, he passed the North American Free Trade Agreement and expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, an underappreciated boost to the working poor. He passed a deficit-cutting plan that, paradoxically, became his most effective social program. But he overreached, and he had to switch strategies.
With Congress against him, he played defense, protecting entitlement programs for the elderly while pushing for incremental changes in health care. He signed a Republican welfare reform bill -- he had promised an end to welfare "as we know it" -- but came back, again and again, until Congress excised what he considered to be its cruel provisions.
President Clinton was largely indifferent to bureaucratic reform, but he wanted to restore confidence in the government. The shutdown of 1995 reminded Americans how much they depended on federal programs. After the 1996 campaign no one seriously talked about disbanding the Department of Education. Now, for the first time, the children of baby boomers have seen that the government can operate in surplus.
BUT Mr. Clinton wasted the opportunity he created. During the shutdown, over a pizza, he started his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, which ultimately gave cynicism about government a good name. His personal trustworthiness became a national joke. Yet, in powerful tribute to Mr. Clinton's gift for conveying that he understood and cared about Americans' problems, a strong majority continued to trust him to do a good job as president. As a result, his sexual experimentation -- like his generation's -- was read as either causing Americans to grapple honestly with the complexities of marriage and relationships or turning them into compartmentalizing moral relativists. In reality, it did both, and deepened the split between the camps holding each view.
"The urgent question of our time is whether we can make change our friend and not our enemy," Mr. Clinton said in that same first Inaugural Address. The baby-boom generation has brought on extraordinary change -- in civil rights, women's roles, the nature of the economy, religious practices, attitudes toward authority. It is hard to think of an public or private institution unaffected. All of it -- like the changes brought on in the last eight years by President Clinton -- feels unfinished. Their contribution, and his, seems transitional.
Now the country will see if George W. Bush -- another representative of the alternately feckless and ambitious boomers -- can handle change as adeptly as his predecessor. As for soon-to-be-former President Clinton, who has never been satisfied simply being, the always fascinating and sometimes aggravating question remains: What will he become next?

HEADLINE: The Nation;
A New Look at Russia

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
VLADIMIR V. PUTIN, the Russian president, has found little to talk to the Clinton administration about of late. And so there he was this month, circling the United States with visits to Cuba and Canada and seeming to say: Please take notice, Russia is still a power.
Mr. Putin is said to be eager to come to Washington to meet President-elect George W. Bush in the spring. If he does, he may find the new Bush administration taking notice of his country in an entirely new -- but perhaps unwelcome -- way. 
 That was the clear implication in the two key choices Mr. Bush made public last week of officials to lead his foreign policy -- Gen. Colin L. Powell as secretary of state and Condoleezza Rice as national security adviser.
"The watchword for the Bush administration will be pragmatism," said Thomas E. Graham, Jr., an expert on Russia at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who, having served in the American embassy in Moscow, has studied the Bush policy as it has emerged for a year. "Gone will be the romanticism of the early Clinton years and the pretense of the later years."
In the 1990's, Russia was treated as the 500-pound gorilla of foreign policy problems -- a country whose nuclear arsenal, strategic position and imploding economy made its success or failure of immense interest to the United States, even though Washington ultimately had little real control over events there.
Now comes the Bush team, with plans to signal different treatment. Speaking bluntly, Ms. Rice said in the fall, Russia is now a challenge not because of the might it once had as the center of the Soviet Union but because it is a "declining power."
For starters, Russia policy is likely to be folded back into the European bureau at the State Department, a move that would suggest that Russia is not going to get all the special attention it had in the last eight years. Instead, Ms. Rice has said that America needs to re-cement relations with its allies in Europe and Asia. Mr. Bush promptly acted on that premise by dropping by to see a visiting President Jacques Chirac at the French Embassy here Monday night.
"They will seek relations with Russia that are a combination of cooperation, competition and indifference -- similar to relations the United States enjoys with most countries around the world," Mr. Graham said.
Ms. Rice has been Mr. Bush's tutor in foreign affairs, and now she will run the Russia policy from a desk just down the corridor from the Oval Office.
But Mr. Bush will also have a powerful and experienced secretary of state, General Powell, and that leaves a question of how the two will mesh their ideas, and how the Russians will react to them.
In his first statement as secretary of state designate, General Powell set a firm tone, saying that Russia would not be a strategic partner, an approach the Clinton administration used in the early going with its favorite Russian leader, Boris N. Yeltsin. General Powell, like Ms. Rice in the past year, spoke unambiguously about forging ahead with national missile defense, a clear-cut Bush foreign policy goal.
If missile defense is, indeed, the first issue to come up in relations with Russia next year, it is highly likely to enrage many Russian leaders, Mr. Putin among them. After Mr. Clinton failed to persuade Mr. Putin to agree to an amendment to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 and thus to allow deployment of a limited missile defense, the two leaders had little to talk about on the four occasions when they met face to face.
THE Bush notion for national missile defense, as outlined by the governor in a speech last spring, calls for abrogation of the ABM treaty, a prospect that Russia and the European allies have fiercely opposed. Whether Ms. Rice and General Powell want to tear up the treaty right away is not clear. But they are intent on forging a new strategic concept with Moscow, and Ms. Rice has hinted she knows this is likely to introduce a new animus.
"Whether or not the Russians are fully ready to accept ballistic missile defense as a part of that strategic concept, I can't judge," she said in the fall.
Ms. Rice has chosen as her deputy at the security council Stephen J. Hadley, an assistant secretary of defense in the administration of Mr. Bush's father and a big promoter of national missile defense. Mr. Hadley is also an active member of the U.S. Committee to Expand NATO, a group that is aggressively seeking to bring into the alliance more nations that were part of the Soviet empire, a goal Moscow detests.
The Bush approach to Russia will focus much less than the Clinton team did on what the Russians are doing at home. Ms. Rice, whose basic expertise is in the Soviet system and its security arrangements, believes that the Clinton administration spent too much time and money trying to transform Russia into a Western look-alike democracy and market economy.
IT was good news, she said in her fall speech, that Mr. Putin had stopped making frequent calls for international financial assistance and had placed more emphasis on tax reform that would allow entrepreneurship to develop. "If we can rebalance the agenda with the Russians to one that deals more with the security challenges that we both face, I think we will have both a more realistic and a more fruitful relationship with Russia," she said.
Is this the kind of music Mr. Putin wants to hear? During the campaign, Russian officials suggested they preferred Mr. Bush to Mr. Gore for the next four years.
They suggested they liked the sound of hard power as opposed to the soft power of coddling Russia into imitating Western models of democracy and capitalism.
Indeed, on a Russian Web site that reflects the government point of view, a commentator wrote last week under the headline "Condoleezza Rice upholds Putin's policy" that Ms. Rice was their kind of hard-headed Russia expert. This was so, the writer said, because she would refuse to spoon-feed the "infant" with I.M.F. "baby food."
But given the content of the hard power agenda, a departing Clinton Russia expert asked: "I wonder if the Russians will like the meat and potatoes when they eat it."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Robert L. Rodriguez;
FPA Capital Fund

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
HERE'S a holiday gift for stalwart value investors: On Jan. 1, the longtime value guru Robert L. Rodriguez will reopen his $375 million FPA Capital fund, which has been closed to new investors since 1995.
The gift comes courtesy of a collapsing stock market that provides him with buying opportunities. The major indexes flirted with new highs earlier this year, Mr. Rodriguez said, but by then the gains were limited to a narrow group of stocks. As he sees it, most stocks have been in a bear market since February 1998, and many are selling at bargain prices. 
 "The value style of investing has been under severe attack, the worst I've seen in 30 years in the business," he said. "The gap in valuations between high-expectation growth stocks and out-of-favor issues is among the widest in years."
Nor does he expect the carnage among technology stocks to stop soon. "It would not surprise us if the Nasdaq declined another 30 percent from present levels," he said from his Los Angeles office overlooking the Pacific Ocean.
FPA Capital, which reopens with a 5.25 percent load, down from 6.5 percent, has outstanding long-term returns. It gained 19.2 percent a year, on average, for the 10 years through Thursday, placing fourth among its peers in the mid-capitalization value category, which returned 15.1 percent, according to Morningstar Inc.
But the shorter-term picture is far different: it rose just 1.1 percent, annualized, for the three years ended Thursday, ranking near the bottom of its group, which returned 8.2 percent.
Those recent returns have not shaken Mr. Rodriguez's strict value discipline. He is a contrarian who chooses stocks from among the most unloved issues. "Many solid companies are selling at seven or eight times their projected 12-month earnings," he explained, compared with a ratio of about 25 for the Standard & Poor's 500. "Some have been hammered by even slightly disappointing earnings, others can't shake off their association with the old economy and others have simply looked dull to investors captivated by an era of headlong technological change."
Mr. Rodriguez, who is 52, races sports cars, a flashier hobby than his investing style might suggest. As chief executive of First Pacific Advisors, the funds' sponsor and a unit of United Asset Management, he also runs the $500 million FPA New Income fund.
At FPA Capital, he and three analysts bottom-fish among companies with market capitalizations of roughly $500 million to $3 billion. To pick the 35 or so stocks in the fund, they seek market leaders with strong balance sheets and depressed share prices, then look for low ratios of short- and long-term debt to total capital, which is debt plus shareholder equity. The fund's ratio of debt to capital is 30 percent, versus 36 percent for the Russell 2000.
"When you invest in companies that are hated," Mr. Rodriguez said, "you like to have a solid balance sheet as well as solid cash flow to give you the financial wherewithal to make it through a difficult cycle."
Mr. Rodriguez also favors stocks that are trading at 12-month lows or below their five-year average prices. He finds others by scanning Wall Street recommendations, then doing the opposite. "Usually we look for companies that have a lot of 'holds' on their stock, a euphemism that brokers use for 'sell,' " he said.
Mr. Rodriguez's mantra is "long term." The fund's turnover has averaged 20 percent a year or less during his 16-year tenure, compared with more than 100 percent for the typical domestic stock fund.
When oil prices hit new highs in recent months, he sold energy stocks and bought those of heavy energy users. "We don't feel that the present level of energy prices can be sustained over the next three years," he said.
In August, he bought Celanese, the German chemical company that trades as American depository receipts, in part as a bet on falling energy prices. He has bought and sold shares over the last decade, most recently buying at an average, including commission, of $15.863. The stock is now at $17.94.
He praised what he called the company's "low-cost leadership" in chemicals for industries including automobiles, construction products and clothing. The company's ratio of debt to capital is 30.9 percent.
Celanese is also a play on the recovery of the euro. "We think the odds are decent that the euro is presently overly depressed," he said.
Another favorite is Michaels Stores, an arts and crafts retailer with about 600 outlets. After the arrival of a new chief executive, Michael Rouleau, nearly four years ago, it is "moving to record profitability," Mr. Rodriguez said.
He bought shares in October 1996 at $14.125. The fund increased its position in October 2000 after the price fell 50 percent in the wake of a company announcement that earnings might not meet expectations. The stock now trades at $23.75.
Two big electronics components distributors account for nearly all the fund's 24.4 percent stake in technology -- Arrow Electronics and its chief rival, Avnet. Any company that wants to do global business requiring electronics parts, he said, must deal with one or the other. He called them "the poor man's way of participating in the growth of technology."
He first bought Arrow shares in 1989 at an average of $5.331; they are now at $26.13. He bought shares in Avnet's predecessor, Marshall Industries, in 1990 at an adjusted price of $12.475; Avnet now trades at $19.06.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends;
Charity Begins at the Rule Book

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
CHARITY is kind, the Bible says. And in this season of coat drives and food baskets, who would disagree? Not President-elect George W. Bush, who has vowed to "rally the armies of compassion," and met with black ministers last week to promote faith-based charity as the kinder, more cost-effective alternative to government-run help for needy people.
But as charities attempt to take up the slack in the safety net caused by a $7 billion decline in government food aid for the poor, they have taken on some of the worst aspects of the government bureaucracy they try to replace. Seemingly arbitrary eligibility rules, inflexible limits on aid and impersonal requirements are now common features at many food pantries and religious social service organizations as they struggle with overwhelming demands. 
 To meet a new scale of need, many nonprofit agencies became more professional and so rule-bound. Public money to expand, or access to supplies from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, brought greater accountability and state rules so detailed they can specify the number of cans of green beans allowed one family in a year. Even small, church-based volunteers are adding rules that can make it harder to get help.
In New York City, a recent survey of 216 food pantries by the Coalition Against Hunger found 63 percent now set rules to limit use, though such rules were too rare to measure just a few years ago, and only reached half the pantries in 1999, said Judith Walker, director of the coalition. At United Bronx Parents, hungry families are barred from getting groceries from the food bank more than three times a year; before the coordinator hands out cans of chili beans and meat balls, he consults a ledger cross-referenced with names, dates and photocopies of such required documents as a referral from a church or social service agency.
The more programs are forced to turn people away for lack of supplies or money, researchers say, the more intent they become on adding rules that tighten their service boundaries, trying to slow demand and ensure help goes to those who need it most. The unintended result is that people unable to make ends meet because of low wages or serious health problems trudge from one food pantry to the next.
"What's most worrisome is that some of the people who are in most need are simply not able to play by all these rules," said Amy Brown, a researcher with the Community Food Resource Center in New York.
One goal of the welfare overhaul was to replace a sense of entitlement from government with a sense of personal responsibility for self-sufficiency. Private charity was expected by many to do a better job than government at deciding who deserved help. And agencies generally consider rules, even arbitrary ones, a fairer way to ration inadequate resources than unbridled discretion.
More rules can also be a healthy development in a growing organization, contends Noel Tichy, a professor of business at the University of Michigan and a management expert who advises corporations and nonprofits alike. In fast-growth software companies, he said, "we try to create some rules and bureaucracy to guide decision-making so it's not all anarchy." In lean social service organizations, "they're trying to be fair, and rules are one way to play triage."
But the result can seem like the worst of both worlds, said Doug O'Brien, director of policy for America's Second Harvest, which distributes $2.4 billion worth of donated food annually, compared to $18 billion-worth of food stamps delivered by the government, down from $25 billion five years ago.
In its survey of 12,000 food programs two years ago, 77 percent of pantries said they limit who can be served, and 70 percent screen clients, often to prevent use by those outside a certain geographic area. Some consider that applicants who make the rounds abuse the system, but 53 percent say the practice is fair, in part because clients cannot get enough food from one program.
At one food bank in Austin, Tex., for example, many young mothers who arrive with hungry toddlers in tow have been referred straight from the food stamp office for emergency supplies to bridge a 30-day delay before their first allotment. But Debora Duncan, the center director, said it cannot supply food for a whole month and bars a client's return for three months. If they go elsewhere, she added, "They are labeled as using the system, when all they're trying to do is survive."
Not surprisingly, a recent survey at the Community Food Resource Center's West Harlem food programs, which has no geographical restrictions, found 21 percent of clients travel there from other boroughs.
SUCH demand pushes charities to ratchet up eligibility requirements, said David Reingold, an assistant professor at the Indiana University School of Philanthropy, who studied the impact of welfare reform on faith-based charities in Indiana. Surveying 295 social service agency directors, he found 23 percent of the faith-based organizations had tightened eligibility criteria for their services -- far more than the 8.7 percent of their secular counterparts. In Green county, Indiana, some churches are limiting help to members of their own congregation, he said.
These trends have a familiar sound to American social welfare historians. In the late 19th century, after public relief was drastically cut in an effort to end "pauperism," private charity organization societies with the motto "not alms but a friend" promoted investigations to curb the "unworthy" poor from seeking multiple handouts and slipping back into dependency.
Then, as severe recessions hit, "scientific charity" came under attack. By the early 20th century, many charity leaders agreed that more government help was needed to relieve poverty rooted in ill health, low wages and economic dislocation.
"In any business solution is embedded the next problem," Mr. Tichy said. "You run a risk of creating a bureaucracy which becomes less human, less in touch with what the vision of these agencies was. On the other hand, you have little alternative."

The First Lesson for Bush: It's Still the Economy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Texas

 BODY:
TO anyone interested in what happens when a new president meets a jittery economy, there was a fascinating bit of political theatre on Monday morning outside the Madison Hotel in Washington.
President-elect George W. Bush emerged from breakfast with Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. A smiling Mr. Bush threw his arm around Mr. Greenspan's shoulders and, while the Fed chairman looked vaguely uncomfortable, said, "I talked with a good man here. We had a very strong discussion about my confidence in his abilities." 
 Actually, a more interesting question is how much confidence the economy's Delphic Oracle has in the abilities of Mr. Bush and his economic team, which is just now taking shape.
After all, Mr. Bush's designee for Treasury Secretary, Paul H. O'Neill, who has run Alcoa and is an old friend of Mr. Greenspan, had barely expressed how honored he felt before the Nasdaq fell 7 percent on Wednesday.
It has now fallen almost 45 percent since Sept. 1., evidence of an economy that has slowed far sooner than almost anyone expected at the end of the summer. Last week, a raft of companies announced disappointing earnings, layoffs and temporary plant closings, and Xerox, of all companies, reportedly asked its employees not to make so many photocopies.
Mr. Greenspan, who engineered a steady run-up in interest rates for fear that the economy needed to be cooled down, now seems to fear he has gone too far: The Fed indicated last week it may soon begin to cut rates, because fears of recession have come to outweigh fears of inflation.
Mr. Bush's advisers are not new to slowdowns: Mr. O'Neill ran an aluminum company, a business tightly bound to world markets, and Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, Lawrence B. Lindsey, whose exact position has yet to be announced, used to serve on the Fed. But the issue facing them today is not just a slowdown here, it is a slowdown everywhere. Japan looks as if it is slipping into recession, Europe's hopes of reducing its chronic unemployment problem are slipping away, and in the past few weeks, the International Monetary Fund has put together a $40 billion bailout package for Argentina, and a smaller one to keep Turkey afloat.
In fact, what makes this slowdown different from the last one, said Allen Sinai, the chief economist of Primark Decisions Systems, whose reports are read by some of Mr. Bush's top advisers, is precisely its global character.
"The links in international economies are much, much tighter than they were during the last Bush administration," said Mr. Sinai. "And this time, the contagion that everybody worries about could easily emanate from us. That creates a particular problem for any administration, much less one that hasn't gotten to Washington yet."
OVER the past decade, it has become clear that troubles in one corner of the globe, even a remote one, can't be quarantined.
Think about the collapse of the Thai baht in 1997, which triggered the Asian crisis. As it spread, Hong Kong's markets began to sink. And that, in turn, provoked a huge sell-off here. The next year the same thing happened again with the relatively small economy of Russia, whose troubles nonetheless ignited panics from Wall Street to Latin America.
Now imagine the effect of the United States economy, the world's largest importer, slowing from 80 to, say, 55 miles an hour. Suddenly, Japan's bad prospects are far worse and China's toy-and-electronics-driven growth falls. And if the dollar weakens, which many economists expect, foreign investors could pull their money out of the United States, where it has been parked for most of the past decade, further depressing imports here.
Mr. Bush's economic aides understand this cascading bad-news scenario all too well, though they don't want to talk about it publicly, for fear of causing some of the very problems they hope to avoid. (They are also up for confirmation hearings, a period during which only fools talk policy.) In the past, Mr. O'Neill has strongly supported the Clinton administration's policy of paying down the national debt. How that squares with Mr. Bush's enthusiasm for tax cuts, a position that Mr. Lindsey helped develop, is not clear. The Bush folks say there is plenty of money to do both, but there won't be if a downturn turns those surplus projections into pixie dust.
For his part, Mr. Bush acknowledged the international dimension of his economic challenges at a press conference on Friday. But his approach sounded markedly different from that of Mr. Clinton and his advisers, led by Robert E. Rubin and then his successor as Treasury Secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, over the past eight years. Mr. Rubin and Mr. Summers never shied from telling other countries to get their economic houses in order, and offered billions in loans to Mexico, South Korea and others if they implemented reforms to Washington's liking.
"We'll have a foreign policy that is humble," Mr. Bush said, repeating a line from his debates with Vice President Al Gore. He added: "By that I mean that we should not be divining prescriptions for people's ills. If they want to work with us, fine. But our country cannot try to impose our prescriptions on nations."
It is too early to tell exactly what that means. It's hard to imagine that the United States will stop prodding Japan to restart its idling economy. Or that it will cease using the monetary fund as an instrument of American will. Because economic downturns these days have a way of gaining speed as they circle the globe.

Fashion's Political Forecast

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NORWICH

 BODY:
IT'S finally clear: Fashion is destiny. The Bush family tree grows in Washington once more and it looks like 1980's deja vu all over again.
Never mind the pundits and political analysts, the prognosticators to beat are fashion people. They have been saying the 1980's are back since 1996. That year, fashion design began to invoke the 1980's gold rush. Now, we have full-blown 1980's redux, with logo handbags (actually, logo everything), designer dresses, big hair, furs and Park Avenue princesses. And the Bushes are returning to the White House. 
 "The 80's just won't go away," said Joan Kaner, fashion director for Neiman Marcus. "Then and now, the excessiveness of detail and exaggeration of sharp shapes are a reflection of good times and the economy."
The range of 80's fashion in stores leaves none of the decade's stones unturned. There are shoulder pads, tight jeans and drapey necklines. There is punk, new wave and early Madonna -- the performer and new bride, not the virgin -- references. Also pearls. Republican red is the new black -- again -- which had been replaced by brown which replaced gray which was the new black.
The word "snippy" is back. Hanging up the phone when one feels "snippy" is back. Texas ranches are back. Reruns of "Dallas" are expected again in heavy cable television rotation. Back, too, is Hobe Sound, the snippy, exclusive Florida resort near Palm Beach, but social worlds away from it, where Dorothy Walker Bush, paternal grandmother of the president-elect, wintered.
Preppy-style clothing and accessories are back.
Also back is Arnold Scaasi, who dressed Barbara Bush when she was first lady in the 80's and still does. The American couturier will, apparently, not have the opportunity to dress Laura Bush for the Inauguration. The Dallas designer Michael Faircloth -- what's in a name? -- got the nod. But Scaasi's fingers are crossed for future commissions. (I know. I've seen the fingers.)
Attention all political analysts: Fashion prognosticators are already on to the next big thing. The fashion cycle spins ever faster. Why not the Clintonesque early 1990's, which featured a minimalism that, as Amy M. Spindler observed in The Times, was a "fashion mea culpa" to atone for the 80's excesses? Almost a decade old, this is already vintage in fashion time. And Bill Clinton himself does not seem to be going away.
Much like politics, fashion nostalgia is tricky. Buyers beware. It, "errs when interpretation digresses into imitation -- and there were many accusations of mimicry this season," as Anne Slowey writes in Elle.
Politics is dandy, but fashion is faster. And people who don't understand fashion are bound to repeat it.

HEADLINE: The Dot-Com Bubble Bursts

 BODY:
A year ago Americans could hardly run an errand without picking up a stock tip.Day-trading manuals were selling briskly. Neighbors were speaking a foreign tongue, carrying on about B2B's and praising the likes of JDS Uniphase and Qualcomm. Venture capital firms were throwing money at any and all dot-coms to help them build market share, never mind whether they could ever be profitable. It was a brave new era, in which more than a dozen fledgling dot-coms that nobody had ever heard of could pay $2 million of other people's money for a Super Bowl commercial.
What a difference a year makes. The Nasdaq sank. Stock tips have been replaced with talk of recession. Many pioneering dot-coms are out of business or barely surviving. The Dow Jones Internet Index, made up of dot-com blue chips, is down more than 72 percent since March. Online retailers Priceline and eToys, former Wall Street darlings, have seen their stock prices fall more than 99 percent from their highs. 
 Unlike the worrisome decline in the stock prices of solidly grounded technology firms due to a slowdown in profits, the sharper plunge taken by some of the trendy Internet companies that had no earnings in the first place has proved comforting to those who believe in the rationality of markets. After all, many of them lacked one key asset -- a sensible business plan. Even the most traditional brokers and investment banks set aside the notion that a company's stock price should reflect its profits and urged investors not to miss out on the gold rush. At the craze's zenith, Priceline, the money-losing online ticket seller, was worth more than the airlines that provided its inventory.
The current sense of despair in the dot-com universe may be as overdone as last year's euphoria. The Internet, after all, really is a transforming technology that has revolutionized the way we communicate. What recent months suggest, however, is that it may not be an indiscriminate, magical new means of making money.
Woeful tales of visionary innovators failing to capitalize on their revolutionary new technology are not new. The advent of railroads, the automobile and radio, to name other watershed innovations in history, also led to many a shattered dream. The number of failed auto makers far exceeded the number that ultimately succeeded.
In this holiday season, the financial implosion of so many dot-com retailers seems particularly cruel. It is not as if consumers do not appreciate shopping online. Online sales this season are expected to be about two-thirds greater than last year. But it is not the innovators who are reaping all the benefits. Online retailers are losing market share to the likes of Wal-Mart and Kmart. This holiday season, online sales of traditional retailers, initially hesitant to embrace the Web, will outpace those of the pure dot-coms for the first time.
The endearing Pets.com sock puppet is a fitting mascot for the demise of the dot-com mania. Less than a year ago the spokesdog for the online pet-supply retailer was starring in some of those $2 million Super Bowl commercials. Now, in the wake of his master's bankruptcy, he is looking to shill for another company -- one that can actually make money.

HEADLINE: INVESTING: FUNDS WATCH;
Mixed Offerings

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
The market for initial public offerings in 2000 was extremely good or extremely bad, depending on who is asked. Capital-hungry companies raised record amounts, but Internet issues dragged down the year's returns on new offerings to the lowest levels in five years.
"Despite raising a record amount of money, this was the year that the I.P.O. market succumbed to the double whammy of Federal Reserve tightening and too many speculative companies," said Linda R. Killian, who runs the $100 million Renaissance IPO Plus fund in Greenwich, Conn. 
 This year, 405 companies raised $97 billion, $4 billion more than in 1999. Their offerings averaged a record $240 million, far surpassing last year's $190 million.
But an anemic fourth quarter pulled down the year's returns. With the Nasdaq index declining far more than the Standard & Poor's 500, "investors lost their infatuation with growth I.P.O.'s and took second looks at the value plays," Ms. Killian said. Over all, new issues this year lost 7 percent from their offering prices, on average, through Dec. 18, and 31 percent from the close of the first day's trading.
All of the largest offerings for 2000 have been spinoffs from big corporations seeking to demonstrate value in high-growth divisions or subsidiaries. In March, the offering of AT&T Wireless raised $10.6 billion, the biggest initial public offering ever in the United States.
The worst results were from dot-coms with high expectations but disappearing cash. The biggest loser, Pets.com, an online retailer of pet supplies that is now in liquidation, lost 99 percent.
Ms. Killian sees brighter skies ahead. Investors hurt by risky initial offerings will demand stronger companies, she said. There are just 200 offerings scheduled, down from a bloated 400 at the start of 2000. Potentially lower interest rates and new retirement savings rules would also bolster interest in initial offerings, she added.
"Next year should mark the beginning of another classic I.P.O. cycle," Ms. Killian said. "With hundreds of dubious I.P.O.'s yanked from the pipeline, investors should be able to buy high-quality I.P.O.'s at reasonable valuations."

A Wild Week Ends With a Tech Bounce

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Stocks ended the week mixed after gyrating wildly in response to more corporate profit warnings and the Federal Reserve's decision to defer cutting interest rates.
 The Nasdaq market plunged to its seventh-biggest loss on record on Wednesday, hitting its lowest level since March 1999, and 53.8 percent off its peak in March 2000. On Thursday, however, it inched ahead, breaking a seven-session losing streak. And on Friday it soared to its fifth-biggest percentage gain ever, as bargain hunters swooped in on technology stocks. That held the week's deterioration to 136.25 points, or about 5 percent. At 2,517.02, the index is now down 38.2 percent for the year and has fallen in six of the last seven weeks. 
But the other major averages did better. The Standard & Poor's 500 showed little change, losing just 6.18 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,305.97. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 200.60 points, or 1.9 percent, to 10,635.56.
 The turmoil in stocks, combined with the economy's deceleration, diverted more money to the bond market. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury eased to 5 percent from 5.17 percent the previous week. ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

HEADLINE: Fueling China's Growth

 BODY:
Oil has not figured prominently in the delicate relationship between the United States and China. But it soon will. China, the world's most populous nation with 1.3 billion people, will become one of the world's top oil importers in just a few years. This growing reliance on imported oil will further anchor China in the global economy and help shape its ties to the United States. Both nations should be thinking about how to manage this new reality and its strategic repercussions not only in East Asia, but also in places like the Middle East.
Though the issue is not yet much discussed, it is being closely studied by the Central Intelligence Agency, academics and oil industry analysts. As he devises a China policy, President-elect George W. Bush can draw on the research, some of which has been done by the public policy institute at Rice University named after former Secretary of State James Baker. 
 China's need for ever greater quantities of imported oil is driven by its torrid economic growth. In the next 20 years, China's gross domestic product is expected to quadruple, enhancing its people's living standards and partially closing the economic gap with the United States.
The underlying force behind China's growth -- the great migration of its population to the cities and the creation of a middle class -- is still in its nascent stages. There are, for instance, 10 motor vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants in China, compared with 30 in Egypt, 148 in Mexico, 552 in Japan and 770 in the United States.
A net exporter of oil until 1993, China now imports 1.2 million of the 4.5 million barrels it consumes a day. It is expected to import roughly 4 million barrels a day in 2010 and close to 7 million in 2020. The United States currently imports about 10 million a day. The Middle East is expected to supply more than three-quarters of China's oil imports by 2010. As this dependence grows, Beijing is likely to become a more active and influential actor in the Middle East.
This may well complicate the American role in the region. Beijing has been cultivating ties with oil-producing nations, including Iran and Iraq. China dislikes international economic sanctions, claiming that they represent unwarranted interference in the affairs of sovereign states. In recent years, Beijing has supplied Iran with ballistic missile technology and has taken an indulgent line toward Iraqi defiance of United Nations weapons inspectors.
But China's Middle East diplomacy has also grown more sophisticated than it was in the days of Mao Zedong, when Beijing's main allies were radical Palestinian terrorists. Now China maintains full diplomatic relations with Israel and seeks to purchase sophisticated Western military technologies from the Jewish state that it cannot buy directly from the United States or Europe.
China's strategic interests, like those of other major oil importers, will increasingly lie in maintaining political and military stability throughout the Middle East. For that reason, Beijing should not want to see Iran and Iraq develop unconventional weapons with which they could threaten Israel and other neighbors. Encouragingly, China recently promised the United States that it would no longer help Iran or any other country develop advanced missiles. In future years, China could even come to rely on American naval power to keep sea lanes open to ensure the uninterrupted flow of its economic life blood.
As China takes its place among the world's great powers, and attempts to integrate its economy into global markets, Beijing's need for foreign oil may have a moderating effect on Chinese behavior. That will require constructive thinking about China's future oil requirements by President Jiang Zemin and a willingness by the Chinese leadership to work alongside the United States in maintaining the free flow of oil around the globe. For a nation on the verge of becoming a full member of the World Trade Organization, that kind of attitudinal shift should be possible. Washington, for its part, should continue to encourage China's Communist leaders to see the two nations' growing economic interdependence as a source of stability and prosperity, not vulnerability.

HEADLINE: FAILING FARMERS LEARN TO PROFIT FROM FEDERAL AID

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: FORT BENTON, Mont.

 BODY:
For somebody who works the hard northern land that was first cut by homesteaders' plows less than a century ago, the big harvest of government checks usually happens in the fall -- $40,000 for just being a farmer, another $40,000 for emergencies like bad market conditions, more than $100,000 for not making any money on what is grown, and $50,000 for taking other land out of production.
Good crops or bad, high yields or low -- it hardly matters, the checks roll in from the federal government, the biggest payroll in farm country. By the end of the year, some farmers can receive up to $280,000 simply by having another miserable year of failure. 
 Perhaps never in the history of a nation founded by agrarian self-starters has the federal government propped up rural America to such a degree. This year, the government distributed a record $28 billion in direct payments, accounting for half of all the money made by farmers. In eight states, including Montana, government assistance made up 100 percent of overall farm income.
What these institutionalized bailouts have done, say many farmers who curse the government but take the checks, is strengthen a culture of dependency in a large part of the United States that consistently votes Republican and touts its feisty independence from Washington.
This dependency has only become more entrenched in the four years since Congress passed a farm bill that was supposed to wean food producers off government aid. Direct payments to farmers have tripled since 1996, and food producers who had never taken a significant piece of the aid pie are now getting big chunks of it, from apple farmers in Washington State to rice farmers in California.
"All that farm bill has done is opened the door for people to get bigger and bigger payments from the government," said Mike O'Hara, a wheat farmer whose grandfather homesteaded the Montana prairie just north of this little county seat and who relies on federal subsidies for his farm income. "It's been an absolute disaster."
The funnel of money from the capital to the heartland has created an unusual welfare state in places like Chouteau County, an expanse of slumbering winter wheat on the Montana high plains that slope to the Missouri River. This is one of the premier grain-producing areas in the world. But it is also essentially a ward of the federal government, a slow-fading county of barely 5,000 people that received $51 million in direct assistance this year. Only three farmers in all of Chouteau County do not receive government payouts, according to the Agriculture Department.
"At one time we were fairly independent, but through no fault of our own have become as dependent as anyone in American society on government assistance -- and it's deeply troubling," said Bruce Nelson, a third-generation Montana grain farmer, who just stepped down as head of the Farm Service Agency, which distributes government checks in Montana.
Despite the extraordinary reliance on government payments, these areas are still losing people, jobs and farms, all the things these payments were intended to support. Farmer dependence on federal money is even higher now, in both percentage terms and real dollars, than it was at the depth of the Great Depression.
The departing agriculture secretary, Dan Glickman, says farming has "become largely an income transfer program," with the government underwriting rural businesses and requiring very little in return. Farmers throughout this state, who seem genuinely torn by the disconnect between their ingrained philosophy of independence and their reliance on federal money to make a living, echoed his conclusion in numerous interviews.
There seems to be a gradual realization in farm country that federal subsidies in the United States -- like those in much of Europe -- are not so much about food supply anymore as they are about keeping the least-populated parts of the country afloat. So while he criticizes the size of some of the handouts, Mr. Glickman says that without the government, thousands of farmers and the businesses that depend on them would go bankrupt within a year or two.
The money keeps banks, schools, hospitals and small businesses afloat in counties that are one step short of the grave. But it also provides better than average incomes for farmers who have learned to take advantage of all the federal programs.
Over the last four years, the top 1 percent of farmers in this county -- about 15 farmers -- received an average of $616,000 each from the government. The top 10 percent -- about 150 farmers -- were paid an average of $308,000 per farmer over the last four years. These numbers do not include the record payout for the year 2000.
"It has created some huge dependencies, no doubt about it," said Wiley Good, a Chouteau County grain farmer and businessman. "It's easy to say, All this cash is out there, now what can I do to farm the government."
Mr. Good lives a comfortable life in a big house, travels to Europe on long vacations, and partakes of the various government programs for most of his farm income. He shrugs at the fact that the free enterprise system has virtually disappeared from the farm economy of Montana, the nation's No. 2 farm state by amount of acreage.
"It'd be nice to go to the local grain elevator and sell your stuff for a price close to what it cost you to produce it," Mr. Good said. "But it's just not in the cards."
Though the aid programs go against their market-oriented philosophy, Republicans have been reluctant to criticize the swelling farm aid programs because a majority of the money has been sent to states that traditionally send Republicans to Congress. The farm aid map is less favorable for Democrats. But a handful of crucial swing states that Democrats count on in major election years -- Iowa, Missouri and Illinois among them -- are also among the biggest farm bailout recipients.
Many farmers are going broke or barely getting by. And drought conditions over the last few years have made bad positions precarious in states from Texas to the northern Plains. The average government payout for this county this year is $36,000 -- and the growers say that money barely covers the crop production costs, like fuel, machinery, seed, labor and loan payments.
Nationwide, 1.6 million farmers received an average of more than $13,000 each last year in government money. After Congress raised the cap on one of the bigger farm subsidy programs this year, an individual farmer can get more than $280,000 a year from various payments.
"Virtually every farmer in the country is on the dole in one form or the other," said Clark Williams-Derry, a senior analyst with the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit research organization that has studied farm subsidies.
"It's social engineering with nobody at the switch," Mr. Williams-Derry said.
Even as the amount of money paid to farm counties has soared, restrictions on who can get those funds and how they are supposed to be used do not form a consistent policy, Mr. Glickman said.
"Essentially, the government's role in requiring the farmer to do something in return has been largely eliminated by Congress," Mr. Glickman said.
He added, "It's important enough for this country to keep rural communities going. And while I don't like the large payments going to some farmers -- that's an outright embarrassment -- many of these payments are keeping large sections of rural America from folding up and going down."
What has happened in rural counties like Chouteau completes a full circle, from the creation of farms by government incentive through the Enlarged Homestead Act of 1909 to a period of prosperity and independence in the 1950's and 60's, to the present where government is the only thing keeping people on the old bison grounds of half of Montana.
The homesteads have become sources of export crops. Nearly 90 percent of the wheat grown in Montana is sent overseas. But it faces global competition and a glut. Even countries like Pakistan, once seen as a relief target, are now exporting grain. If the Montana growers were to try and get by in the free market, they would lose about $2 on every bushel of wheat they grow.
Farm policy, in part, has been an effort to eliminate subsidized farmers, providing them with relief as they get into something more profitable. But as Congress has been raising the amount of money paid to failing farmers, many of them are making good profits.
"The general outlook for many of these farms is not good," said Bill Evans, the government's chief liaison in this county. "But they have become dependent on our office, and we don't want that."
Agriculture policy makers say the aid programs have become so big and are often at cross-purposes, that it is unclear exactly what taxpayers are getting for the $28 billion sent to rural counties this year. Some of the biggest payouts, like money given to farmers who agree not to grow crops on a piece of ground for 10 years or more, may actually be encouraging the dismantling of fragile rural economies.
Roger Axtman, the last farm implements dealer left in Chouteau County, says his family-run, three-generation-old business is slowly going broke even as the millions in farm aid courses through his county.
"We're taking very good ground out of production and paying people to do it," Mr. Axtman said. "So where we used to have a hundred regular clients, now we have sixty. And what do they do with the money? Well, some of them buy the Winnebago and hit road. They don't buy a new tractor from me."
Even as federal money to this county has reached record levels, farm employment has continued to fall -- declining by 32 percent, more than twice the rate of population decline, over the last 20 years.
But Mr. Axtman says that without the federal payments his business would fold, and with it would go most of the human attachments to Chouteau County, a place that calls itself "the birthplace of Montana" because of its proximity to the ancient highway of the big Missouri River.
"These farmers sit here and they tell me how much they hate taking the cheese checks from the government," Mr. Axtman said. "They're honest farm people, the majority of them, but they don't know what else to do."
Other payouts, like the money from programs in which individual farmers can receive up to $150,000 a year when commodity prices are particularly low, are disproportionately weighted toward the bigger operations, contributing to the loss of small family farms, according to taxpayer groups that have done independent analyses of farm programs.
But one thing that the people who grow the food and the people who write the checks agree on is that if the government were to suddenly disengage itself from its monumental entanglement with rural America, upwards of half of the 1.6 million farmers in the United States who now receive some form of federal assistance would go out of business.
Montana, for example, ranks nearly last in average annual pay and near the top in the percentage of people living below the poverty level. If the $500 million annual government farm payroll were taken out of the state, the Big Sky country could fall into bleak times rivaling those of the Great Depression, some analysts say.
"So maybe it is time we had some intellectual honesty in farm policy," Mr. Glickman said. "Nobody talked about this during the presidential election. And you rarely hear it spoken in Congress. But these farm payments have become truly rural support payments."

HEADLINE: East Village Journal;
Echoes of the Left Bank, but on the East River

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
Christophe Croquelois was one Parisian who liked to think he knew the world party circuit. He had danced at the full moon raves in Ko Phangan in Thailand and Goa in India. He had worked the clubs in Montmartre and in Miami.
But on this Friday night, he was indulging in a different kind of night life, one that could be found only where the East Village meets the Lower East Side, he said. Here he was, watching a Parisian friend spin house music at Le Pere Pinard, the restaurant Mr. Croquelois started last year with another French friend. 
 It was a sound from two worlds, because the D.J., Benjamin Deffe, had spent years in the city tuning his Gallic ear to funk and hip-hop and soul. "It's really New York style, really garage," said Mr. Croquelois, 28.
Among the diners, there was much French being spoken and a lot of red wine being sipped and more lighting of cigarettes than at a chain smokers' convention.
"I think you start to see some French people in this area now, like never before," said Mr. Croquelois, who moved to the East Village with his girlfriend in 1998. "It's never cool when it's too much. But I'm sure they love this neighborhood. They love this. The French are fashion people a little bit."
And if you take Mr. Croquelois at his word, what appears to be fashionable for some of the French these days is to pack up one's life in Paris and relocate to the East Village. Young French visitors began settling in the neighborhood about five years ago in search of cheap rents and la vie de boheme. That has intensified in the last couple of years, with so many French people coming now that some of the pioneers say they are getting sick of the neighborhood.
In some ways, many of the settlers are at least superficially reminiscent of, if not exactly as blatantly intellectual as, the American expatriate artists who caroused their way around the Left Bank of Paris in the 1920's. They sit around cafes and talk about the old arrondissement. They attend one another's gallery openings. They go to local clubs and stumble home in the morning and wait for the next weekend when the new hot D.J. from Paris is supposed to fly in. If Paris was a moveable feast, as Ernest Hemingway once asserted, it is now downtown Manhattan that is serving the main course.
Of course, French hipsters have been coming to New York for many years, especially as the star of Paris dimmed in the ever-shifting constellation of the international arts scene. But only recently, as gentrification has swept the East Village, have such large numbers put down roots here.
"I thought I was being original when I moved to this neighborhood, but then I realized there are so many French people here now," said Eve Hernandez, 32, an aspiring playwright who quit her management consulting job in Paris in 1996 and left her boyfriend to move here. "The East Village comes with some familiar things. It has culture and art that can remind me of Paris and Europe in general."
There are no statistics on how many French live in the neighborhood. But one sign is the proliferation of French-owned or French-themed bistros, bars and cafes that attract throngs of ex-Parisians.
In the last two years, a half-dozen or so have opened off Avenues A and B alone. There is Casimir, the trendy dining spot on Avenue B between Sixth and Seventh Streets, once the site of a Cajun restaurant, that is always packed and always flowing with talk of Paris. Six blocks up, a jazz lounge called Rue B opened this year in a building formerly occupied by a soda warehouse. And on Fifth Street between Avenues A and B, a branch of Le Gamin recently opened next door to the Bouche Bar, down the street from a bistro called Le Tableau.
The French accent can be heard thick and furious at Jules and Leon, both firmly established in Continental dining circles. And at East Village Books, virtually an entire foreign literature shelf is stocked with used French books.
There are those settlers who came on their parents' dime. But like Ms. Hernandez, many of them are struggling writers, musicians or designers who spent their first years here staying up all hours and wondering how to pay for their next meal. In the process, they became enamored of the American entrepreneurial spirit and of a joie de vivre that they say was missing from Paris.
"There's a lot of young French people looking elsewhere for something else," Mr. Croquelois said.
Many of the first ones who came over said they were dropping out of a bourgeois society that was becoming both more impoverished and more conservative. In 1995, the unemployment rate in France hit 12 percent. That same year, a 14-year socialist presidency was toppled by the election of Jacques Chirac, ushering in a wave of right-wing sentiment and anti-immigrant rhetoric.
"There were so many unemployed people, and it was creating an atmosphere of intolerance and close-mindedness," Ms. Hernandez said. "I thought that if I had to stay, I wouldn't like my country anymore."
From 1995 to 1996, there was an almost 40 percent increase in legal French immigrants coming to New York, up to 307, according to statistics from the City Planning Commission. Since then, the number of entering green-card holders has hovered at about 290 per year, according to an agency demographer. But, he added, "our immigration numbers do not capture the actual flow of the French" since most of them enter on nonimmigrant visas.
Karine Duteil, for instance, lived for years in New York on a tourist visa. A struggling sculptor, she went through what she called the typical jobs that French women take: coat checker, waiter, baby sitter, language tutor. She said she had to fly back to Paris every three months to renew her visa, but later got a student visa and married an American lawyer whom she had been tutoring. She moved into his East Village apartment in 1996.
"At first, it was amazing, but now it's not fun anymore," Ms. Duteil, 33, said of the neighborhood. "There are too many French, and they are all white. Four or five years ago, I was the only white woman in the street sometimes."
Ms. Duteil has started artistic projects that take her out of strictly French circles, such as running an art gallery in the South Bronx. But she has also kept one foot in the world of her compatriots. To commemorate Bastille Day in 1995, she and a friend started "Le Francophile," a magazine for expatriates and immigrants in the region, as well as lovers of all things French.
As she ambled from her studio to her community garden on a recent afternoon, she pointed to an apartment building on Seventh Street. Inside lived another French artist, named Virgile. He had recently come to her seeking advice on opening a gallery.
"A lot of French come here to start things," she said. "In France, if you start your own business, it takes weeks. Here, it takes half a day."

HEADLINE: Chinese Pigs Feed a Western Fashion Boom

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN and CRAIG S. SMITH 

 BODY:
Americans are buying animal hides like Hell's Angels. In the first nine months of this year, leather clothing sales were up 71 percent, according to the Leather Apparel Association. Stores from Gucci to Wal-Mart are chock-a-block with skins -- and not just bomber jackets. The Limited's Express has pink and gold metallic leather halter tops, and Ralph Lauren has designed a leather five-pocket jean in red.
What has marked this holiday season more than the color and abundance of leather goods, however, are the incredible shrinking prices. A decade ago, leather was predominantly a luxury product, purchased at boutiques. Today, Old Navy has seamed A-line skirts in olive leather on sale at $39.99. Kmart has stadium jackets at $59.99. Target, the giant discounter, entered the leather market this year with a highly promoted black zip-up coat for $109.99. 
 In Haining, China, a coastal city about 100 miles south of Shanghai, Zhou Zhanghe, a leather wholesaler, has a theory on why America is suddenly awash with inexpensive leather. "There are a lot of pigs in China," he said, chatting in his narrow shop stacked to the ceiling with tanned hides.
Pigs, of course, are not entirely responsible for transforming leather into the mass-market fabric that it is today. There are other important factors, among them an increase in meat consumption in the third world, easing of government labeling guidelines, and the wholesale movement of leather clothing manufacturing into the Far East, where the highly labor-intensive industry can buy workers' time for pennies on the dollar.
Retail prices in the United States are also being depressed because demand, while strong, has nevertheless fallen short of merchants' expectations.
A year ago, Gap Inc.'s "Everyone in Leather" promotional campaign, featuring sexy but wholesome youths in T-shirts and leather pants, was so successful that sales clerks in Manhattan reported women bursting into tears when stores ran out of stock.
Gap's foray was key to sparking the mass-market craze for leather, but also created too much of a hot thing as everyone jumped on the bandwagon. This year, Gap itself -- admitting it overordered -- slashed prices on its multicolor leather goods well before Christmas. Leather is being marked down substantially by department store and other speciality stores, too. Further cuts will probably come after Christmas.
"Put it this way," said Jack Dougherty, a Gap company spokesman. "Pretty much everyone who wants to be in leather is there already."
But Chinese pigs do figure in to perhaps the biggest contributor to lower leather prices: new technologies that can metamorphose cheap animal hides -- scratched cow, pocked sheep or porous pig -- into supple leather.
"The chief advantage of technology is that it improves finishes, making them softer and softer, so that leather that was only good for shoes is now pliable for clothing," explained Joel Waller, chief executive of Wilsons the Leather Experts, the leading American retailer of leather.
"The tannery people are magicians," said Hans Nutzhorn, who exports Chinese-made leather garments to Europe. "They can do anything with the right chemicals."
Increasingly sophisticated stamping and printing technology also allows tanneries to make low-quality skin from farm animals look like scaly snakeskin or crocodile -- or whatever manufacturers want. Wilsons, for example, used pig skin for its fall line of "python" blazers.
"As an extreme example, I can take a piece of leather and make it look like corduroy or over-dyed denim, and it is very economical," Mr. Waller said.
Very, very economical. Skins can be split into three layers, according to Mr. Zhou, and tanneries can now treat even the cheapest, innermost layer to give it a finish close enough to fine cowhide to fool most untutored buyers.
The inner layer of pig -- the "split-grain" leather once reserved for shoe sole inserts -- is now a staple for outerwear. It can cost as little as 30 cents a square foot, or a little more than $10 for enough to make a man's jacket. Skins account for roughly 70 percent of the cost of leather goods, according to Mr. Waller and other industry experts.
Previously, the Federal Trade Commission allowed only the most durable outer layer -- called top grain -- to be labeled leather in America, but it waived those rules in 1996.
Of course, most consumers, thrilled to get ostrich print boots at bargain prices, probably do not care if they are really wearing the inner hide of pig, the rest of which most likely ended up in a string of Chinese sausage. But even if they did, there is not much they could learn.
Under the F.T.C's labeling guidelines, anything made of animal hide -- including, say, gopher hide or rat hide -- can be labeled "genuine leather," according to Susan Arthur, a staff lawyer who headed up the last review of the guidelines in 1996. That might give a shopper pause over the really inexpensive items.
The Commerce Department has regulations banning the import of skins from endangered species and house cats and dogs; the law rules banning the use of domestic mammals became law only last month, inspired, in part, by revelations in 1998 that cat and dog fur were being used on coats sold, unknowingly, by Burlington Coat Factory.
The government's main aim in regulating labels is to prevent consumer fraud. When leather has been embossed to look like alligator, for example, the label has to say as much.
However, even within these bounds there is ample room for interpretation. Lambskin has historically been prized as a fine quality leather, but much of what comes out of China labeled as such is actually a bit longer in the tooth. The United States tariff code, which defines calves by size, makes no distinction between the skin of a lamb or an adult sheep; both can legally be called lambskin.
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA, has tried to create consumer outrage about the growth of leather imports from countries like China, where they say animals are treated particularly inhumanely.
This fall the animal rights organization began a campaign against Express. And in April, PETA was able to convince Gap to stop buying its animal hides from China and India by showing them videos of cows as well as dogs being skinned alive. Gap now manufactures clothing in China, but says it gets most of its hides from tanneries in Italy. On Thanksgiving, PETA started a television ad campaign called "Cows are Cool," meant to raise awareness of all animal cruelty related to leather.
Perhaps out of concern that a backlash could emerge if enough consumers learned the source of their leather, many of the large chain retailers and manufacturers of leather products tend to offer more rather than less information.
The Gap says that the "vast majority" of its leather products are made from cow -- though shoppers have to guess themselves, because all of its products are labeled simply "genuine leather." Kmart's low-priced stadium jacket is a pig product, but its label, too, reads leather. Wilson's says that its sales clerks have been schooled in the different types of skin in each garment, but customers must ask if they want to find out.
Though retailers may be fuzzy about the origins of the skins they sell, the Chinese are more than willing to brag about having found a new export market for a product previously used only as a food (boiled, roasted or fried).
"If it's cheap and it comes from China, then it's probably pigskin," said Zhang Xuhua, a China Leather Industry Association official.
Leather clothing imports from China have almost tripled since 1992, according to the Commerce Department, accounting for roughly two-thirds of imported leather. Imported leather goods account for more than 95 percent of the entire American leather apparel market.
According to the Chinese trade group, about half of the leather garments China ships to the United States are made of pigskin. Another third are made of Chinese sheepskin, and most of the rest are cowhide imported from the United States or South America and tanned in China.
The lowest-quality cowhides, scratched by brushes or pocked with insect bites, are buffed and made into jackets with the "distressed" look especially popular in the West.
Mike Woo, a young salesman at the Haining Import and Export Corporation, said he sold lots of pigskin garments labeled simply as leather to Wilson's -- but that American discount chains tend to buy their jackets for even less.
"Kmart and Wal-Mart go further inland to look for the cheapest labor and the cheapest leather," he said. "We can't even do it that cheap."

HEADLINE: Lily Carlson Is Dead at 85; One of First Models for Ford

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Lily Carlson Schulte, one of the first models hired by the Ford agency and a favorite subject of photographers like Irving Penn and Richard Avedon, died on Dec. 14 at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 85.
"It's hard to explain to you what a star she was," said Eileen Ford, the agency's co-founder. "Every great photographer wanted to work with her. In this business, there certainly has never been a bigger star. " 
 Lily Carlson, as she was known professionally, stood 5 feet 11 inches tall. She stood out in a crowd, even of other models. She is the woman in the center of Irving Penn's famous photograph of the 12 most photographed women of the 1940's. She wears a white gown with a billowing skirt and gazes slightly upward.
Her face was more famous than her name, perhaps, but she was always famous to her photographers. George Hurrell, a distinguished fashion photographer, called her one of the three most beautiful women he ever photographed. The others were Joan Crawford and his wife, Phyllis Bounds, also a model. He called Miss Carlson "perhaps the best fashion model in the entire country."
In an interview in Cover Girl magazine, Mr. Hurrell said that some models are wooden and tend to simper, but that Miss Carlson was alive and vital. "Equally good in sports clothes or evening gowns," he said.
She came along just as the whole business of modeling changed, Mrs. Ford said. In the immediate post-war years, models became the elegant emblems of a newly booming haute couture fashion business, perhaps epitomized by Christian Dior's romantic New Look of 1947. There was an explosion of photography, and models like Lisa Fonssagrives, famously photographed at the Eiffel Tower with her skirts billowing, elevated the model's role far beyond that of simple clothes hangers.
"It was like a land rush," said Mrs. Ford, who with her husband, Jerry, opened Ford Models in 1946. They had hired only a couple of lesser-known models when Miss Carlson agreed to sign on. "She was our seal of approval, the first really, really great star," said Mrs. Ford. (Her agency agreed this month to be bought by Magnum Sports Entertainment.)
Lily Viola Carlson was born in Sheridan, Iowa, on April 4, 1915, Easter Sunday. "It was Bunny or Lily," said her daughter Christina Fleur, "and they called her Lily. Thank goodness."
Her father was a Lutheran minister who frequently conducted services in Swedish. Her son, William Dowell, said she hated both the plains and the plainness of the Midwest, greedily devouring The New Yorker magazine as if it were "an escape manual."
She attended the Art Institute of Chicago, specializing in watercolors and photography. She followed a fellow student, Julian C. Dowell, to New York and married him. Their honeymoon consisted of a nickel ride on the Fifth Avenue bus. They and their friends would hold spaghetti parties to which each person would bring a can of pasta to throw into the kettle.
With Mr. Dowell unemployed at the depths of the Depression, his wife looked in the mirror and saw what just might be a bankable asset. She flipped through a directory of fashion photographers and under the B's, spotted one named Erwin Blumenfeld. He shot some test pictures and sent them to Vogue, and Miss Carlson went to work.
"It was so amazing," she later told Cover Girl. "The first 28 days, I made $1,500," the equivalent of about $13,500 in today's money.
Mr. Blumenfeld said this was not all good news. He told her the pressures of the stratospheric career she could easily have might damage her marriage. Mr. Dowell, who envisioned her as a movie star, said she must do it, their son, William, said.
Soon they were living in different worlds. She was a regular at the Stork Club in a veiled hat and white gloves, while he found work as an art director. He moved to the suburbs, she stayed in Manhattan, and they were divorced.
She had not started modeling until her late 20's, but she quickly became a regular in both the fashion and general press. A picture in Life showed her striding down Park Avenue carrying a hatbox, then "the symbol of the model's trade," as the caption read. An Avedon photograph in Vogue showed her "wrapped in a cloud of red fox against black."
She sometimes veered beyond fashion, once escorting a sheep around the country for a wool dealers' group. She was the Drene Girl, showing off her voluminous hair for Drene shampoo.
To enliven her expression, she always conversed with an imaginary friend as she was photographed. "That way I just naturally warm up," she said.
Cover Girl reported, "Photographers with whom Lily works tease her about this. 'Well, Lily,' they say, 'who will it be today . . . Julian, Joe or John?' " Mrs. Ford said this is wrong. It was always John. She has no idea why.
In 1955, Miss Carlson married David A. Schulte, a financier who advised presidents on employment policy and still serves on the New York City Board of Corrections. Her new affluence allowed her to leave modeling and spend more time taking pictures herself. Her work appeared in Life, Look and other magazines.
The two would have been jet-setters had they not preferred the staterooms of luxury ocean liners. They spent almost half their lives in Europe, always staying at the Cipriani in Venice, the Ritz in Paris. At the Ritz several years ago, Mrs. Schulte spotted Richard Avedon and shyly approached to ask if he remembered her. He did.
But her son described a woman who furnished her elegant apartment with things she bought at flea markets.
In addition to her husband, her son and her daughter Christina, she is survived by another daughter, Holly Schulte Ellison, and four grandchildren, all of Manhattan.
At her funeral on Monday, there were mountains of white roses and white lilies. Ms. Fleur told of the time at age 8 or 9 that she was caught with her mother in a downpour. Yellow cabs were whizzing by, but you would have had a better chance of catching a snowball somewhere very hot. Suddenly, a cab screeched to a stop directly in front of Miss Carlson.
"I saw you standing there," the driver said.

HEADLINE: Chen Zhen, 45, Whose Artwork Explored Complexities of China

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
Chen Zhen, a Chinese-born conceptual artist and sculptor who lived in Paris and became a highly visible international art figure during the 1990's, culminating with an appearance at the 1999 Venice Biennale, died on Dec. 13 in Paris. He was 45.
The cause was cancer, reported Mr. Chen's New York gallery, Deitch Projects in SoHo. 
 Mr. Chen was born in 1955 in Shanghai to a family of physicians. The family was sent to the countryside for "re-education" during the height of the Cultural Revolution.
In 1973, he graduated from the Shanghai Fine Arts and Crafts School, and in 1978, he graduated from the Shanghai Drama Institute, where he specialized in stage design.
Eager to work in the context of international art, he left for Paris in 1986. Without any contacts there or any knowledge of French, he supported himself for three years as a sidewalk portrait artist. He enrolled in the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Beaux-Arts where he later became a visiting artist.
A solo show in 1990 in Paris was followed by more than 30 others during the next decade in Europe, the United States and Asia. He first appeared in New York in a group show at the Asian-American Arts Center in Chinatown in 1991, then in a solo show organized by Alice Yang at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo in 1994.
His debut at Deitch Projects in 1996 focused on a multimedia sculpture titled "Daily Incantations." The work was based on revered ancient Chinese forms: sets of bronze bells associated with ancestor-cult rituals and a ruling elite. In his piece, however, the bells were replaced by wooden chamber pots, utilitarian objects already obsolete in modern China. In the center was a satellitelike globe made of old television sets, computers and radios, from which came recorded voices reading from Mao's "Little Red Book."
Like all of his work, "Daily Incantations" blended critical and nostalgic views of China's past and present, and made references to Western culture and a global economy. It won a prize at the Kwangju Biennale in South Korea in 1997 and was included in the Carnegie International 1999/2000 in Pittsburgh.
A survey of Mr. Chen's work was organized by the Galleria Civica d'Arte Moderna e Contemporanea in Turin, Italy, last spring. He was working on a public sculpture for the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris at the time of his death. His work was included in several international exhibitions, and he had a second Deitch Projects exhibition this year.
Mr. Chen is survived by his wife, Xu Min, and a son, Chen Bo, both of Paris; his mother, Xu Manyin, his father, Chen Jialun, and a brother, Chen Zhu, all of Shanghai; and a sister, Jian Chen Bristol, of Vancouver, British Columbia.

HEADLINE: Hartford Feels Science Center Can Fix Its Economic Picture

BYLINE: By PAUL ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Dec. 21

 BODY:
For years, in the hearts and minds of everyone who had ever pondered the best way to breathe some life back into this depressed capital city, the solution was neatly packaged into two words: football stadium. But now, those words seem to have been replaced by others that state officials believe stand for an even better idea: science and technology.
After considering several kinds of football stadiums, from a dome downtown for the University of Connecticut to a 50,000-seat coliseum custom-made for the New England Patriots, a state-appointed redevelopment group has decided to bank instead on the digital age. 
 The group announced recently that it planned to build a multimillion-dollar science and technology-based attraction, similar to a museum with interactive computer displays, to attract visitors from across the region.
The announcement by the Capital City Economic Development Authority, which was created by the State General Assembly to lead Hartford's redevelopment, ended years of political indecision about what, exactly, to build and where.
Two years ago, for example, Gov. John G. Rowland, legislators and business leaders discussed building a domed stadium to anchor the project, known as Adriaen's Landing, that envisioned turning unused downtown land into a gleaming hotel and convention center.
Then, last year, Mr. Rowland began high-stakes negotiations with Robert Kraft, the team owner, to move the National Football League's Patriots from Massachusetts to Hartford. To entice the team, state officials offered to build a new stadium near downtown, on the banks of the Connecticut River.
Mr. Kraft, however, eventually scuttled the deal, leaving the Adriaen's Landing project, worth $771 million, still without a high-profile regional attraction.
The new plan for a science and technology-based interactive museum is intended to fill that void, said Brendan Fox, the executive director of the development authority.
"This evolution has been a positive," Mr. Fox said, noting that a football stadium for the university's team will still be built across the river in East Hartford.
"What we've opened up here is some breathing room for the convention center," he added. "We want to generate a fair amount of traffic down here. I think we will."
Plans for the science and technology museum are still vague, Mr. Fox said, but it may include a wide-screen theater, a dinosaur exhibit and interactive computer exhibits with the Connecticut River as their theme.
The concept, which consultants to the redevelopment authority estimated could draw roughly 500,000 people a year, is meant to attract visitors from New York to Boston, and turn Hartford into something it has never really been in its 364-year history -- a tourist destination.
Governor Rowland's press secretary, Dean Pagani, said Wednesday that Mr. Rowland believed the science-based attraction would be good for Hartford.
"What he does like about the proposal is that it tries to tie in the science, art and history attractions that are already in the area," he said, like the Wadsworth Atheneum, the Mark Twain House and the Old State House, three of Hartford's most visible cultural attractions. "That could make it a very dynamic part of downtown Hartford."
Beyond the convention center, hotel and the science-based attraction, Adriaen's Landing, named after Adriaen Block, a Dutch explorer who sailed up the Connecticut River in 1614, also includes space for shops, restaurants and new housing, as well as renovations to several parks and plazas.

Venus Williams May Raise the Bar Even More

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
THE slogan has a ring to it, though the marketers at Reebok surely didn't have to rack their brains to come up with "Defy Convention" for Venus Williams. She has authored her own campaign in rising from the urban courts in Compton, Calif., to being the hottest tennis player and female athlete in the world.
But now, as the richest pitchwoman athlete ever, can she continue to defy convention and the belief that corporate America prefers its transcendent and crossover clients to play it stultifying and safe? 
 We know the history here, how Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods positioned themselves as the standard-bearers of endorsement earnings.
Beyond the protection of the rights to his likeness and name, Jordan has seldom if ever confronted an issue that motivated him to move from the middle. As for Woods, he has worked assiduously off the Michael model, staying far away from issues political and especially racial -- no small feat, in the lily-white world of golf.
"Tiger and Michael have done a lot of good things, but there are places where people would have liked to see them go that they haven't," Kevin Davis, agent for the Williams sisters, said at the news conference last week to announce Venus's five-year, $40 million Reebok deal. "But I think you'll see Venus 'out there' more than those two other gentlemen."
As a 20-year-old woman who is crashing through barriers, perhaps even more than as an African-American turning a country club sport upside down, Venus is already ahead in the social activist game. The case and cause for female athletes is continuing, and grand, and the announcement of Williams's power-lifting the endorsement-earnings bar was applauded by Billie Jean King (via telephone) and Donna Lopiano of the Women's Sports Foundation (in person).
"The hardest barrier to break is the economic one," said Lopiano, the foundation's executive director. "It's one thing to let girls play. It's a whole other thing to share money with them."
To this point in their short careers, Venus and her not-so-little sister Serena have been simultaneously enterprising and edgy, nonconformists to the core. Last year, when the women's Tour stopped in South Carolina during the Confederate flag at the Statehouse controversy, Serena was alone in refusing to play.
Venus, injured at the time, later indicated that she would not have played, either.
The Williams sisters have also been selective playing nonoffensive events, and have been criticized by reporters and players for acting as if the Tour is a hotel to check into as they please. Yet why argue with their more diverse lifestyle when fashion school has helped produced a deal that will allow Venus to design her own brand of tennis wear?
When someone asked if the big money would force her to become more of a Tour drone, Venus deflected the question by saying she would play as much as she could. But as she and Serena, who grace the cover of Elle magazine this month, undergo the Madison Avenue makeover, how long can they continue to be Richard and Oracene's iconoclast kids?
"I know a lot of agents tell their clients to be careful, to stay away from controversy," Lopiano said. "As role models, like it or not, that's the worst mistake they could make. In the long run, you can only win by speaking out against social injustice."
Lopiano's point was that Jordan and Woods, pillars of Nike, may be representative of that particular company and their own conservative values, and that their way is not the way it has to be to maintain a high commercial profile.
When Jordan several years ago rejected calls for him to endorse Harvey Gantt, a Democrat running for Jesse Helms's North Carolina Senate seat by saying, "Republicans buy shoes, too," that was his own marketing strategy, and a shortsighted one at that.
Gone from the stage of championship-winning shots, Jordan now seems to have diminished appeal, beyond the small ownership stake and largely absentee front-office position he holds with the Washington Wizards.
So badly have matters deteriorated with that team, Jordan was back to revising history last week, assuring all those wondering where his golden touch has gone that he would still be winning titles if the Bulls hadn't made him retire.
In stark contrast, Magic Johnson, who lost all of his endorsements after contracting the virus that causes AIDS, is defining popularity in new entrepreneurial ways, especially in the inner city. He has been the point man for eye-opening development and the creation of jobs. The Magic model, one to be studied by superstar athletes, has been to teach corporate America that it needed him more than he needed it.
"Money doesn't change some people," Davis said, arguing that Venus and Serena will continue to defy convention.
We weren't talking about foundations; many star athletes are charitable, but few, if any, are the stand-up people they have the power to be. Most have wanted to Be Like Mike. Here's hoping that the newest women's marketing champ builds a model of her own and doesn't sell out.

HEADLINE: REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK;
Bush Waits, Politely, to Undo What Clinton Has Done

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Dec. 23

 BODY:
By road, it's a little more than 1,500 miles between the Governor's Mansion here and the White House. That's too far to spit.
Mere distance, however, is not stopping anyone from trying. 
 Just before they pack their bags, President Clinton's aides are taking one last shot at creating an America in their image -- churning out new emission rules for cars and trucks, reviewing last-minute authorizations for national monuments, putting the final touches on Mr. Clinton's effort to make sure that development stops in roadless areas of national forests.
All this has left the Bush folks fuming, because they know -- or their lawyers are telling them -- that the rules cannot be wiped out at the stroke of a pen. There must be hearings and committees. Mr. Clinton's chief of staff, John D. Podesta, whose passion is environmentalism, noted this fact a year ago when he stood atop a Virginia mountain with Mr. Clinton, who was announcing his plan to save millions of acres of federal land from the intrusion of new logging roads.
"Reversing this kind of stuff," Mr. Podesta said at the time, "is politically difficult, and a bureaucratic nightmare."
President-elect George W. Bush is going out of his way not to pick a fight, telling everyone that as long as Mr. Clinton is president, he should do "what he's got to do," and when Mr. Bush moves in, he will worry about it then.
"There's going to be a lot of opportunities, obviously, during the transition for me and the vice president or any of my designees to look backwards, but we're not going to do that," Mr. Bush said on Friday. "Our job is to -- once I'm sworn in and these members of my cabinet are sworn in -- is to look forward, is to think about the future."
But his spokesman, Ari Fleischer, told reporters that executive orders might be undone with reverse executive orders, and "regulations can be undone through regulation." And of course, Mr. Bush's greatest weapon is also Washington's oldest art: footdragging.
Not all the barbs, however, are coming from the White House. Mr. Bush arched his eyebrows more than once when describing Senator John Ashcroft's qualifications for attorney general. Mr. Bush stretched out the word "in-teg-rity" more than once, to let it settle in. He worked the facial expressions again when he suggested Mr. Ashcroft's Justice Department would "follow the truth."
But the first real conflict between the Clintonites and the Bushies may have nothing to do with forests or justice. It will focus on license plates -- the plates on the presidential limousine.
Mr. Clinton this week authorized the placement of the District of Columbia's new plate, with the slogan "Taxation without Representation," on the presidential limousine. The plate was created by the city to protest the fact that residents are not represented by a voting member of Congress. Republican sympathies for the District are limited; after all, the District is a Democratic bastion and gave Al Gore 85 percent of its vote. With the Senate split 50-50, Republicans are not terribly interested in statehood for the District, which would certainly add two Democrats to the upper body. Jake Siewert, the White House press secretary, insisted that the president was making his own statement, and that the next president was free to put anything on his car that he liked. "We're not tying anyone's hands," Mr. Siewert told reporters. "Screwdrivers are a dime a dozen."
 
Whose Recession?
The backbiting has been fiercest over what kind of economy Mr. Bush is inheriting. When Mr. Clinton's troops arrived in 1993, they went to some lengths to describe the "mess" that George H. W. Bush had left them, to make any recovery sound all the grander. What goes around comes around.
Vice President-elect Dick Cheney started it, talking about how the country might be slipping into recession. Mr. Bush picked up the theme, then sat in the Oval Office the other day while Mr. Clinton recited the opinions of 49 of 50 leading economists who think growth next year will be around 2.5 percent -- nothing to write home about, but hardly a recession.
No sooner was Mr. Bush finished with the tour of his new home than Gene Sperling, head of the National Economic Council (an institution Mr. Bush may kill off or reinvent), started telling reporters about the danger of undermining confidence in the economy by talking it down. Mr. Bush's aides, he said, were wrong on the facts, and unwise as they talked to the markets. Mr. Bush pulled back a bit on Friday.
"I keep hearing talks about, you know, well, this is an administration that is trying to talk down the economy," he said. "That's foolish talk. All of us in the Bush administration will want the economy to be strong. But there are some clear warning signs, warning signs that will require what we believe is important action in the halls of Congress, such as tax relief."
Most important, Mr. Bush appears to have learned early a lesson Mr. Clinton learned the hard way: Never, ever talk about whether you favor a strong dollar or a weak dollar. Mr. Clinton once opined about exchanged rates a little more than a year into his presidency, and touched off a mini-panic among currency traders and presidential aides. Mr. Bush, asked about the dollar on Friday, just ignored the question -- either because he knew enough not to answer, or not enough to know how to answer.
 
Lots of Fish. No Chad.
After all that's happened over the last month, you might think that the last place Mr. Bush wanted to go for relaxation was Florida.
You would be wrong.
On Tuesday, Mr. Bush and his family will head to Boca Grande, an island off the Florida coast known for fishing, golfing, wealthy winter residents -- and no recounts.
 
Truly Domestic Policy
With the long election and post-election battle over, Mr. Bush's staff can now focus on the big questions for January. A new approach to ousting Saddam? How about some innovative reforms for Medicare? "First things first," one of Mr. Bush's most senior advisers said this week. "I need a place to live. Warmer than a tent on Lafayette Park. Cheaper than a Victorian in Cleveland Park," one of the city's most tony neighborhoods. It's not easy. The rental market in Washington is tighter than ever. Whatever else happened during Mr. Clinton's tenure in Washington, home prices soared.
So now when Mr. Bush's aides complain about Washington, they're not talking about the city that overregulates, that intrudes in the life of the citizenry and sees their death as another opportunity to tax. Instead, they are complaining that the place is too expensive for anyone on a government salary.
It has clearly affected the Bush camp's internal discussions. One longtime Washingtonian discussed this week for a senior national security job joked that his main qualification was that "I already have a house." Then there is Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's political mastermind, who lives on a lovely piece of property in Austin that he bought for a pittance 30 years ago, and that he plans to keep because nothing in Washington is forever.
As everyone waited for Mr. Bush to name Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Mr. Rove was deep in discussions with the press corps. He was asking about their neighborhoods.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Canadiens Showing Some Tarnish

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE

DATELINE: MONTREAL, Dec. 22

 BODY:
In the glorious 91 years of the Montreal Canadiens, few days were more humbling than last Monday. In the afternoon, the Molson brewery announced in a cryptic news release that it had abandoned its target date of Dec. 31 to sell the hockey team. Molson said it would need "the time necessary to conclude a deal that is in the best interests of our shareholders and our fans."
In the early evening, a local television station reported that an American investor, Jonathan Ledecky, a part owner of the Washington Capitals, had offered to pay about $65 million in American money for 80 percent of the Canadiens, one of the world's most famous sports franchises. The offer made jaws drop. Wasn't the team valued at $191 million? Could the Canadiens be worth less than half of what many people thought? 
 Later that night, before thousands of empty seats in the 21,273-seat Molson Center, the Canadiens were defeated, 2-0, by the Columbus Blue Jackets, an expansion team. The Canadiens have won the Stanley Cup 24 times, including once before the National Hockey League was established back in 1917 in a Montreal hotel. The result Monday dropped the Canadiens to 30th place in the 30-team league.
Early in the game, Martin Rucinsky, Montreal's leading scorer, injured his knee seriously when he crashed into the boards after missing a check. The new coach, Michel Therrien, punched a wall as he walked to the dressing room. After the game, Therrien wore bandages on his bruised and bloodied fingers. When someone asked him how he felt, Therrien said: "Frustrated."
Around this city and the N.H.L., the frustration with the Canadiens is turning to astonishment. They last won the championship in 1993. Since then, the city's two most important hockey-related events have been the closing in 1996 of the Forum, the team's "temple of hockey," and the funeral last spring of Maurice (Rocket) Richard, the star of the mid-20th century who personified the Canadiens' hallowed history.
"We're taking a beating," Sheldon Souray, a Canadiens defenseman, said. "Obviously, it's not fun. Around the N.H.L., around the world, the Montreal Canadiens are known for history, for pride and for tradition. We're like the Yankees, one of the best teams in sports. It's hard when you are fighting for last place. If you play in Carolina, you can pull wool over people's eyes. In Montreal, you're not fooling anyone."
He spoke in a dressing room decorated with pictures of former Canadiens heroes, their faces like a silent jury gazing over the shoulders of the current athletes. A larger photograph of the Rocket in uniform adorns the north side of the outer wall of the Molson Center. Wearing the familiar "CH" logo, Richard looks over the city, toward snow-covered Mount Royal.
In this classic pose, his dark eyes burn brightly, like coals in the winter night. Shortly before the Canadiens' game with Nashville on Thursday, scalpers on the sidewalk beneath Richard's picture jostled each other to unload their tickets. A ticket with a face value of $74.77 went for $20. Under current circumstances, Richard's face could be construed to look startled, as if wondering what had happened to his team.
 
Poor Hockey Decisions
The answers are many. If the Canadiens miss the playoffs for the third consecutive season, it will be the first time that has happened since the early 1920's. In 24 seasons, from 1956 to 1979, the Canadiens won the cup 15 times. Since then, they have won it only twice and the franchise has declined amid undercurrents of economics, politics and sociology.
The Canadiens have drafted poorly for the last decade and have traded unwisely. They have been slow to tap the stream of European talent. To replace the Forum, they built a new arena, the Molson Center, which is too large, is dark on most nonhockey nights and is saddled with a local tax burden of $10.6 million a year in Canadian dollars.
Pierre Boivin, named president of the team 15 months ago, said, "It's not as bad as it looks on the outside." Boivin acknowledged that there had been "some very bad hockey decisions," and that the team was now "at the bottom of the cycle." But he also said that the franchise is fundamentally sound, even though the Canadiens will lose between $5 million and $10 million this season and season-ticket sales have dropped from 14,500 to 12,000.
"The press loves to dwell on the negative, so when you're 30th in the league, you've got no leg to stand on," Boivin said in his big corner office at the Molson Center. Gesturing toward a binder on a table, Boivin said, "There's a 134-page investor presentation that says there is a bright future for this organization."
Boivin refused to discuss the television report that suggested the team's market value was significantly less than previously thought.
Molson is selling the team and the new arena because the synergy between sports and breweries is not what it used to be; Molson's new management wants to concentrate on its core business -- beer. Many hockey franchises have changed hands in recent seasons, some more than once. The drift in sports ownership is toward multimedia companies, and some have explored buying the Canadiens. But there are conditions peculiar to this city and this country that complicate such a sale.
N.H.L. players are paid in American dollars, and with the Canadian dollar worth about 65 cents in American currency, Canadian team owners are paying more for their players than American owners. Although owning a team and an arena is usually advantageous, this is not necessarily so for the Canadiens. The arena was constructed with private funds for $265 million in Canadian money. When American teams need new arenas, they often use threats to leave town to obtain public subsidies and tax breaks.
The Canadiens, so much a part of the culture, did not make such threats. "Oklahoma City Canadiens just wouldn't fly, would it?" said John Paul Macdonald, Molson's vice president for corporate affairs.
"It's difficult enough to turn a profit in Canada under present economic conditions," Macdonald said. "With the taxes, forget about it."
The hockey team is trying to reduce its tax burden in a court proceeding. "We have worked very hard, talking with people in the mayor's office, talking with the provincial government," Macdonald said. "We see no sign."
But Mayor Pierre Bourque said the taxes come from the high value placed on the building by the owners. "I have to send my bills according to the values," Bourque said. "This is not my problem. We hope to find a solution."
Since Quebec's "Quiet Revolution," the French-Canadian population has been politically and economically ascendant, while the English-Canadian population has lost power. Many Anglos, as they are called, have left the province, some taking their businesses and money with them. Some Montrealers say this tribal friction -- with its sign laws favoring French and its occasional referendums about separating from Canada -- is a factor in the decline of Montreal's economy and has even contributed to the hockey team's troubles.
Mayor Bourque said emphatically that there was no correlation between the decline of the team and the struggles of the city. But he also maintained that, in a much broader way, the team and the city were inextricably linked.
"There is a very strong feeling of belonging with the Canadiens and Montreal," he said. "They are part of the soul of the city. It is a love story. You cannot separate them. What they need are another one or two French-Canadian stars like they used to have, like Rocket Richard, Guy Lafleur, Jean Beliveau, Yvan Cournoyer. They could lift the team back on its feet."
This is not as easy as it once was. Until 1967, the N.H.L. was a six-team league made up almost exclusively of athletes from Canada. The league president, Clarence Campbell, lived in Montreal and the amateur draft was often held here. A league bylaw gave the Canadiens first choice of the best players from Quebec. So stars like Richard, Beliveau and Jacques Plante were essentially born to the team. Since that era, the number of N.H.L. teams has multiplied and all players are subject to a universal draft. Nearly half of the players are Americans and Europeans.
 
French-Canadian Pride
But Montreal fans still want their French-Canadian stars, more now than ever. "It is important to have Francophone players for people to identify with the franchise," said Boivin, the 47-year-old team president who grew up in Montreal. "This is the only franchise that needs to worry about this. It's true in players. It's true in management. It's true in strategy. We need to think biculturally all the time. It's a fact of life in Quebec."
This fact restricts top management. Because a general manager or coach of the Canadiens must be bilingual, at least 75 percent of all candidates are immediately eliminated, no matter their hockey qualifications. The Canadiens won their last cup under General Manager Serge Savard and Coach Jacques Demers. They faltered under General Manager Rejean Houle and two coaches, Mario Tremblay and Alain Vigneault. The new leaders, General Manager Andre Savard and Coach Therrien, are Francophones, as were the others.
"It makes it more difficult, no question about it," Boivin said of this unusual consideration. But, he added, "a lot of great hockey minds have come from Quebec."
This hockey ethnocentricity is studied in local universities. Professor Anouk Belanger, who teaches sociology, popular culture and media at Concordia University, said people still assess the political implications of the Richard Riot of 1955. On that night, N.H.L. President Campbell was attacked in the Forum and fans raged through the streets after Campbell suspended the Rocket for roughing up an official. "That emboldened the Quiet Revolution," she said. "A lot of people called that event a turning point."
Boivin said that the threat of the province separating from Canada had caused a lot of capital to flee Montreal and had inhibited the city's ability to attract new capital. But in the last five years, he said, there has been a resurgence, which is reflected in the Canadiens' business. "All our private suites are sold," Boivin said. "For corporate entertainment, there is no better product in town. Our catering is up significantly this year."
But for whom are they cheering? In recent seasons, Montreal management squandered its best French-Canadian players. Patrick Roy, the great goalie, was traded to Colorado in 1995 after an angry spat with Tremblay, then the coach, and Ronald Corey, then the team president, during a game at the Forum.
Pierre Turgeon, a captain who carried the team's symbolic torch from the Forum to Molson Center, was traded to St. Louis and became the top scorer on one of the league's best teams. Eric Desjardins, a defenseman, was traded to Philadelphia and has become captain of the Flyers.
Desjardins said it can be difficult to play under the smothering love of Montreal's fans and news media. "The people around the team have to realize hockey has changed," Desjardins said recently. "They have to realize the Canadiens can't win the Stanley Cup every year."
He said Montreal's fans and news media "make it hard on the players."
"They don't have patience," Desjardins said. "It's hurting them now." Desjardins paused and monitored his words for how they might look in print. "I don't want to get booed when I go back there the next time," he said, then concluded: "It's really sad. I don't like to see it. I played for them for so many years."
Desjardins wore the "CH" sweater from 1988 to 1995. One of his young teammates on the 1993 champions was Patrice Brisebois, now a veteran. Brisebois, about to turn 30, is a native of the city. After a recent defeat, he discussed what it has been like to play for such a team at such a time, underscoring his remarks with motion and emotion.
"Born in Montreal," he said, throwing a shin pad into his equipment bag.
"Raised in Montreal," he said, throwing in the other pad.
"Played in Montreal," he said, tossing in one of his skates.
"Won a Stanley Cup in Montreal," he said, tossing in the other skate.
Then he concluded with a couple of curse words in his native language. "That's French," he explained.

HEADLINE: Angola's Goal: Stepping Back From the Abyss

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: KUITO, Angola

 BODY:
The morning wind whistles through the bullet holes in the tiny house on Teofilo-Braga Street. The electricity is out again. And Agostinho Capitango shuffles through the dark, his wooden leg dragging, as he considers his rusting faucets. "We used to take showers when there was water," he said. "That was in 1992."
In the far-flung provincial capitals of America's eighth-largest oil supplier, history has seemingly reversed course, leaving entire communities with dimming memories of modernity. 
 Here, wheelbarrows and bicycles wobble along avenues once clogged by automobiles. Street lights have been blinded by rifle fire. There is no running water, no postal service, no garbage collection and scant rehabilitation for a shattered town where collapsed roofs, missing walls and other scars from the continuing civil war disfigure nearly every building.
Angola is vowing to rebuild its broken cities after decades of war, neglect and squandered riches. The government just recently allowed foreign auditors to begin their accounting of the country's oil revenues for the first time and renewed promises to increase spending on crumbling infrastructure, all in an effort to secure low-interest loans from the West.
But the measures -- which have been praised by the State Department and the International Monetary Fund -- have only exposed the magnitude of the task ahead.
This country may surpass Kuwait in oil exports by 2010, but it is still crippled by an inefficient and corrupt public service, decaying infrastructure and attacks by a weakened but unrepentant rebel army, say diplomats and local and United Nations officials.
In November, the government decided to commemorate 25 years of independence from Portugal by pardoning rebel soldiers and pumping water to thousands of homes on Independence Day, Nov. 11. One month later, the rebel leadership rejected the olive branch.
And Mr. Capitango's tap is still dry.
Forty years have passed since sub-Saharan Africa began shaking off colonial rule to harness the continent's natural riches for its oppressed people. Today, one of every five Africans lives in a country severely disrupted by conflict. And the wealth that once enriched Europe's colonial powers now fuels many of those wars.
The World Bank estimates that conflicts in Central and West Africa have cost those regions more than $1 billion and $800 million respectively. In Angola, where the continent's longest-running civil war simmers, the toll is achingly apparent in communities undone by violence, poverty and corruption even as oil exports boom.
About a quarter of the country's 13 million people have been forced to flee their homes since war erupted after independence in 1975. The World Food Program, which issued an urgent appeal for donations this month, struggles to feed nearly a million people. And every day, about 500 children die from malnutrition, disease and exploding land mines.
Leprosy and polio -- illnesses virtually eradicated in the West -- are rampant. Rebels and bandits roam freely through vast swaths of the country, making roads impassable. And since the national airline refuses to fly to most stretches of the interior, most Angolans are stranded in remote towns that seem like islands in dangerous waters.
In a roofless, doorless warehouse of this isolated, destroyed city, a war-weary graffiti writer vents his people's frustration on the cement walls. "Angola says, 'Enough!' " he cried in his black scrawl.
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos blames the continuing misery on the rebels, who have reneged on two peace agreements since 1990. But criticism of Mr. dos Santos is mounting as the United Nations, human rights groups and ordinary Angolans increasingly raise pointed questions about how the government is spending its wealth.
Deeply indebted and desperate for low-interest loans, the government finally agreed this year to open its oil accounts to the I.M.F. and to redirect its oil revenues from defense toward rebuilding, a move that Human Rights Watch has described as "a positive first step."
"The government of the Republic of Angola recognizes that the present still remains marked by numberless difficulties," the government told the nation in an Independence Day communique. "The government of unity and reconciliation is already implementing deep, wide-ranging reforms."
I.M.F. officials, who are still assessing Mr. dos Santos's commitment, say the government pledged $90 million for public repairs this year. There are reports of a new power station in Humpata, a repaired dam in Matala, running water in Huambo, new money for roads, hospitals and housing.
But that message has yet to trickle down to the bureaucrats click-clacking on manual typewriters in dusty offices without electric lights. Salomao Canhanga, a 49-year-old administrator, works in the housing rehabilitation bureau, but he admits that there is no housing rehabilitation happening here. His friends and neighbors beg for help with the gaping holes left by falling mortar shells. Mr. Canhanga tells them the office has no money for repairs. Even he has to scavenge for wood planks and straw mats to replace the glass windows in his house that were shattered by rebel attacks seven years ago.
As for sanitation? He shrugs his shoulders.
"Those workers don't have cars," Mr. Canhanga said gloomily. "We don't have trash cans. We have nothing, nothing." Mr. Canhanga earns about $16 a month and grows vegetables to feed his family. His youngest son, born in 1994, has only fuzzy memories of glass windows or houses without bullet holes. And these days, some of Mr. Canhanga's colleagues look back on their Portuguese oppressors with nostalgia.
"There's a feeling of sadness," Mr. Canhanga admitted. "People see independence as suffering. That's how they understand it. Some people say, 'When is this independence going to end?' " Underpaid and undersupplied, provincial bureaucrats have abdicated most responsibilities to foreign charities.
The World Food Program repairs classrooms and feeds nearly half of the town's 220,000 people. Oxfam builds water pumps. Doctors Without Borders provides supplies and medicines at the local hospital; it says the government covers only about 1 percent of the operating costs.
The government is technically responsible for the town generator, the water supply, the roads, defense and administration. But when officials tried to restore water on Independence Day, the underground pipes were so corroded that most people ended up without even a drop.
In its most recent report, the I.M.F. estimates that 40 percent of government spending went for defense in 1999, compared with 5 percent for social issues like health and education. Human rights groups say corrupt officials have siphoned off millions, a charge the government denies.
What is clear, however, is that the government is still unprepared to rescue this graceful colonial city once known for its gardens, its fountains and its rich soil.
In the vast camps for displaced people, babies with polio creep on hopelessly deformed limbs. In the dingy hospital, a teenager with leprosy screams as a nurse disinfects his diseased flesh. A young soldier with empty eyes lies motionless as his amputated leg bleeds steadily into a blue bucket.
But they, at least, are alive.
In the fiercest fighting here in 1993 and 1994, 30,000 people were killed in street battles that spilled out from Avenida Joaquim Kapango. So many died in the hail of falling mortars and machine-gun fire that bodies were buried where they fell, in alleys, parks, backyards, basements.
But in a town where thousands are hungry and homeless, the dead are no longer sacred. Grave robbers chip away at the walls of the municipal cemetery. They plunder coffins and drag away precious headstones. "People used to respect the dead," said Francisco Cavamba, 60, a grizzled man who has been burying bodies for 30 years. "These days, people need bricks and stones to rebuild houses."
Building supplies are flown in on cargo planes at exorbitant prices. That means there are too few bricks on the market, said Mr. Cavamba, staring at the rows of desecrated graves. "And there are so many, so many dead." People are still dying.
At first, the fighting was fueled by the cold war. The Russians and Cubans backed Mr. dos Santos and his Marxist party, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola.
The United States and the apartheid rulers of South Africa supported the rebels, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, known as Unita, led by Jonas Savimbi.
When the cold war ended, Mr. Savimbi sold the country's abundant diamonds to equip his army. He returned to war in 1998, but government soldiers armed with the profits of oil sales destroyed much of his war machine last year.
Mr. dos Santos has trumpeted the military successes, saying the rebels no longer threaten the government's efforts to rebuild.
But recently a bomb exploded outside the police station here, relief workers said. And in the last few months, 40,000 people have poured into the town, fleeing guerrilla attacks and skirmishes between the two sides in nearby villages.
In an assessment in November, the United Nations reported that rebel attacks on civilians, banditry and exploding land mines continue to disrupt the country. In some cases, the report says, government soldiers and the police are implicated in the robberies, rapes and forcible relocations of the very people they are supposed to protect.
"It should be noted that while the government claims to have control of over 90 percent of the country, the control that the government exercises does not infer normality," the United Nations said in its report.
Next year, Angola hopes to export as much as one million barrels of oil a day. And some critics believe that Mr. dos Santos is playing down the country's problems to reduce pressure on the government to invest more in the beleaguered provinces.
Hendrik Vaal Neto, the minister of communications, denies such charges. He says the government had no choice in the past but to spend its oil money on weapons. But with the war ebbing, he says the government is moving rapidly to rebuild.
"There has been a lot of suffering since 1975, but right now we are in a better position to solve our people's problems," Mr. Neto said in an interview earlier this year.
"There are already many positive changes," he said. "Some people do not want to recognize that. If you give the government two or three years, you will see the government directing even more finances to social problems."
When there is electricity, Mr. Capitango hears those promises revived on the grainy newscasts on his black-and-white television. And most mornings, he pedals his black bicycle to church and asks God to help the government keep its word.
"My father, he encouraged me to believe," said Mr. Capitango, 51, his brown eyes wistful with the memory of it, as he invited a stranger into his dim parlor on another afternoon without power.
"He told me there were many wars in the past and that things would change," he said. "The world wars ended. This, too, would end. But my father, he was captured and killed by Unita.
"Now, I talk to my children," said Mr. Capitango, sighing. "I tell them one day the war will finish. But the situation is worse all the time. And I am getting old."

Voters in Serbia Wipe Away Remains of Milosevic Rule
Serbs voted overwhelmingly to sweep away the broken parapets of the rule of Slobodan Milosevic and give Serbia its first non-socialist government in more than 50 years. Preliminary results showed the 18-party coalition supporting the new Yugoslav president, Vojislav Kostunica, had won more than two-thirds of the seats in Serbian parliament. 1 

Support for Palestinian Rule
The leading Christian churches in Jerusalem, increasingly assertive and unusually unified, are openly backing Palestinian demands for full sovereignty over the Old City and its Christian and Muslim holy sites. 10
 
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators failed to overcome their differences on Jerusalem and other tough issues, setting back President Clinton's drive for a peace accord before leaving office. Emerging from a half-hour meeting with Mr. Clinton at the White House, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said gaps remained on Jerusalem, security, refugees and borders. 4
 
Pause for Hope in Kashmir
There is a rare sense of optimism in Kashmir after a hopeful tit-for-tat by India and Pakistan this week, if only because the dispute over the region has been so stubbornly bad that any good news is extraordinary news. 6

Clinton Leaves a Legacy Of Gains and Failures
President Clinton will leave behind a complex record when he walks out of the White House next month; he helped balance the budget, presided over unbroken growth of the economy and a flowering of the information age, but also was the first elected president to be impeached. 1
 
White House aides are taking one last shot at creating an America in their image -- churning out new regulations and reviewing last-minute authorizations for national monuments. The Bush administration may reverse some of the measures, but it is a cumbersome process. 16
 
Aid to Farmers Growing
The government distributed a record $28 billion in payments to farmers this year, accounting for half of all the money made by farmers. What these bailouts have done, say many farmers who curse the government but take the checks, is strengthen a culture of dependency. 1
 
Tribe Seeking to Ban Alcohol
The Yakama Nation in central Washington is seeking to start enforcing a long-ignored ban on alcohol in a dispute that is testing the limits of Indian sovereignty. 14

HEADLINE: VOTERS IN SERBIA ERASE THE REMAINS OF MILOSEVIC RULE

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Sunday, Dec. 24

 BODY:
Serbs voted overwhelmingly on Saturday to sweep away the broken parapets of the rule of Slobodan Milosevic and give Serbia its first non-socialist government in more than 50 years.
Preliminary results early this morning showed that the 18-party coalition supporting the new Yugoslav president, Vojislav Kostunica, had won more than two-thirds of the seats in the Serbian Parliament and would form a government, to be led by Zoran Djindjic, 48, as prime minister. 
 According to forecasts based on a representative sample of votes, the 18-party coalition, still known as the Democratic Opposition of Serbia, won more than 64 percent of the votes and 177 seats of the 250 in Parliament. The total will allow the coalition to change the Serbian Constitution easily and dismantle the structure of Mr. Milosevic's rule.
Mr. Milosevic was not a candidate, but his Socialist Party did relatively well, winning about 13 percent and 35 seats, making it the largest opposition party. About one-third of its previous voters defected to the coalition.
The nationalist Serbian Radical Party of Vojislav Seselj won nearly 9 percent and 23 seats. In a surprise, it looked as if another nationalist coalition of four parties -- including the Serbian Unity Party of the slain paramilitary leader Zeljko Raznatovic, known as Arkan -- would make it into Parliament with nearly 6 percent of the vote and 15 seats.
But the Serbian Renewal Movement of Vuk Draskovic, once the strongest opposition party, was not expected to reach the 5 percent threshold to win seats. And the Yugoslav United Left party of Mr. Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, essentially disappeared, winning less then one-half of one percent of the vote.
This was a crucial election for the future of the Balkans, where the United States and other Western nations have poured billions of dollars and thousands of troops in the last 10 years, including the waging of NATO's first war, over Kosovo.
But even with Mr. Milosevic and his Socialist Party out of power, the future of the Yugoslav Federation remains uncertain. Serbia's tiny sister republic, Montenegro, is still pressing for independence, along with the Serbian province of Kosovo, which is home to an ethnic Albanian majority, administered by the United Nations and patrolled by NATO-led troops.
One of the crucial tasks of the new Serbian government will be to manage its own neighborhood, trying to reduce the instability that could discourage the foreign investment needed by impoverished Serbia after 10 years of international sanctions and regional warfare.
How well the new government does, in cooperation with Mr. Kostunica, will have a major impact on the American military presence in the Balkans. President-elect George W. Bush has already made clear that he would like to reduce the number of and eventually withdraw the nearly 10,000 American troops in Bosnia and Kosovo.
But there are significant strains between Mr. Kostunica and Mr. Djindjic, and their fractious coalition is expected to break up over time.
Mr. Milosevic voted with his wife in a Belgrade suburb, but made no comments, other than to wish Serbs a happy new year.
Mr. Kostunica said the vote "is a continuation of the work that started in September," when he defeated Mr. Milosevic for the Yugoslav presidency. Mr. Milosevic resigned after a popular revolt on Oct. 5, and this election -- called early after popular pressure on the previous Parliament -- was intended to consolidate the democratic coalition's victory by taking over they key power center of the dominant Serbian republic.
But after a quiet campaign and an unusual Saturday vote, turnout was about 60 percent, considerably lower than the 75 percent in September. That aided the smaller parties and cut into the coalition's margin.
Voters said they expected economic reforms, an improvement in their standards of living, a battle against widespread corruption and justice meted out to high-ranking officials of the Milosevic government.
Mr. Djindjic, who has already announced the key figures in a government of politicians and policy experts, has promised quick action on all fronts, arguing that Serbia must discard its "relaxed" and "Oriental habits" and understand that "we have already lost a lot of time."
Mr. Djindjic, who studied philosophy in Germany and sees himself as a modern European politician, has promised to establish the rule of law, reform the police, create a true market economy and decentralize the state, bringing it closer to the European mainstream. "I think that the main thing starts after the election, which means introduction of reforms, raising the population's living standard and creating conditions for normal life in this country," he said.
The election marks the end of a provisional, caretaker Serbian government, where power was shared with Mr. Milosevic's Socialists.
Mr. Djindjic has suggested that charges will be brought against Mr. Milosevic on issues like bribery and corruption. But the Socialists' position as the largest opposition party may provide the former Yugoslav president, who was indicted by the United Nations tribunal for war crimes during the Kosovo war, with protection against an indictment.
Mr. Djindjic, like Mr. Kostunica, has said that he will not hand Mr. Milosevic over to the Hague tribunal, but that his government will cooperate with investigators.
While Mr. Kostunica was not running himself, he is extraordinarily popular, much more popular than Mr. Djindjic, and the coalition list bears his name.
He has used his popularity to benefit his Democratic Party of Serbia in the coalition list, and his party will get as many seats as Mr. Djindjic's Democratic Party.
The two men do not trust each other and have had different views on the pace and nature of change, with Mr. Djindjic favoring more "revolutionary speed" and Mr. Kostunica, a constitutional lawyer by training, insisting on legality and constitutional forms. But Mr. Kostunica rejected the temptation to break the coalition apart before this election, even though his previously tiny party would have emerged as the country's largest.
Both he and Mr. Djindjic say they know that they now have shared responsibility for the new democratic Yugoslavia. But how long the coalition holds together is anyone's guess, with some suggesting that it will inevitably break up with the next elections.
When those elections arrive will depend in large part on what happens with Montenegro, where its president, Milo Djukanovic, is promising a referendum on independence by the summer. His supporters boycotted the federal elections in September that ousted Mr. Milosevic.
If Montenegro breaks away, Mr. Kostunica's position as president of a nonexistent Yugoslav federation becomes nearly meaningless, and he may then run for the powerful presidency of Serbia. If Montenegro stays, new federal elections are likely by the spring.
Senior Western officials say an independent Montenegro, which Washington and the European Union oppose, would hasten pressure for independence for Kosovo and Republika Srpska, the Serb-dominated part of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
To keep turnout low, Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party spread rumors that an invisible spray intended to prevent someone from voting twice is dangerous to health and male potency. Voters also were required to sign voting lists and cast their ballots in transparent plastic boxes.
Stojan Cerovic, writing in the liberal magazine Vreme, said the coalition could no longer blame anyone else. "Serbia will be a true reflection of the intelligence, capabilities and integrity of these people, who can amass huge merit," he said. "Yet no sin will be forgiven them. The first scandal, the first case of corruption, the first greater injustice or neglect to establish justice will significantly set them back and will soon squander October's high hopes."

HEADLINE: Crime

BYLINE: By Marilyn Stasio 

 BODY:
There's a sickly odor -- of something rich with life that has started to decay -- about Nicolas Freeling's disturbing psychological study of a mild-mannered killer, SOME DAY TOMORROW (St. Martin's Minotaur, $22.95). Like the smell of garden mulch, it is not unclean, or even unpleasant; but it carries overpowering hints of death.
Death and decay are very much on the mind of Bert van Bijl, the elderly Dutch flower grower whose ambiguous confession this is. Although Bert is in prison ("It was decided that I should be put out of society," he says. "I'm supposed to have killed a girl"), the only crime to which he confesses is the crime of being old, redundant and ridiculous. On this subject, he is positively eloquent. "One might regret Bert, who made few mistakes," he tells us, "but there's no place for him in the modern world. He's another of the great army of oldies who are no longer productive, who do not contribute, who are a drag upon society." Despite the self-pity and the self-loathing, he still manages a vigorous defense of himself as the frail remnant of a once robust species, the last of the "old stock" produced by "the old Holland." And although he sees himself as an example of genetic exhaustion, there is vitality in his lewdness, which never entirely flickers out. Even at the end, one horticultural life lesson persists: "You are perishable. So learn not to perish." 
 Joanne Dobson takes the title of her new novel from Sinclair Lewis's observation that "our American professors like their literature clear and cold and pure and very dead." COLD AND PURE AND VERY DEAD (Doubleday, $22.95) uses Lewis's sharp point to poke at male-dominated literary traditions and their old-boy boosters in academe. When a reporter for The New York Times asks Karen Pelletier, who teaches English at a proper New England college, to cite the best novel of the 20th century, the quick-witted scholar thumbs her nose at the establishment and names a steamy 1950's potboiler (think "Peyton Place") that shocked literary sensibilities even as it exposed "the hypocrisies of life in a smug New England college town." Quicker than you can say "Oprah's Book Club," the book becomes a sensation and its female author is forced out of seclusion.
Pelletier's guilty efforts to stop the mischief she set in motion take on urgency when the nosy reporter is shot to death on the author's goat farm. The amateur sleuth is on the right track when she looks into the buried scandal that inspired the autobiographical novel, but with people literally chasing her down the street to spill their secrets, her investigation looks silly. Pelletier is on surer ground when she sticks to her literary search for the emotional truth in popular fiction and the "subtle analyses of class aspirations, struggles and prejudices" that give it value.
In times of crisis, Abe Lieberman, the world-weary detective in THE BIG SILENCE (Forge/ Tom Doherty, $23.95) and other Chicago police procedurals by Stuart M. Kaminsky, applies his personal motto: "Hope for the best. Expect the worst." He found it in the Bible. Unless he picked it up from a Mel Brooks movie. Lieberman isn't quite sure, but the way he deals with a crisis, either source would do as well.
This warmhearted cop and his morose partner, Bill Hanrahan, find themselves backed into a corner by a blackmailer who kills a mob informant's ex-wife, kidnaps his 17-year-old son and threatens to do away with the boy unless the informer pledges ultimate silence -- by committing suicide. And that's only the first labor of the day for this herculean cop. Heaping one calamity on top of another, Kaminsky piles up a whole stack of woe to try his hero's soul: a deadly duo robbing Korean convenience stores; a sleazy con artist extorting money from old people; a Mexican gangster calling in favors; and Lieberman's own brother falling apart and blaspheming God in a Torah class. In Kaminsky's seamless style, these interlocking stories and their ethnically diverse players reflect the textured face of the city, a little bruised and battered but full of life and worthy of Lieberman's pragmatic brand of humane justice.
After reading THE SQUIRE'S TALE (Berkley Prime Crime, $21.95), by Margaret Frazer, I'm inclined to think that being a nun was the only way for a woman to survive the Middle Ages. True, the cloisters were drafty in winter and the heavy prayer schedule cut into your free time, but you could work at peace in the herb garden and copy lovely manuscripts in the library. Whatever the discomforts of the job, it was better than the lot of a virgin bride, which condemned you, as likely as not, to a forced marriage and an early death in childbirth. Dame Frevisse, the pious and perceptive nun who gives focus to this sober series, lends her wisdom to a noble family caught up in the political intrigues of arranging such a marriage for their ward -- if some randy knight doesn't carry her off first. Frazer can't write an action scene for all the gold in the papal treasury (the foiled kidnapping is all nuance and no event), but her domestic scenes set in castle and nunnery show a meticulous detail that speaks of trustworthy scholarship and a sympathetic imagination.
Bad boys like Ray Bob and Eddie need no introduction; they just are what they are, "outsiders from the rural frontier . . . young and unemployed and broke, trawling boredom after a late greasy lunch." Christopher Cook puts the match to these combustible "running buddies" in ROBBERS (Otto Penzler/Carroll & Graf, $24.95), a debut novel with classic noir bones, when he sets them down in Austin, Tex., in a stolen Eldorado and points them to the highway. Eddie, the stupid one, comes up a penny short for a pack of smokes, so he shoots the clerk at the 7-Eleven, giving Ray Bob, the crazy one, the excuse for a crime spree. Jumping lanes to elude a mean Texas Ranger on their trail, the outlaws shoot, rape and rob their way to Galveston and would still be tearing up the blacktop if Eddie hadn't fallen for a Houston hairdresser with higher aspirations. This is familiar plot territory, but Cook covers it with fearless originality, in a lyric voice that sings itself raw.

 THE DARK VALLEY
 A Panorama of the 1930s.
 By Piers Brendon.
 Illustrated. 795 pp. New York:
 Alfred A. Knopf. $35. 
 If the 1930's strike us today as a grim and miserable time, weighed down by unemployment and the travails of capitalism in crisis, overshadowed by the war that had been and the war to come, "The Dark Valley" will do nothing but reinforce that view. For the author, the British historian Piers Brendon, this was a dreary, dishonest decade in which dictators led millions astray through propaganda, militarists prevailed over peacemakers and poverty and crisis pervaded daily life. Focusing on developments in the major powers of the day -- Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Britain, Japan and the United States -- Brendon offers a sweeping picture of how politics shaped the fate of ordinary people between the Wall Street crash and the onset of World War II. He is concerned to convey the very texture of life: the sense of place, jokes, food and fashion can all be found in this account. But beyond this lies a grander goal -- to learn the lessons of the 1930's, above all how to ensure that economic crisis never again jeopardizes political stability.
Scattered throughout the book and enlivening its pages are numerous vivid vignettes of leading politicians. These portraits, though delineating character as well as physical appearance, pay special attention to their subjects' sexual doings, and there are relatively few whose love lives are insufficiently spicy to warrant attention. The gallery of eccentrics is completed by men like Gen. Hugo Sperrle, commander of the German Condor Legion in Spain, who -- Brendon tells us -- was "a flute-playing fitness fanatic who did physical jerks every morning, yet . . . had only one lung and smoked 40 cigarettes a day."
At first this way of bringing individuals to life makes for an attractive style. After a while, however, it comes to seem a sign of nervousness, an indication that the author fears losing his readers without the gaudy brush stroke or captivating detail. This impression is reinforced by the lengthy set pieces -- like the descriptions of the French Foreign Ministry at the Quai d'Orsay and St. Peter's Square -- that at their least controlled degenerate into a mere piling of detail upon detail. Buckingham Palace, we are told, "was a vast museum full of the treasures of the ages. Its 600 rooms were crammed with Aubusson carpets and Axminster rugs, Meissen porcelain and Sevres china, Japanese perfume burners and Chinese cabinets. They contained Gobelin tapestries, gilt thrones, ebony commodes, malachite candelabra, marble vases, boulle tables, walnut grand pianos, silk panels and damask walls, as well as bric-a-brac so antique that it was liable to disintegrate at the touch." Just like most palaces in fact. And so the list continues, offering detail but little or no interpretation of why the detail counts. This is history for the interior decorator.
Insofar as there is a political narrative, it is a familiar one. The Wall Street crash marked the end of the always fragile prosperity of the previous decade and paved the way for fascism's rise: British dithering, French internal feuding and the Roosevelt administration's need to combat economic depression at home allowed militaristic revisionist powers to rearrange the Versailles order. The good guys were too complacent and woke up too late. Stalin was busy butchering his own people in order to industrialize and arm quickly enough to protect the revolution. Everywhere, the power of the state and new technologies were deployed to dupe the masses; intellectuals failed in their duty to act as the voice of truth. Few of the politicians evoked in these pages emerge in anything like a favorable light. It is not only the dictators and their henchmen who come out badly; the leaders of the world's democracies fare little better. In short, the world was being run by fools and incompetents.
Brendon has read widely and synthesizes complex research in a readable and pleasing way. But as his pictorialist style hints, the analysis of events is not his strong point. If the stock market crash was so important in contributing to the rise of fascism, how do we explain Mussolini's easy triumph in Italy much earlier, or the rise of other right-wing regimes later in the 1930's, well after recovery had begun? The slump did not help, and was evidently crucial in Germany; but there was a wider and more pervasive dissatisfaction with democracy running throughout the first half of the 20th century that Brendon largely ignores. Hence the link between economic crisis and the rise of dictatorship is less watertight than might at first sight appear.
One effect of focusing on notable personages is that issues that cannot easily be reduced to questions of personality get short shrift. We read almost nothing about the ethnic tensions and minorities problems that bedeviled Europe, and that form the context for understanding Nazi anti-Semitism. The development of new kinds of corporatist economic power passes without comment. Dachau and the Gulag are extensively described, but beneath the shocking facts lie fundamental questions -- why the first half of the 20th century saw the rise of political imprisonment and persecution on an unparalleled scale across the political spectrum; why the Soviet Union imprisoned so many more of its citizens than Nazi Germany -- questions that the kind of history offered here fails to engage.
Nor can ideological debate be reduced to a matter of propaganda. It seems hard for Brendon to accept that people might have made up their own minds to support Hitler, Mussolini or Stalin. It was not always a case of leaders duping the masses, though that clearly happened. Mass politics worked two ways, and it was perfectly possible to offer reasoned and convincing critiques of the manner in which parliamentary democracy had operated till that point. There is obviously a sense in which the degree of faith implicit in ideological conviction may be likened to fanatical belief in religious dogma; nevertheless it was not all a matter of brainwashing and thought control.
Do we see so much more clearly today? The suspicion of ideology that pervades this book is characteristic of our mistrustful post-cold-war age. I fear, however, that it only distances us from the real uncertainties of the interwar era, and to that extent makes it harder, not easier, for the author to articulate whatever lessons it may hold for the present. I am not at all sure that, in Brendon's words, "political power obscured knowledge and economic catastrophe darkened understanding." Many of the world's leaders and their supporters knew only too well what they wanted, and strove to attain it. We may not like the idea of Hitler's New Order, but it was scarcely misguided on its own terms.
The real question is whether presenting a picture of a specific decade in this way helps us understand anything of the grander sweep of events. Capitalism's remarkable collapse at the end of the 1920's certainly undermined the liberal world order established at Versailles. But long-run factors played an important role too -- the crisis of constitutional liberalism and the emergence of mass political parties dated back to the first years of the 20th century, if not earlier. Nationalism, a force about which Brendon has little to say, triumphed in the shape of fascism. But fascism, with its recurrent dream of the ethnically pure nation led by the strong state, was one chapter in the story of a political idea that had already germinated in the middle of the 19th century. Empire building had followed a similar trajectory: Mussolini and Hitler were reacting against powers that had built up their own imperial domains in the previous century.
And if it is unconvincing to pin all the woes of the 1930's upon Wall Street and its crash, so too it may be misleading to stress World War II as the ultimate outcome of the decade in anything other than a chronological sense. The 1930's not only gave birth to the war; they also saw the rise of managed capitalism, which would dominate economic life internationally and domestically until the oil crises of the 1970's. At the same time, the 30's saw the beginnings -- as Brendon himself notes -- of what later generations would come to call consumerism: cheap cars, mass-produced household appliances, the rise of professional advertising and market research. The 1930's, it turns out, were not merely the "dark valley" of Nazism and the drift to total war, they were also the seedbed for what would succeed it too, a world enthralled by economic growth and domesticity.

HEADLINE: Striking Strengths, Glaring Failures

SERIES: THE CLINTON LEGACY -- First of five articles: Tale of 2 Presidencies

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
For eight years, Bill Clinton has been the bright sun and the bleak moon of American politics, embodying much of the best and the worst of his times. Even as he prepares to leave office after two tumultuous terms, he remains near the center of the collective consciousness.
In countless ways, Mr. Clinton has been the unavoidable man. 
 He exploited the daily rhythms of popular culture to redefine his office; he nudged the political culture to the center to reshape the Democratic Party; he rode the unbroken growth of the national economy to high approval ratings; and he helped foster the flowering of the information age, even as it amplified his flaws. He presided over a period of rapid change, in the world and in the presidency itself. He kept his office relevant and carried his country along on a wild ride.
The first president born after World War II, the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected to a second term, the first to lead in a post-cold-war world, Mr. Clinton also became the first elected president to be impeached, over his deceptions about an affair with a White House intern half his age.
He polarized the electorate like no president since Richard M. Nixon, and he left a trail of disappointed friends and former aides, some of whom feel betrayed, and others who barely speak to him now.
But in the face of a citizenry skeptical of government action at home and wary of commitment abroad, Mr. Clinton managed to shape a new kind of limited executive activism that kept the presidency in the thick of things, whether in modest domestic initiatives or efforts to promote peace and trade around the world. Without ever winning a majority of the popular vote, and despite the huge failure of his effort to overhaul the nation's health care system, he still helped bring the federal budget into balance for the first time in a generation and signed a major restructuring of the welfare laws.
Throughout his tenure, voters consistently said they did not particularly trust Mr. Clinton personally, but they trusted him to look out for their interests, and his job approval ratings seemed to rise with his legal bills. He used surpassing gifts of innate empathy to find a new presidential style of relating to the public, and to forge an extraordinary connection with ordinary Americans, especially minorities. If the Constitution had not barred him from running again, polls suggest he might well be preparing for a third term.
"I believe that Clinton is the best tactical politician, certainly of my lifetime," said no less a cold-eyed critic than the president's old nemesis, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. "I don't think he's F.D.R.'s peer, but if you just measure his ability to figure out, 'O.K., this will buy me the next six months,' he does that better than anybody I've seen, and at a lower cost generally."
In a recent Oval Office interview, Mr. Clinton ranged over his tenure, expounding on the global economy, elaborating on his efforts to find a "third way" between the politics of left and right, reflecting on his personal and policy failures and, once or twice, attacking his critics.
"My whole view of the world is that we're in a new aspect of human affairs," Mr. Clinton said, in a response to a question about the impact of the Internet that quickly expanded to address broader themes.
"Nobody's got a pointer on the truth, nobody is totally right, and we need to be doing more listening to each other and trying to find common ground."
Of course, Mr. Clinton's own parsing of the truth infuriated a large segment of the populace, and his short-term legacy may well be the most closely contested presidential election in more than a century, its legal machinations and 24-hour-a-day tactical cut-and-thrust constituting the pitch-perfect coda to his often rancorous political era.
But Mr. Clinton is also likely to be recalled as the president who presided over -- some will say helped spark -- one of the greatest surges in prosperity and innovation in American history, and who helped make the transition from the standoff of the cold war to an era in which American influence was unchallenged. Indeed, the question was no longer whether the nation was in decline relative to Asia and Europe but whether it could manage the resentments its sweeping influence engendered.
At home, he learned to use his bully pulpit, and the power of the executive order, liberally, remaking workplace rules and cordoning off millions of acres as national monuments to block logging and other businesses.
"All the dramatics and high and low comedy and conflicts of the last eight years have tended to obscure this central and serious fact: that Clinton may well be remembered not for the booming economy and not even impeachment, but for the new role for the president and the government that he articulated," said his former chief speechwriter, Michael Waldman.
"He tried to govern in the grand style in the first two years of his term, passing big programs and rallying the public with big speeches." Mr. Waldman said. "And it just didn't work. He had to find a way to be president that was much more in keeping with the smaller but still active government the country would tolerate right now."
For most of his tenure, Mr. Clinton presided over a hostile Republican Congress, and it was from this defensive posture that he operated most successfully. He co-opted the Republicans' longstanding political advantage on issues from crime to the economy to welfare, and even, for a time, on morality and values. His critics in both parties derided the approach as mere tactical positioning, reflecting Mr. Clinton's determination to win and keep power more than any core convictions. But he described this approach as the essence of his governing philosophy.
"A lot of people criticized me at the time," Mr. Clinton said in the interview, referring to the 1992 campaign, in which he first outlined these views. "They said, 'Well, he doesn't have a foot in either camp. Therefore, he must not have any convictions.'
"But that's not where I saw it at all," he said. "For example, I didn't think we could have an economic policy that would work unless we both got rid of the deficit and invested more in education and science and technology. I didn't think we could have a welfare reform policy that worked unless we both required people to work, and then rewarded work.
"I thought we had to find a way to clean up the environment and preserve it and improve the economy," he added. "I didn't think we could have a crime policy that would work unless we had more police and more prevention."
Mr. Clinton's achievements in these spheres were real. But they were undercut to a degree that only history can ultimately settle by the spectacular public disclosure of his personal flaws, and by the political firestorm they fueled.
"In many ways, this is a tale of two presidencies," said Leon E. Panetta, who served as White House chief of staff and budget director. "One, obviously brilliant and extremely capable, with the ability to help produce the greatest economy in the history of this country and to focus on major domestic priorities and, in effect, protect peace in the world.
"And the other is the darker side," Mr. Panetta said, "the one that made a terrible human mistake that will forever shadow that other presidency. Every person who's occupied that office has had their strengths and their weaknesses, and the prayer of the country is that their strengths will always be foremost. But in fact, their weaknesses are there, and part of the person, and we may think those weaknesses can be controlled, but time and time again, we've seen they can't be."
Lani Guinier, a Harvard law professor and onetime friend whom Mr. Clinton nominated to be assistant attorney general for civil rights, then dropped in a controversy over her legal writings, also said his record would be mixed.
"President Clinton has been extremely effective in the symbolic presidency, a talented politician, a gifted communicator," she said. "He has staged his presidency in a way that meets the needs of the information economy, a public sphere dominated by visual images, personality and sound bites. If we define effective as a president who can live in that world and survive and communicate some of his dearly cherished views, he has been effective.
"If we are speaking about a leader who has identified fundamental problems that people don't really know how to deal with, he has been ineffective," Professor Guinier added. "He has not identified that vision and has not moved people toward it. He is someone who truly had enormous talent but also had a few flaws, Achilles' heels that just held him captive."
In the end, Professor Guinier said, Mr. Clinton "became more consumed with winning than leading," and was "such a good politician that he began to believe that in winning he was actually leading."
Another old friend, Peter B. Edelman, who resigned as an assistant secretary of health and human services over Mr. Clinton's decision to sign the 1996 welfare law, said simply, "I hold him to a high standard, because he is a very intelligent man, and he has not lived up to the standard that is appropriate to him."
High intelligence, and great resilience in the aftermath of missteps, have been Mr. Clinton's hallmarks. Mr. Gingrich recalled that as long ago as 1993, at a White House ceremony, the president had said to him, "You know, I'm like that clown you had when you were a kid, and there's sand in the bottom: You knock it down and it comes back up."
"He said, 'I'm not pretty, but I always come back up,' " Mr. Gingrich added.
Mr. Clinton took, and gave himself, no shortage of knocks. Even his aides like to joke that he served not two terms but four.
The first was his troubled first two years, culminating in the failure of his health care plan and the Republican takeover of Congress. The second was his comeback from that defeat, culminating in his successful standoff with the Republicans over the budget, the passage of the welfare bill and his re-election in 1996. The third was the scandal over his affair with Monica Lewinsky and his subsequent impeachment for lying about it under oath. And the fourth was a denouement of ambivalence and opportunities lost, punctuated by a successful military intervention in Kosovo, that ended in last month's electoral dead heat between his handpicked successor and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
First elected with just 43 percent of the vote in a three-way race, Mr. Clinton faced criticism from his first day in office from opponents who regarded his presidency as illegitimate. The passage, by a single vote in the summer of 1993, of a package of measures to reduce the federal budget deficit was the major achievement of Mr. Clinton's first year in office, and it helped pave the way for the biggest success he claimed for his tenure: a booming economy.
But the 1994 failure of his effort, led by his wife, Hillary, to overhaul the nation's health care system overshadowed almost everything else about his first two years, and led the Republicans to reclaim majorities in both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years. Even now, Mr. Clinton identifies that as his biggest policy failure.
"I suppose on a policy front, that certainly ranks right up there. I wish we'd gotten, I wish we'd been able to do more," he said.
"The reason is we didn't have the money to," Mr. Clinton added. "If you want to provide health insurance, universal health insurance, there's only two ways to do it. It's not rocket science. You've either got to require the employers to offer the health insurance and then give them a little financial, a tax break to the people who have a hard time providing it, or you have to pay for it with tax money."
Because the administration had just raised taxes to help reduce the deficit, he said, there was no appetite for raising them further, and the economy was not strong enough to persuade Congress to impose employer-mandated health insurance payments in the face of business opposition.
The administration also took criticism for the overall size of the plan and for drafting it largely in secret.
"That was my mistake," Mr. Clinton said of the whole matter. "I've always thought my wife took too big a hit on that. I asked her to come up with a universal plan that maintained private health providers. And there aren't any other options and neither option, frankly, in 1994, was politically doable in that Congress, and maybe not in the country by the time the interest groups got through mangling on it. So that was my mistake, and it's one I have to live with, like all my other mistakes."
But Mr. Clinton resolved never to be caught again in the mistake of trying to make the country swallow programs more ambitious than it wanted. With the help of Dick Morris, his astute, politically nimble consultant, Mr. Clinton found a way to exploit the political center on issues from food-safety regulations to school uniforms to 48-hour hospital stays for new mothers.
Many such moves he could make on his own, without Congressional approval. No issue seemed too minor to attract his attention, as he tried to attract the nation's. His speechwriter, Mr. Waldman, said the staff calculated that in a typical noncrisis year, Mr. Clinton made about 550 speeches, while Ronald Reagan had made 320 and Harry S. Truman 88.
That was in part because of a sea change in the postmodern role of the presidency. Mr. Clinton became the first president to live in a relentless real-time media culture that magnified his every mistake. His most mundane utterance might be carried live on cable and the Internet from the Rose Garden, even as the major broadcast television networks often balked at giving him the time to address the nation that his predecessors routinely claimed.
Early in his term, Mr. Clinton's aides were unnerved to realize, in airports or other public settings, that people barely seemed to notice if the president was on television because they were so used to seeing him interviewed. So his public appearances became more tightly structured, each one seen as an opportunity to make a point Mr. Clinton wanted to make.
To a degree that often seemed to surprise everybody but Mr. Clinton, the strategy worked. In 1995, he gave the longest State of the Union address on record -- an hour and a half. Pundits were scathing, but the public loved it. Mr. Clinton seized the mantle of fiscal responsibility from the Republicans, and by the fall, just a year after they had swept to victory in the 1994 midterm elections, Mr. Clinton had his opponents on the defensive as he prevailed in two government shutdowns prompted by a standoff over the Republicans' budget proposals.
Ken Burns, the documentary maker, described Mr. Clinton as "someone who has moved us from one kind of world to another." And so he has, from a world in which the Internet was barely a force in American life when he first ran for president to one in which the instantaneous reality of cyberspace affects every aspect of daily life.
Mr. Clinton, by virtue of his relative youth, and the generational shift embodied in his election, also moved the presidency from card files to e-mail messages and from a certain parental reserve to a more accessible image: commander in chief as older sibling.
From his saxophone and shades to his MTV answer about boxers or briefs, Mr. Clinton made the modern presidency more understandable and approachable, and eliminated a substantial measure of the distance that had insulated the office and its occupants.
His television skills were so obvious that becoming host of a TV interview program has loomed as a potentially serious post-presidential career option. But there was a cost, and a darker side, to that familiarity.
Well before taking office, and then while in office, Mr. Clinton became grist for a seemingly endless series of tattletale memoirs, tabloid gossip, Internet screeds, late-night sex-and-cheeseburger jokes, and even a best-selling novel and movie, "Primary Colors," whose hero was a thinly veiled portrayal of him. A recent episode of the television drama "Law & Order" featured a murder suspect who had failed to confess to the police that he was having an affair with the dead woman. When prosecutors called that a sign of guilt, the defense lawyer exploded: "He conveniently omitted having sex with a woman other than his wife? Now where have we heard that before?"
Mr. Clinton has said he is not sure it is such a bad thing for the president to be seen as human. In an interview this year with the author of "Primary Colors," Joe Klein of The New Yorker, he said, "We need to demystify the job. It is a job."
But Mr. Clinton has also complained that he was forced to govern in the face of opposition far more implacable than that confronted by most of his predecessors, and in the face of a culture of investigation that has seemed to overtake Washington in the last decade.
There is some truth in that. Years of investigation into the failed Arkansas real estate investment known as Whitewater -- intensified early in Mr. Clinton's first term by the suicide of Vincent W. Foster Jr., a deputy White House counsel -- and other associated inquiries never produced clear evidence of wrongdoing by the Clintons, though several former associates were convicted of various crimes.
Mr. Clinton was all too aware that intense scrutiny was part of the price of politics, and that the old rules had changed; after all, aides have said, he decided against running for president in 1988 partly out of concern that reports of dalliances with other women might undo him. So when the Lewinsky scandal became public a year into his second term, as a result of his testimony in a sexual harassment lawsuit dating to his days as governor of Arkansas, even aides under few illusions about the president's weaknesses were dumbfounded.
"That is the most inexplicable element of his presidency," said Michael D. McCurry, the former White House press secretary, who, after leaving his post, said in an interview with the BBC that in hindsight, he had to question Mr. Clinton's fitness for office. "I mean, what could he have been thinking, and why?"
"I'm reasonably well convinced that he fully understood the burden of the office," Mr. McCurry said. "I don't know enough about psychology to know what it is, but something in the back of the mind said, 'I'm just not worthy of this, or maybe I'm not up to this.' It's some kind of insecurity, I guess."
For more than a year, a president steeped in the lore of his office, minutely versed on the strengths and weaknesses of his predecessors and consumed with his own potential legacy, was all but paralyzed. At one point in the late summer of 1998, after he had acknowledged first to a grand jury, then to the public, offering misleading answers about the Lewinsky affair under oath, even a couple of his top advisers thought his presidency was over.
But Mr. Clinton also displayed a profound ability to compartmentalize his problems. Just a week after the scandal erupted in January 1998, he delivered a State of the Union address that crystallized his determination to use the projected federal budget surplus to "save Social Security first," a political goal that has dominated all policy discussion on the subject since. He took a more active role in foreign policy, the major arena in which he could act unilaterally.
And Mr. Clinton's approval ratings remained high, which only infuriated his critics further.
David Schippers, the Chicago lawyer who served as chief investigative counsel for the House Judiciary Committee during impeachment, voted for Mr. Clinton in both presidential elections. But during the impeachment inquiry, Mr. Schippers became one of the sharpest Clinton critics, distressed at the president's evasions and the legal rulings they helped prompt, including a Supreme Court decision that Secret Service agents could be compelled to testify about those they protect.
"As a president, give the devil his due," Mr. Schippers said. "The people were happy with him, and he spun the Congress like they were a bunch of rag dolls. I stand in awe of his political abilities."
At 54, Mr. Clinton will be the youngest former president since Theodore Roosevelt, and from his presidential library in Little Rock, Ark., and an office in New York, he said he expects to "be a good citizen of our country and have a positive impact around the world," using Jimmy Carter as a model.
"Bill Clinton's legacy isn't over; it's only midstream," said the historian Douglas Brinkley.
As he leaves office, Mr. Clinton's troubles are not over, either. He faces a mountain of legal bills, the threat of disbarment in Arkansas and even the specter of a possible perjury indictment by the last Whitewater independent counsel, Robert W. Ray.
"The fight over his presidency after it is over will be as vocal and vigorous as it was during it," said Rahm Emanuel, a former senior adviser who has remained fiercely loyal to Mr. Clinton.
Throughout the turmoil of his career, Mr. Clinton's greatest personal and political resource has been a relentless optimism -- a force that ranges from ebullience to weary resignation -- allowing him to press on when others would give up.
George Stephanopoulos, his former close aide who broke with him over the Lewinsky affair, wrote in his memoir of the White House: "I came to see how Clinton's shamelessness is a key to his political success, how his capacity for denial is tied to the optimism that is his greatest political strength. He exploits the weaknesses of himself and those around him masterfully, but he taps his and their talents as well."
Mr. Clinton has lived more lives than most politicians ever dream of having, and skirted more deaths, only to rise again. Indeed, asked to describe his single best campaign event, Mr. Clinton did not hesitate to point to "that moment in that hot building in Dover, N.H., in '92" when, as he put it, "I knew I wasn't going to die."
At that moment, of course, much of the smart money thought Mr. Clinton was already dead, dispatched by tabloid reports of his affair with a lounge singer named Gennifer Flowers and reports in more serious publications about his efforts to avoid the draft and his subsequent efforts to blur and evade that truth. In New Hampshire that night, he ad-libbed a speech telling voters that if they would stick with him, he would stick by them, "until the last dog dies."
It has been convenient in recent years to describe Mr. Clinton as a tragic figure, a hero brought low by his foreordained flaws. But it seems just as plausible now to regard him, in Shakespearean terms, as a comic figure, who endures all manner of slips and humiliations to remain alive and standing, smiling, on stage at journey's end.
To be sure, a raw and wounded bitterness lingers just beneath Mr. Clinton's skin. Asked if the nation could have enjoyed the best of him without also enduring the worst, the president at first demurred. "Oh, that's a judgment for somebody else to make," he said tightly.
Then Mr. Clinton wheeled on his questioners. He sharply criticized The New York Times's coverage of the Whitewater affair, and the case of Wen Ho Lee, the Los Alamos scientist accused of mishandling nuclear secrets, then declared, "I wish we could have had the great New York Times without that," adding, "But we couldn't."
Finally, he said, "The American people will have to make that judgment."
Mr. Clinton said he might someday make a stab at describing what the personal crisis that precipitated the political crisis of impeachment had meant to him.
"I might," he said. "Most people have no idea about what, personally, I've gone through for the last couple of years, and I might do that. But I did the right thing not to do it, at this point, because the people hired me to do a job, and I got up every day and did it."
Mr. Clinton, though, has also been lucky, as he readily acknowledges.
"The price I paid for my personal mistake was, believe it or not, more than anything else a profound personal price," he said. "I'm glad that I saved my family. I'm glad that my life is happy and in good shape, and I'm glad my country is still in good shape."
On a fund-raising trip to California last fall, Mr. Clinton met a baby girl whose tiny fingers reached out to clutch at his own big hands. "Look at her," he said then. "She's holding on. That's 90 percent of life, just holding on."

AT&T to Job Seekers: Take My Cards, Please

BYLINE: By Charles L. P. Fairweather 

 BODY:
When it comes to handing out pink slips, few big American companies can measure up to AT&T, which has engaged in various forms of mass downsizings that have eliminated 25,600 jobs over the last four years. But in what has become a sort of ritualistic annual gesture to the unemployed, AT&T is again giving out free calling cards so job hunters can line up interviews.
The number of people who actually use the cards for their intended purpose is not clear. But Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a job placement company that distributes the AT&T calling cards as part of a promotion for its own counseling services, expects a surge of inquiries this year, reflecting a growing apprehension about the economy. "Insecurity is rearing its head again," said John A. Challenger, the company's chief executive. 
 Under the collaboration of Challenger and AT&T, now in its fourth year, job seekers who call (312) 332-5790 on their own dime from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. E.S.T. this Thursday and Friday will receive free advice on how to prepare a resume and tips about dazzling a job interviewer. They will also receive two 15-minute calling cards in the mail.
Mark Spiegel, an AT&T spokesman, said AT&T agreed to the card giveaway to lend a "small helping hand to folks in a tough situation."

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
Hey, Keep Your Eyes on This. It's About to Get Interesting.

BYLINE: By Iver Peterson; Iver Peterson reports from New Jersey for The New York Times.

DATELINE: PRINCETON

 BODY:
Political punditry is a pretty cushy business for reporters because most of what gets written concerns things that have already happened, and how hard can it be to bloviate with perfect hindsight?
But the end of the year invites even the laziest of us to try a little foresight for a change, and to look ahead to 2001 for the personalities and problems and potential wild cards that may be lurking. 
 So what do we see?
The big political story nationally as well as here in New Jersey is deadlock -- voters so evenly divided between centrist Democrats and middle-of-the-road Republicans that both national parties will be watching 2001 very closely for any evidence of a breaking trend in popular opinion.
And they will be looking at New Jersey and Virginia with particular intensity, since the odd-year election cycle in both states has historically made them an early warning system for forecasters. Think of 1993, when Mrs. Whitman's election made taxphobia -- with a dose of social liberalism -- a respectable commodity, at least among the people who had not yet heard of Newt Gingrich.
New Jersey's status as a straw in the wind will give Republicans and Democrats alike in Washington a strong incentive to try to influence the big event on next year's political calendar, the race for governor. Assuming that James S. Gilmore of Virginia runs for a second term, New Jersey will be the only state with an open seat, giving the race here a particular national resonance. So if by the time you read this, Mrs. Whitman has been apotheosized into the Bush cabinet, you will have seen an early example of national politics reaching into New Jersey.
By taking the governor out of the State House, the Republican Party will have elevated the Senate president, Donald T. DiFrancesco, into the acting governorship and have given the Republicans a huge advantage over the Democratic candidate next year. Expect Republican spinners to credit George W. Bush with starting a ground swell if Mr. DiFfrancesco goes on to win, and for Democrats to call Mr. Bush a lame duck if he loses.
Not that DiFrancesco is exactly a household name, but there will be some even newer faces in the news next year. Roger Bodman, a Republican lobbyist and campaign strategist, points to Senator John Bennett, the patient majority leader, who will become de facto Senate president during a DiFrancesco interregnum.
David Rebovich, a political science professor at Rider University, says we should keep an eye on Councilman Corey Booker of Newark, who is rapidly building a political career. And Ross K. Baker of Rutgers notes that by surviving a challenge from Dick Zimmer, Representative Rush Holt has earned the right to some statewide attention.
Hamilton Township now has a Democratic mayor, Ken Gilmore. And if Mr. Gilmore can deliver the township -- the state's seventh-largest municipality -- to Jim McGreevey, the probable Democratic candidate for governor, Mr. Gilmore will have new status in the state.
Issues are the fuel of politics, and New Jersey has some perennials as well as a few potential wild cards. Reforms have already wrung most of the savings out of auto insurance, but discontent with the country's highest rates is still deep-seated and most likely to rumble when campaign temperatures rise.
Paying for urban schools is another perennial problem that has the potential to flare up when the multimillion-dollar tab is given as an excuse for cutting someplace else. Property taxes remain a source of frustration and anger.
And there are some wild cards, the unknowable maybes that make politics so nerve-wracking for its practitioners and so much fun for the idlers and gawkers on the sidelines. Mr. Rebovich's favorite wild card is the anti-toll movement from the people who want the fees lifted on the Garden State Parkway and, who knows, maybe even the turnpike. The idea of getting rid of all those 35-cent stops on the parkway may seem like a small thing now, but ending tolls is the kind of populist rant that stations like 101.5 FM, New Jersey's voice of the lowest common denominator, loves to trumpet.
Expect someone to start playing that tune next year, and watch it become the equivalent of toilet paper in the trees outside the State House, which was the famous protest against Gov. Jim Florio's hastily withdrawn tax on paper products eight years ago.
Mr. Bodman points out that redistricting is another wild card coming up. Whether congressional lines are redrawn to help Republicans or Democrats will come down to the single nonpartisan vote on the redistricting commission, which will begin to meet this spring.
The final wild card is the economy, and it gets wilder with every sag in the stock market. Many aging boomers have put their 401(k)'s in stock-indexed funds that have all lost value, and like red-blooded Americans everywhere, they will be looking for someone to blame for the dumb investment decisions they made. A sour economy also has a direct effect on the state budget, since it is so dependent on the sales tax. Two quarters of a downturn will immediately show up in state revenue, and newcomers to the legislature will have the pleasure, last experienced during the Florio years, of trying to pay for all of the expensive programs like tax rebates that were started in flush times with the diminished revenue of a recession economy.
Happy New Year.

HEADLINE: Playing War

BYLINE: By Michael Finkel; Michael Finkel has written for the magazine about sailing illegally to America with Haitian refugees and, more recently, a double murder in Kentucky.

 BODY:
A little before noon on the last day of his life, 15-year-old Ahmed Abutayeh invented a toothache. This was the first time he had ever complained of a health problem in school, so his science teacher wrote him a permission slip to visit a nearby clinic. Ahmed shouldered his plaid-patterned book bag and walked out of the Rimal Boys' School and onto the chaotic streets of Beach Camp, where 75,000 Palestinian refugees are corralled into a half-square-mile block, at the northern end of the Gaza Strip. It was Nov. 1 of this year. The previous day, Ahmed had sold his pet nightingale for a few shekels, and now, carrying this money, he caught a taxi and asked to be driven to a place called Karni crossing. He was wearing the nicest shirt he owned, a light blue button-down, and a few dabs of his father's cologne. On the outside of his book bag, in blue ink, he had inscribed a four-word epitaph: "The Martyr Ahmed Abutayeh."
Karni crossing, as its name implies, is an intersection. It's where the Karni Road crosses the so-called Green Line, the razor-wire border dividing the occupied territory of Gaza from Israel proper. The Gaza Strip is a place small enough to be easily fenced. It pokes from the northern end of the Egypt-Israel border and follows the shoreline of the Mediterranean Sea; its silhouette is roughly that of a pistol, aimed just west of Jerusalem. Karni crossing is at a point about midway along the pistol's barrel. 
 Palestinians are not allowed through the Karni crossing. The road is reserved for Israeli access to a settlement called Netzarim. Forty percent of the Gaza Strip's land is controlled by Israel and is home to 6,500 or so Israeli settlers, many of whom believe they have a property claim that is spelled out in the Old Testament. The other 60 percent is home to more than a million Palestinians, half of whom live in refugee camps. Most Israeli settlements in Gaza are clustered in one of the large, fortified areas at both ends of the strip, but Netzarim is in the middle, an Israeli island in a Palestinian sea. There is something about the Karni crossing, several Palestinians told me, that seems emblematic of the entire half-century-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict: it's a place where Arabs are not considered equal citizens, in an area dominated by the Israeli armed forces, permitting entrance to a settlement provocatively situated to deny the Palestinians a homeland. And so when the peace process fell apart in September and fighting resumed, it made sense that Karni was a scene of daily clashes. This is why Ahmed Abutayeh wanted to go there.
The confrontation on Nov. 1, the day Ahmed took the taxi, was intense. The Israeli Defense Forces had placed a tank and two armored vehicles along the Karni Road, trying as usual to maintain a safe route for settlers to pass through. Also beside the road, crouched in dirt trenches and behind cement barricades, were at least a hundred Palestinians, all of them male and many of them, like Ahmed, too young to be away from school. The boys Ahmed's age were armed with stones and Molotov cocktails. A few older fighters, wearing dark green uniforms indicating membership in the loosely controlled Palestinian security services, carried guns.
Ahmed had a sling with him, made of a bit of denim the size of an eye patch and a long piece of twine. He'd cup a stone in the denim, twirl the sling about his head, then snap the line taut. By all accounts he was a fierce and fearless stone-slinger. Sometime around 4 o'clock, as the desert sun was low and the dust that hovers about the Gaza Strip turned golden, the level of violence escalated. Two carloads of settlers wanted to drive through, and the Palestinians showed no signs of permitting a trouble-free passage. Live ammunition was fired from the Israeli side. Many of the boys fled or dove behind barricades, but Ahmed continued to twirl his sling. He did not seem concerned about finding protection. He stood up and flung another stone. A bullet from an M-16 struck Ahmed just above his right ear. The bullet was traveling at a downward angle, and it passed through his head and throat and settled in his chest. He was dead before an ambulance crew could reach him. The permission slip from his science teacher was found in the front pocket of his blue jeans.
This is a strange war. The rhetoric and geo-politics of the conflict -- the claims of Biblical or Koranic privilege; the push-pull of Middle Eastern power; the status of refugee rights and occupied lands and religious sovereignty -- are all cast in the loftiest of ideals. And yet, on the Palestinian side at least, much of the fighting is being carried out by children. There are preteenagers and midteenagers and boys as young as 5 hurling stones at Israeli soldiers. Children are dying with shocking frequency. Since late September, at least 68 boys under the age of 18 have been killed and thousands wounded in clashes in the Gaza Strip and West Bank. The violence, though, does not deter the children; quite the opposite, in fact.
The day after Ahmed's death, there were more boys at Karni crossing than ever before. At the front, in the trenches, the energy level felt wild and unfocused and adolescent; not much different, really, than an unruly middle-school recess. Here I met half a dozen boys who'd known Ahmed: I met Sameh and Muhammad and Hares and Yehya and Aymen and Rami. All of them were 13 or 14 or 15 years old, skinny and dirty and friendly. Each held a couple of rocks in his hands and jiggled them idly. Protruding from back pockets, where one might expect to see combs, were wooden slingshots and denim-and-twine slings. Aymen wore silver-framed glasses that sat crooked on his nose and sported a strip of cloth tied ninja-style about his head, upon which he'd written, "Better to die a martyr than die in your sleep." Rami's left wrist was bandaged; he'd been hit, he said, by a rubber bullet. I commented on his bravery, and all the boys lifted their shirts or raised their pants legs to show me various scars. Each one said they'd seen people die. Hares insisted that the red stain on his shirt was Ahmed's blood; he'd tried to stem the bleeding until the medics arrived, he said, but the attempt was hopeless.
Hares was one of the unofficial leaders of the front. He seemed perpetually agitated, in the noisy, inexhaustible manner of a child who might benefit from Ritalin. During a stone-throwing volley, he'd always leap up first, or nearly so, and he leapt in a way that seemed designed for maximum bravado, leaving himself exposed as if daring the soldiers to fire at him. Most of the boys appeared to admire this, but Muhammad admitted to me that he sometimes worries about Hares.
Muhammad was a little calmer than the others and more cautious, and only slightly averse to introspection. He had gone to school with Ahmed -- they were in the same class -- and Muhammad's family lived a few doors down from Ahmed's, in the center of Beach Camp. They'd been friends, Muhammad said. Muhammad had an easy, inviting grin, a slight fuzz of a mustache and front teeth just shy of being buck. He kept a stash of roasted watermelon seeds in his pocket and nibbled them in the smooth, casual way a smoker handles his cigarettes. The trenches weren't the place for lengthy conversation, but Muhammad mentioned that if I met him after school tomorrow we could talk. I told him I would.
The fighting progressed in fits and starts. Sameh owned a pair of binoculars, and though one eyepiece was broken they were still usable.
He focused on an Israeli tank, 100 feet away, and studied the soldier in the hatch, helmet lowered to his eyebrows, straps tight against his cheeks, his mouth a thin pair of lines, one hand about the trigger of his rifle and an eye at the scope, watching the boys watching him. The vehicle crept along the Green Line, and when it reached the spot directly in front of us there was a surge of momentum, 20 or 30 boys leaping up at once, the air a hailstorm of stones. The soldier ducked into the hatch and the stones fell harmlessly against the tank. There was no return fire, but the boys all said it was only a matter of time before the Israelis' patience wore thin.
The exceptionally large turnout at Karni didn't happen by chance. Dozens of fighters were there specifically because of Ahmed. Most had not known him personally, but his martyrdom had been embraced by the Palestinian leadership and transformed, in short order, into a powerful recruiting device. Within an hour of Ahmed's shooting, his mother, Afaf, was perched on the edge of a bed in Shifa Hospital, where her son had been pronounced dead. She was wrapped in a black headdress and robe, her eyes furious and red as she looked into a Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation television camera. She spoke in Arabic, using the baroque argot of the uprising, rhythmic and sharp. "Who killed my son, who shot my son, I am asking God to kill him, to spread his blood," she intoned. "We must flood Israel with blood like they have flooded us with blood. Let their blood wash them out of Palestine."
Two other Palestinians were also killed in Gaza the same day. One of them, Ibrahim Omar, was a friend and classmate of Ahmed's. Ibrahim, too, was 15 years old. He was shot in the neck while standing behind the same barricade where Ahmed had earlier been killed. The third victim was a 17-year-old named Muhammad Hajjaj. Ibrahim and Muhammad's families also delivered pleas for vengeance. These were broadcast throughout Gaza, on radio and television, along with an announcement that the three funerals would be conducted simultaneously the following day. Schools would be released early, it was reported, so that students could attend.
The next morning, in the minutes before Ahmed and Ibrahim and Muhammad's funeral procession was scheduled to arrive, Gaza City was quiet. All of the buildings -- five, six, seven stories tall -- appeared to be constructed of cinder blocks. There were cracks in some walls wide enough to offer glimpses of the apartments inside. Falafels were frying at outdoor stands; groceries sold cigarettes and soft drinks and penny candies. Tea shops were open. Clattering over the broken pavement came a mule-drawn cart, transporting a crateload of live chickens, dirty and squawkless. A few taxis passed. A bright new banner was stretched across the road, and my translator read it aloud: "Glory and Eternity for Our Martyrs."
Faces of the dead gazed from a dozen posters. Within hours of the boys' shootings, printing presses across Gaza had begun churning out posters. Each featured a head shot of one of the dead superimposed in front of the giant, gilded Dome of the Rock, in Jerusalem's Old City, the place where the Prophet Muhammad is thought to have ascended to heaven. In the posters' upper right-hand corner was an outline of the State of Israel, shaded in the colors of the Palestinian flag.
From down the street came the sound of chanting, and there seemed to be a change in the air, a ratcheting of pressure, as if a storm front were approaching. The demonstration blew in. At its head were three pickup trucks, each ferrying a stack of concert-size loudspeakers. An announcer stood atop each stack, shouting into a microphone, his voice so amplified and reverberative that the words felt as if they were being hurled outward, smacking against our ears and chest.
The trucks crept forward, each enmeshed by a turbulent crowd, shouting and reacting to the announcer's calls, many of the marchers spreading their fingers into victory signs. A man held up a Kalashnikov and fired round after round into the simmering sky. "Will we forgive those who killed our children?" cried one truck's preacher, his face a commingling of rapture and grief.
"No!" responded the marchers.
"Will we forget our martyrs' blood?"
"No!"
"Will we compromise for peace?"
"No!"
Behind the trucks swelled a larger pack of mourners. They carried flags, hundreds of them, representing every political faction in Gaza -- Popular Front flags and Fatah Youth flags and Islamic Jihad flags; flags with images of clenched fists and crossed rifles and soaring minarets -- and they marched in a mass that stretched from sidewalk to sidewalk, and anyone standing and watching had the choice of joining the demonstration or being trampled by the flow.
At the crowd's core were the three bodies. They were laid out on gurneys, wrapped in Palestinian flags, flowers piled on their chests, riding atop the crowd. Up close, I noticed that Ahmed did not have the
jet-black hair typical of a Palestinian. It was slightly red. His eyebrows were thick and caterpillery. His left ear, the only one visible (the right one, presumably damaged, was covered by a head cloth), stuck out like an open door. He seemed to be sweating. Perhaps it was the mortician's makeup, melting under the heat.
The marchers pressed toward Martyrs' Cemetery, a simple expanse of sand dotted with headstones and fenced by palm trees. Three fresh graves had been dug, and mourners packed around them. Women tipped their heads skyward and keened in trilling strains. Men linked arms and swayed forward and back. A mullah stood in the center, among the graves, and as the bodies arrived he shouted, "With our soul, with our blood, we will sacrifice ourselves for God." He shouted it again and a third time, and the crowd picked up the chant. The three boys were slid into the ground and the dirt was piled on, a thousand hands pawing at the graves. After the bodies were covered, the mounds atop their graves were a collage of palm prints, and everyone was still chanting, even the smallest of children, who wandered about the cemetery dazed from the excitement, repeating the words softly to themselves.
As the funeral ended there seemed to be a general exodus in the direction of Karni crossing, a short walk away. Toward the rear of the battlefield, a few hundred yards from the Green Line, rose several large mounds of dirt, almost a miniature mountain range. These were the equivalent of the battle's grandstands, and the hills were heavy with spectators, about half teenagers and half older, a hundred people milling around, arguing politics and charting the progress of the clashes. At moments when the situation became hazardous, everyone retreated from the hilltops and stood behind the dirt, and the conversations scarcely missed a beat.
In front of the dirt mounds, closer to the Green Line, were a series of cement blocks, about the size of dishwashers, each pocked with bullet scars and protecting a small clot of fighters. A few broken blocks hid just a single person, a fighting force of one. At the very front, about 30 yards from the Green Line, were a series of wide trenches cut into the soft desert soil, protected by dirt walls. The trenches were jammed with dozens of stone-throwers, almost all of them high-school age or younger. At the Green Line itself, on the far side of the fence, were three Israeli armored trucks and one tank, driving back and forth. Soldiers poked out the top hatches, rifles poised. There were no Israeli soldiers outside of the vehicles, at least none visible. A dog had been killed the day before, and its corpse lay on the battlefield, infusing the trenches with a miasmic tang. Plastic bags caught in the razor wire flapped in the wind. A burning tire exhaled black columns of smoke.
The area was wide open -- there were heaps of uprooted tangerine trees, a mess of twisted steel where a factory once stood and the remains of a demolished house. The Israeli Defense Force's policy is to bulldoze any spot on a battlefield that might offer protection to Palestinians. But instead of being deterred, the fighters who show up each day face an increasingly greater risk. At Karni, no one I spotted anywhere near the front carried a gun. The 10 or so Palestinian soldiers I saw were all well back, at the dirt mounds, their weapons slung casually over their shoulders. "We don't fire our weapons during the day," one of them explained. The children were the warm-up act. At dark, the real fighting began -- soldiers against soldiers. Several Israeli officers confirmed that virtually all the shooting from the Palestinian side occurred after nightfall.
Most of the stone-throwers at the front, it seemed, lived in refugee camps. Still, even in the trenches, the boys wore collared shirts, school-uniform pants and stylish sneakers; Palestinians are fastidious dressers, no matter the occasion. Toward the rear, kids in leather belts and jean jackets and penny loafers crouched safely behind the dirt mounds, too far from the Green Line to throw stones. The boys in the back were nearly all from the more middle-class neighborhoods outside Gaza City. Their parents were carpenters and electricians and merchants. They had clean fingernails and careful haircuts; they owned watches and Walkmans.
At the back there were vendors selling soft drinks and ring-shaped loaves of bread and, from a cart beneath a red umbrella, flavored ices. Bicycles and book bags were scattered about. A boy sat cross-legged in the dirt, studying from a mathematics book. Another boasted about his personal computer, which housed, he said, a Pentium 1 chip and Windows 98 and a collection of Pamela Anderson photos -- O.K. to keep, he explained, because she wasn't Islamic. Eight ambulances, with red crescent moons painted on the sides, were lined up like cabs at an airport, the drivers socializing and smoking. Parked nearby were two dump trucks, property of the Palestinian security services. At sunset the trucks would roll onto the battlefield and the kids would scramble aboard, to be driven back to their neighborhoods as if riding the school bus.
What was missing was anger. even in the trenches, even while throwing stones, none of the boys seemed particularly enraged. If anything, they appeared to be having fun. Yehya and Rami, two of the kids who had known Ahmed, spent half an hour assembling an enormous slingshot that required both of them to operate. They called it a Palestinian tank. Nobody cared that its accuracy could at best be considered random. Anyone who found a soda bottle would rush off and soon return with it half-filled with gasoline, a rag stuffed in the neck. The rag would be lit and the bottle tossed, to trenchwide cheers. It usually landed nowhere near an Israeli soldier. The Gaza soil never seemed short of rocks, though once in a while a donkey cart laden with cinder blocks would arrive and the boys would race to the cart, smash the blocks and return to the front with armloads of fresh ammunition. During the frequent cigarette breaks, the preferred brand was Marlboro, because if you took a pack and turned it upside down, the word "Marlboro," when inverted, approximated the Arabic script for the phrase "Horrible Jew."
Not one Palestinian political faction, no matter how militant, claims that it encourages children to participate in the clashes. Every party's official position is that it's better for the children to stay home. But if the boys decide on their own to fight, the organizations all say, well, there's nothing we can do to stop them -- this is a popular uprising, after all, and the children, like the rest of us, feel strongly about recapturing our homeland. At the front, the boys themselves could not say precisely who or what had motivated them to fight. They were too young to be affiliated with a political party, though most knew their parents' party, which was overwhelmingly Hamas, the fundamentalist movement that denies Israel's right to exist. Nobody told them to come, the boys all affirmed. They saw images on television, they said, or joined a demonstration, or knew a friend who fought. There were no recruitment drives or strategy sessions or battle plans. They were just here to throw rocks. It was better than going to school.
Of Ahmed's six friends at the front, two claimed that their fathers had granted them permission to fight, and all said that their mothers forbade it. It's not uncommon to witness a mother arrive at the front, spot her child and haul him off with an arm grip that indicated further punishment to come. About 5 percent of boys under 18 in Gaza regularly join the clashes, more than enough to compose a potent fighting force.
"If my mother knew I was here," said Sameh, "I'd be beaten."
"I told my mom I'm playing soccer," said Yehya.
"Mine thinks I'm at Aymen's house," said Hares.
"And mine thinks I'm at his house," said Aymen, and everyone broke into laughter.
When they tried to explain exactly why they were throwing stones, everyone said the same thing -- not approximately the same thing, but exactly the same thing. "I'm fighting for Palestinian freedom," they said. "I'm fighting so that Jerusalem can be the capital of Palestine. I'm fighting because the Jews stole our land and we want it back." Every sentence was taken, verbatim, from messages played and replayed on Palestinian TV.
At one point, following a rock-throwing jag, there was a sudden series of suctionlike pops. "Fireworks!" the kids shouted, and in an instant tear-gas canisters exploded about us. For reasons that didn't seem clear, the Israeli retaliation had begun. No one panicked. The boys reached into their pockets and produced cotton balls that had been rubbed with garlic and onion and pressed them to their eyes. Aymen tore his in two and gave half to me. Then the games began. Several boys vaulted out of the trenches, ran to the steaming canisters, picked them up and hurled them back at the Israelis. They were playing with army men, just as I did at their age, only mine were plastic and theirs were real.
Canisters that had already discharged their gas were brought to the trenches so the boys could play hot potato, staging contests to see who could hold the scalding metal in their fingers the longest. "Look," said Hares, making a face. "Built in America. I hate America." The writing on the outside of the 560 CS Long-Range Projectile said that it was manufactured by Federal Laboratories in Pittsburgh. When it had sufficiently cooled, Hares stuffed it in my pocket. Everyone was working on an ammunition collection. A basic set included the two styles of rubber-coated bullets (spherical and cylindrical), an M-16 bullet, a tear-gas canister and a .50-caliber bullet. Sometimes the kids traded them back and forth, like baseball cards.
Shortly after the tear-gas attack, which inspired nobody to leave the front, came rubber-coated bullets. Two, three, four shots. These were the spherical ones -- musket-type balls sheathed with a few millimeters of cushioning. They're launched from high-powered rifles; boys have died from being struck in the head by them. They ricocheted unpredictably about the trenches, and the boys hunkered down and the atmosphere turned a notch serious. A few people began crawling toward the rear of the battlefield, though all of Ahmed's friends remained. Muhammad curled himself into an insectlike ball and bit down hard on his lower lip. Sameh lay on his side and knocked two stones together, tapping out a jittery beat. Hares retrieved one of the bullets, stuck his fingernail into the rubber, peeled it like an orange, put the metal ball into his slingshot and fired it back.
Despite the scare, the next time an armored car approached, nearly everyone jumped up and launched an especially exuberant barrage of rocks. The boys, so far as I could tell, were convinced that their stones would eventually disable the Israeli Army. This may one day prove correct, though probably not in the David-versus-Goliath fashion the boys envision. What's clear to many Palestinian leaders but not apparent to the children is that the stones, and those who throw them, are playing an almost purely symbolic role in the war. In Mecca, Muslims throw stones at a statue representing the Devil; it's a centuries-old tradition. In Gaza, Israeli soldiers fill the Devil's role. Stones, the Palestinian leaders know, won't directly defeat the Israelis, but repeated images of rock-throwing youths being shot by highly trained soldiers might turn international opinion against Israel and persuade other Arab nations to join the war. In this way, Palestinian thinking goes, Israel could be defeated and erased from the map, replaced with the nation of Palestine.
After about 10 rubber shots in five minutes, a real bullet was fired. Again, it wasn't clear why. No vehicle seemed to require access to the Karni Road; nothing more lethal than rocks, as far as I could tell, was coming from the Palestinian side. I knew it was a live bullet because the sound was different -- just a hummingbird's whoosh and a quick spray of sand -- and because every boy's eyes instantly popped wide open. But the proof came with the second shot. There was another whoosh, followed by a moment of strained silence, everyone's shoulders instinctively hunched, and then a choking gasp that swiftly accelerated into an agonized cry. Someone was hit. A few feet down the trench there was a burst of whistling and yelling, and a dozen boys raced to the spot. Hands grabbed for the body. The wounded boy was hoisted out of the trench, dropped once, then picked up again and carried into the open. His right thigh was bent in an unnatural way. Blood blossomed on his pants. There was the sound of spinning wheels; a siren.
The Israeli Defense Forces have an official rule of engagement: live ammunition is never to be used unless Israeli soldiers or the people they are protecting are in immediate danger. The situation at Karni crossing, it was explained to me by an army spokesman, fell under this definition. Thrown rocks, I was told, have killed motorists. And for a few hundred Israelis, the Karni Road is their only link to the outside world. Israeli settlers have the right to drive. Palestinian children refuse to vacate the road. Something has to give.
I spent two weeks at Karni during daylight hours, and in my time there, the Israeli Army fired live ammunition almost every day. Sometimes only two or three shots, sometimes a dozen or more. On occasion the shots were fired when cars or buses needed to enter or exit the settlement, at other times I could ascertain no reason for the shooting. Not once did I see or hear a single shot from the Palestinian side. Never during the time I spent at Karni did an Israeli soldier appear to be in mortal danger. Nor was either an Israeli soldier or settler even slightly injured. In that two-week period, at least 11 Palestinians were killed during the day at Karni.
When the ambulance arrived, the wounded Palestinian was pushed inside, and in the commotion I hopped in as well and we sped away. The stone-thrower, an 18-year-old named Ibrahim Abusherif, arched his back and clenched and unclenched his fingers and shouted a single phrase over and over: "Damn the Jews; damn the Jews." His right femur, the medic said, appeared to be shattered. The ambulance rattled across the dirt and onto the cracked pavement, and the bottles and bandages and intravenous bags slid about on their little shelves, and Ibrahim continued to damn the Jews.
At Shifa Hospital, he was hurried into the emergency room and laid on a bed beneath a bare, flickering bulb. The floor was made of rubber tiles, sticky with the blood of previous patients. Elsewhere in the emergency room, behind salmon-colored curtains, were 6 other injured fighters -- a handful of the 40 people who are injured, on average, each day in the clashes in Gaza. The hyperventilated gasps of earnest pain filled the room. On the wall was a poster of a suicide bomber who had blown himself up two weeks before. Written above the poster, in thick black letters, were the words, "He is worth a thousand men." A doctor dug into Ibrahim's thigh and removed three twisted fragments of an M-16 bullet, which he held up like trophies. Then Ibrahim was rolled into surgery.
Rimal Boys' School, the school that the two slain boys attended, is hidden behind a stout cinder-block wall, insulated somewhat from the filth and clamor of Beach Camp. The entrance is a large steel door, upon which was spray-painted "The Student Union Congratulates Our Martyrs." The school's headmaster guided me to one of Ahmed's former classrooms. Forty-four students, all boys, sat two to a wooden desk. (Palestinian girls attend their own schools and rarely appear at the clashes.) The rear wall was decorated with six posters of Ahmed, two posters of Ibrahim and a detailed drawing of a human cell, with the nucleus and cytoplasm and mitochondrion labeled in Arabic. Muhammad, the boy I'd met in the trenches, flashed me a brief, acknowledging smile, then propped his head in his left hand and focused on his book. Ahmed's desk, in the second-to-last row, had been turned into a shrine, decorated with a flag and a head scarf and a bouquet of plastic flowers.
Palestinian schoolbooks tend to offer a rather one-sided view of Middle Eastern history. In some texts, Nazism and Zionism are equated, and Palestinians are portrayed as the true historical stewards of the land. Maps of the region omit Israel entirely and label the land between Lebanon and Egypt as Palestine. According to a widely studied book, "Our Country Palestine," "The Jewish claim to historic rights to Palestine has no justification; it is a deceitful and disproved claim with no parallel in history, a blatant lie."
Every student I spoke with, in the hallways, in classrooms, in the courtyard, insisted that he, too, wanted to be a martyr. "I don't fear the bullets," one boy informed me. "I want to be with God," said another. "I will avenge Ahmed and Ibrahim's deaths," announced a third. This was, I suspected, a form of adolescent bluster, but no one would dare say anything different, especially in front of his friends. In the school's art room, though, the pictures on the walls offered a different perspective. The works were done in colored pencils, and they were nearly all fantasies -- not of violence, but of moments of almost profound simplicity: a family picnicking on a beach; two boys on a swing set; a tennis game on a tree-shaded court.
When school ended for the day, Muhammad agreed to let me walk home with him. Immediately outside the school's gate, he unbuttoned his school shirt to reveal an undershirt advertising his favorite musician, an Iraqi singer named Kazem el-Saher. At a record store he stopped and gazed at some of el-Saher's tapes, but he didn't have any money. Muhammad walked with a teenager's slack-legged gait, strolling along one of Beach Camp's central thoroughfares, which had a V-shaped notch running along the middle, transporting raw sewage to the sea. Beach Camp's idyllic name was bestowed because it abuts the Mediterranean, but the beaches were little more than garbage dumps.
There are no real side streets in Beach Camp, just alleys between the homes so narrow that people can pass one another only by turning sideways. The alleys were a cat's cradle of laundry lines, flush with school uniforms. The houses, concrete cubes with corrugated tin roofs, were packed together and stacked atop one another as if in a warehouse. Trash whirled about. In a vacant lot a few cactus bushes pushed through the sandy soil. Women shuffled their feet listlessly, hauling loads of laundry. Unemployed men sat around playing backgammon. The air smelled of fried fish and charred rubber and fresh mule dung. Small children, many of them barefoot, ran about in hyperkinetic herds, sometimes tossing rocks at one another, or playing marbles, or lighting cardboard fires. Older kids played soccer in the street. The average woman in Gaza gives birth seven times.
A vegetable stand sold a shopping bag's worth of tomatoes for the equivalent of a quarter. Gaza's borders had been sealed by the Israeli Army since the start of the violence -- the strip was now, for all practical purposes, a million-inmate prison. (Even the Internet had been disrupted.) Farmers, who worked humble plots in the few uncrammed corners of Palestinian-controlled Gaza, were prohibited from exporting goods, creating a glut. Most of the season's crops were expected to rot.
Graffiti was everywhere, on the walls of homes and shops and abandoned construction sites. Teams of painters, employed by each of the major political factions, were working daily, whitewashing old slogans and adding new ones, and for those without television or radio, the messages ("Death to Barak"; "On With the Intifada"; "To Jerusalem We Are Going") served as daily updates on the mood of the Palestinian leadership. At Beach Camp's entrance, an Israeli flag was painted on the roadway and both sidewalks, so that anyone passing through had to step on it. Most pedestrians made sure to plant a foot in the center of the six-pointed star.
Muhammad has six brothers and seven sisters. His father, Tayser, is a janitor at Shifa Hospital; his mother, Anaam, owns a tiny shop next to their home. Their family name is Saman. Like many Muslims, Muhammad prays five times a day, though he said he wasn't especially religious. He attends mosque on Fridays, at a new building in Beach Camp where the sermons are usually laced with anti-Jewish screeds. He has never listened to rap music, or eaten at McDonald's, or heard of e-mail.
He sleeps on a reed mat in a room with eight of his siblings. He wakes up at 6 o'clock in the morning and eats a bit of cheese and falafel -- unless I wake up late; then I just run to school." In the rear of his mother's shop, in a metal cage, he keeps his pet birds, a dozen canaries. "I like the way they look and I like the way they sing," he told me. Muhammad recently marked his 15th birthday but hadn't received any presents. The last gift he'd been given was nearly a year before, to mark Id al-Fitr, the post-Ramadan feast. His mother bought him a new pair of pants, the ones he was now wearing, which were too long and rolled at the ankles. In school, he's good at math and carpentry and not that solid in his foreign language, which is English.
Muhammad has never once in his life left the Gaza Strip. Yet when asked where he's from he'll respond, as many in Gaza do, with the name of a town on the other side of the Green Line. His family left Hamman in 1948, soon after Israel declared its statehood, a period during which tens of thousands of Palestinians relocated to Gaza, which was then under Egyptian control. Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War, and the settlements were soon established. Muhammad's parents have told him stories about Hamman -- though they, too, have never been there. "It's a small town," Muhammad told me. "It's filled with olive trees. There are big fields, and the soil is good. The water is good. It's healthy to live there."
If Muhammad had the power to end the conflict, this is what he'd do: "I'd give Palestinians back all of their homeland, and I'd send the Israelis to the countries they came from."
And if the Israelis refused to leave?
"Then I'd kill them."
I asked Muhammad what he'd buy if he had money. "A gun," he said. The last two summers, he added, he attended a sleep-away camp where he learned to shoot M-16's and Kalashnikovs, firing at targets dressed up like Israeli soldiers. The camp was financed by the Palestinian National Authority, the governing body of the Palestinian-controlled areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This summer he's going again. As soon as he's 16, he told me, he'll join the Palestinian security services.
What would you buy, I asked him, if you could purchase more than just a gun?
"I'd buy a tank," he said.
But what if there were peace? Then what would you buy?
Muhammad thought for a second. He looked upward, as if calculating something, then grinned in a way that involved his entire face. "I'd buy a bicycle," he said. "A mountain bike. I'd buy a cell phone. I'd buy a bed, and a bedroom, and a desk, and a soccer ball. And a TV. And chocolate. I'd buy a lot of chocolate. I love chocolate."
On the way to Muhammad's house, we stopped at Martyrs' Square, the centerpiece of Beach Camp, where a plaque lists 73 names of men and boys from the camp who have died fighting the Israelis. A ceremony known as a "martyr's wedding" was being held for Ahmed and Ibrahim. A large green tarp had been stretched over much of the square for the three-day celebration. Men sat in plastic chairs, drinking coffee and smoking apple-flavored tobacco from elegant water pipes. There were streamers hung with miniature Palestinian flags, and a disk jockey played the theme music of the uprising, most notably "Jerusalem Never Dies," by the Egyptian singer Hani Shaker. Here, the graffiti reached critical mass; every political group had painted a sign congratulating Ahmed and Ibrahim for dying in the service of God. There were a pair of billboard-size murals, one of a burning Israeli flag, the other of a young boy hurling a stone. Kids jumped around on the empty chairs. A banner flew overhead, courtesy of the Popular Liberation Front: "If You Want to Die -- Die a Martyr, Amid the Bullets."
The festival felt neither weddinglike nor funereal. It was odd, stilted, like an ill-rehearsed play. Ahmed's father, Sliman, was sitting in the center of the square fingering a strand of prayer beads. People were all around him, yet he appeared to be alone. He had a gray mustache and a drawn face and curly hair, tinted with some of the red I'd seen in Ahmed's hair. "I'm proud of my son; he fought for our homeland," he said, avoiding eye contact, his voice a monotone. "He was very brave. A very brave boy."
The women gathered at the family home, one street away. Ahmed had seven brothers and two sisters, all of whom lived in two underfurnished rooms. Ahmed's mother, Afaf, sat cross-legged in her black robe, clutching her son's book bag, surrounded by friends and relatives. There was an old yellow refrigerator in the corner and a ceiling fan overhead, but no electricity. A tray of dates served as refreshments. Unlike Ahmed's father, Afaf was animated and emotive and loud. What she said, though, bore no relation to what she was asked. She was simply chanting phrases. "I am proud," she said. "so proud. Look at how beautiful his wedding is. What a grand celebration. Thanks be to God. Did you see how his face shone? Oh, he is still alive! I will give all my children, if that's what it takes to get our homeland back. All of them can become martyrs. It will be a dignity to me."
At Karni crossing, several of the boys casually mentioned that dying would not only transport them to paradise, it would also bring riches to their families. When a Palestinian is martyred in the war, no matter his age, the Palestinian National Authority issues a one-time payment of $2,000 to his family, followed by monthly payments of $150 that continue until the last child has left the house. The Red Crescent, an Islamic relief organization, contributes an additional $2,500. And the government of Iraq donates $10,000 to every martyr's family. Saddam Hussein has pledged $4.5 million to the Palestinian Authority -- enough to cover 450 martyrs -- and Gaza newspapers frequently run ads from martyrs' families thanking the Iraqi leader for his largess.
Ahmed's father told me that the Palestinian Authority's payment had already been delivered. The $2,000 came in an envelope, in United States currency. He was expecting the rest of the money in a matter of days. The first thing he planned to purchase, he said, was a set of Korans imprinted with Ahmed's name. He'd distribute them to his friends in Beach Camp. Next, he'd buy a carpet for the mosque. Finally, he said, with the remainder of the money, the family would buy a house. "We are 12 people living in two rooms," he explained. He said he was looking for a little plot of land, where the family could grow olive trees. This is what Ahmed would have wanted, he mentioned. He had been unemployed for some time and said that there was no other way the family would ever be able to leave Beach Camp. "Ahmed always asked why we couldn't move out of this camp and have a nice house," he said. "Now we can." His wife, he added, was pregnant. The notion of an impending birth caused him to pause and, for the first time during our conversation, look directly at me and smile. "If it's a boy," he announced, "we'll name him Ahmed."
Muhammad's home is a few steps from Martyrs' Square, down one of Beach Camp's narrow alleys. There were three rooms, two with dirt floors covered by rattan mats and one with a cement floor overlaid by a flowered carpet, the family's most valuable possession. The kitchen consisted of a few aluminum pots and a tiny propane stove, like one that might be used on a camping trip. There was no furniture. All of the family's clothes were kept in suitcases or plastic bags, as if, after 52 years, they still hadn't decided to move in.
Anaam, Muhammad's mother, was sitting in her store, a windowless box that sold soda, candy, eggs, flour, teacups and tampons. She wore a black-and-white checkered head cloth and a brick-red robe; her 5-year-old daughter, Esraam, sat on her lap. The store is a popular place, mainly because neighborhood kids know that they can stop by after school and Anaam will give them each a free piece of candy. There was electricity and a television, which was perpetually tuned to the Palestinian network, where endless images of Israeli soldiers' brutality accompanied a soundtrack of nationalistic songs. Muhammad and I slipped behind the counter and sat down.
"You know," said Muhammad's mother, gazing at her son, "he goes to sleep scared and he wakes up scared." Muhammad sunk into his seat and rolled his feet on edge. When a friend of his stopped by a minute later, he made his escape. Anaam kept talking. She explained what happened to Raed, her oldest son. Raed is 28 years old. In 1995, he was shot in the mouth while stoning Israeli soldiers. The family can't afford dental work, and so he still has no teeth. Then she told me about her husband. It was a few months before Raed was shot, during a time the Israelis had imposed a strict curfew on Gaza. Her husband heard the 5 a.m. call to prayer and decided, defiantly, to walk to the mosque. A group of five soldiers caught him just outside the house and began beating him. The family rushed out to see what was happening. Muhammad watched as the soldiers broke his father's right arm with a billy club. He watched as they pounded his legs. "He started screaming: 'My dad is dying! My dad is dying!"' said Anaam. "He wanted to go after the soldiers, and I had to hold him back. I had to tell him no, you can't go after them."
Ever since then, she said, Muhammad has harbored a frightening anger. "He's told me, 'Mom, I've had enough of this life,' and it's made me scared. I've told him: 'Muhammad, please don't. You're too young. You're still a child.' But when the boys see their friends killed, they get angry, and they go to the clashes. Even if he'll go to heaven, no mother wants her child to die. I've told him that throwing stones at Jews will not make him a martyr. I've told him the real sacrifice is staying at home and helping care for his family. If you die doing that, I said, then you're a real martyr. I've told him that if he goes to the front and dies, then I'll be angry at him, and you know how God is -- God will never accept your martyrdom if your mother is angry at you. He said, 'O.K., Mom, I'll stay.' But every time he asks for a shekel I'm worried that it's for a cab to go to the clashes. I worry that the neighbors will come by and say, 'Congratulations, your boy is a martyr.' The last two days, since Ibrahim and Ahmed have gone, I've just sat and looked at him, at how beautiful he is."
And then she pulled her scarf over her eyes and began to sob.
I found Muhammad just down the alley from the store, playing marbles with his friend. He'd taken his bird cage out, and his canaries were taking in a bit of sun. It was late in the afternoon, and the shadows were long. There was a clanging of the water truck's bell, and the neighborhood women grabbed their containers and headed into the street. The sky held the contrail of an Israeli fighter jet; on patrol, as always. Muhammad looked at me with a crooked face and asked if I told his mom that he'd gone to the clashes. I shook my head no. He shifted closer and whispered that he'd once stolen a shekel from the shop's till, so that he could take a cab to Karni crossing. I said that his mom would be very upset, and he said that he knew.
"Are you sure," I asked, "that you want to be a martyr?"
"Yes," he said. "I want to be a martyr."
"Do you know what that means?"
"Throwing stones and Molotovs."
"No," I said, curious. "That's not what it means. It means dying."
"I'll take a bullet in the leg," he said.
"That doesn't make you a martyr. You would have to take one in the head."
"My brother was shot in the head."
"To be a martyr," I said, "it has to go all the way through. Are you sure you want to be a martyr?"
"No," said Muhammad. "I want to be an architect."
Finding a comfortable position in the hold was hopeless. The hull was V-shaped, and large waves sent everyone sliding into the center, tossing us about like laundry. I exchanged hellos with the people around me -- Wesley and Tijuan and Wedell and Andien -- but there seemed nothing further to say. Every hour, an electronic watch chirped from somewhere in the dark. One man read from a scrap of a paperback book, Chapters 29 through 33 of a work called "Garden of Lies." From here and there came the murmurs of sleep. The occasional, taut conversations between Stephen and David consisted primarily of reveries about reaching America. David said that he wanted to work in the fields, picking tomatoes or watermelon. His dream was to marry an American woman. Stephen's fantasy was to own a pickup truck, a red one.
The rules of the boat had been established by Gilbert. Eight people were allowed on deck at once; the rest had to remain in the hold. Six spots were reserved by Gilbert and the crew. The other two were filled on a rotating basis -- a pair from the deck switched with a pair from the hold every 20 minutes or so. This meant each person would be allowed out about once every six hours. A crowded deck, Gilbert explained, would interfere with the crew and rouse the suspicions of passing boats. More important, people were needed in the hold to provide ballast -- too much weight up top and the boat would tip.
Of the 46 people on the boat, 5 were women. They were crammed together into the nether reaches of the hold, visible only as silhouettes. The further back one crawled into the hold, the hotter it got. Where the women were it must have been crippling. Occasionally they braided one another's hair, but they appeared never to speak. They were the last to be offered time on deck, and their shifts seemed significantly shorter than those of the men.
The oldest person on the boat was a 40-year-old passenger named Desimeme; the youngest was 13-year-old Kenton. The average age was about 25. Unlike the migrants of the early 90's, who tended more heavily to be families and rural peasants, most Haitian escapees are now young, urban males. The reason for this shift is probably an economic one. In recent years, according to people on le Tortue, the price for a crossing has become vastly inflated, and women and farmers are two of Haiti's lowest-paid groups.
Two hours after leaving, the seasickness began. There was a commotion in the rear of the hold, and people started shouting, and a yellow bucket -- at one time it was a margarine container -- was tossed below. It was passed back. The man who was sick filled it up, and the bucket was sent forward, handed up, dumped overboard and passed back down. A dozen pairs of hands reached for it. The yellow bucket went back and forth. It also served as our bathroom, an unavoidable humiliation we each had to endure. Not everyone could wait for the bucket to arrive, and in transferring the container in pitching seas it was sometimes upended. The contents mingled with the water that sloshed ankle-deep about the bottom of the hold. The stench was overpowering.
One of the sickest people on board was Kenton, the 13-year-old boy. He lay jackknifed next to me in the hold, clutching his stomach, too ill to grab for the bucket. I slipped him a seasickness pill, but he was unable to keep it down. Kenton was a cousin of one of the crew members. He had been one of the last people to board the boat. In the scramble to fill the final spots, there was no room for both him and his parents, so he was sent on alone. His parents, I'd overheard, had promised that they'd be on the very next boat, and when Kenton boarded he was bubbly and smiling, as if this were going to a grand adventure. Now he was obviously petrified, but also infused with an especially salient dose of Haitian mettle -- as he grew weaker he kept about him an iron face. Never once did he cry out. He had clearly selected a favorite shirt for the voyage: a New York Knicks basketball jersey.
This did not seem like the appropriate time to eat, but dinner was ready. The boat's stove, on deck, was an old automobile tire rim filled with charcoal. There was also a large aluminum pot and a ladle. The meal consisted of dumplings and broth -- actually, boiled flour balls and hot water. Most people had brought a bowl and spoon with them, and the servings were passed about in the same manner as the bucket. When the dumplings were finished, Hanson, one of the crew members, came down into the hold. He was grasping a plastic bag that was one of his personal possessions. Inside the bag was an le Tortue specialty -- ground peanuts and sugar. He produced a spoon from his pocket, dipped it into the bag, and fed a spoonful to the man nearest him, carefully cupping his chin as if administering medicine. Then he wormed his way through the hold, inserting a heaping spoon into everyone's mouth. His generosity was appreciated, but the meal did little to help settle people's stomachs. The yellow bucket was again in great demand.
Hours trickled by. There was nothing to do, no form of diversion. The boat swayed, the sun shone, the heat intensified. People were sick; people were quiet. Eyes gradually dimmed. Everyone seemed to have withdrawn into themselves, as in the first stages of shock. Heads bobbed and hung, fists clenched and opened. Thirst was like a tight collar about our throats. It was the noiselessness of the suffering that made it truly frightening -- the silent panic of deep fear.
Shortly before sunset, when we'd been at sea nearly 12 hours, I was allowed to take my second stint on deck. By now there was nothing around us but water. The western sky was going red and our shadows were at full stretch. The sail snapped and strained against its rigging; the waves, at last, sounded like waves. Gilbert was standing at the prow, gazing at the horizon, a hand cupped above his eyes, and as I watched him a look of concern came across his face. He snapped around, distressed, and shouted one word: "Hamilton!" Everyone on deck froze. He shouted it again. Then he pointed to where he'd been staring, and there, in the distance, was a ship of military styling, marring the smooth seam between sea and sky. Immediately, I was herded back into the hold.
A Hamilton, Stephen whispered, is Haitian slang for a Coast Guard ship -- it's also, not coincidentally, the name of an actual ship. The news flashed through the hold, and in reflexive response everyone crushed deeper into the rear, away from the opening, as though this would help avoid detection. Gilbert paced the deck, manic. He sent two of the crew members down with us, and then he, too, descended. He burrowed toward his cubby, shoving people aside, unlocked the door and wedged himself in. And then he began to chant, in a steady tone both dirgelike and defiant. The song paid homage to Agwe, the Voodoo spirit of the sea, and when Gilbert emerged, still chanting, several people in the hold took up the tune, and then he climbed up and the crew began chanting, too. It was an ethereal tune, sung wholly without joy, a signal of desperate unity that seemed to imply we'd sooner drift to Nova Scotia than abandon our mission. Some of these people, it seemed, really were willing to sacrifice their lives to try and get to America. Our captain was one of them.
Over the singing came another sound, an odd buzz. Then there were unfamiliar voices -- non-Haitian voices, speaking French. In the hold, people snapped out of their stupor. Stephen grabbed his necklace. David chewed on the meat of his palm. I stood up and peeked out. The buzz was coming from a motorized raft that had pulled beside us. Six people were aboard, wearing orange life vests imprinted with the words u.s. coast guard. Gilbert was sitting atop one of our water drums, arms folded, flashing our interlopers a withering look. Words were shouted back and forth -- questions from the Coast Guard, blunt rejoinders from Gilbert.
"Where are you headed?"
"Miami."
"Do you have docking papers?"
"No."
"What are you transporting?"
"Rice."
"Can we have permission to board?"
"No."
There was nothing further. In the hold everyone was motionless. People tried not to breathe. Some had their palms pushed together in prayer. One man pressed his fingertips to his forehead. Soon I heard the buzz again, this time receding, and the Coast Guard was gone. Gilbert crouched beside the scuttle and spoke. This had happened on his last crossing, he said. The Coast Guard just comes and sniffs around. They were looking for drugs, but now they've gone. Then he mentioned one additional item. As a precaution, he said, nobody would be allowed onto the deck, indefinitely.
The reaction to this news was subtle but profound. There was a general exhalation, as if we'd each been kicked in the stomach, and then a brief burst of conversation -- more talking than at any time since we'd set sail. The thought of those precious minutes on deck had been the chief incentive for enduring the long hours below. With Gilbert's announcement, something inside of me -- some scaffolding of fortitude -- broke. We'd been at sea maybe 14 hours; we had a hundred to go, minimum. Ideas swirled about my head, expanding and consuming like wildfire. I thought of drowning, I thought of starving, I thought of withering from thirst.
Then, as if he'd read my mind, David took my right hand and held it. He held it a long time, and I felt calmer. He looked at my eyes; I looked at his. This much was clear: David wasn't willing to heed his own words. He wasn't prepared to die. He was terrified, too. This wasn't something we discussed until much later, though he eventually admitted it.
When David let go of my hand, the swirling thoughts returned. I wrestled with the idea of triggering the Epirb. People were weak -- I was weak -- and it occurred to me that I had the means to save lives. But though pressing the button might lead to our rescue, it would certainly dash everyone's dreams. There was also the concern that I'd be caught setting it off, the repercussions of which I did not want to ponder. I made a decision.
"Chris," I said. I was whispering.
"Yes."
"I'm going to use the thing."
"Don't."
"Don't?"
"No, don't. Wait."
"How long?"
"Just wait."
"I don't think I can."
"Just wait a little."
"O.K. I'll wait a little."
I waited a little, a minute at a time. Four more hours passed. Then, abruptly, the buzz returned. Two buzzes. This time there was no conversation, only the clatter of Coast Guard boots landing on our deck. At first, it seemed as though there might be violence. The mood in the hold was one of reckless, nothing-to-lose defiance. I could see it in the set of people's jaws, and in the vigor that suddenly leapt back into their eyes. This was our boat; strangers were not invited -- they were to be pummeled and tossed overboard, like the old man who had tried to stow away. Then lights were shined into the hold, strong ones. We were blinded. There was no place for us to move. The idea of revolt died as quickly as it had ignited. Eighteen hours after we'd set sail, the trip was over.
Six at a time, we were loaded into rubber boats and transported to the Coast Guard cutter Forward, a ship 270 feet long and nine stories high. It was 4 o'clock in the morning. Nobody struggled, no weapons were drawn. We were frisked and placed in quarantine on the flight deck, in a helicopter hangar. Three Haitians were so weak from dehydration that they needed assistance walking. The Coast Guard officers were surprised to see journalists on board, but we were processed with the other Haitians. We were each supplied with a blanket, a pair of flip-flops and a toothbrush. We were given as much water as we could drink. We were examined by a doctor. The Forward's crew members wore two layers of latex gloves whenever they were around us.
The Forward's commanding officer, a 19-year Coast Guard veteran named Dan MacLeod, came onto the flight deck. He pulled me aside. The Coast Guard, he said, had not lost sight of our boat since we'd first been spotted. He'd spent the previous four hours contacting Haitian authorities, working to secure an S.N.O. -- a Statement of No Objection -- that would permit the Coast Guard to stop a Haitian boat in international waters. When David and Stephen learned of this, they were furious. There is the feeling among many Haitians of abandonment by the United States -- or worse, of manipulation. American troops helped restore Aristide to power, then they vanished. Now, because there is democracy in Haiti, the United States has a simple excuse for rejecting Haitian citizenship claims: Haitians are economic, not political migrants. For those Haitians who do enter America illegally -- the United States Border Patrol estimates that between 6,000 and 12,000 do so each year -- it is far better to try to seep into the fabric of the Haitian-American community than to apply for asylum. In 1999, 92 percent of Haitian asylum claims were rejected.
As soon as the Haitian government granted permission, the Coast Guard had boarded our boat. Though illegal migrants were suspected to be on board -- two large water barrels seemed a bit much for just a crew -- the official reason the boat had been intercepted, Officer MacLeod told me, was because we were heading straight for a reef. "You were off course from Haiti about two degrees," he said. "That's not bad for seat-of-the-pants sailing, but you were heading directly for the Great Inagua reef. You hadn't altered your course in three hours, and it was dark out. When we boarded your vessel you were 2,200 yards from the reef. You'd have hit it in less than 40 minutes."
Our boat running against a reef could have been lethal. The hull, probably, would have split. The current over the reef, Officer MacLeod informed me, is unswimmably strong. The reef is as sharp as a cheese grater. The Epirb would not have helped.
Even if we'd managed to avoid the reef -- if, by some good fortune, we'd changed course at the last minute -- we were still in danger. Officer MacLeod asked me if I'd felt the boat become steadier as the night progressed. I said I had. "That's the first sure sign you're sinking," he said. There was more. "You were in three-to-four-foot seas. At six-foot seas, you'd have been in a serious situation, and six-foot seas are not uncommon here. Six-foot seas would've taken that boat down." When I mentioned that we'd expected the trip to take four or five days, Officer MacLeod laughed. "They were selling you a story," he said. In the 18 hours since leaving Haiti, we had covered 30 miles. We'd had excellent conditions. The distance from Haiti to Nassau was 450 miles. Even with miraculous wind, it could have taken us 10 days. The doctor on board said we'd most likely have been dealing with fatalities within 48 hours.
The next day, it turned out, was almost windless. It was hotter than ever. And the seas were choppy -- seven feet at times, one officer reported. Another high-ranking officer added one more bit of information: a Coast Guard ship hadn't been in these waters at any time in the past two weeks. The Forward happened to be heading in for refueling when we were spotted.
Our trip, it appeared, had all the makings of a suicide mission. If there had been no Epirb and no Coast Guard, it's very likely that the Believe in God would have vanished without a trace. And our craft, said Officer MacLeod, was one of the sturdier sailboats he has seen -- probably in the top 20 percent. Most boats that make it, he mentioned, have a small motor. I wondered how many Haitians have perished attempting such a crossing. "That's got to be a very scary statistic," said Ron Labrec, a Coast Guard public affairs officer, though he wouldn't hazard a guess. He said it's impossible to accurately determine how many migrants are leaving Haiti and what percentage of them make it to shore.
But given the extraordinary number of people fleeing on marginal sailboats, it seems very likely that there are several hundred unrecorded deaths each year. Illegal migration has been going on for decades. It is not difficult to imagine that there are thousands of Haitian bodies on the bottom of the Caribbean.
We spent two days on the Forward, circling slowly in the sea, while it was determined where we would be dropped off. On May 16, everyone was deposited on Great Inagua Island and turned over to Bahamian authorities. Chris and I were released and the Haitians were placed in a detention center. The next day they were flown to Nassau and held in another detention center, where they were interviewed by representatives of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. None were found to qualify for refugee status.
As for the Believe in God, the boat came to a swift end. The night we were captured, we stood along the rail of the flight deck as the Forward's spotlight was trained on our boat. It looked tiny in the ink-dark sea. The sail was still up, though the boat was listing heavily. Officer MacLeod had just started telling me about its unseaworthiness. "Watch," he said. As I looked, the mast leaned farther and farther down, as if bowing to the sea, until it touched the water. Then the boat slowly began to sink.
On May 30, all 44 Haitians were flown from Nassau to Port-au-Prince. They received no punishment from Haitian authorities. The next morning, Gilbert returned to le Tortue, already formulating plans for purchasing a second boat and trying to cross once more. Stephen also went home to le Tortue, but was undecided as to whether he'd try the journey again. David went back to Port-au-Prince, back to his small mahogany stand, back to his crumbling shack, where his personal space consisted of a single nail from which he hung the same black plastic bag he'd had on the boat. He said he felt lucky to be alive. He said he would not try again by boat, not ever. Instead, he explained, he was planning on sneaking overland into the Dominican Republic. There were plenty of tourists there and he'd be able to sell more mahogany. He told me he was already studying a new language, learning from a Spanish translation of "The Cat in the Hat" that he'd found in the street.

BYLINE: By Scott McLemee; Scott McLemee is a contributing writer for Lingua Franca.

 BODY:
EVERY familiar complaint about the limits of utopian fiction applies in full to Edward Bellamy's "Looking Backward: 2000-1887" -- a novel first published in 1888 and continuously in print ever since. As fiction, it is a dud. There are countless didactic passages, and only few moments of action or feeling. (Imagine a blueprint with characters.) Bellamy does include a love story -- people in the year 2000 do experience the old passions, it seems -- yet the romance is clearly an afterthought, meant to sweeten the social theory.
Ideas trump narrative; pure reason squeezes emotion to the margins of the text. That has always been the complaint about fictional utopias. And as the abundance of old books on display at the current New York Public Library exhibit "Utopia: The Search for the Ideal Society in the Western World" may suggest, it has always been an essentially "literary" form of the imagination (though artists and filmmakers have added their visions as well). As a genre, utopian fiction is a mutant species -- a hybrid of the fable and the essay. Most mutants don't survive very long; yet "Looking Backward" is a remarkable exception. For all its inherited disabilities, Bellamy's vision has always had an uncommonly firm grip on readers' attention -- and still does, in the very year that his utopia is set in. 
 The plot of "Looking Backward" (such as it is) is pure Victorian-era sci-fi. Julian West, the narrator, is a young Boston Brahmin of the 19th century -- he is tormented by the social chaos of the Gilded Age and also by insomnia. His home contains a special underground chamber, where he can sometimes catch a few winks thanks to soundproof insulation and the services of a professional hypnotist. Through a remarkable sequence of events, West awakens in the year 2000 to find that the poverty, conflict and ugliness of his own era have been forgotten by all but historians.
The social Darwinism of the late 19th century has long since been replaced by an egalitarian order in which all industry is owned by the state. Men and women alike are drafted into a vast "industrial army" that handles the necessary work of society. Domestic drudgery has been abolished, thanks to a system of cafeterias and laundries. Nor is money used any longer, having been replaced by credit cards. Public spaces are clean and artistically appealing. And telephone wires carry orchestral music right into the home.
Fortunately, the narrator is well rested -- giving him the stamina necessary to listen to many lectures on how this ideal society functions. West ventures some predictable 19th-century objections to the idea that an entire economy can be run on benevolence. They are refuted, in some detail. There is also the evidence of his senses: you can't argue with success.
"Looking Backward" carefully avoids calling this arrangement "socialism" -- a word connoting furtive men with European accents, sinister facial hair and bombs. Bellamy also found it disagreeable that contemporary radicals were associated with what he called "all manner of sexual novelties." Instead, the regime bears the label "nationalism" -- which probably sounded wholesome to the 19th-century ear, if less so now.
And all these changes were realized peacefully. Across the decades that West had been sleeping, the growth of monopolies meant that more of the economy fell under the control of ever fewer companies. It proved a painless matter to fuse them into one humongous global corporation -- thereby achieving efficiency through the largest possible economies of scale. With scarcity abolished, altruistic sentiments could naturally flourish. Just before the book closes, the narrator has a vivid nightmare of returning to the dog-eat-dog world of 1887. Then young West awakens and rushes out to the garden to embrace his sweetheart; he is overwhelmed by gratitude at finding himself back in paradise.
The 19th-century public had to envy Julian West. The book's arguments were made so reasonably -- and the economic and technological arrangements sounded so plausible and inviting -- that for a considerable portion of the readership, "Looking Backward" had the feel of inevitability. Sales were brisk in 1888, and astronomical after that. Within a few years, almost half a million copies were in circulation.
By 1890, a prominent American magazine noted that Bellamy's ideas formed one of the leading subjects of conversation, along with tariffs and electric lighting. Countless imitations were published, including such inspired titles as "Looking Further Backward" and (my favorite) "The World a Department Store." Clubs devoted to discussing nationalist doctrine sprang up -- particularly among genteel readers, relieved to think that society could be improved without violent revolution. But labor unionists also embraced Bellamy's vision, as did the newly emerging populist movement among farmers. And like "Uncle Tom's Cabin" (the only book by an American to outsell it in the 19th century), "Looking Backward" became an international sensation. It was translated into all the major European languages, plus Russian, Hebrew, Chinese and Japanese. The essays in the collection "Edward Bellamy Abroad: An American Prophet's Influence" (1962) -- edited by the eminent Bellamy scholar Sylvia Bowman -- give some idea of how profoundly international the audience was for this nationalist vision. (Particularly striking is a photograph showing a classroom of the Bellamy Society in Indonesia, sometime in the 1930's.)
Knowing all this, you can read "Looking Backward" now with a sort of vicarious optimism. But how to account for the change in reader response over the course of a century? After all, the same book that prompted a phenomenal surge of enthusiasm now seems to embody all the basic faults of utopian fiction as a genre: the flatness of tone, the static quality of a diorama, the light coating of sentimentality in the place where human personality ought to be.
One answer is to smirk at the past: people back then were simple, unlike our terribly jaundiced selves; they thought credit cards and music-by-telephone would be liberating! But this attitude is little more than a failure of the imagination. It is easy to sneer at labor-saving devices now, when they are everywhere. Somewhat harder to gainsay is Bellamy's other assumption: that prosperity and convenience would allow people to be more humane and sympathetic and generous with one another. This is terribly nave, of course -- but in a way that scarcely flatters anyone now.
It is possible to look through the other end of the historical telescope: to insist that Bellamy and his readers possessed something we have lost. "Today few imagine that society can be fundamentally improved," writes the historian and social critic Russell Jacoby in the December issue of Harper's Magazine, "and those who do are seen as at best deluded, at worst threatening." It has become a commonplace nowadays that "utopian" is just a polite way of saying "totalitarian." And even Jacoby thinks that the "industrial army" in "Looking Backward" has some disagreeable overtones. But he also argues that utopias (nationalist or otherwise) get a bum rap. Most of the 20th-century horror show was spawned by ethnic tensions and territorial disputes -- with few if any meaningful connections to visions of universal human felicity, like the one Bellamy offers.
This echoes the German philosopher and social critic Jrgen Habermas's claim that we are living through an "exhaustion of utopian energies." A dire prospect indeed: the "exuberance" of utopian thought, Habermas wrote, "seems to have the function of opening up alternatives for action and margins of possibility." The impact of "Looking Backward" would be a case in point: readers were drawn by it into public life. But the book was more than propaganda. Bellamy seized elements familiar to his audience -- monopolies, telephones, the military (that great moral force of the Civil War) -- and found in them something calling to the better angels of our nature.
So the reader in the late 19th century could put down "Looking Backward" and experience a sort of double vision. That is still possible today. For Bellamy himself addresses his readers in the year 2000, and he worries about us -- worries about our easy contempt for the past, our lack of imagination, the exhaustion of our utopian energies.
At the very start of "Looking Backward" -- just before Julian West commences his story -- Bellamy includes a short preface, dated Dec. 26, 2000. In it, a historian at Boston's Shawmut College explains that he wrote the book to remind readers how much has changed over the past century, and how much improvement is possible in the new millennium, which starts in the year 2001. (So much for the idea that utopia is a regime of timeless totalitarian perfection.)
People take what they have for granted; this ingratitude means they can scarcely recognize the need for change. As Bellamy's historian puts it, "The readiness with which men accustom themselves, as matters of course, to improvements in their condition, which, when anticipated, seemed to leave nothing to be desired, could not be more strikingly illustrated." It is a wake-up call to the imagination -- a demand to recognize the silent promise of utopia all around us.

HEADLINE: New Economy;
Bringing Competition Policy Into the Age of the Internet

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
So let's see if this makes any sense.
The government allows the No. 1 Internet provider, America Online, to acquire the No. 2 cable company, Time Warner, but the No. 1 long-distance carrier, AT&T, was not allowed to acquire the No. 2 local phone company, SBC. 
 Bell Atlantic, now known as Verizon Communications, was allowed to buy Nynex, creating the biggest local phone company, but WorldCom was not allowed to acquire Sprint, even though the combined company would have played second fiddle in long distance. At the same time, AT&T was allowed to buy its way to the top of the cable business.
If all this seems confusing, it is. But antitrust experts say that there really is an intellectual consistency lurking there under the covers: deals between direct competitors tend to be rejected, while mergers are often approved between companies that are in the same or related industries but are not direct competitors.
Even though competition policy is not enforced that cleanly in the real world, at least the basic principles are reasonable.
And yet, many of the ways in which the decisions are currently made appear overly rigid. Many of the analytical and intellectual tools that competition authorities use these days were developed for slow-changing industries like manufacturing. But these methods may not be up to the task of dealing equitably with technology sectors where the competitive landscape can change significantly from year to year.
That is why many experts are beginning to question the current state of competition policy and why even some regulators are wondering whether it is time for a new antitrust approach to the new economy -- an approach that tries to take the future into account.
"We are at a potential turning point for competition policy," said Michael K. Powell, the man whom many people in Washington expect to be the next chairman of the Federal Communications Commission -- if he wants the job. "These new information industries pose new questions and not all of the answers are in yet. It presents the challenge of having to wrestle with inherently more speculative predictions about how fast-changing innovations in new markets will unfold."
Mr. Powell, currently a Republican F.C.C. commissioner, would not talk about his professional future. But his comments on the state of competition policy are resonant with those of many other experts.
In important ways, the approval of the America Online-Time Warner deal is a near-perfect reflection of the current state of competition policy. The mere fact that the No. 1 Internet provider is acquiring the No. 2 cable provider does not raise many red flags because America Online and Time Warner have a fairly classic "vertical" relationship.
Companies are considered to have a vertical relationship when they represent different parts of the same production chain, like a manufacturer and a distributor. Companies are generally considered to have a horizontal relationship when they are direct competitors in the same market, like two car makers.
Under the so-called Chicago school of antitrust analysis, named for the University of Chicago, which has been in ascendance since the 1970's, mergers between horizontal competitors are likely to get closer scrutiny than are deals by companies with a vertical relationship.
"There is no question that horizontal problems are easier to understand and are more likely to trigger law enforcement than vertical arrangements," said A. Douglas Melamed, the acting assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division. "Antitrust law is now, and I think quite appropriately, focused on identifying where there might exist a particular competition problem in the sense of the creation of economic power in certain markets. It is not a populist law meant to deal with mere bigness."
Current antitrust law and doctrine make some provision for looking ahead to future developments. But antitrust authorities basically take a snapshot of a horizontal market for a given product and then look at whether a merger would explicitly reduce competition in that market.
The difficulty is that in fast-changing industries, the snapshot approach can lead to outcomes that appear to ignore what is actually happening, or what may reasonably be expected to happen, in the market.
Consider the failed WorldCom-Sprint deal. Here, the No. 2 and No. 3 long-distance companies, fierce competitors, were trying to merge in a classic case of horizontal consolidation. The Justice Department and the European Commission evaluated snapshots of long-distance markets and concluded that the deal would reduce competition significantly.
But what may have been lost in the process is the fact that the Bell local phone giants are jumping into the long-distance market in a huge way, mostly in the voice telephone business but also in the Internet sector. It is fairly clear that in a few years, the Bell companies will be the dominant force in the consumer long-distance market, but no one knows exactly how fast that will happen. The traditional antitrust approach did not seem to be able to deal with that ambiguity.
"WorldCom-Sprint is a great illustration of the limitations of antitrust enforcement," said Joe Sims, a lawyer for America Online and chairman of an American Bar Association task force that is examining the state of antitrust law. "Antitrust is always going to be a lagging indicator rather than a forward indicator, and that was less of a problem when industries were changing more slowly than they are today."
As for the Bell mergers, the case that really set the tone for local phone consolidation was the Bell Atlantic-Nynex merger in 1997. Two de facto monopolies were sitting just across the Hudson River from each other. But the Justice Department took snapshots of the local markets, and because the companies were not already competing, it was unable to conclude that the deal would impede competition.
"That approach, taken to its logical conclusion, would allow all of the Bells and GTE to combine into one massive national monopoly," said James W. Cicconi, general counsel of AT&T, which has tried and failed to block various Bell mergers.
The essential problem seems to be that current antitrust doctrine is not flexible enough to take account of how various communications markets are evolving, or should be expected to evolve.
So what is to be done?
"The problem with the traditional antitrust analysis is that it assumes static markets," said Reed E. Hundt, a former F.C.C. chairman, who shot down AT&T's merger talks with SBC in 1997 at least partly because SBC -- a Bell company -- was not then allowed in the long-distance market. "I think we need a new antitrust for a new economy. It needs to assume dynamic markets."
The problem is that when the government tries to predict the future, it risks falling into a rabbit hole of subjectivity.
"The people who are reviewing these mergers in detail are good and they make some pretty sound decisions," said John Thorne, a deputy general counsel at Verizon. "Their biggest handicap is that what is happening in these markets is very unpredictable. If you start down this other road, you've got to be a pretty good predictor."
Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, contends that changes in antitrust doctrine can be made while preserving the structural checks and balances that lead to sound policy decisions.
"High tech, or more specifically intellectual property markets, are different," Mr. Pitofsky said. "The kind of static analysis that we often have applied in the past, Chicago school and non-Chicago school, is in fact unlikely to be fully adequate to take high tech into account.
"Ultimately, these regulators are going to have to justify what they predict in court," he continued. "And courts have been pretty good in the area of cracking down on what they call conjecture and speculation and asking for evidence of reasonable likely effects."
As the Bush team arrives in Washington, this will be one of its primary challenges in dealing with the new economy -- bringing more flexibility to competition policy while maintaining the rigor of the past.

HEADLINE: E-Commerce Report;
Will bricks-and-mortar merchants grow complacent now that the dot-com boom is quickly fading away?

BYLINE: By Bob Tedeschi 

 BODY:
TRADITIONAL retailers greeted the first strains of the dot-com swan song, when online-only merchants died en masse, as great news. It meant they had at least a little more time to construct their own Internet strategies. But now that the consumer e-commerce landscape looks like it has been struck by a neutron bomb, industry analysts say bricks-and-mortar merchants are breathing a bit too easily.
"There are a lot of incumbent retailers who are sitting back and saying: 'Well, I'm glad that's over. We can get back to traditional business again,' " said James Vogtle, who leads the e-commerce practice of the Boston Consulting Group. "They're reading the current shakeout as a sign that the online channel itself is not viable." 
 Neither Mr. Vogtle nor the other analysts who recently expressed similar sentiments would disclose the names of traditional companies that are slowing down their e-commerce efforts, but the idea is worth noting, particularly if the American economy heads into a recession in the coming months. If traditional merchants let e-commerce slide down their priority lists, technology companies that serve the e-commerce community may be in for even more difficult times than they currently face.
Dawn Robertson, president of Federated Direct, the subsidiary of Federated Department Stores that oversees the Web and catalog operations of Bloomingdale's and Macy's, said her own company was "pushing ahead fast and furious, but that is not true of everyone else."
"I think the rate of growth has slowed for some people," Ms. Robertson said. "There's been a bit less expansion and building" of Internet strategies among traditional retailers.
Ms. Robertson said Federated had indeed felt less pressure to sell all its items on the Web now that so many online-only merchants had died. For instance, she said, "we have a pretty substantial furniture business that we chose not to put online yet. It could've been one of the natural businesses we would have done online, but over the last year, a lot has changed" in the online furniture category. Indeed, two leading online only companies, furniture.com and living.com, have gone out of business.
As for the other categories of goods the company sells, Ms. Robertson said "we're continuing to focus, edit, and refine our space on the Internet. There's no complacency here."
Lisa Allen, an analyst with Forrester Research, a technology consulting firm, said, "The smart retailers are not giving up on the Web. They're working hard and spending the bucks to figure out how to integrate all their channels, because they know that when they do, their customers' spending jumps."
Indeed, Forrester and other consulting firms have found that customers who shop at a company's online and offline stores tend to spend more than those who shop at one or the other. A study by McKinsey & Company found that so-called "multichannel" shoppers spend more than twice the amount of single-channel shoppers.
Although those at the vanguard of traditional retailing have the money to aggressively follow this strategy, Ms. Allen said those who are neither at the cutting edge nor the trailing edge are in a difficult position. "They need to embrace new technologies," she said, "but they're saddled with big old legacy systems and minuscule budgets, and they have to meet their numbers every quarter."
She added, "Promises of what e-commerce will do are hard to swallow when you need to make your numbers next month." Ms. Allen said she has told executives at traditional retail companies that "the demise of the dot-coms is a great opportunity to go in and grab a dynamite URL like eToys, or buy the tools or functionality that a dot-com has created. But I still see far too much hesitancy. I think it comes down to complacency, and not having enough money, and the simple fact that retailing has been around for a thousand years, and there are traditions that are tough to change."
Some retail executives are hardly apologetic when it comes to their tortoise-like approach to adopting e-commerce. "We've been called a dinosaur," said Ron Griffin, chief information officer of Home Depot. "The fact is, we're moving very methodically. We take steps, make sure we're managing things appropriately, pay as we go, and shift spending as we need to."
Home Depot is still in the early stages of its Internet rollout. Rather than build a central warehouse and ship items all over the country, as other traditional merchants have done, the company has opted to point customers to the Web site of the Home Depot store nearest them. The site will keep an up-to-date count of a particular store's items, and will ship goods to customers from that store. The company tested the strategy in the Austin, Tex., and Las Vegas markets this fall, and will soon test the San Antonio markets, a spokesman said.
"I know that what we do runs counter to the people who said, 'Damn the cost, damn the torpedoes and profitability, the name of the game is market share,' " Mr. Griffin said. "You have to get market share in a way that maintains profitability."
Be they slow or complacent, traditional retailers are beginning to think about what future e-commerce efforts will look like if, in fact, the economy heads toward a recession. With little competition from e-tailers, and more incentive to concentrate on the parts of the business that are producing profits today, analysts said retailers could slow e-commerce spending significantly if a recession hits.
"For many, it will definitely slow down their e-commerce investments," said Ms. Allen of Forrester. "But again, for the smarter ones, this would be an opportunity. When money gets tight, you want to be sure you're getting the biggest bang for your buck, and the efficiencies the Web brings to marketing can increase that bang."
For instance, Ms. Allen said strategically aimed e-mail advertising gives businesses a way to accurately measure the success of a campaign, whereas offline ads offer no such benefits.
Ms. Robertson, of Federated, agreed that a recession would bring cutbacks in overall e-commerce spending by traditional retailers. "They won't abandon it, but there won't be as wild a pace of spending as there was," she said. "There will be more focused spending. It won't be as emotional a decision as it once was."
If and when the economy contracts, Ms. Robertson also said bricks-and-mortar retailers will weather the recession better than the Internet companies, assuming that there are any left standing. "Bricks-and-mortar companies have been through great economies, we've been through recessions, and we continue to survive," she said. "That's why the bricks-and-mortars win."

HEADLINE: Mining an Untapped Market, Radio One Becomes a Force

BYLINE: By CLEA SIMON 

 BODY:
Consolidation has brought hundreds of radio stations into the mainstream embrace of giant companies like Clear Channel and Viacom's Infinity, but it has also left some audiences out in the cold.
The trend, though, has created an opportunity for Radio One, a family-controlled radio company that has built a thriving business by serving one audience overlooked by the giants: urban African-Americans. 
 Not that Radio One is tiny. Since going public in May 1999, after two decades as a private company, Radio One has achieved a stock market value of nearly $1 billion. With stations in Los Angeles, Detroit, Philadelphia, Atlanta and more than a dozen other major cities, Radio One is the largest broadcast group controlled by African-Americans in the country, owning 48 stations. It has only two big metropolitan gaps in its holdings, although they are significant gaps indeed: New York and Chicago.
By offering listeners a mix of hip-hop and rap on some stations and rhythm-and-blues on others, Radio One is mining a market that its 35-year-old chief executive, Alfred C. Liggins III, thinks other media companies are mistaken to overlook.
"I call the African-American market the emerging market in the domestic market," said Mr. Liggins, a Wharton M.B.A. who assumed the chief executive job two years ago from the company's founder -- his mother, Catherine L. Hughes. "As companies are looking to break into China and other countries around the globe," he said, "they should really be looking here."
Mr. Liggins's target market has a household income that is growing faster than the national average and yet has been largely ignored by advertisers. Between 1972 and 1998, factoring for inflation, average African-American household income grew 16.3 percent, to $25,351, significantly outpacing the 9.2 percent growth rate for total United States households, according to Banc of America Securities, which predicts continued growth.
"Radio One can lay out the facts and figures that this is a very attractive group for advertisers," said W. Timothy Wallace, a Banc of America Securities senior broadcasting analyst.
The methods Radio One uses to reach this audience have changed little since Ms. Hughes borrowed heavily to buy her first station, WOL, a 1,000-watt AM station in Washington, for $900,000 in 1980.
Ms. Hughes's broadcasting experience had come from running WHUR, the station of Howard University, the prestigious and predominantly black university in Washington. She programmed her new station for the inner-city audience, making WOL a forum for African-American issues and an advocate for the homeless and often bringing local political leaders into the studio for interviews.
It was not the best time to be starting a business, with inflation raging and interest rates heading into double-digit range. Divorced and concerned with saving money to send her son to college, Ms. Hughes went 18 months without being able to give herself a paycheck and was forced to sell her car and home to stay solvent. For a short time she even lived at the station. "It did not matter to me where I slept and ate as long as I kept my radio station alive," Ms. Hughes recalled in a recent interview.
People who knew her back then remember her persistence. "It was a tough time to be in the center of the city," said Robert Unmacht, former publisher of the M Street group of radio trade publications. "She was known by everybody and involved in everything, and she put a lot of effort into building the business, which was by no means a sure thing."
To save money, Ms. Hughes made herself the morning host on the station, which focused on local talk. The resulting mix of activism, chat and District of Columbia politics eventually made the little station profitable and paved the way for the acquisition of her second station, WMMJ-FM in Washington, seven years later.
For WMMJ, Ms. Hughes envisioned an adult African-American audience eager to hear rhythm-and-blues. But her primary lender, the now defunct DC National Bank, cautiously sought to keep the station playing its established format of soft mainstream pop from the likes of Barbra Streisand and Melissa Manchester.
"We're in a city with a 75 percent black population, on a station purchased by a woman who is a community activist, and you give us Barry Manilow?" Ms. Hughes said, laughing gently at the memory. The format fared so badly that during one ratings period, the station was reported as having no listeners.
The bank finally relented. And within two years, playing the gentle rhythm-and-blues of performers like Barry White and Smokey Robinson, the station was attracting listeners and advertisers -- and turning a profit.
What Ms. Hughes had developed at WMMJ in Washington became the formula for Radio One, whose headquarters are now in Lanham, Md. The company takes smaller, underperforming metropolitan stations and focuses them on specific parts of a city -- not only ethnically and demographically, but geographically, too. Radio One's engineers carefully calibrate the transmitters to coax the maximum power from the stations to reach the target neighborhoods.
"African-Americans tend to live in certain areas in the community," Mr. Liggins said. "They tend to be concentrated. So if you're serving that community, you don't need to have enough power to cover the entire market."
A financial advantage to this strategy, Mr. Liggins acknowledged, is that it enables Radio One to acquire lower-power, lower-priced stations. The company's most recent purchase, WILD, an AM station Radio One acquired in Boston in November, was $5 million. (Compared, for example, with the $26 million that another Boston AM station, WEEI, fetched two years ago.)
What Radio One's stations put on the air counts for a lot, too, of course. The goal is to serve the African-American community "from cradle to grave," as Mr. Liggins puts it.
In markets like Houston, Baltimore and Philadelphia, that means at least two stations. One plays the hot, rhythmic music that is usually labeled "urban," performed by rappers and hip-hop artists like Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg and OutKast and designed to appeal to teenagers and young adults.
At least one other Radio One station in such markets, meanwhile, aims for adult listeners by focusing on the softer, smoother rhythm-and-blues sound that Ms. Hughes first took to Washington. These days, that is likely to mean Montell Jordan and Angie Stone as well as classics by Barry White and Marvin Gaye. Always part of the mix, Ms. Hughes said, are community issues, like this fall's voter registration drives by all the Radio One stations, or the radio marathon by the company's four Baltimore stations that raised money for city residents left homeless by a broken water main.
There are other radio companies controlled by African-Americans, like Blue Chip Broadcasting, which is based in Cincinnati, and Inner City Broadcasting, which is based in New York and owns five stations that include WBLS-FM in the city.
Blue Chip and Inner City remain privately held, though, and have neither the market reach nor the financial power of Radio One. "In most of the markets where Radio One has stations, it doesn't have direct competition," said Ron Rodrigues, editor in chief of the trade publication Radio & Records.
In some ways, Radio One is pursuing an ethnic strategy made successful by Spanish-language radio groups like the Hispanic Broadcasting Network, a public company based in Dallas that is building a national audience, local market by local market. But compared with the Hispanic radio market, the African-American market remains significantly undervalued, in the view of stock analysts like Mr. Wallace.
Paradoxically, consolidation among the larger mainstream radio companies has helped make properties available for Radio One's expansion. In August, it purchased a dozen stations for about $1.3 billion from Clear Channel, taking Radio One into Houston, Dallas and Los Angeles. Clear Channel had been forced to sell the properties to stay within federal ownership rules after merging with the broadcasting company AMFM.
Radio One is also adding two more Dallas stations, having purchased airwave rights for one station from Infinity Broadcasting and conducting negotiations with Sunburst Media for another.
"Those additional stations and markets make the company the unchallenged leader in African-American radio," said Tom Taylor, editor of the M Street trade publications.
The next challenge will be managing the company's growth and its emergence as a national player. The family remains in charge, with Ms. Hughes and Mr. Liggins controlling 55.6 percent of the voting stock. But the transition from a longtime private company into a publicly held corporation has not been without stumbles.
In September, for example, cautious comments at an analysts' conference by Mr. Liggins, warning of a slowdown in advertising revenues for the third quarter, helped trigger a sell-off in Radio One shares, which plunged from the $19 range to below $6 within a few weeks.
"It caught investors somewhat off guard," Mr. Wallace said. But Radio One then beat analysts' forecasts by posting revenue of $42.9 million. For the quarter, the company reported a net loss of $4 million, which it said was the result of tax consequences of the August deal to buy stations from Clear Channel.
Earlier this month, the company said it expected revenue to grow 10 to 13 percent next year, higher than average for the mature radio business. And with no direct competition and an increasingly affluent audience, Radio One is being rated as a strong buy by the analysts who follow the stock, which closed Friday at $10.13.
"There are other radio companies out there that have some urban-oriented formats, but Radio One is the only one that is dedicated to these formats; this gives them greater clout with advertisers," said Paul T. Sweeney, broadcasting analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston.
Mr. Liggins, like most radio company executives these days, sees new technologies like Internet broadcasting and distribution over cable and other broadband conduits as possible areas for future expansion.
But he still sees plenty of growth ahead for Radio One in conventional broadcasting -- particularly if any affordable stations go up for sale in New York or Chicago.
"Just in acquisition-related growth alone we can double the size of the company," he said. "Urban music, R&B music is not just African-American. Because the music is so huge, it gives us entree into a crossover culture. That makes us not just an African-American company but an urban company."

HEADLINE: REVISIONS;
Horrific, Heroic or Banal, Black Life in the Artist's Lens

BYLINE: By Margo Jefferson 

 BODY:
Going page by page through Deborah Willis's grand book "Reflections in Black: A History of Black Photographers, 1840 to the Present" was what finally made it possible for me to go, page by page, through "Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America," where the earliest photo dates from 1870 (lynchings took place earlier) and the last from 1960 (lynchings took place later, too).
The "Reflections in Black" exhibition, organized by Ms. Willis, is touring the country and has yet to come to New York City. I had seen an exhibition of the lynching photographs last winter at the New-York Historical Society; I found them horrific and necessary to look at, but at the time paying money for the book felt embarrassingly voyeuristic, even a little obscene. 
 As to why I would discuss lynching photographs during religious and festive holidays: if such holidays mean anything, it is because these celebrations mean taking questions of brutality, sacrifice and redemption seriously. And as visual evidence and testimony, "Reflections in Black" helps repudiate once again the awful lies and obsessions that created lynching.
The images in "Without Sanctuary" (Twin Palms Press) belong to several genres. Like the pictures of Cambodian prisoners taken by their interrogators and torturers, they record what we can call civil war crimes. The lynching pictures were taken by local or traveling photographers who made a killing (pun intended) selling them to the citizens. The images are also what the historian Leon F. Litwack calls, in his introduction, race pornography: they were often made into picture postcards that were mailed, with curt, gleeful or venomous messages to friends and foes with nary a peep from the United States postal authorities.
They are visual anthropology, too. You can't look at these black bodies, beaten, burned and hanging from trees, lampposts and bridges, without thinking of the savage blood-lust rituals that scholars spend their lives investigating in other countries. Then you read about the gap between the accusations (the favorites were murder, rape or attempted rape of a white person) that led to the lynchings and the actual facts behind them (black economic success, union organizing or the kinds of things whites did constantly and got minor or no punishment for, like gambling, stealing a pair of shoes and "talking big" or simply displaying "utter worthlessness.")
You start looking at the perpetrators and spectators who treated lynchings as family affairs, civic celebrations, picnics (the preferred term was "Negro barbecue") and some kind of sexual catharsis. A lot of the men have the rugged dusty look of bit players in old westerns, and they strike movie attitudes for the camera or clasp the ankles of the dead man sternly.
Some wear white shirts, ties and straw boaters. (One young man with immaculately styled hair looks dressed to call on his sweetheart once the lynching's done.) And they give their children private viewings. The virtue of white womanhood is upheld by placing one's daughters (in crisp little dresses) around the tree from which a black man hangs. The black servant is there, too, in her white uniform. She has managed to turn away.
What anthropologists would not ask who these people were with their primitive, barbaric practices? What belief system did they invoke to justify such deeds? Why were they considered civilized?
When my niece left the Historical Society lynching exhibition, she said: "They made it up. They made it all up." And to open "Reflections in Black" (W. W. Norton) is to feel just that. To which race does the phrase "the race problem" really apply? That's the question asked by generations of black photographers as they recorded -- unearthed is probably the best word -- lives unknown to most white Americans until quite recently. And the point was not just the spectacular and the uplifting. The point was the small-time and the commonplace, too, even the trifling facts of life that people forced to justify their existence learned to fear as weaknesses or loathe as mortal flaws.
Ms. Willis organizes the book into five time periods, supplying a useful overview of each, along with short biographies of the photographers. As she makes clear, one all-pervasive aim was to commemorate black achievements. There are fine formal portraits of political leaders and beautifully intimate ones of musicians, dancers and artists.
But achievement could just mean doing everyday things most whites didn't imagine you doing. It isn't only the glamorous black 19th- and 20th-century aristocrats with their elegant airs and wardrobes and looks that make you think their ancestors must have come from every known continent. It's the nurses' training schools, the baseball players and beauty queens, the all-male card games in bars, carefully angled hats of women on a Bronx street corner waiting to be hired as low-paid domestics. The restaurants, barbershops, beauty shops and funeral homes that were part of what black writers through the years have called Bronzeville, Negroland, Aframerica or the 'Hood.
You will find heroism, lyricism and naturalism here. And, through the 1980's and 1990's, abstraction, collage and exuberant technical experiment. Photographers well known to blacks and whites are represented. (James Van der Zee, Gordon Parks, Roy DeCarava, Chester Higgins Jr., Carrie Mae Weems and Lorna Simpson). So, too, are many, like Robert H. McNeill, Monetta J. Sleet Jr. and Charles Harris, who spent most of their lives working for the black press. There is so much good work from so many.
And in the end "Reflections in Black" turns out to include whites, too. Nineteenth-century black professionals often photographed nonblack subjects, from abolitionists to the obscure citizens whose pictures are in every in state historical society collection. Like their white counterparts, these photographers, occasionally women, traveled, set up studios, advertised and won medals at state fairs.
When James Presley Ball moved to Richmond, Va., in 1846, an observer wrote: "The Virginians rushed in crowds to his room; all classes, white and black, bound and free sought to have their lineaments stamped by the artist who painted with the Sun's rays." Augustus Washington began his career in Hartford, and before it ended he had photographed the fierce John Brown and had traveled to Liberia, photographing the black families who had emigrated there from the United States.
Ms. Willis includes a 1946 photograph of an anti-lynching march: the sign-carrying women all wear hats and some wear white gloves, too. And there is one picture, taken by James Presley Ball, of a black man hanged in Helena, Mont., in 1896. In Ball's first picture of him, the man is wearing a suit with a white flower in his lapel and smartly folded pocket handkerchief. In the second picture, he is hanging from a rope, a hood over his head, flanked (since the hanging was legal) by a sheriff and a minister.
He was an ex-slave named William Biggerstaff and in Ball's last photo, he lies in a white-lined coffin, mustache combed, wedding ring in view.
All varieties of the human are in this book. They don't always defeat cruelty and bigotry but they do at last make them bear the weight of those terrible words "inhuman" and "subhuman."

HEADLINE: Last-Minute Surge by Shoppers Caps Tepid Retail Sales Season

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Wal-Mart, Macy's and other United States retailers welcomed crowds of last-minute holiday shoppers this weekend, in what analysts predicted would be among the two biggest shopping days of the year.
"We were busy all day" on Saturday, said Kathy Tariche, a manager at a Williams-Sonoma store in Manhattan. "It was a lot of guys doing last-minute shopping." The cookware chain had KitchenAid mixers, wine-bottle openers and food baskets wrapped and ready for customers in a hurry, she said. 
 Retailers were hoping for an 11th-hour sales surge after three weeks of so-so sales, and they had good reason to expect one. The Saturday before Christmas has been the busiest holiday shopping day for the last five years. With Christmas on a Monday this year, consumers had a full weekend to finish, or in some cases -- and you know who you are -- to start buying gifts.
Strong results this weekend could help the industry stave off a shortfall in sales at stores open at least a year, known in the industry as same-store sales, analysts said.
Few analysts now expect that such sales will wind up matching last December's 6.7 percent jump, what with higher fuel prices and volatility in the stock market weighing on consumers this month. As of last week, some doubted that the industry would meet even more modest expectations.
A Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi economist, Mike Niemira, who had forecast a 4 percent increase this season, adjusted his sales estimate last week down to a range of 2 percent to 4 percent. This came after Wal-Mart, Target, Sears, Roebuck and other chains said sales had not kept pace with forecasts.
"On the strength of this last-minute surge, we are likely to see a same-store sales increase of about 3 percent," said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report. "If it hadn't been for the final surge, I think it would've been a disastrous holiday."
After this weekend, retail analysts will switch their focus to industry profits, which may have been hurt by the heavy discounting that some retailers offered to lure shoppers.
Some chains, afraid of having too much holiday merchandise left over, slashed prices this weekend, providing a taste of the kinds of bargains that will be available after Christmas.
Kmart, which kept its stores open 24 hours on Friday and Saturday, cut prices on jewelry and other items by as much as 70 percent. Federated Department Stores offered 20 percent-off coupons for holiday clearance merchandise at its Macy's and Bloomingdale's chains, while Circuit City gave away a DVD player with each purchase of a projection television.
Shoppers have become accustomed to the late-season discounts, with many people saying they wait for big price markdowns before buying gifts.
"I look for tags of 50 percent off," said Louanne Tan of Toronto, who shopped at the Manhattan Mall in Herald Square while visiting her brother for the weekend.
In Atlanta, where ice and snowstorms last week made it harder for many shoppers to get around town, the weather cleared just in time for Jimmie Carey to finish her shopping and take advantage of markdowns at the downtown Macy's.
"I shopped later this year because I couldn't get around as easily" with the weather, said Ms. Carey, who bought pots and pans at 20 percent off. "I also wanted to wait for sales. The sales are very good this year."
The pressure on sales affected smaller merchants as well. Virginia Nelson, 40, who sells handmade Navajo jewelry in downtown Santa Fe, N.M., said she lowered her prices for the weekend to compensate for a slower economy and to compete with last-minute sales at local shopping malls.
"You have to adjust your prices with the season and the customers," she said. "I took $5 off of everything."

Reality Dampening the Dot-Com Hoopla

BYLINE: By LISA NAPOLI; Lisa Napoli is the Internet correspondent for MSNBC.

 BODY:
A miniature set of playing cards. A 12-carat faux diamond ring. A candy bag containing more lollipops than chocolate. A holiday music CD attached to a box of Cheerios. A giant banner personalized with my name and company logo. 
 Two copies of the catalog entrepreneur J. Peterman's new book, one addressed to my former producer, who quit nine months ago.
Eleven other books, all with "cyber," "e" or "Internet" in the title, some addressed to the person who had my job before me, almost 18 months ago.
For an entire month recently, I saved all the mail and trinkets I received at my office, rather than route them to the circular file or give the contents to colleagues. Four crates in all.
I also tabulated the e-mail messages sent to my public mailbox: 2,170. I tried but couldn't keep tabs on the phone calls.
"You're so popular!" the nice man at the switchboard told me once.
Hah! He and I know -- as I'm sure you do, too, by now -- that this flood of attentiveness has nothing to do with my personal charms.
It's my television network, MSNBC, where I am the Internet correspondent, and the fact that a brief audience with me may yield a mention on the air, on a Web site or both. This is the "dance that's not a duet," as a public relations person called it.
Like everything else about the new economy, this dance is nothing new -- just taken to ridiculous extremes, with some new moves, twists and stumbles thrown in.
Even within the dot-com world, however, things have changed, and fast. In the early days of e-commerce in New York City, some five long years ago, you could stand in the center of Silicon Alley and scream for a press agent to give you particulars about a new Web site and no one would answer. Early Silicon Alley parties were chock-full of eager "radicals" who were fascinated by the Net even before the dot-com boom. Back then, journalists found stories the old-fashioned way: sniffing them out themselves.
Just about nine months into the Web boom, though, there was a discernible change. It started with a sputter. In the Web's infancy, I was a reporter for CyberTimes, which at the time was a section of The New York Times on the Web. Uncertain voices would call and leave messages in which they nervously recited the Web addresses of clients.
And then, quickly, that sputter became a tidal wave, with an endless series of -- well, refer to the beginning of this article. In 1999, $13 billion was spent courting the technology media, according to Jack Bergen, the president of the Council of Public Relations Agencies, an industry trade group.
"There's been this heightened demand for P.R., as opposed to other communications tools," he said, because public relations offers three benefits helpful to a start-up company: speed, credibility and efficiency. For those benefits, some companies are paying public relations firms $50,000 to $60,000 a month. Agencies, in fact, are turning away business; in some cases, they see nine clients for every one they take.
"Clients are now pitching agencies," Mr. Bergen said, instead of the other way around. "That has never happened before."
Technology journalism has been booming the last 10 years, but the effect of technology on the news cycle is far-reaching. News is not something you get only from a newspaper in the morning and from television at night. The Internet has accelerated what was already becoming a 24/7 cycle as early as 1981, with the introduction of the Cable News Network (now called CNN).
All this has produced interesting kinks in the balance between supply and demand, creating a weird permutation of Economics 101. An abundance of start-up companies vying for attention leads to a demand by readers and viewers who are hoping to get expert help in making sense of the heavy promotion. An abundance of space and time in print and other media lead to a demand for more "news," which leads to a supply of information -- or an equally confusing oversupply.
And abundance does not necessarily translate into quality.
Consider this scene: A stylish conference room high above gleaming new Times Square. Four men, wearing suits, are preparing to meet the news media. They have invited a television reporter and a crew to videotape a demonstration of a "hot new" technology product. The reporter was skeptical, but the promise of something that could "revolutionize education" was alluring. The producers and her viewers would love this.
Just as everyone is cozying up around the enormous conference table, disaster strikes.
"You can't release this story, of course, until January," says one of the suited men. It is September. "And this product demo, well, it's not how it actually works. And when you shoot it, could you avoid that part of the screen? We don't have clearance for that yet."
That is the face of desperation, just like last year's dot-com start-up parties, each seemingly louder and costlier than the last, the ostentatious face of baseless optimism.
Pity the perky 20-somethings actually given the task of calling people like me. "Hi, I wanted to see if you were interested in meeting our C.E.O., a very exciting guy," they chirp on the phone, which rings a hundred times a day, and I try not to pick up.
Public relations people are gauged by their "hits" -- they keep logs of the notes and packages they send. They get extra points for keeping a journalist on the phone. They get many extra points if a reporter meets them in person. If that reporter actually writes a story or puts it on TV, they can get a raise.
Knowing this, I sometimes invite people to have coffee with me in Secaucus, N.J., where I work. It is one part sadist -- if they're that badly interested in meeting me, let them trek out here from New York, I reason. But it is another part compassion -- I know it's hard to sell something, and hard to deal with rejection. I'll give the person who sounds smart and eager a break. Besides, I might actually learn something.
Lately, though, the tide has again turned. As many high-technology companies consolidate or just plain go out of business, more frequently than not it is the reporter who makes the initial phone call -- to ask about the gory details.
And lately, in addition to plunging stock prices and rising layoff totals among the dot-coms, I have seen one other clear economic trend: a steep decline in the number of faux diamond rings and lollipops in my office in-box.

HEADLINE: Miami Airport Full of Santas, All Heading South

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 24

 BODY:
Some folks need snow and Santa to feel it's Christmas. But in some Central American mountain villages or sandy Caribbean islands, a lot more people are depending on William Lora, especially when their stateside relatives implore him to check his holiday list: a schedule of cargo flights.
Mr. Lora shares more than just his girth and his smile with the season's better-known package delivery specialist: he is the Santa of last resort. As the manager of ABS Freight Forwarders at Miami International Airport, Mr. Lora is the go-to guy for desperate travelers who discover that many airlines here have severe holiday restrictions on the number of bags and boxes they can take back to the old country. 
 That is not a minor concern. Each Christmas season, 100,000 people troop through the airport daily, carrying everything from toys and television sets to car parts and livestock. Festively wrapped in green-and-red Christmas paper, encased in yards of see-through plastic like bulging Saran-wrap stockings or just stuffed into crates and bags, the packages make the airport's main concourse look like a seasonal swap meet.
Forget about the duty-free stores hawking Chanel, Hermes or Dior. The big names on the concourse are Zenith, Samsung and Casio. They are a testament not just to the strength of the economy, but also to the enduring allure of the North American dream, which makes Latin American and Caribbean immigrants leave behind everything they ever knew and loved. To these women and men -- wise, but weary from hard work -- the gifts they bear are signs of success that ease the months, and sometimes years, of separation.
"Latin Americans work all year so they can take gifts home," Mr. Lora said, with a nod to a pile of packages that included a chandelier bound for the Dominican Republic, a solar panel headed for Haiti and a boom box destined for Nicaragua.
"From past experience, as far as the Latin American traveler, the airlines tell them you can only bring two pieces per person and they show up with eight. They always bring gifts to relatives, and once a year they travel. Their relatives expect that from them."
Baggage handlers and airport clerks who work at the airport during its busiest season have come to expect anything. Most of the presents are run-of-the-mill consumer items, especially electronics, clothing and toys. But some people get a little carried away.
"Roosters," said Luis Arce, a supervisor with the Miami Dade County Aviation Department. "You can hear roosters in the terminal. I once saw a guy walking a bobcat like a pet on a leash."
Geneva Hairs, another county aviation worker, is still wondering about a woman she once saw at curbside. "I saw a lady with a tail hanging out of her blouse," she said. "It was a black tail. She was going to Santo Domingo or someplace."
But the only snapping airport workers usually have to fear is from irate passengers when they learn that their airline will not permit them to take their gifts.
"They bring everything," Mr. Lora said, with a dead-serious look. "People have brought 700 pounds worth of goods. That's just one person."
He pointed to two slender car axle rods being shipped to Japan. Written on the paper was "Tokio." "I said to the guy, 'I thought you fabricated cars over there,' " Mr. Lora said. "It turns out the guy is building a car over there. An American-made car. Yesterday he brought some transmission parts."
American Airlines, the dominant carrier to the Caribbean and Central America, imposes a no-box rule from early December to early January to prevent cargo holds from being so crammed with packages that luggage will not fit. Selected flights also have a two-bag luggage limit.
Airlines also have safety rules barring aerosol cans, flammable liquids and some other goods. But many travelers to poorer countries show up with household goods, like the many women who try to go to Haiti with four-packs of spray starch.
The explanation for the box ban might make sense to those who are staying home. But it sounded like nonsense to Hector Castillo, who was told he could not take aboard a microwave oven he had bought for his sister in the Dominican Republic. Now all she will get is an excuse.
"Why?" he asked. "This is the time of year when people bring the most gifts. My sister asked for this. Now I'll have to take it in the summer."
Good luck, since American also has a similar ban during the heavy travel season in the summer.
The reactions are not quite passenger rage, but letdown, eased a bit by some holiday entertainment at the freight forwarding counter, where merengue music is sometimes played to soothe travelers.
Maria Isabel hugged a brown teddy bear as she waited with her teenage son Martin to check into their flight to Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Beside them, still inside their boxes, were a laptop computer and "My Walking Doll," which wasn't going anywhere, walking or otherwise, as long as she stayed in the box. Ms. Isabel had already left at home a bicycle and television set she had bought for her grandchildren in Honduras and will now have to ship.
"The computer is for my daughter because she started her first year at the university there," Ms. Isabel explained. "I want her to get ahead."
She paid for her gifts over the year, saving her money from her job planting and picking tomatoes at a southern Florida farm.
"Life is easier here," she said. "What we want is joy for our family. That's why we work, to make money and bring joy to our children."
On the other side of the airport, where the line for the afternoon TACA flight to Nicaragua was several hundred feet long, Luis Chavez was embarking on a busman's holiday. He is a truck driver, so the 10 huge bags he had hauled to the airport were a breeze compared with his usual cargo. His daughter Sheyla, 6, rested on one of the plastic-wrapped packages. Inside, there were clothes, toys and a microwave oven. More were left behind at home.
"This is a way to help those who are not here and show we are well," he said. "I have not been home in two years. It's a tradition for us to go home and be with the family on Christmas Eve. Here, we celebrate Thanksgiving American style. But you always remember and miss how we were raised."
Michael Rose will spend the holidays scanning luggage and not relaxing with his mother in his native Jamaica. His job as an airport security guard is one of the two jobs he holds, making it easier for him to help out back home. One might think he would become numb to all the presents he sees -- or their X-ray outlines, at least. Hardly.
"That's Christmas, man, for real," he said. "You get everything you want here, as long as you have the money. The U.S. is a very powerful country."
He repeated his last few words like a statement of faith.
"The U.S. helps a lot of Caribbean countries," he said. "If there were no foreign nationals living here, I don't know what kind of Christmas they would have over there."
Two weeks from now, the rush will begin anew, in reverse, as holiday revelers return to their jobs. Then, the stress will be on the Customs line. Tom Roland, the chief inspector for the United States Customs Service at the airport, said he could expect to stop people smuggling Cuban rum, animal skins, or even endangered birds or chicken blood (for religious rituals).
And, inevitably, Grandma's mango.
"These are people who are closer to the earth than we are," he said, explaining why someone would risk a $50 fine for violating laws against bringing in agricultural goods to smuggle the forbidden fruit.
"These are treasures to these people," he said. "They could be carrying a mango, but it grew on Grandma's tree back on the islands. That means something. They would go to those lengths to smuggle in a mango."
He spoke with warmth, not cynicism. There was something about the parade of humanity and its hopes that he sees whenever he walks through the concourse.
"The holidays to me are about family and food," he said. "We do the big Italian thing ourselves, and I'm going to be cooking for 26 people. I'll get my fish at the market in Coral Springs. I'll go to the Italian butcher in Pembroke Pines. I'm going to have my cannolis and my Sicilian wine waiting for me at the store."
He had a faraway smile for a second.
"And you know something?" he said. "I don't have to get on a plane to do it. Geez, this is a pretty good place to live. And work."

HEADLINE: Did U.S. Bombs Help or Hinder?

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Dec. 24

 BODY:
Serbs voted Saturday for a new Parliament and government that put an end to the era of Slobodan Milosevic, leaving one major question: how much of a role did the American-led bombing war against Yugoslavia, in spring 1999, have in Mr. Milosevic's fall?
The question matters, not just for history or for the legacy of the Clinton administration, which, as it prepares to leave office, considers the fall of Mr. Milosevic one of its great foreign policy successes. It also matters for what lies ahead. 
 By all accounts, the incoming administration of George W. Bush will be more reluctant to intervene abroad if American interests are not directly at stake. And the new president of Yugoslavia, Vojislav Kostunica, is convinced that a Bush administration would not have bombed Yugoslavia over Kosovo, and that Mr. Clinton's policy choices kept an unpopular Mr. Milosevic in power longer than necessary.
Colin L. Powell, the former general and designate for Secretary of State, opposed the use of American power in Bosnia and criticized the conduct of the Kosovo war. Both he and Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's choice for national security adviser, have said they want to reduce and then eliminate the American military presence in the Balkans.
Virtually all Serbs, like Mr. Kostunica, opposed the NATO bombing war as a crude, unnecessary and even unjust use of power when other Western policies had failed, even as some of them do acknowledge that it helped -- eventually -- to push Mr. Milosevic from power.
They believe that American support for international sanctions against Mr. Milosevic over Bosnia helped prop him up; that Washington did not push the Kosovo Albanians to vote, which would have defeated Mr. Milosevic as Serbian president even in 1992; that the Americans made Mr. Milosevic more important than he was, after the 1995 Dayton accord that ended the Bosnian war, as the "guarantor of stability in the Balkans"; that Washington did not provide enough help to the Serbian opposition when it challenged Mr. Milosevic in late 1996 and early 1997 and kept trying to pick "favorites"; and that Washington had an inconsistent and counterproductive policy toward Kosovo, especially after Mr. Milosevic fanned the crisis there to create new support at home.
However much these points can be debated, there is also understanding here that the shock of the bombing and the loss of Kosovo finally stripped Mr. Milosevic, already deeply unpopular, of all but his firmest supporters. The bombing at first consolidated patriotic support around him as president, which was reinforced by the immediate revenge attacks against Serbs in Kosovo that NATO forces did little to stop.
But that support could not last, and when Mr. Milosevic himself decided to call an early election for September, the only real question was whether he would be able to steal enough votes to pretend to win, and whether the Serbs would stand up to defend their votes.
"Milosevic lost because he called an election, which he would have had to do sooner or later, and the result would have been the same," said Aleksandar Fatic, head of the Security Policy Group at a Belgrade policy institute, the Management Center.
"What was most important to people was the poor state of the economy and their own lack of perspective," he added. "What was really different was a united opposition with a credible candidate, Kostunica, and that would have worked before, in 1997, too."
While the election was definitive, and stripped Mr. Milosevic of legitimacy and thus support from the police and the army, Kosovo was "an important contributing factor in his defeat," said Aleksa Djilas, a Serbian historian and analyst.
"He wasn't popular for a long time," Mr. Djilas said. "He would have lost in 1992 if the Americans had pressured the Albanians to vote. But in the end, it was this divided opposition of ours that kept him in power." As for any American help in removing Mr. Milosevic, he said, it reminded him of a dedication that P.G. Wodehouse wrote to his daughter, "without whose never-failing sympathy and encouragement this book would have been finished in half the time."
Dr. Velimir Pajevic, a physician from Kragujevac, is more definitive: "The last resort in psychiatry is electroshock, and that's what the bombing of Serbia was, unfortunately. I'm not justifying the bombing, but it was clear afterwards that the West had stopped playing with Milosevic and that we had no future with him."
Milivoje Mihajlovic, a Serbian journalist who lived and worked in Kosovo, said the loss of the province was crucial to Mr. Milosevic's fall. "The war mattered, definitely," he said. "It showed that Milosevic was a loser, a liar, and didn't care for his own people."
After the Western bombing of Serbia and the loss of Kosovo, no one could any longer believe, as they did after Dayton, when the Serbs kept half of Bosnia, that Mr. Milosevic was a political mastermind who could find a tactical victory, said Ljiljana Smajlovic, a political analyst for the magazine NIN.
Serbs lived with the sanctions and the loss of foreign goods, visas, air travel and much else as the "price of something dearer to us, this sense of national interest, what makes us a people," she said. "But after Kosovo, it was all in vain. We had lost living standards, our pride in our history and honor as warriors, and finally lost Kosovo, too."
By standing up to NATO in what Serbs felt was an unjust and even scandalous war, Mr. Milosevic had earned some respect and political rehabilitation, which was reinforced by the aftermath in Kosovo -- the expulsion and murder of Serbs there. "People said that this hate-filled chauvinism of the Albanians had to be confronted, even if the heavens fell on our heads, and that redeemed him to a certain extent," Ms. Smajlovic said.
But it was clear this spring that the Milosevic government was on its last legs and that any reasonably fair election would defeat him, she said.
A united opposition with a credible candidate, and Mr. Milosevic's "hysterical attacks" upon anyone who opposed him as agents of NATO, displayed his weakness to everyone, said Dragor Hiber, a leading opposition politician.
The Americans and the West, desperate to push out Mr. Milosevic, finally understood for this election that the Serbian opposition was the only one available, Mr. Hiber said, and provided much more help than before, pouring money into Serbia -- to the opposition, the media, to student protesters, almost everyone who could claim to be anti-Milosevic.
"But no one really knows how important Western support was," Mr. Hiber said. "It was preaching a lot to the converted. It's unprovable." By then, he said, the question wasn't if Mr. Milosevic would lose to Mr. Kostunica, but whether Mr. Kostunica would be allowed to win.
Probably as important as any aid to the opposition, Washington accepted Mr. Kostunica and his campaign criticism of American policy -- including the bombing war and the indictment of Mr. Milosevic for war crimes -- with dignity and discretion, trying to ensure that Western policy would at least do no harm.
The protests that led to Mr. Milosevic's ouster and the acknowledgment of his defeat had little to do with the West, but with the Serbs themselves, everyone here agrees. And senior American officials, who say they feel vindicated by the outcome, also concede that the main idea of promoting Mr. Kostunica was not theirs, but the Serbian opposition's.
Some American officials with long experience in the region accept many of the criticisms, especially the accusation that a more focused policy in 1996 and 1997 could have defeated Mr. Milosevic. American aid to the democratic opposition began then, but it was small and late, and Washington, worried about problems in Bosnia and thinking it needed Mr. Milosevic's help, did too little then to force the opposition to keep together for the 1997 elections.
Whatever the earlier Western mistakes, once the bombing war started NATO could not afford to lose it. And whether the war was necessary or not, due to miscalculations in the West and in Belgrade, it did help bring about the fall of Mr. Milosevic, said Milan Bozic, a professor and politician, because it broke his relationship with the West, which finally had no more use for him.
"If in 1996, the West had wanted to push harder, he would have been out then," Mr. Bozic said. "But the war in Kosovo finally ended Milosevic's symbiotic relationship with the West. It was an important leg of his stool and it was gone, and it helped unseat him."

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Critical Player on Bush Agenda Is an Unknown Quantity

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN the six years he was in the House of Representatives and the 20 he has been in the Senate, Charles E. Grassley made it a practice to reserve the hours of 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. every day he was in Washington for meetings with outsiders.
His constituents from Iowa always had first crack. Then came lobbyists, reporters and others interested in specific issues or legislation. He almost always had time for everyone, and often had time to spare. 
 That has all changed now.
When the new Congress convenes next month, Senator Grassley, a Republican, will be chairman of the Finance Committee, the panel with jurisdiction over taxes, Social Security, Medicare, health insurance, trade and welfare. By virtue of his seniority and the defeat last month of the chairman for the last six years, Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, Mr. Grassley, 67, will move from relative anonymity to a position with a dominant voice on most of the top items on President-elect George W. Bush's agenda.
Already, lobbyists and policy advocates are lining up to meet with him, and his phone is ringing incessantly. "I've had to ask my staff," Mr. Grassley said the other day, "to say to people that I might have met with over the past 26 years that I want their first meeting now to be with staff so I can reserve time for the broader questions of administration of the agenda and mastering of the issues."
One reason those interested in particular legislation are so eager to meet with Mr. Grassley is that he is such an unknown quantity. With a few notable exceptions like his opposition to the Persian Gulf war resolution in 1991, his voting record has been solidly conservative Republican. But his main interests have been agriculture, aging and Pentagon waste, and he has never taken the lead on the hot issues over which he will now have so much influence.
Even colleagues on the Finance Committee do not know, for example, how strongly he feels about across-the-board tax cuts or providing prescription drug coverage under Medicare or establishing private investment accounts under Social Security or giving patients the right to sue their health insurance companies.
More narrowly, the lobbyists who plead for tax breaks from the Finance Committee have no clear sense of where Mr. Grassley is likely to stand. He created a splash by uncovering excessive military spending on items like toilet seats, and there is anxiety in some circles that he might turn his attention to tax loopholes.
The senator is not ready to tip his hand. He has met, he said, with Vice President-elect Dick Cheney to "open lines of communication," but they have reached no conclusion on the order in which the Finance Committee should take up the Bush agenda.
Mr. Grassley said his sense is that "with a Congress so divided and a presidential election so close, we ought to start on some things where we can build some bipartisan consensus."
Into that category, he places measures approved by Congress this year and vetoed by President Clinton that would reduce the income taxes owed by married couples and gradually phase out the federal tax on large estates.
If the economy turns sour, Mr. Grassley said, it may be possible to get some overall tax relief, though probably not the huge tax cut proposed by Mr. Bush.
"With the 50-50 makeup of the Senate," he said, "I think we've got to be realistic that there might be some compromise necessary."
He said he was inclined to take up Medicare in two steps. The first, he said, might be a bill that would give the states money they could use for prescription drug coverage for low-income Medicare beneficiaries. The second step, which might take a year or two, would be more comprehensive legislation that would combine broader prescription drug coverage with a more market-based approach to Medicare generally.
Mr. Grassley said that he was under no illusion the elderly wanted big changes in Medicare but that changes must be made or the system will go bankrupt.
"Sometimes, little old ladies in Iowa say to me, 'Just leave it alone,' " he said. "I tell them, 'If you just leave it alone, you won't have Medicare pretty soon.' "
MR. GRASSLEY does not look, talk or act like the archetypal senator. He is tall and thin with a crooked smile and an awkward gait. He wears off-the-rack suits, and his voice has a country twang. He is proud of his background as a farmer, and he spends his weekends and Congressional recesses on the corn and soybean farm he owns with his son Robin in New Hartford, west of Waterloo, the city where he was born. Mr. Grassley, whose term runs through 2004, rarely delivers extended monologues in the Senate the way most of his colleagues do. He is not a Republican firebrand, but he makes no secret of his partisan views.
Asked, for example, what he thought of Mr. Bush and Vice President Al Gore, he replied: "I think there's a difference between how Bushes of three generations approach public office and Gores of two generations. I think the Bushes see it as a responsibility and an opportunity and probably a privilege. I saw the Gores seeing public office as a right."
People who have followed Mr. Grassley's career say his slow-talking farm boy demeanor is an act like a pool hustler's meant to lull his opposition into complacency. True or not, he has certainly been successful in politics. He lost a race for the Iowa House of Representatives in 1956 when he was still in graduate school. But he won two years later when he was 26 and has never lost an election since.
"I think what you see is what you get," he said. "I'm not one thing in Washington and another thing in Iowa."
That seems true enough. One afternoon in the impeachment trial in the Senate last year, Mr. Grassley astonished visitors looking down from the gallery by taking off his shoes.
Questioned about it the other day, he said: "You know, my feet were hurting. My gosh, I probably had on some shoes I shouldn't have been wearing because, you know, I don't normally take off my shoes except at home."

HEADLINE: Resort's Full-Time Residents Getting a Break on Housing

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: MACKINAC ISLAND, Mich.

 BODY:
Marvelous Victorian summer cottages and magnificent views of Lake Huron and Lake Michigan make this teardrop-shaped island one of the most popular resort destinations in the Midwest. But with some home prices exceeding $1 million, an increasing number of the 500 islanders who live here all year and earn low wages are hard pressed to run the local government and perform other vital work while keeping a rented roof over their heads.
Many of them can no longer afford to stay. 
 Resourcefulness, however, has been a part of this island's heritage since it was a haven for French "voyageurs" in the 17th century. Mindful of this history, modern island residents have come up with a solution for affordable housing that could well provide a model for other expensive resort communities.
This month a single-family home and a comfortable two-family duplex were offered for sale at subsidized prices by the Mackinac Island Housing Corporation, a nonprofit group founded and managed by island workers, including a schoolteacher, a public works clerk and a delivery agent.
The units are the first of 10 single-family homes and 18 two-family duplexes to be built over the next two years on a three-acre parcel owned by the housing corporation in Harrisonville, a hamlet near the island's center where many year-round residents live, some in tiny two-room cabins.
So far, about 30 families have signed up for a lottery next month that will determine who will be the first to live in the plainly named Harrisonville Subdivision.
Among the first to enter the lottery were Julie and Christopher Malfroid, year-round residents whose housing plight has been emblematic. The couple, who have two young sons and a third child on the way, have lived in four different cramped rentals since arriving from Grand Rapids, Mich., in 1997.
They live off Mr. Malfroid's earnings as a bicycle mechanic and maintenance man. But the family was forced to leave its three previous apartments because of higher summer rents.
"I tell you, it builds character," said Mrs. Malfroid, 33, who said she was hoping to buy a three-bedroom duplex for around $75,000 through the lottery.
The planning on the subdivision project began in 1995, when land prices sharply escalated and the island's school enrollment dropped below 100 students as young families departed.
Several prominent summer residents joined a group of year-round residents in the effort, and by 1997 the resulting company, the Mackinac Island Housing Corporation, had raised $475,000 from private donors and foundations and bought 3.16 acres from an island family.
The corporation has worked with a succession of private donors, foundations, technical specialists, bankers and state officials to raise another $750,000, including a two-year $517,000 state housing grant to install a road and sewers, and to build the first three homes.
Michael Hart, 48, a longshoreman who serves as the corporation's president, said the position involved riding a sea of details. For instance, to qualify to live in the Harrisonville Subdivision, a family cannot earn more than $33,200 a year. The Mackinac County median income is $35,000 for a family of four.
Each family must also sign a contract certifying full-time residency; no more than one month a year can be spent off the island.
"If they take a vacation it better be short," Mr. Hart joked.
"We don't want these homes to be rented or subleased," he added. "We want them to used by the families that bought them."
To ensure that the subdivision's homes are affordable and remain so for many years to come, the housing corporation owns the land beneath each house and leases it to the homeowner for a nominal fee. The buyer is thus insulated from high land values.
In addition, the buyer agrees to a limit on any profit from future sale of the home. Twenty percent of the increase in value is the maximum profit allowable, under a contract that the Mackinac Island Housing Corporation is drawing up.
For example, a single family home that sold for $98,000 this year could theoretically be worth $130,000 in 10 years. But under the contract, the seller would legally be entitled to only slightly more than $6,000 from such a sale -- 20 percent of the increase in value. So the new price for the home would be set at approximately $104,000.
Such a formula ensures that a family in the future will be able to afford the home, said Edward Bobinchak, an executive at the Michigan Capital Fund for Housing, a nonprofit group in Lansing, Mich., that has provided financial and technical support.
The general concept underlying the Harrisonville Subdvision, known as a community land trust, was developed in the late 1960's and is promoted nationally by the Institute for Community Economics in Springfield, Mass. Sarah Page, the institute's director, says 90 community land trusts exist in the United States, most of them in small cities and suburbs where decent housing is perennially in short supply for low-income people.
The Mackinac Island project is the first community land trust in Michigan and among the first nationwide in a resort community.
The people who settle on Mackinac Island are, in many ways, modern pioneers. They live an isolated, spartan, nomadic lifestyle on low wages. In exchange, they receive splendid maritime scenery, safety and quiet.
Of all the inconveniences the residents contend with, none is more bothersome than the constant moving around. The Malfroids pay $425 a month for a cramped two-bedroom home -- a step above their $500-a-month one-bedroom apartment of a few months ago, which was so small they had to sleep in the living room.
Of the duplex they are seeking, Mrs. Malfroid said, "This is where we want to be, and if we are able to buy one of those homes, it will really help."

HEADLINE: U.N. Workers Return to Afghanistan After Taliban Safety Pledge

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: se emb KABUL, Afghanistan, Dec. 24

 BODY:
Non-Afghan employees of the United Nations began returning to Afghanistan today after the Taliban militia, who rule most of the country, guaranteed that the workers would not face a violent backlash because of newly proposed sanctions against the government.
Three United Nations workers arrived in the Afghan capital, Kabul, early today, while seven others returned to the cities of Herat and Kandahar, said Erick de Mul, the United Nations coordinator for Afghanistan. 
 They are among about 50 workers the United Nations had pulled out of Afghanistan last week because there were fears that there would be a violent reaction to a sanctions resolution that the United Nations Security Council passed last week.
Mr. de Mul said the Taliban had guaranteed the safety of the United Nations employees, most of whom work for agencies involved in removing land mines, aiding refugees and providing food assistance.
Most employees who left will be back in Afghanistan in the coming week, he said.
"I am very happy to back here and resume work," David Pakas, a United Nations security official, told reporters after he arrived at the Kabul airport today.
The United Nations gave the Taliban a month to surrender Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born financier of militancy who is thought to be in Afghanistan. Mr. bin Laden is wanted in the United States on charges of being behind the bombings of two United States Embassies in Africa in 1998.
The Taliban were also told by the United Nations that they must close terrorism training camps or face new sanctions proposed by the United States and Russia.
The Security Council said the sanctions would affect only the Taliban, not ordinary Afghans already devastated by a protracted civil war and a persistent drought.
However, ordinary Afghans already are suffering: the currency has plunged and prices have gone up because of the sanction threats. Thousands of people are trying to flee the country.
The sanctions call for an arms embargo on the Taliban, including foreign military assistance that is believed to be provided by Pakistan. It also calls for the closing of all Taliban offices overseas.
The sanctions will go into effect in a month if the Taliban fail to close Afghan camps that are believed to be training grounds for terrorists and to deliver Mr. bin Laden to the United States or to a third country for trial in the bombing of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
Taliban leaders have refused to hand over Mr. bin Laden. They also have denied allegations that the camps are used to train Chechen rebels, who are fighting for independence from Russia.
In November 1999, the United Nations imposed limited sanctions on the Taliban to try to force Mr. bin Laden's extradition.
The Taliban, who rule more than 95 percent of Afghanistan, including Kabul, are fighting a northern-based opposition alliance in an attempt to extend their control over the entire country.
The Taliban, mostly Sunni Muslims, practice a fundamentalist version of Islam, imposing, among other things, severe restrictions on education and work for women.
The opposition is based in the north and includes some of the commanders who have been fighting since the days when the West helped finance an effort to expel Soviet rulers. It is made up of predominantly ethnic and religious minorities.

HEADLINE: A Torrent of Sludge Muddies a Town's Future

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: INEZ, Ky.

 BODY:
As Prentice Maynard was leaving for work before daybreak on Oct. 11, he noticed that Coldwater Creek was unusually high as it flowed under the bridge he took to the road.
By 7:40, when his wife, Janice, left their trailer for her job in town, the creek was an eerily still, glistening black goo that could hold a stick upright. 
 "I thought, 'It's like pudding,' " Ms. Maynard said. "It was overflowing the stream bed. At 4:45, when I got home, it was over the driveway."
For three days the goo rose and spread. It swamped gardens and lawns along the six miles of Coldwater Creek in eastern Kentucky and coated its banks and bottom and those of neighboring 15-mile Wolf Creek to thicknesses of up to six feet.
Ms. Maynard's pudding was 250 million gallons of coal-mining sludge. And it created an environmental disaster, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, suffocating aquatic life -- salamanders, frogs, fish and big snapping turtles -- as it moved downstream. It has also worsened the economic disaster in this backwater pocket of central Appalachia, where, with the din of tank trucks and pumps running constantly, the cleanup is only half finished.
The slurry of watered-down coal particles, dirt, rock, clay and traces of heavy metals had burst through the bottom of the A. T. Massey Coal Company's lifeless 72-acre, 2.2-billion-gallon waste lagoon, which sits atop this Appalachian county's struggling and now terrified hollows.
For five hours starting just before midnight, 10 feet of the 90-foot depth of the lagoon raced through abandoned underground mines, smashing concrete seals the company thought strong enough to contain a spill, then shot out two mine entries and into the creeks.
Briefly before the spill, this place had some hope in the pending arrival of two new employers. On high ground six miles away, a casket company is expected to open a shop that might employ 30 or 40 workers, and in two years, a maximum security federal prison will open and employ about 200 local people.
Now any future employer will have to weigh the risks of another visit of sludge. "We were making some progress when this disaster hit," said Garry R. Lafferty, the county's deputy judge executive, its second-highest-ranking administrator. "It really backs you up."
Martin County's torrent of sludge was more than 20 times the volume of the Exxon Valdez's crude oil spill in Alaska 11 years ago. Among coal-mining spills, it was twice that of its biggest forerunner, 28 years ago in Buffalo Creek, W.Va., which killed 125 people and swallowed 500 homes. This time, though, no one was hurt.
A touchy issue involving industry, jobs and the environment, it drew a few headlines but little national interest.
As the spill rolled into 100 miles of rivers and streams, clogging water treatment plants and forcing schools, restaurants, laundries and a power plant to close before dispersing at the Ohio River, Gov. Paul E. Patton of Kentucky, a Democrat and former coal mine operator, declared a 10-county emergency.
Inez, population 470 and sinking, is where President Lyndon B. Johnson announced his War on Poverty in 1964. "I was a college kid then," said John Kirk, a lawyer in town who has filed a class-action suit for 200 homeowners against Massey and its local subsidiary, the Martin County Coal Corporation. "What Johnson did, more than anything else, was give an injection of optimism to this little place."
In the 1970's, coal companies swooped in, leasing and buying hundreds of square miles of rolling hills and valleys. The land below ground became honeycombed with tunnels and shafts. With strip mining, mountaintops became mesas.
In return, the industry delivered wages, jobs and home-building. According to Ron Crouch, director of the Kentucky State Data Center at the University of Louisville, coal mine employment leaped nearly tenfold, to 3,156 in 1980 from 364 a decade earlier. The county's population rose to 13,925 from 9,377, before beginning a gradual decline.
Incomes, once just above half the state average, reached the average by 1980. Middle-class homes and new trailers sprouted near eastern Kentucky hovels along Coldwater and Wolf Creeks. The poverty rate, more than 50 percent at the start of the War on Poverty, fell by half.
But automation took away mining jobs and the price of coal began to plunge, to just over $20 a ton today from nearly $40 at its peak. The boom began to fizzle, and today, mine employment has dropped below 900, while wages have slipped. And with no one yet willing to buy into the path of another spill, home values along the two creeks have collapsed.
Just why the October spill happened, in particular why the seals broke, is still being investigated.
By most accounts, a computer operator noticed that a conveyor belt carrying coal had stopped. Workers who were sent to check it found sludge from the lagoon pouring into a cavity, like water through a bathtub drain, near the shore on one side. From there, said Fred Stroud, the E.P.A. official at the scene who leads the federal cleanup, the sludge roared through the Swiss cheese of underground mines near the lagoon walls, breaking through the two sets of seals.
Mr. Stroud said one stream then poured out of one mine entrance, over a ravine and into the head waters of Coldwater Creek. He said the other appeared to have run a longer course through the mines, slowing down as it spilled into Wolf Creek.
The man on the hot seat here is Dennis Hatfield, president of Martin County Coal and the son of a retired local miner. He lives nearby with his wife and two children and teaches Sunday school. It is rare to hear an unkind word about him, if not about the company he runs. "He frogged and fished in the creeks," Mr. Lafferty said.
Mr. Hatfield has been deeply apologetic. Partly under orders from the state, which has cited the company for engaging in unsafe practices, Martin County Coal is picking up the cost of a cleanup, estimated at $40 million to $60 million. "We've got 500 people and 300 pieces of equipment working on this cleanup," Mr. Hatfield said.
Within hours of the spill, he was on the phone to homeowners in its path, offering motel rooms, groceries, driveway clearing, topsoil for the ruined gardens and new bridges.
The company attributes the spill to an act of God, a claim that stirs derision in this heavily Baptist community. Mr. Hatfield is less certain. "I don't know what happened," he said. "I don't think anybody else does." With lawsuits building against it, the company has taken some extra measures, like installing a Massey public relations man.
The company bought a used four-wheel-drive vehicle so Prentice Maynard can reach his trailer and the red barn where he keeps 20 beagles, and leased an apartment for Janice Maynard, who says she is too frightened to return home. But she calls the gestures meaningless. "I want them to buy me out," she said. "I want my life back."
Up Coldwater Road from the Maynards, closer to the mining site, Glenn Cornette, a 66-year-old retired strip miner, and his wife, Shirley, 60, feel similarly. Their trailer is next to that of their daughter and son-in-law, Patty and Edward McGinnis, and near the crumbling little house where Mr. McGinnis was born.
Around 3 that October morning, Mr. McGinnis was getting ready to give his wife, Patty, a ride to Grandad's Diner, where she would begin preparing breakfast for early-rising miners. On the road outside his trailer, Mr. McGinnis said he saw a company guard watching the rising creek.
"I asked him," Mr. McGinnis said, " 'Have you got a pond break?' He said, 'We got one seeping a little bit. It's just a seep. It will be all right.' "
Later, when Mr. Cornette arose, he said he told his wife that it looked like mud to him. "Steam was coming off of it," he said.
As daylight broke, the sludge kept rising and flooding the land where he raises vegetables. "I caught a big turtle that was going for high ground," Mr. Cornette said. A footlong snapper, he said, it was caked with mud. "I took him in and washed him off," he said, and then put him in an unaffected stream nearby.
Mr. Cornette leases the company a patch of his 90 acres for $1,065 a year. But with fears of another spill keeping them up at night, he and his wife want out. "I'm afraid of what's left up there," Mrs. Cornette said of the nearly two billion gallons still in the lagoon.
This was not the lagoon's first big leak. Six years ago, more than 100 million gallons, mostly water, escaped, doing little damage. The Mine Safety and Health Administration, a Labor Department agency, found inadequate sealing around the lagoon. The state fined the company $1,600. A plan was prepared with the federal agency to reinforce the lagoon, and the company agreed to adopt it.
"We followed up with a pretty thorough analysis," said J. Davitt McAteer, assistant secretary and head of the agency. But no one has established yet whether the company actually complied with the plan or whether the federal regulators checked to see that it had. "Obviously we weren't thorough enough," Mr. McAteer said.

HEADLINE: The Wisdom to Let the Good Times Roll

SERIES: THE CLINTON LEGACY -- Second of five articles: Presiding Over Prosperity

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 24

 BODY:
Aside from his impeachment, nothing defined Bill Clinton's years in the White House more than prosperity.
Not until the final days of his presidency was there more than a bump in what early this year became the longest economic expansion on record. Jobs were plentiful. Wages rose and poverty fell. Advances in technology reinvigorated some industries and created others. 
 Even after tumbling this year, the stock market produced substantial gains for the growing ranks of shareholders. The nation's resurgent financial strength complemented its military muscle in projecting American power around the world.
In political terms, Mr. Clinton drew vital succor from the economy. His re-election in 1996, his survival in office after his relationship with a White House intern and whatever authority he enjoyed in his policy clashes with Republicans derived at least in part from the widespread sense that times, for most people, have never been better.
Economists, historians and members of both parties will no doubt debate for years whether Mr. Clinton was lucky or good when it came to the economy.
The debate will only become more intense if the sharp deceleration of the economy over the past few weeks leads to a recession, as some analysts think is possible.
"Any president in large measure is evaluated on the state of the economy during his administration," said Leon E. Panetta, who was Mr. Clinton's budget director and chief of staff. "If that's the test with Clinton, it will clearly show the economy to be his greatest triumph."
Even his supporters concede that Mr. Clinton was fortunate to occupy the White House during a period when the economy enjoyed the payoff from decades of technological progress, generating a cascade of unanticipated tax revenues. Supporters contend that Mr. Clinton realized early that reducing the federal deficit would be crucial and that his management of economic policy spurred growth and led to revenue surpluses.
Republicans, though, bristle at any suggestion that Mr. Clinton deserves anything more than token credit, and in any case his economic record is not without blemishes. Although the unemployment rate fell during his presidency, many high-paying jobs in manufacturing were lost to foreign competition. Consumers ran up staggering levels of personal debt. The trade deficit surged. Farmers suffered from low prices.
And even as the gap between rich and poor remained stubbornly wide, the administration often seemed lulled, like much of the rest of the nation, by the relentless march of stock quotations across the bottom of the screen on CNBC.
To his critics, the best that can be said is that nothing he did derailed an expansion that had its origins in the early 1980's, was reinvigorated with the end of the cold war and was interrupted briefly in the early 1990's by the Persian Gulf war. The economy has been growing without interruption since March 1991, nearly two years before Mr. Clinton took office.
"This is a pretty smart guy riding a big canoe down a big river," said Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House. "And he didn't capsize it. But the canoe was going to go down the river, and the river is huge."
His claim to credit rests primarily on his handling of two issues: budget policy and trade.
His predecessor, George Bush, had started to deal with the rapidly mounting federal deficit in 1990 by agreeing with Democrats in Congress on a package of tax increases and spending restraints. But when Mr. Clinton took office in 1993, the fiscal mess was getting worse.
Mr. Clinton responded by pushing through legislation that provided for immediate tax increases and delayed spending cuts to bring down the deficit.
It was a move that united Republican lawmakers against him and cost his party dearly in the 1994 midterm elections, but also gave him cover to call for increased spending on his priorities -- education, health care and environmental protection.
He agreed later to balance the budget, albeit under intense Republican pressure. As deficits gave way to large and growing surpluses, he pushed to pay off the national debt.
Mr. Clinton's fiscal policy served as a laboratory for a change in economic thought. For decades, governments had operated in the belief that running deficits was often good because it would stimulate activity and employment in an economy running at less than its potential.
But that traditional assumption, based on the economic theories of John Maynard Keynes, has been turned on its head, at least in the United States.
Deficits are now considered growth-sapping, draining capital from the private sector, pushing up interest rates and creating uncertainty on Wall Street.
Balanced budgets -- or better yet, surpluses -- are believed to hold down interest rates, free capital for the private sector and reassure investors about long-term economic stability.
Lawrence H. Summers, the treasury secretary, said recently that, "propelled by the experience of recent years, it has become conventional wisdom that reducing budget deficits and running surpluses is expansionary, not contractionary, and that that is the way forward."
Much to the frustration of Republicans, who consider him an unreconstructed tax-and-spend liberal, Mr. Clinton has blurred if not cast off his party's longstanding reputation for profligacy.
By focusing the debate on the affordability of Republican calls for tax cuts and not on calls by Democrats for additional spending, he has been able to use the surplus to pay for his priorities while accusing Republicans of playing fast and loose with the economy.
Indeed, Democrats at the end of the Clinton era have a credible if disputed claim to being the party of fiscal responsibility, a political transformation of the first order.
"I knew if we could just get the deficit down, get interest rates down, get out of the way of the economy and then do some things that would speed it up," Mr. Clinton said this year, "it would be great."
In the international sphere, Mr. Clinton recognized early on the power of globalization to reshape economies.
Despite protests from organized labor and many Democrats, he decided that the United States had more to gain than to lose from pushing for trade pacts that opened American markets to competitors in return for new export opportunities.
With help from Republicans, he ratified the creation of a free trade zone in North America, reduced trade barriers and brought China into the world trading system.
But on trade, unlike on budget policy, he was never able to unite his party, and he leaves the Democrats as divided over how to face the global economy as they were when he took office.
To a degree that was striking for a Democratic president, Mr. Clinton stuck closely to orthodox, even conservative, economic policy, sometimes to a degree that unsettled or disheartened his party's core constituencies.
In fighting poverty, he sought to shift his party's emphasis from entitlements to programs that reward work, like the earned-income tax credit for the working poor. He upset liberal Democrats by signing a bill to force welfare recipients into the work force more quickly at a time when there was no assurance there would be jobs for them.
But for the most part Mr. Clinton was able to hold the Democratic coalition together by linking his policies to job creation and economic opportunity, and then pointing to falling unemployment, rising incomes, low interest rates, stable prices and improved international competitiveness as validation of his strategy.
"The bottom line is that it worked," said John Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
Mr. Clinton has been president at a time of immense economic change. It has been a period when market forces have swept the globe, burying the remnants of communism in the former Soviet Union and its clients, enticing and simultaneously punishing much of the developing world and making the United States more than ever the capital of capitalism.
Fascinated by policy and convinced from the start of his first presidential campaign that his political fate would be determined in large part by the economy, Mr. Clinton was as fully engaged in economic policy as any president has been.
Breaking with the practice of the two preceding administrations, he adopted a hands-off policy toward the Federal Reserve Board. In doing so, he granted Alan Greenspan, the chairman, considerable freedom at a time when the Fed was coming to the conclusion that the technology-enhanced economy was capable of much faster growth than the old theories had predicted.
Mr. Clinton and his team handled several international financial crises adeptly, and despite occasional protests from exporters, they stuck consistently to a policy of supporting a strong dollar, a stance that helped hold down inflation and attract foreign investment.
Though his Justice Department brought an antitrust case against the Microsoft Corporation, his administration continued the decades-long move toward deregulation of many industries, especially telecommunications.
And he generally kept the federal government from meddling in the most far-reaching technological development of the 1990's, the Internet.
But he had his share of setbacks, mistakes and disappointments.
He put the troubled future of Social Security on the national agenda in 1998. But he underestimated the ideological divide between the parties on the issue, and found his ability to maneuver constrained by his need not to alienate members of his party during his impeachment.
He also tried to address Medicare's long-term financial troubles. But when a bipartisan commission came back with a more conservative approach than he and many Democrats could swallow, he backed away.
He occasionally ignored the advice of his advisers in search of short-term political benefit, as when he released oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve last fall just as oil prices were becoming an issue in the presidential campaign.
But for the most part, his economic policy was less subject than most other areas of his presidency to the criticism that he had few convictions and was guided by polls and his political needs.
"In many ways, as an economist, I've been impressed at the Clinton administration's ability to rise above the Beltway politics of Washington," said Diane C. Swonk, chief economist at the Bank One Corporation in Chicago.
Mr. Clinton's approach to the economy evolved gradually from his days as a candidate through his first years in office.
Campaigning in 1992, Mr. Clinton promised something for everyone: a package of spending to give the still-feeble recovery a jump; a longer-term package of government spending on needs like education, health and the environment, and a tax cut for the middle class. It was by no means apparent that dealing with the deficit was at the top of his list.
On Dec. 3, 1992, Mr. Clinton held his first meeting with Mr. Greenspan. The Fed chairman told the president-elect that the best thing he could do for the economy would be to undertake a deficit-reduction effort big enough to be judged credible by the bond market.
If Mr. Clinton could show Wall Street that he was intent on getting the deficit under control, Mr. Greenspan told him, investors would conclude that the threat of inflation was diminishing, and they would put downward pressure on long-term interest rates. Lower rates, in turn, would make it easier for consumers to buy cars and houses, and make it more affordable for businesses to build factories or develop technologies.
Four days later, Mr. Clinton's advisers told him of new projections showing that the deficit was going to be considerably larger than anticipated. On Jan. 7, 1993, less than two weeks before Inauguration Day, Mr. Clinton gathered his economic team in Little Rock, Ark.
"Less than an hour into the meeting, he looked at us all around the dining room in the Governor's Mansion and said deficit reduction is a threshold issue," said Robert E. Rubin, the former Wall Street executive who was Mr. Clinton's economic policy coordinator and who later became treasury secretary. "He said if we don't do this, we can't do anything else."
This was largely uncharted territory for a Democratic president. Republicans had always found it easy to embrace deficit reduction, at least in principle, partly for economic reasons but also because it fit their ideological push for smaller, less influential government.
In early 1993 there was no established and politically comfortable deficit-reduction rationale for a Democrat.
But with a little prodding from Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Rubin and others, Mr. Clinton grasped that, through the mechanism of lower interest rates and stronger growth, deficit reduction could be made meaningful to lunch-bucket Democrats.
Mr. Rubin recalled, "Clinton said, 'I have a jobs program, and my jobs program is deficit reduction.' "
The new administration eventually settled on a plan that called for slightly less than a $500 billion deficit reduction over five years, largely through a tax increase on the wealthy, at a time when the deficit was running at nearly $300 billion a year.
He persuaded his party members in Congress to go along, but only barely, and attracted not a single Republican vote in either chamber.
Did the plan work?
Long-term interest rates did go down. The economy, which was already strengthening, warmed so much that the Federal Reserve stepped in to cool it in 1994, driving rates back up. Nonetheless, job growth accelerated and unemployment fell steadily, from 7 percent in mid-1993 to around 6 percent a year later and to about 4 percent throughout this year.
But the economy at that point was being driven at least as much by developments having little to do with government policy as it was by anything happening in Washington.
Facing intense global competition and pressure from shareholders, companies were reaping the benefits of years of cost cutting and investments in technology. The most basic measure of economic potential, the growth rate of productivity, or output per hour, began creeping up after years of lackluster performance.
But if the long-term economic outlook was improving, the immediate political impact of the 1993 budget plan was grim for Democrats. The tax increase, along with the administration's ill-fated health care proposal the next year, led voters in 1994 to hand control of the House and the Senate to Republicans.
With the Republican takeover of Congress, the question was no longer whether the two parties would act to reduce the deficit further; it was whether Mr. Clinton would match the Republican promise for a balanced budget.
Mr. Clinton had made some tough decisions in his first term: pushing the North American Free Trade Agreement through Congress over the objections of much of his party, and bailing Mexico out of a financial crisis.
But it was unclear in early 1995 that a Democratic president could eliminate the budget deficit without sacrificing everything that made him a Democrat, most notably support for poverty-fighting entitlement programs like food stamps, Medicare and Medicaid.
Most of Mr. Clinton's advisers eventually accepted the political need to endorse the principle of a balanced budget. But they were content to let the Republicans put out their plan first, convinced that the Republicans would pay a heavy political price once they had to propose specific budget cuts.
But Mr. Clinton was impatient. His new adviser, Dick Morris, pushed the president to get out in front of the issue, even if it meant proposing his own cuts.
The more liberal members of the White House staff could see that Mr. Clinton was torn, and they feared that he would rush in with a proposal that would endanger what they saw as sacrosanct commitments. Among themselves, staff members talked of quitting should Mr. Clinton cut a deal with Mr. Gingrich and the Republicans.
On April 10, Alan Cohen, a budget analyst at the Treasury Department, ran some numbers. He found that if Mr. Clinton were to propose balancing the budget in 10 or 11 years rather than 5 or 7, as the Republicans were proposing, the administration could protect its priority programs and still eliminate the deficit.
He gave his one-page analysis to Mr. Rubin, who showed it to the president.
On May 29, 1995, Memorial Day, the president called his economic team and senior advisers to the Oval Office.
When he criticized the Republican budget, Mr. Clinton asked them, what was he to say when he was asked where his budget plan was. His voice heavy with sarcasm, he imagined his response: Why should he have a balanced budget? He was only the president of the United States.
Less than three weeks later Mr. Clinton unveiled a plan that he said would eliminate the deficit in 10 years.
Republicans assailed it as unrealistic and too slow, but that was not the point. From that moment, both parties were committed to a goal that a few years earlier was politically and economically unthinkable.
At midmorning on May 2, 1997, negotiators from the White House huddled in an office beneath the Capitol with the members of the House and Senate budget committees to complete a deal to balance the budget.
It had been a long road. A bitter standoff in late 1995 and early 1996 had led to a government shutdown. The issue was put on the back burner during the 1996 campaign, but in early 1997 White House officials opened talks with Republicans in Congress. Their instructions from Mr. Clinton were clear: get an agreement.
The final task on that spring morning was to divide an unexpected windfall, the result of a last-minute re-estimate of the fiscal outlook by the Congressional Budget Office. With the economy getting stronger, tax revenues were pouring in much faster than expected.
The deal they unveiled later that day promised a balanced budget in five years, by 2002, and a reduction in the capital gains tax to boot.
But within months it was clear that the fiscal situation was improving far faster than the agreement had contemplated. Not only was the deficit about to disappear, but surpluses were just over the horizon.
At the White House in the fall of 1997, Gene Sperling, the director of the National Economic Council, convened a series of secret meetings to plot strategy for the new age of surpluses.
The surplus, the president's economic and political advisers decided, should go first to shoring up Social Security, which was going to run short of money as the baby boom generation retired. And committing the surplus to Social Security, that most untouchable of programs, would be a politically impregnable roadblock to using it for tax cuts.
"What should we do with this projected surplus?" Mr. Clinton asked in his 1998 State of the Union address, delivered in the deepening shadow of accusations that he had lied under oath about his sexual relationship with a White House intern. "I have a simple four-word answer: Save Social Security first."
As a practical matter, reserving the surplus for Social Security meant using it to pay down the national debt, the $3.5 trillion hangover from decades of deficit spending.
Over the next several years, with little debate, Congress and the administration drifted into an agreement that showed every sign of being unbreakable: the better portion of the surplus would be off limits for tax cuts and new spending, and would be used only to reduce debt or fill Social Security's long-term financing gap.
In a little over a decade, if the surplus projections and the agreement hold, the debt will be paid off.
White House officials took it as the highest praise when Mr. Greenspan, in a meeting with Mr. Clinton last January, said the president should be congratulated for setting off a bidding war between the parties over which could do more debt reduction.
It is disheartening to some Democrats that in an age of fiscal plenty, the most lasting achievement of the Clinton era may have been not in health care or education or the environment or poverty reduction, but in cleaning up the government's books and keeping Wall Street happy.
Not to Mr. Clinton. Asked in an appearance last summer about the "toughest one or two decisions" and the "highest moments, just the greatest feelings" he had encountered as president, he put one episode in both categories: pushing through his first deficit-reduction package in 1993.
"I knew it was going to turn the country around," he said. "I just knew it."

Success Story For Children, But the Ending Is Uncertain

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
Five years ago, when Elisa Izquierdo suddenly became a symbol of the failure of New York City's child welfare system, the Giuliani administration was criticized for letting the long-troubled city agency for children deteriorate to a new low. Today that agency -- reconfigured, re-energized and infused with millions of dollars to strengthen its staff and management -- seems on its way to becoming one of the administration's major accomplishments.
But there is a paradox in this apparent turnaround. The same elements that made it possible -- public scrutiny, a political commitment buoyed by an economic boom, and a shrinking foster care population -- make its successes tenuous. Political will and public attention wane, and history suggests that when they do, reforms in the system can unravel quickly, especially under the pressures of expansion. 
 The city's child welfare commissioner, Nicholas Scoppetta, says he is committed to the overhaul, which he called "an enormous work in progress." With only a year remaining in Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's term, he added: "It is a challenge to keep the reform going. Whatever happens with the change in administration, the critical thing is to continue."
Earlier this month, a panel of national experts ended two years of monitoring of the agency, the Administration for Children's Services, by praising the city's "remarkable progress."
Improvements they highlighted included Mr. Scoppetta's ambitious plan to reconfigure all foster care services along neighborhood lines; a sharp increase in staff training and salaries; the establishment of family conferences at important points in a child's case; and a shift from a focus on child removal, which characterized Mr. Scoppetta's first three years, toward a slow recognition that child safety would often be better served by preventing the trauma of foster care placement in the first place.
But Mr. Scoppetta and the panel, whose oversight was the result of a legal settlement, agree that the changes have barely penetrated the private, nonprofit agencies that care for 90 percent of the children in foster care, and that the Administration for Children's Services, too, is still working out how to turn new policies into daily work by caseworkers.
Mr. Scoppetta's candor in part reflects the knowledge that meaningful overhauls of the child welfare system came undone in the past. Scrutiny subsided, and competing political interests clashed with the needs of children in the system. Veterans of successes that slipped away have not forgotten those pitfalls.
David Tobis, director of research at the Center for the Study of Family Policy at Hunter College and a major player in the last comparable child welfare overhaul in 1979, said he thought it unlikely that the Giuliani administration, having already reaped a public relations victory from the panel report, would risk the political fight necessary to hold the agencies accountable for achieving actual results. His forecast, correct or not, is fatalistic.
"Our prediction now is that in five years, perhaps somewhat longer, the administrative reforms that have been implemented will unravel as they have so often in the past, because the fundamental problems of the system have not been addressed," Mr. Tobis said, citing "the lack of a comprehensive, early system of prevention, and the tendency to blame parents, particularly poor African-American and Latino families, rather than help them."
Agencies are supposed to lose slots for children, or even their contracts, if they do not accomplish goals like placing children close to home, keeping siblings together, and shortening or preventing stays in foster care through better services to poor parents in their own communities. But in the past, similar accountability measures have been watered down or abandoned under the pressures of city politics, economic downturns, or roller coaster shifts in the foster care population.
In the late 1980's, for example, when Mayor Edward I. Koch wanted Cardinal John J. O'Connor's support in a difficult mayoral election, and child welfare officials were begging for more beds from all foster care agencies, including those affiliated with Catholic Charities, the city quietly dropped any effort to enforce similar performance measures.
It is much easier for the city to demand changes of the foster care agencies when they are competing for a shrinking pool of children, but the current decline in the foster care population might slow or reverse in an economic downturn. The decline, to about 31,000 children today from a peak of 49,100 in 1991, in part reflects the departure of a huge contingent of children affected by the crack epidemic who are reaching adulthood, and masks the fact that annual removals of children from their homes surged to 12,536 in fiscal year 1998, from 7,949 in 1995, before subsiding to about 10,000 in each of the last two years. Many child advocates say that number is still far too high, especially since nearly half the children come from only a dozen community districts in the city and the average length of a stay in the system seems stuck at four years.
"Agencies have to roll up their sleeves and open offices in these districts," said John Courtney, who helped create an earlier agency accountability system for the city that fell apart in the 1980's. "Some have embraced the concept, and some are dragging their feet.
"Having been inside the system, I know how difficult it is to move it in any direction," added Mr. Courtney, who once directed a large foster care agency and is now an editor at Child Welfare Watch, a watchdog publication. "The political winds and the political landscape have to be going in the same direction."
The city acknowledges that the private agencies have lagged far behind in training, salaries and management, while the city upgraded its own staff and supervisors. The expert panel has urged the city to lobby the State Legislature for better agency reimbursement, and a new formula rewards agencies that quickly return children to their own homes or place them for adoption. With such financing as the carrot, Mr. Courtney said, real change might be possible this time if Mr. Scoppetta stands firm on the new rules and the next administration embraces his neighborhood plan.
"If not," he said, "there's going to be a retrenchment and a resistance, and we'll see much of the gains start to deteriorate."
Mr. Tobis said he feared that Mr. Scoppetta may have already squandered the best chance to intensify the agencies' work with parents to prevent foster care placement, which the panel called the heart of any lasting overhaul.
Mr. Giuliani's initial budget cuts sharply reduced these prevention programs, and money for them has remained flat for four years, even as Mr. Scoppetta commanded a $43 million increase in his agency's budget.
Sympathy for parents with children at risk of foster care placement probably reached a low point at the end of 1995, when Elisa Izquierdo, 6, was beaten to death by her mother while under the city's watch. The case seized public attention just as Marcia Robinson Lowry, a leading litigator for children, was preparing a broad class-action lawsuit against the system.
What Mr. Scoppetta has achieved since then is still more road map than highway, with many dotted lines where construction is under way, said Monica Drinane, attorney in charge of the juvenile rights division of the Legal Aid Society. That helps explain the apparent contradiction between those who marvel at how much has been accomplished, and those on the front lines who say that for children and families, almost nothing has changed.
The panel has found that caseworkers are sometimes so ill prepared that they are unable to explain to a judge why children were removed from their homes. Judges, operating out of fear, frequently approve placing children in foster care even when the city fails to provide sufficient evidence of abuse and neglect, the panel said.
But now, Ms. Drinane said, the Administration for Children's Services is supporting a push for legal representation for all parents who appear in Family Court. She said the five-member panel, financed by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a child welfare philanthropy, has provided the right mix of prodding and praise to begin to rebalance the agency in fundamental ways.
And last week, at Mr. Scoppetta's invitation, panel members agreed to stay on to advise him.
"I was very naive when I took office," Mr. Scoppetta said. "I thought two or three years till reform will take hold. I think it has taken hold, but there is much more to be done."

HEADLINE: WORKER SHORTAGE IN HEALTH FIELDS WORST IN DECADES

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Hospitals, nursing homes and private home care agencies throughout New York are experiencing the worst staffing shortage in decades, health care policy experts, union officials and industry executives say.
The shortages are most acute among low-paid nurses' aides who work in nursing homes, and both state legislators and the state attorney general's office have linked the low staffing levels to abuse and neglect of patients. 
 But the shortages have extended in recent years to many areas of health care. Hospitals complain that there are too few registered nurses, pharmacists and workers who code medical records, and home health care agencies say turnover among aides is at an all-time high.
The staffing problems first began a few years ago in the Hudson Valley, but have spread throughout the state in the last year, striking New York City just recently.
At White Plains Hospital Center, it is now taking six to nine months to fill specialized nursing positions, compared with the three to six months it took just a year ago. Fedcap Home Care Services in New York City now turns away roughly half the patients who request short shifts of nursing care. And nursing home workers who each used to care for about seven residents during the day shift are now regularly compelled to care for 10 or 11 people, and as many as 40 during the night shift, union officials say.
"The work force shortage is one of the most critical issues facing health care in New York State right now," said Daniel Sisto, president of the Healthcare Association of New York State, a lobbying group for hospitals and health care systems. "I think it is affecting care. No health care association wants to admit that, but I think that hospital C.E.O.'s are no longer in a position to guarantee the public that optimum quality of care is being delivered."
The difficulties in finding and keeping health care workers stem in large part from a booming economy that has created a surplus of higher-paying, less demanding jobs in other fields.
But even more troubling, experts say, are factors that go beyond simply a wealth of job options, and they are forces that will not necessarily be altered by a slowing of the economy, even a recession.
Those factors include a steady decline in nursing school enrollment, and a growing nursing home population that is sicker, and whose more complex medical problems have transformed the job requirements of the people who care for them. In addition, the entire profession suffers from a major public relations problem, with certain jobs in health care often perceived as thankless occupations rather than labors of love.
Similar labor shortages in the health care industry are being felt all over the country. For instance, enrollment in advanced nursing programs has fallen for five consecutive years, according to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.
But while enrollment in bachelor's degree nursing programs declined nationally by 4.6 percent in 1999, it fell the most -- 7.4 percent -- in schools in the North Atlantic states, including New York. In a recent survey by a trade association, the New York State Association of Health Care Providers, 93 percent of the state's roughly 200 home health care agencies said they could not find enough workers to fill vacancies.
New York's extremely low unemployment rate has made it hard to attract workers, and a decrease in Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements three years ago has kept salaries in many areas of health care low.
For example, recent Congressional projections for the budget period from 1998 to 2003 show an estimated $69 billion drop in spending on Medicare home health programs, a figure more than four times as large as what Congress originally projected. Those reductions end up cutting right into salaries. Most home health aides in New York are paid $5.15 an hour, the federal minimum wage, though some receive as much as $7.
As part of these cuts, many Medicare patients are now entitled to only two hours of home care a day, and the vast majority want nurses' aides in the morning, leaving workers idle in the afternoon and contributing to a shortage of aides for early shifts. As a result, turnover among aides is climbing, executives say, because there is not enough work to go around, and some are leaving the profession altogether, for jobs like retail sales clerk.
"If people are thinking about where they can make the best dollar, they are not going to go into this line of work," said Phyllis Wang, president of the New York State Association of Health Care Providers. "There are more and more opportunities out there, and there has been another full cycle of not giving pay increases while retailers are bidding up. All it takes is 25 cents to lose a worker."
But there are many other factors, some of them demographic, others just plain quirky, that have contributed to the shortages, and those will not be ameliorated by a weakening economy, industry officials fear.
The average age of those in nursing homes, for instance, has risen sharply in recent years as the population has grown older. Many younger and more robust elderly people have opted for other types of housing, like assisted-living communities, leaving the sickest and most challenging patients to be cared for in nursing homes.
"The kind of residents that come in the nursing homes these days are more demented, more aggressive and more old," said Olgarene Oliver, who has worked as a nurses' aide for 26 years. "It is much harder to take care of them. I have a friend who had to leave because a patient slammed her against a wall and broke her collarbone."
More difficult patients, combined with the added paperwork generated by managed care in recent years, has meant that workers are spread more thinly. A report issued last summer by the federal Health Care Financing Administration found that 54 percent of the country's nursing homes provide less than the minimal two hours a day of nurses' aide care for each patient, and New York's experience is consistent with those findings.
Jay Sackman, executive vice president for the nursing home workers unit of 1199/S.E.I.U., New York's largest union of health care employees, said staffing levels were the worst he has seen since 1968.
Nursing homes have been the target of both the State Department of Health and the state attorney general in the last year, and The Daily News last week published a series of articles describing failures in care and supervision at nursing homes in the city.
This year, the Health Department cited 55 of 58 homes that it surveyed, for minor infractions like not getting a patient a yogurt in a reasonable amount of time to far more serious problems involving care. The attorney general's office has investigated 264 cases of patient abuse in nursing homes this year, double the number in 1999.
At a public hearing this month in New York City, Jose Maldonado, a deputy attorney general who heads the state's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, strongly recommended that the state impose minimum staff-to-patient ratios in nursing homes to better safeguard against patient abuse. There is also a bill in the State Legislature to set such requirements, and it has the support of numerous patient advocacy groups.
A nursing home industry group, the New York Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, has responded coolly to such proposed requirements, arguing that there is no money to pay for more workers.
Wayne Osten, a State Health Department official, said at the hearing that he believed that Medicaid reimbursements to nursing homes were substantial enough to attract more workers. He also said that the Health Department would spend $80 million on a program to attract, train and subsidize poor New Yorkers who agree to work in health care, and that it was seeking proposals to develop the program.
Hospitals, meanwhile, are facing their own labor woes. They have had a difficult time attracting pharmacists in the last two years, largely because of competition from the growing drugstore industry, which has poached many workers and pushed up wages. According to a recent study by the federal Department of Health and Human Services, pharmacy jobs in the retail sector have grown at nearly three times the rate of those in hospitals.
And that hardship for hospitals could worsen, both because of declining enrollment in pharmacy schools and because a recent change by those schools has lengthened the required study to six years from five, delaying the entry of new pharmacists into the market.
Hospitals have also been scrambling to find nurses in recent years, and the situation has worsened considerably in the last six months. The problem is especially stubborn among specialty nurses, like those who work in operating rooms, intensive-care units and labor and delivery units.
The average vacancy rate for registered nurses in hospitals around New York City is 5.5 percent, though as recently as 1998, many nursing school graduates could not get jobs, said Patricia O'Brien, the senior administrator for regulatory and professional affairs at the Greater New York Hospital Association. In some pockets of the city, the rate is closer to 9 percent.
Mr. Sisto, of the Healthcare Association of New York State, said that around New York, some hospitals have been forced to cancel elective surgeries and divert ambulances away from emergency rooms because of the nursing shortage.
What is more, Ms. O'Brien said, the average age of nurses is now above 40, and the ratio of nurses over 50 to those in their 20's is expected to reach four to one in the next few years, leaving fewer nurses to replace those who will be retiring.
Ms. Wang, the official with the New York State Association of Health Care Providers, said, "We are just not sure the workers are out there."
Fewer young people are considering careers as nurses and nurses' aides, experts say. Many of the state's vocational programs for licensed practical nurses have been shelved in recent years, and high school guidance counselors are not encouraging careers in nursing and health support services. New York's health care industry itself has done little for recruitment, experts say.
As a result, Ms. Wang's organization, as well as the Healthcare Association of New York and other industry groups, have formed a coalition on staffing. They hope to develop legislative proposals to get more Medicaid money for wages, to recruit retired police officers and firefighters into second careers in health care, and to begin marketing efforts to attract young recruits.
Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, chairman of the Assembly Health Committee, is sponsoring a bill that would establish minimum staffing levels in nursing homes. He expects the labor problem to be high on the Legislature's agenda this winter.
"I think staffing in nursing homes, home care and hospitals is going to be a major budget issue," Mr. Gottfried said.

HEADLINE: MEDIA;
A One-Issue Magazine Goes Under

BYLINE: By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
Every couple of years, the few thousand men and women who populate the magazine industry abandon their usual skepticism and schadenfreude and start to buzz about an enticing new magazine in development.
For some reason or another, there is a sense of good will and a kind of hey-gang-let's-put-on-a-show-in-the-barn anticipation around the project. There is a hot editor and a savvy publisher, a raft of award-winning photographers and the promise of an intriguing, fresh editorial mix. 
 Fuse magazine had all of those things. But most consumers will never see it because its largely anonymous and very brief life is a fable from the front lines of the dot-com bust.
In September 1998, the editor in chief, Lisa Gabor, conceived the idea of melding the sensibilities of Fortune and In Style to create a chic business lifestyle magazine. At the time, she was a development editor at Time Inc.
But because Time was already working on a new economy title, eCompany Now, Ms. Gabor found a backer in Imagine Media, which publishes the new economy magazine Business 2.0, among several other technology-oriented titles in the United States. She asked Richard Pandiscio, a creative director who had made his reputation at two temples of magazine chic, Interview and Conde Nast, to join the team.
Then came two and a half years of development, cocktail-napkin sketches and white-board sessions, thousands of hours spent editing and photographing and typesetting and designing.
And finally, late last month, 350,000 copies of Fuse magazine's first issue were winging their way to Business 2.0 subscribers --just as Imagine Media decided to pull the plug on Fuse.
"The problems had nothing to do with us," Ms. Gabor said. "We were not a new-economy magazine. We were a today's economy magazine. But the problem is that Imagine is a new-economy company."
And how. Imagine Media's parent is the Future Network, a British company that publishes computer, new-media and video-game magazines.
And Future Network has had a particularly tumultuous year.
In February, when the company's stock hit a high of 927 pence ($1.37 at current exchange rates) in London, expectations were high and analysts were predicting bounty.
Even in March, shortly before technology stocks crashed, the outlook appeared especially rosy for Business 2.0.
Future Network had announced that Business 2.0 would be its biggest moneymaker, buoyed by growing advertising revenue as the magazine went on sale in Britain, Israel and other countries this year with a French edition planned for 2001.
Through the end of November, according to the Publishers Information Bureau, the American edition of Business 2.0 has indeed performed well.
The magazine has generated $84.9 million for Imagine, up 215 percent from $15.9 million in the comparable period a year earlier. Ad pages are up 432 percent, to 3,479 for the year to date.
In November, the Future Networks chief executive, Greg Ingham, said sales for the company's video-game magazines would be down because Sony was not shipping enough PlayStation 2 game consoles to meet demand. (Imagine's titles include PSM: PlayStation Magazine.)
He also said Business 2.0's advertising would be lower than expected. Technology advertising was down, and although the magazine had begun "a transition toward a broader base of advertisers," the company said in a statement, "there are signs that some nondot-com marketing budgets were also being reduced."
There was another troubling development. Mr. Ingham discovered that Future Network's French division had been overstating earnings the last three years.
The three factors combined meant that the company's 2000 profit would be about $8.6 million below forecast.
So not only was Future Network faced with some unexpected financial burdens, but the dot-com boom was going bust.
The dot-com shakeout was affecting other Internet-focused magazines, too. This month, for example, the weekly Industry Standard announced that it would fold its special monthly edition, Grok, because it had failed to attract enough advertising. Upside Media, publisher of Upside magazine, has restructured its business and its management.
Red Herring Communications laid off 22 people. And Wired and eCompany Now are also publishing slimmer issues than they did before.
But Future Networks' announcement on Nov. 13 was particularly ill-timed for Fuse, whose first issue was shipped the week of Nov. 27.
On Nov. 29, Michela O'Connor Abrams, president of Imagine's business division and publisher of Business 2.0, came to the Fuse office to deliver the news.
"She said that really this was all about their situation with the parent company," Ms. Gabor said last week. "She said they they could not afford to invest in a launch right now, and they had to put the money back into their mature magazines, like Business 2.0."
As Ms. Abrams was speaking, the mailman arrived -- bearing the first copies of Fuse.
"We all sort of laughed nervously," Mr. Pandiscio recalled.
Ms. Abrams said that she initially had high hopes for Fuse but that the decision to pull the magazine was not based solely on the unexpectedly bad performance of Future Networks.
"This is more inextricably linked to the economy at this point and is not just a dot-com issue," Ms. Abrams said. "We're experiencing a slowdown much greater than the Fed thought and a much more extremely conservative approach from marketers to the work-lifestyle sector, which is the sector that Fuse addressed. Add up those things, and they are not ingredients that are wonderfully promising for a brand-new launch."
The question now is whether there is a future for Fuse anywhere.
Judging from the first issue, the magazine is a quirky, thoughtfully designed hodgepodge of business stories, profiles and lifestyle features, all suffused with a new-economy flavor.
There is a history of burnout, which starts in 530 B.C.: "Nepalese Prince Siddartha Gautama renounces his fortune for a spiritual life; he becomes the Buddha at the age of 35."
There is a column called "Ask the Office Confidant."
There is an essay by Ernst Malmsten, the founder of Boo.com, one of the Internet's most notorious failures, on what he wished he had known before starting the company.
Ms. Gabor said that Imagine had offered some options, including folding Fuse into Business 2.0 as a special section.
"A special section is not a magazine," she said. "I had approached them with a proposal for a stand-alone magazine. I still believe in the validity of the concept. I do not know what is going to happen next, and the market is certainly more challenging now."
Ms. Abrams, on the other hand, said that readers should expect to see a Fuse-like section in upcoming issues of Business 2.0.
Ms. Gabor, who spent two and half years developing the magazine, said last week that she felt "numb" and was leaving the country to spend Christmas with friends and "decompress" over the loss of Fuse.
But Mr. Pandiscio said that, in a way, he was mentally prepared for the magazine's sudden death. "We had prepared a lot of stories about failure, about the notion that in failure there is always a grander lesson," he said. "And yes, we did learn our lesson here."

CORRECTION-DATE: December 28, 2000, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Monday about Fuse magazine, which closed after one issue, misstated the dollar value of the stock of its parent, the British company Future Network. At its high in February, the stock reached 927 pence, or $13.70 at current exchange rates, not $1.37.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Ways

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Stock Gambling on the Cheap," by Frank Partnoy (Op-Ed, Dec. 21):
It is all too tempting in this time of falling stock prices to invoke the usual populist refrain: small investors are victims of derivative-dealing Wall Street sophisticates and somnolent regulators. 
 Mr. Partnoy mentions futures and swaps, which are derivatives. Derivatives are designed to transfer money in creative ways that allow companies to hedge unforeseen risks. They are not necessarily "bets" any more than kitchen knives are necessarily weapons.
Deregulating these financial contracts benefits business, the economy and both professional and individual investors. The primary result of deregulation will be to remove the uncertainty associated with regulatory caprice and reinforce respect for legally binding contracts.

HEADLINE: Nuclear Power Benefit

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A Dec. 20 Business Day article about the renewed interest in nuclear power discussed the economic incentives. You should have mentioned the environmental benefits, with their long-term cost savings.
Increased use of nuclear power would help save irreplaceable fossil fuel for future generations and reduce production of climate-warming gases and air pollution. More than a dozen countries make greater use of nuclear power than the United States. 
 The environmental problem of waste burial can be solved by geologists, who have studied rock structures that have not moved in tens of millions of years. The political problems of such waste disposal require stronger, more honest leaders in government and environmental circles than have yet appeared.

For 130 Years, a Metropolis of Extremes

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT 

 BODY:

BERLIN
By David Clay Large
Illustrated. 706 pages. Basic Books. $40.
 If Paris was, in Walter Benjamin's phrase, the "Capital of the 19th century," then Berlin became "the signature city of the next hundred years." So writes David Clay Large, risking understatement, in his introduction to "Berlin," a witty and occasionally caustic history of that city since 1871.
You could also say that if the 19th turned out to be a reasonably good century for Paris, the 20th was on the whole a bad one for Berlin. Again speaking mildly, Mr. Large goes on to state that "no other place has so dramatically encapsulated the highs and lows of our modern human experience." 
 Framing his narrative between the two unifications of Germany, in 1871 and 1990, Mr. Large recounts the extremes of Berlin's experience. Until 1933 the city stood out as a symbol of modernity in both the positive and negative senses of the word. From 1933 to 1945, the Nazi era, it represented the culmination of all that has been abusive and unjust in human history.
After 1945, Mr. Large writes, Berlin "took on yet another symbolic role: that of capital of the cold war," literally divided by the wall put up by East Germany in 1961. "Since the fall of the wall and the end of the Great Divide," he concludes, "Berlin has come to represent humanity's aspirations for a new beginning, tempered by caution deriving from the traumas of the recent past."
A professor of history at Montana State University and the author of four previous books, among them "Where Ghosts Walked: Munich's Road to the Third Reich" and "Germans in the Front: West German Rearmament in the Adenauer Era," Mr. Large traces Berlin's history here within the broader context of Germany, Europe and the world, always emphasizing the city's perspective, whether the subject is political, social, economic or cultural.
The story is a complex one to piece together, and Mr. Large infrequently lapses into mere recitation of sequential events, as for instance when he follows mention of the 1929 Wall Street crash and its consequences for Berlin with an entertaining account of the making of the film "The Blue Angel," directed by Josef von Sternberg and starring Marlene Dietrich and Emil Jannings.
But usually Mr. Large keeps one theme or other of his story in view. Prominent among them and supplying a good deal of his story's vitality is the disapproval so many outsiders have felt for Berlin.
Whether they were German leaders like Bismarck, who, in Mr. Large's words, "saw Berlin as an ugly concrete jungle full of pallid people and nasty urban smells"; Kaiser Wilhelm II, who saw the city as too irreverent toward royal authority; Chancellor Conrad Adenauer, who equated Berlin with everything he hated, from socialism to Protestantism; even Hitler, who identified the city with cultural corruption; or simply those who happened not to live there and resented the city as a bastion of Prussian arrogance, people were forever trying to change Berliners or teach them some lesson.
A result was that Berliners were often in rebellion, doing the opposite of what was expected of them and thus burnishing their reputation for subversive wit and cutting-edge creativity. Mr. Large pays particular attention to the effects of such ferment in his surveys of the city's cultural scene over the decades. Only isolation and division succeeded in dampening Berlin's spirits, he argues, as during the cold war era when the city seemed to lose its creative elan.
One hesitates to attribute a single psychology to any city, and Mr. Large reminds us time and again how especially complicated Berliners have always been, thanks partly to what he describes as "their peculiar brand of impudent and subversive wit, the famous Berliner Schnauze"; partly to what the playwright Bertolt Brecht described as their forgetfulness and simultaneous capacity to wax nostalgic for what they've forgotten; and finally to their knack for embracing contradictions.
Yet if any single attitude prevails in Mr. Large's narrative, it is the city's sense throughout the past 130 years that it somehow fell short as a world city and that had to overcompensate for its failings and at the same time compensate for its overcompensation.
As Mr. Large puts it, "Being a latecomer as both a national capital and a major European metropolis, Berlin suffered from a municipal inferiority complex that proved hard to shrug off as the city struggled to catch up with the more established European capitals." He concludes, "Now that Berlin has been reunited and has resumed its position as a European capital . . . Berliners are hopeful that this time they will make the grade."
While one may share the hope that Berlin will finally make it as a world-class city, one hopes even more fervently that the city's sense of inadequacy and pressure to succeed has diminished somewhat. One certainly wouldn't want the world to live through another century in the city's life like the one Mr. Large has described so absorbingly.

Punch and Charm in Overlooked American Songs

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI 

 BODY:
A new generation of American song composers has been winning the support of singers and song enthusiasts. And whatever one may think of their work, the fact that new songs are being written and performed is good news. But when singers present songs from earlier decades, the same handful of composers tend to turn up on programs. A great deal of interesting repertory is being sadly overlooked. That's why three recent recordings of little-known songs by three notable American composers are so welcome.
 
Otto Luening
Born to a family of German musicians in Milwaukee in 1900, Otto Luening was renowned for his pioneering experiments with electronic music in the 1950's. Luening, who died in 1996, mostly composed in a rather conservative, though lucid and elegant, tonal style. Having worked as an opera coach and conductor, he was particularly adept at vocal music. Of his nearly 400 compositions, some 80 are songs, and "Songs of Otto Luening" (CRI, 840), with the soprano Judith Bettina and the pianist James Goldsworthy, present 30 of them, composed between 1917 and 1993. 
 Luening chose texts with discerning literary taste and set words with admirable clarity. There are no wasted notes or pumped up emotions in these songs. They are direct, lyrical and often quite short. "She Walks in Beauty," to a poem by Byron, is typical, a lovely song with a beguiling melodic line and a hymnal-like piano accompaniment. Yet even here the spacious voicing of the chords and the sometimes unexpected progressions give the work a modern edge and a quality of surprise.
Luening could get spikier when he wanted to, as in his short setting of Whitman's "Farm Picture," with its punchy piano clusters and deceptively simple tune. He has a special flair for the words of James Joyce, whom Luening had worked with in Joyce's theater troupe, the English Players, in Zurich. Ms. Bettina's singing is a model of vocal grace and verbal clarity, and Mr. Goldsworthy plays with great sensitivity.
 
Gardner Read
Born in Evanston, Ill., in 1913, Gardner Read, the composer, conductor and teacher, may be best known for his useful books on orchestration. A self-described conservative composer who employs an early-20th-century tonal language with splashes of Impressionism, Mr. Read has been overlooked. "Gardner Read: The Art of Song" (Albany Records, 336), with the mezzo-soprano D'Anna Fortunato and the pianist John McDonald, is a surprise and a delight. Though not daring or highly original, the songs are exquisite.
In "Up and Down the River the Barges Go," an undulant, shimmering 1946 setting of a Frances Frost poem, Mr. Read seems like an American Duparc. His music for "From a Lute of Jade," settings of Chinese poems from the fifth through seventh centuries, is economical, understated and lovely, unmarred by even a trace of Oriental exotica. Three "Songs for Children" are accompanied by a six-piece chamber ensemble. "A Sheaf of Songs" employs a brass quintet. These striking song sets testify to Mr. Read's skills at instrumentation.
Ms. Fortunato brings her rich voice and superb artistry to the music. Mr. McDonald, who is also a composer, is an attentive and imaginative pianist.
 
Jack Beeson
In recent years, the New York City Opera's successful production of Jack Beeson's 1965 opera "Lizzie Borden" has brought a whole new generation of admirers to this veteran American composer, born in Muncie, Ind., in 1921. Mr. Beeson's songs, some 80 to date, are less often heard, which makes "Fire, Fire, Quench Desire: Songs of Jack Beeson" (Albany Records, 382), with the soprano Angela Brown and the pianist Dixie Ross Neill, a welcome release.
Not surprisingly, given Mr. Beeson's penchant for opera, many of his songs are more like dramatic soliloquies than tune-and-accompaniment art songs. Dreamy meditations, like the wistful setting of Thomas Lovell Beddoes's "Song," and fitful works like the story setting of Jasper Mayne's "Time," have a narrative sweep to them.
Of these three composers, Mr. Beeson's harmonic language, though still essentially tonal, is the most far-ranging and modern. The album's title song, a 1959 setting of a poem by George Peele, is a full-fledged 12-tone work. Still, Mr. Beeson values clarity of texture and directness of expression. Ms. Brown's bright voice can turn edgy in the top range. But she is a gifted and literate interpreter of songs who is well served by Ms. Neill's able pianism.

HEADLINE: Rampant Obesity, a Debilitating Reality for the Urban Poor

SERIES: THE FAT EPIDEMIC: Stuck Inside

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 25

 BODY:
Clara Holloway's boys do not go to school anymore. Instead, they often sit at home, eating and watching television in a darkened apartment here on the South Side.
They are not in school because of health problems, and because their mother does not want them on the streets of a neighborhood that local church leaders are still trying to take back from the gangs and drug dealers. 
 So on a typical Monday morning, Jeffrey, 15, can be found in the living room, slumped in a big easy chair, watching the Cartoon Network while Robert, 17, is sprawled across his bed, drifting in and out of sleep.
The boys are also coping with obesity, which is spreading all over the country, but particularly, some say, among the blacks and Hispanics who are part of America's urban poor. Nutritionists say part of the problem is a lack of knowledge of nutrition and little access to stores with healthier foods.
"There's no question that study after study shows that minorities have poorer diets from a nutritional point of view," said Dr. P. Peter Basiotis, an economist and the director of nutrition policy and analysis at the federal Department of Agriculture. Many, he added, are also "less physically active," creating more problems.
Obesity is a growing problem among all groups in the United States. But according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 27 percent of blacks and about 21 percent of Hispanics of all ages are considered obese, or about 30 percent overweight, compared with just 17 percent for whites. That means that 26 million blacks and Hispanics in the country are obese, and as a result, at risk for serious health problems. And lower income minorities are at even greater risk, according to federal statistics.
The Holloway boys, who are black, are part of that equation. As a result of a pattern of eating high-calorie foods while getting little or no exercise, Robert and Jeffrey weigh 415 pounds and 280 pounds, respectively, far above the optimal weight for their 5-foot-9 and 5-foot-8 frames.
Robert is diabetic and spent several months in the hospital before dropping out of high school last year.
Jeffrey's situation is even more precarious. He has asthma and sleep apnea, a disease that causes people to stop breathing temporarily during sleep, and doctors believe his weight is a factor in a recent spate of unpredictable, and still unexplained, fainting spells.
"He's been in and out of the emergency room, and they'd check him and say they'd never seen anything like it," said Mrs. Holloway, a 48-year-old widow, adding that she had to take five months off work to care for him. "When he sleeps, the windpipe closes up. They said maybe his weight had something to do with it. Now I'm afraid to send him out by himself." She fears he may faint on his way to school.
Medical experts say Type 2 diabetes and sleep apnea are widely believed to be linked to obesity, but while asthma is common among the obese, there is no clear cause and effect relationship. Yet these are the mysteries with which families like the Holloways grapple.
Mrs. Holloway, who often works six days a week wrapping Butterfinger candy bars, says she raised six children on the Southern dishes she grew up with, like fried pork chops, fried chicken and cornbread.
Now, though, Mrs. Holloway says Robert and Jeffrey's health problems leave her torn between serving the familiar foods and trying to master low-fat recipes on a meager budget; between treating her children to the foods they crave and bringing home McIntosh apples.
Robert, who sometimes complains about the food changes his mother has made, appears pessimistic about losing weight. "My life is terrible," he said almost inaudibly one recent afternoon, as his voice cracked. "It may be too late for me to do something."
Jeffrey, who often struggles to lift himself from a chair, is trying to change his diet, eating more apples and cutting back on fried foods. He dreams of playing professional football like his hero Warren Sapp, the defensive lineman from Tampa Bay.
"I think about my future all the time," he said. "I want to get better."
Yet he has few options. In District 7, where the Holloways live, drug dealers congregate on the corner and handwritten street signs plead, "God Love Us, Stop the Violence." It is a four-square-mile area that registered 863 violent crimes in the first three months of this year.
When Mrs. Holloway keeps her boys at home to protect them, however, the result is an inner-city recipe for obesity. Further, federal statistics show that rates of obesity are highest among the poor.
"There have been several studies that suggest that blacks and Mexican-Americans are less active than their Caucasian counterparts," said Dr. Ross E. Andersen, an assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University. "Our study of blacks and Mexican-Americans showed there was a clear link between the number of hours of TV watched and body fat."
In another study, he found that on average, black children watched much more television than white children. While 26 percent of children ages 8 to 16 in his study watched four or more hours of television daily, the figure was 42 percent among black children.
An experiment last year by a Stanford professor, Dr. Thomas Robinson, showed something similar. Dr. Robinson studied 192 third- and fourth-grade children in two schools, letting children at one school alone and encouraging the others to watch less television. After seven months, the children who had been encouraged to watch less television gained an average of two pounds less than the others, and their waists were nearly an inch smaller.
Part of the problem, experts say, is that when children watch television, they are exposed to a continuing stream of commercials for candy, snacks and junk food.
"Food is widely available here in the U.S., and in pernicious ways," said Dr. Kelly D. Brownell, a psychology professor at Yale. "The average child sees 10,000 food advertisements a year, and even the most intrepid parent can't keep up with that." A recent Agriculture Department report on diet quality shows that about 28 percent of blacks have poor diets, compared with just 16 percent of whites, and blacks are particularly deficient in fruits and vegetables.
Other federal statistics show that rates of obesity climb as poverty increases, particularly among minorities. While about 16 percent of whites who earn about $50,000 a year are obese, that rate climbs to nearly 23 percent among those whites who earn about $15,000. On the other hand, 22.5 percent of blacks who earn $50,000 are obese, but that figure rises to nearly 34 percent for those blacks who make about $15,000.
Of course, the factors that determine who is obese are complicated. Environment, daily habits and hereditary factors all come into play. In the Holloway household, Jeffrey has a twin sister, Jennifer, who is relatively slim, as is their sister Ayanna, 22. Two other children, Michael, 27, and Melissa, 12, are heavy but not obese.
"In individual families there are genetic components and there are behavioral components, and teasing these apart is pretty impossible," said Dr. Robinson of Stanford.
Regardless of the causes, obesity is creating major problems among the urban poor. Here in the Englewood section of Chicago, where the Holloways live, experts estimate that more than one in four blacks (and nearly that many Hispanics) are obese.
A few weeks ago, clinic staff members at the Englewood Health Center gathered to discuss the soaring rate of Type 2 diabetes in the area and the growing number of overweight youths. The center is trying to raise awareness, albeit among people with many other pressing concerns.
"Their priorities aren't food choices," said Zachary Morgan, director of the center. "They're trying to pay their bills."
The resulting obesity has led to growing concerns about high rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and asthma in younger and younger patients.
"I'm counseling young people all the time," said Dr. Daniel S. Kirschenbaum, director of the obesity clinic at La Rabida Children's Hospital here on the South Side. "It's almost as if I'm talking to old people. It's like talking to someone who's 80 years old. They have the same maladies; they have trouble moving; they have asthma."
The Holloways, whose budget is so tight they must occasionally use the stove burners for heat, went to La Rabida last summer for obesity counseling.
After the sessions, they realized that for years they had ignored standard nutritional guidelines about what to eat. "We've changed the way we eat a whole lot," said Mrs. Holloway. "I used to make pork chops, steak and a lot of fried chicken, and now there's turkey meat. I don't fry a whole lot of food, I boil or bake it."
There is also fresh fruit, generally apples, and canned pineapples, apricot halves and large bags of frozen vegetables.
Like many other families, though, the Holloways still buy little fresh produce. Those items are perishable, and typically more costly, Mrs. Holloway said, and few stores nearby appear to have large stocks of fresh fruits and vegetables.
"People in the inner-city neighborhoods have far fewer choices," said Dr. William Julius Wilson, a professor of social policy at Harvard. "They don't have big supermarkets in their areas; they go outside the neighborhood and stock up on canned goods."
A few weeks ago, Mrs. Holloway went to Aldi, a grocery store that specializes in generic bulk goods. Few shoppers seemed to be searching out healthy foods. They wanted bargains, and they got them: a box of saltines for just 49 cents, margarine for 49 cents a box, a frozen dinner steak for $1.79.
Sometimes, Mrs. Holloway goes to Fair Play, another giant grocery store about two and a half miles from her home. It has a large base of black and Hispanic customers and is stocked with enormous selections of meats, particularly pork: smoked hock, slabs of bacon and sausage links.
The manager of the store, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said that besides meats, the store's most popular items were Kraft macaroni and cheese, Jiffy corn muffin mix and loaves of white bread, which can be bought three for $1.
Such patterns were apparent in a 1999 survey conducted by A. C. Nielsen Home scan, which tracks consumer buying habits among 55,000 households. It showed that blacks were heavy buyers of frozen and canned goods, pork products and starchy foods. Hispanics were more likely to buy vegetables, but also to buy large quantities of items high in saturated fats, like lard and refried beans.
The other day, Jeffrey was counting out his former fast-food favorites. "I used to go to KFC, McDonald's, Burger King," he said. "I used to go to White Castle. They had these great specials, so I used to go every day."
Others in the same situation have similar habits. On the northwest side of Chicago, where a large Puerto Rican community has settled, Milagros Jimenez-Abril, a 29-year-old mother of three, complained about her weight problem as she prepared to give an Avon party. She was not shy about saying why she was in this predicament.
"I hate when people say they don't eat and they're fat," she said. "I'm fat because I love to eat a lot of junk food."
The Jimenez-Abril family -- which also includes Francisco, 10; Marcos, 5; Raziel, 2; and Ms. Jimenez-Abril's husband, Edwin, a security guard -- is living just above the poverty line. They have a comfortable apartment, but, like the Holloways, they also fear neighborhood crime. "They don't go out," Ms. Jimenez-Abril says of her boys.
The children, like those anywhere, clamor for the latest food fads. But Ms. Jimenez-Abril, at 5 feet 4 and about 200 pounds, is the only one facing weight problems.
She is trying to cut back and has pasted a diet plan on her refrigerator door to show how determined she is to rejoin the dance troupe at her church.
"My feet just hurt too bad right now," she said. "But I just got my Herbalife diet package in the mail."
On a brisk morning a few weeks back, Mrs. Holloway dismissed all the talk about obesity and fatty foods and headed to Miss Muffett's, where she and Jeffrey ordered the "Big Man's Meal" -- eggs, a giant pancake, sausage and toast -- for $5.81.
Still, for Jeffrey, progress has been good: he has lost 16 pounds, his mother said, and he is eager to lose more. Three years from now, he said, "I hope to be thin."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Another starry year for the industry: dot-comedies, some electoral spoofs and 2 dead dogs.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
WHAT a year this has been for Madison Avenue. Agencies were acquired faster than Jack Robinson could say "Donny Deutsch." Accounts were shifted between shops more often than George W. Bush mispronounced "subliminal." There were more consolidations of large accounts than viewers of "Dot Comedy" on ABC.
And speaking of dot-comedies, an entire category of advertisers -- recklessly spending e-commerce Web sites -- was born, flourished and vanished at a pace reminiscent of the sped-up footage from those old Walt Disney nature films of plants germinating, blooming and wilting. 
 Here is a look back at the follies and fresh moments of 2000 for advertising, marketing and the media.
 
COURTING CONTROVERSY -- Typically, advertisers and agencies avoid associating with contentious issues that divide the country. Though few events have divided America more deeply than the outcome of the Bush-Gore presidential race, several marketers rushed out ads that tried to find some good-natured fun amid the bitter disputes.
Most notable was a commercial for the Pizza Hut chain owned by Tricon Global Restaurants, which mocked the chameleon-like color changes the map of Florida underwent during the networks' election coverage. The spot was created by the New York office of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group. Just imagine the zany hijinks if a recession hits next year or the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade.
 
DOGGONE -- If there can be five stages of grief for imaginary canines, the creative executives at TBWA/Chiat/ Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of Omnicom, would be the Elisabeth Kubler-Rosses of advertising. The lives of two dog characters they produced as centerpieces for big campaigns were abruptly cut short.
One was the sock puppet representing Pets.com, developed by the agency's San Francisco office, which disappeared when the e-commerce company shut down operations. The other was the "talking" Chihuahua featured in a campaign for the Taco Bell fast-food chain owned by Tricon, which vanished when the agency's Playa del Rey, Calif., office lost the account.
Fear not, Chihuahua fans, the character is featured on the agency's holiday card, which includes a prank hot line for a make-believe talent agent who is trying to find the dog work. And the sock puppet might resurface, because Pets.com is trying to raise money by selling licensing rights to the mascot.
 
HAIL TO NO CHIEF -- A television commercial for the Snickers candy bar sold by the M&M division of Mars Inc. showed a young man inside a voting booth, bedeviled by a donkey and an elephant acting out the most annoying personality traits of the presidential standard-bearers represented by each character.
The subversive subtext of the spot, created by BBDO New York: Both candidates are idiots, so why vote? This commercial might have done more to suppress turnout than the butterfly ballot.
 
O, CANADA, POUR IT ON -- Not every nation could find validation in a beer commercial, but then not every nation is Canada, eh?
Anyone doubtful that beer is an intrinsic part of the Canadian self-image -- or that Canadian brewers have skillfully cultivated that belief -- need only consider the response to a spot called The Rant for the Molson Canadian brand sold by Molson.
Its patriotic themes resonated so loudly and profoundly that consumers began memorizing the script. And the actor who recited the lines was rushed out on a tour of -- what else? -- hockey rinks. The commercial was created by Bensimon Byrne D'Arcy in Toronto, part of the D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles unit of the Bcom3 Group.
 
OLDS HAT -- To be sure, Oldsmobile wasn't the newest kid on the block. In fact, at 103, it was the most venerable American car brand. Yet while age is not necessarily a handicap in moving the iron -- as Mercedes-Benz, for one, could attest -- a series of product and marketing miscues doomed the Olds nameplate.
It's sad that a year that began with Oldsmobile proclaiming "Start something" is ending with a decision to finish off the brand, despite efforts by many well-meaning executives at the parent, General Motors, and the longtime Oldsmobile agency, Leo Burnett, part of Bcom3.
 
THAT WAS LAURA . . . -- Gay activists who were angry at Dr. Laura Schlessinger for negative comments about homosexuality she made on her popular syndicated radio show vowed to derail efforts by the Paramount Domestic Television unit of Viacom to transfer her success into the realm of syndicated TV. And they did, surprisingly effectively, by aiming a succinct message at major marketers: discrimination, against anyone, is bad business. Even traditional advertisers like Procter & Gamble agreed to avoid her TV series, making it one of the biggest failures of the 2000-2001 season.
 
WHASSUP WITH THAT? -- It is not enough to take the risks of approving an unconventional idea and then spending enough money to garner sufficient attention. A marketer must be prepared to manage success as well as to cope with failure.
Anheuser-Busch again demonstrated its ability to perform that most difficult of marketing tasks, in this instance with a series of commercials for Budweiser beer centered on a group of friends who greet each other by proclaiming "Whassup?" The company fed the overwhelming public demand for the characters without overexposing them, and even sustained that interest during an actors' strike that limited production of new commercials. The spots were created by the DDB Chicago office and the filmmaker Charles Stone III.
 
WHAT A CARD -- One of the few respites from the relentlessly unpleasant peddling that constantly interrupted the tape-delayed presentation of the Summer Olympics on NBC was a clever commercial for Charles Schwab & Company. The spot, promoting a Web site for novice investors, featured a boy actor portraying Charles Schwab, circa 1951, who already knew his way around Wall Street.
But the best investment advice the boy gives in the commercial is about neither stocks nor bonds nor mutual funds: he tells his pal to hang on to a Mickey Mantle baseball card. BBDO New York was the agency.

HEADLINE: Microsoft Waits for Bush's Position on Its Antitrust Case

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 25

 BODY:
Microsoft executives may have cheered as loudly as anyone this month when it became clear that George W. Bush would be the next president.
If statements by Mr. Bush and his advisers in recent months are any indication, the Bush administration seems willing to walk away from the resounding court victory the Justice Department won in the antitrust case against Microsoft this year. 
 Bush aides emphasize that no decisions have been made, adding that the Bush administration will fully enforce the antitrust laws. And the attorney general-designate, Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri, has not taken a sharply delineated stand on the Microsoft case.
But during the campaign, Mr. Bush made several statements indicating that he did not fully agree with the government's case and the court-ordered remedy -- breaking the company in two and enforcing a number of restrictions on its conduct.
"I stand on the side of innovation, not litigation," Mr. Bush said during a news conference in the state of Washington, Microsoft's home, last spring. "What I am worried about is if this company were to be broken up, this engine of change and this engine of growth."
His aides have been even more direct: some said they believed a Bush administration would never have filed the suit to begin with and will drop it under certain circumstances -- or settle under terms far more generous than the present administration would have offered. A civil suit can be settled at any time, with the court's approval.
Mr. Ashcroft has a mixed public record on the issues surrounding the case.
On the one hand, when William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, appeared before a Senate committee in March 1998, Mr. Ashcroft was among the senators who asked him skeptical questions, principally about Microsoft's practice of placing links to the company's own Web sites on the main page of the Windows operating system. Senator Ashcroft called this the "screen prejudice issue" and said it was "a real question, and a serious one."
On the other hand, some public statements have suggested that he holds an unenthusiastic view of antitrust in general, which is not surprising for a conservative Republican. At the Senate hearing in 1998, he spoke at length about his view that the government ought not to meddle in the technology industry.
"Frankly, the best thing that the politicians in Congress could do for the nation and this vital industry is to keep their hands off a part of the economy they do not understand," he said.
But Mr. Ashcroft is not known to have made any important public statements about the Microsoft case itself, and the company is not known to have made significant efforts to court him. Microsoft's political action committee made $9,000 in contributions to Mr. Ashcroft's Senate re-election campaign.
A senior Clinton administration official said of Mr. Ashcroft: "I don't think you can automatically say he is going to back away from the case; it would look bad to drop a case that has already been won. But the signs are that this isn't the kind of thing he would be enthusiastic about."
Mr. Ashcroft's appointees, of course, will hold the major leadership positions in the Justice Department's antitrust division. While several career Justice Department officials were important players in the case, most of the major decisions on courtroom strategy and trial briefs were made by political appointees in the antitrust division.
Joel I. Klein, head of the division, left office in September. And the division's other senior officers are expected to leave by Jan. 20, though it remains theoretically possible that the Bush administration could ask one or more of them to stay on.
What is more, the government case will almost certainly lose its courtroom star. David Boies argued the case in court for the Justice Department, and his performance in Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's courtroom has won a large measure of credit for the government's lopsided victory. But Mr. Boies's very public performance defending the Gore campaign during the Florida recount battle makes it highly unlikely that the Bush administration would retain him on the Microsoft case -- or any other.
Still, if the Bush administration backed off of the case, Microsoft would not walk away free and clear. Nineteen state attorneys general are partners in the litigation, and they say they will pursue their case -- including the breakup order -- no matter what the federal government may do.
"If they were to settle the case on terms that were weaker than we believe should be accepted, we would not agree to that settlement," said Tom Miller, the attorney general of Iowa and the leader of the 19 state attorneys general pursuing the case. He added that he and the other attorneys general believe the judge's breakup order is "the right remedy."
Even if the Bush administration keeps its distance from Mr. Boies, Mr. Miller added, "we will figure out a way to have strong oral arguments -- and there are plenty of lawyers who can do that."
Judge Jackson's ruling against Microsoft is under appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Microsoft filed its appeal brief late last month. The federal and state governments are to file their reply by Jan. 12. Oral arguments are scheduled for Feb. 26 and 27, and a ruling is expected in the spring.
Bush transition officials would not comment on the case. A well-informed Bush adviser said the Bush Justice Department was likely to carry the suit forward through the present Court of Appeals case. But if the Court of Appeals rules in Microsoft's favor, as this adviser and many Microsoft supporters expect, then the Justice Department would not be likely to appeal that loss to the Supreme Court, the adviser added.
"This is not a case George W. Bush would have brought in the first place," he said.
When asked about the Microsoft case in that news conference last spring, Mr. Bush said: "I am not sympathetic to lawsuits. Write that down. I worry about lawsuits on job creation. If you are looking for the kind of president I will be, I will be slow to litigate."
Nonetheless, the problem for Microsoft is that two suits were filed against the company in May 1998. One was filed by the Justice Department, the other by the states. Since they are quite similar, the two suits were consolidated for trial, and the Court of Appeals is hearing them together -- though all appellate court communications list them separately.
If the Justice Department dropped its case, the states' case would still be alive with full legal standing. Mr. Miller said he had sensed no equivocation or back-pedaling in his 19-state coalition. If the federal government settles the case but the states do not, he added, "then they are no longer in the case but we are." The states would probably appeal a loss in the appellate court, he added.
Even before those decisions must be made, the Bush administration, whatever its enthusiasm for the case, will have to argue it before the Court of Appeals.

HEADLINE: For Lawyers, Is Boom Near In Insolvency?

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
For the last several years, lawyers have overseen an incredible spate of public offerings, mergers and acquisitions. Now that the economy is slowing, they are quietly preparing to play another role for their clients -- by building up their bankruptcy departments.
Both partners at law firms and legal recruiters say that demand for lawyers with experience in bankruptcy is soaring. And while firms indicate that they are already busy, many foresee a sharp increase in bankruptcy filings in the near future, because companies that are not yet in critical financial trouble -- but expect to be soon -- have begun to reserve lawyers in advance. 
 "A huge wave is coming, and we want to make sure that we catch the wave," said Luc A. Despins, who joined the New York office of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy in 1998 to build up its bankruptcy practice.
Legal recruiters say that although statistics are hard to come by, the demand for bankruptcy lawyers at all levels, including partners, has been rising for several months now, and has increased sharply since mid-October. Because experienced lawyers invariably have jobs already, that means that law firms have been poaching experienced bankruptcy lawyers from rivals, executive placement specialists say.
"In the last two months, I have definitely noticed much greater interest in immediate hiring in bankruptcy groups and an interest in staffing up even if the departments aren't exceedingly busy yet," said Jeff Schneider, president of Schneider Legal Search in New York.
Mr. Schneider said that his company was looking to fill more than 50 positions at firms for bankruptcy lawyers and recently helped several bankruptcy lawyers switch law firms.
"Nobody wants to be caught short-staffed," he said.
Firms also want to recession-proof themselves by building up a practice that can pay the bills when the pace of merger-and-acquisition activity slows, said Renee Berliner Rush, a partner at Corrao, Miller, Rush & Wiesenthal, another legal placement company in New York. "They're really working at doing what they can to protect themselves from the inevitable downturn," she said.
Part of the reason for the scramble for lawyers with bankruptcy experience is scarcity: not that many lawyers have honed bankruptcy skills in recent years. "There are not a lot of strong midlevel associates who have that training," said Peter J. Goldfeder, managing director at PeterSan Group, a New York legal recruiter.
Mr. Despins agreed. "The competition for associates right now is ferocious," he said.
The total number of corporate bankruptcy filings has been falling, to 8,211 in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with 9,243 in the previous three months and 8,986 in the third quarter of 1999, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute. But lawyers say that the statistics hide the fact that more large companies are seeking protection from creditors.
Among the more prominent bankruptcy filings recently are those of Lernout & Hauspie, a maker of voice recognition software; TSR Wireless, which bills itself as the nation's sixth-largest wireless carrier; and ICG Communications, which sells telephone and Internet services to businesses.
"There has been a real shift in what is going on in the world," said Harvey R. Miller, a partner who heads the business financing and restructuring group at Weil, Gotshal & Manges. Mr. Miller should be an expert at recognizing the symptoms of an incipient bankruptcy boom: he has represented such well-known filers as Continental Airlines, Texaco and Eastern Air Lines.
Since midsummer, he said, the pace of restructuring work has picked up notably.
"It's just a reflection of the softening economy," Mr. Miller explained. "Financing alternatives are narrowing." His firm, already widely recognized as a leader in the field, has hired more than a dozen bankruptcy specialists this year.
The pickup in the pace of business does not mean simply that more companies will be filing and will need legal help to do it. Bankruptcy lawyers are also retained to represent creditors, investors, employees -- anyone who stands to be affected by a company's filing.
Frequently, lawyers are brought in before a company files for bankruptcy protection, to advise on ways either to restructure the business to prevent a filing or to make the proceedings themselves as smooth as possible.
The upstart technology companies that have been crashing this year are not necessarily a gold mine for bankruptcy lawyers. Often, they lack hard assets of substantial value in bankruptcy proceedings, said Larry G. Engel, a partner at Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison in San Francisco.
But the companies that did business with failed dot-coms, he said, typically need help from bankruptcy lawyers to try to recover anything that is owed to them.
"What we spend our time doing is the actual transaction, the purchase of the failing company's assets," he said.
In some industries, evidence is mounting that a variety of companies will be in need of restructuring soon, said Peter J. Antoszyk, a partner at Brown, Rudnick, Freed & Gesmer in Boston.
In retail trade, for example, the lenders that his firm typically represents were calling even before the weak holiday shopping season to express concerns about borrowers' financial performance, Mr. Antoszyk said.
Rising costs, particularly for energy, are exposing signs of weakness in the health care industry, he added.
Lawyers said that bankruptcy reform legislation like the measure vetoed last week by President Clinton would not have a significant impact on corporate filings.

HEADLINE: Europe Rethinks Its Pensions;
A Search for Ways to Reduce the Government's Role

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 25

 BODY:
Like most people in France, Jean-Pierre Thomas does not come from a long line of stock owners. "If my grandmother had owned stock," he said, "I'd be rich today."
Still, in 1996, as a member of parliament, Mr. Thomas, now a 43-year-old investment banker, pushed through legislation to establish tax-subsidized personal pension funds in hopes of turning France into a nation of shareholders. At the time, fewer than 2 in 10 French adults owned stock, less than half the level in the United States. While Mr. Thomas's bill was passed, however, labor unions and the Socialist Party resisted what they saw as a weakening of state pensions, and the private retirement funds were never introduced. 
 Such ambivalence toward private pensions is not unique to France. A similar reluctance to adopt private pensions has long been evident in much of Western Europe.
But shifting demographics -- chiefly falling birth rates and increased longevity -- are squeezing government-run pension systems that tax workers to pay their elders. As the number of workers shrinks and the pool of pensioners grows, such plans are coming under strain.
Acknowledging the quandary, several governments have begun experimenting with alternatives, though there is still no agreement within Western Europe on how or even whether to supplement state-run programs with tax-deductible private retirement plans. Sweden recently allowed its citizens to invest part of their government pension payments themselves, in mutual funds or other savings plans. Germany's Socialist government has recently proposed a similar idea.
Paradoxically, these innovations from Europe's most left-wing governments more closely resemble the Social Security campaign proposal of George W. Bush, the Republican candidate, than that of Vice President Al Gore.
In France, far tamer alternatives have been put forth, and in any event action has been postponed until after national elections next year.
A growing number of individuals are not waiting for government to make up its mind. Encouraged by bankers -- including Mr. Thomas, who now works at Lazard Freres -- they are investing on their own, pushing up the amount of mutual fund assets under management in Europe to the equivalent of $3.5 trillion this year. That was less than half the $7.2 trillion in the United States, but more than double the $1.7 trillion in Europe five years ago.
"People are reacting to shortfalls in the retirement system," said Michael Saunders, head of European economics at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney in London.
The effects are striking: increased equity investment, coinciding with the adoption of the euro as a single currency, has spawned a huge new capital market that has lowered financing costs and enabled governments gradually to lower taxes. At the same time, it has given private businesses a cheaper alternative to bank financing.
To take advantage, European corporations have had to sharpen their performance and introduce more responsive corporate governance, helping make Europe more competitive with the United States and Asia. "From the point of view of the economy, this is a very positive long-term development," Mr. Saunders said.
To accelerate change, the European Commission recently proposed guidelines for a single European market in pension funds, to make it easier for funds to invest beyond national borders and shift from government bonds and other fixed-income securities to stocks. Moreover, it aims to unify national tax laws and make it easier for retail investors to move their money across borders.
Ultimately, the question of whether to introduce private pension funds will depend on national governments. The commission forecasts that pension fund assets in Europe will grow in the next five years to about 3 trillion euros, or $2.5 trillion, from 2 trillion euros today. But over half of that is managed in just two countries, Britain and the Netherlands.
In recent months, the German government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder announced sweeping plans to reduce retirement benefits, while at the same time allowing Germans to channel a portion of their retirement tax payments into private pension plans. The changes, if they come, will be revolutionary for Germany, where comprehensive government pension programs were invented in the 19th century.
Still, obstacles remain. The government has not been able to agree on tax credits to sweeten investment in private pension plans, and a lobbying battle is raging among banks, brokerage firms and life insurance companies over the relative tax relief each hopes to achieve for its type of investment product.
Moreover, the government has made frequent changes to its proposals and recently announced that the changes, if approved, would not come until the start of 2002, one year later than anticipated. Thomas Weisgerber, a retirement expert at the Association of German Banks in Berlin, said frequent changes in the proposed bill made critical discussion of its proposals akin to "target shooting at a carnival."
In Sweden, long known for cradle-to-grave security, the change has been even more sweeping. Retirement benefits are no longer fixed, but vary according to average life expectancy. Under the most dramatic change, Swedes will begin in January to funnel part of their social security payments into mutual funds. Swedes will have roughly 500 funds to choose from, offered by domestic and international asset managers.
Hence, the trend toward stock investment is expected to continue. In Sweden, the changes could produce a gradual shift of up to $16 billion from bonds to stocks; in Germany, the banking association expects private pension funds to take in as much as $28 billion annually by 2008.
Italy scaled back pension benefits in the early 1990's and introduced private pension funds, and recently announced tax credits to make investment more palatable. But Tito Boeri, a pensions expert at the Bocconi University business school in Milan, said that, curiously, Italians, after paying high social security taxes to support the pensions of their parents' generation, have little set aside for their own retirements. Moreover, pension funds are often too restrictive in their asset management.
"Their portfolios are mainly bonds, and that's too conservative for young people," he said.
In contrast to the United States, where the Social Security system continues to record surpluses, the retirement funds in several European countries already operate with losses that have to be made up from the general government budget, putting upward pressure on taxes. Italy, for instance, has an unfunded old-age pension obligation amounting to an estimated 1.5 percent of gross domestic product, or about $18 billion annually, so that in recent years it had to devote some 3 percent of the general budget to cover the gap.
Complicating the debate is the way that retirement plans influence the competitiveness of individual European countries, because of the effect pensions have on raising or lowering the level of payroll taxes companies pay. Moreover, many European politicians and business leaders argue for the creation of private pension funds as a counterweight to American and British funds, which have poured billions of dollars into Europe, as European industry has reorganized to increase its competitiveness.
"At the moment, our companies are paying dividends to American funds," Mr. Thomas of Lazard said, "benefiting retirees in Texas."
Of course, as in the United States, the debate over retirement in Europe has spawned ideological sniping and nowhere is the clash more evident than in France.
On one side stands the Socialist-led government and the labor unions, who agree to the need for an overhaul of retirement savings but fear that introducing government support for private pensions will favor mainly the wealthy. Opposing them are French business leaders and a growing number of citizens who have been forged by the new culture of share ownership; they both believe that only by giving individuals greater responsibility for their retirement can pressure be taken off the foundering government pension system.
In recent months, the government has proposed changes, including the creation of a reserve fund, a plan to equalize benefits in government and private employment, and a proposal for 10-year saving plans with tax credits for small and midsize companies. (France does have private pension funds, but they are only accessible to government civil servants. There are also short-term tax-deferred savings funds, but experts do not consider them adequate for retirement savings.)
The Communist labor union C.G.T. called the saving plans "close to pension funds" and hence menacing a fair distribution of benefits. At the more moderate C.F.D.T. labor union, Jean-Marie Toulisse, the chief pensions negotiator, approved of the savings plans as long as they resulted from union-employer negotiations and all workers had equal access. But he criticized the government for postponing most pension decisions until after the coming general elections. "The longer we wait to make decisions," he said, "the more brutal the decisions will have to be."
French business pushes ahead, meanwhile, offering employees stakes in their future through share ownership.
Take Alcatel, the French global electrical manufacturing giant. This year the company introduced a stock-purchase plan for its employees, and 59,000, roughly half the total, signed up -- including 60 percent of Alcatel's French employees. Pierre Le Roux, the executive who created the plan, said it was "completely independent of the pensions issue" and intended to motivate workers.
Jean-Pascal Beaufret, the head of Alcatel's pension program, said many employees saw share ownership as a supplement to their government pension. "That's one of the reasons why employees are much more interested in stock holdings," he said.
The embrace of shareholder culture is one sign that French workers may be more accustomed to risk than the elite assumes. Another is the willingness of Alcatel engineers to work abroad. After a series of acquisitions in the United States, the company began a "Go U.S.A." program to recruit 250 French engineers willing to relocate. More than 1,000 French employees applied.
Mr. Beaufret, who left a job as a pensions expert at the Finance Ministry 11 months ago to join Alcatel, said that in the end France would be forced to enact "a mix of solutions" giving individuals more responsibility for their retirements.
By contrast, for Hans Eklund, responsible for pensions at Ericsson, the Swedish electrical giant, such debates seem remote. Like all Swedes, Ericsson employees pay 18.5 percent of their salaries in retirement taxes, but beginning Jan. 1, 2.5 percentage points of that amount will be funneled into personal investment accounts whose asset managers Swedes will be able to choose personally from a list of 500.
"Some would describe it as a giant step," Mr. Eklund said. "I would say a positive, good step."

HEADLINE: Mushrooming Costs of Japan's Aging Population

BYLINE: By MIKI TANIKAWA 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 25

 BODY:
When the Finance Ministry published the first detailed report of Japan's finances in October, it was part of an attempt to put a fresh face of honesty on government accounting. But the main theme that emerged from the data was how quickly Japan is growing old.
The balance sheet, as the Finance Ministry called it, portrayed a country burdened with heavy liabilities, most notably a sharp increase in pension payments as increased numbers of workers retire. 
 The total public assets of 659 trillion yen, or about $6 trillion, failed to meet the liabilities by a large margin under the realistic assessment of the Finance Ministry accountants. They calculated that the government faces total liabilities of 776 trillion yen, or about $7 trillion, assuming it pays all retirees what they are owed.
In many ways, the Japanese, despite their reputation as big savers, may be in even worse shape to face their nation's changing demographics than either Europeans or Americans.
It is not new, of course, that Japan's population is growing older -- it has the lowest birthrate of any developed nation, almost no immigration and one of the longest-living populations, a reflection of Japan's postwar affluence. But viewed in the uncompromising arithmetic of an accountant, the aging of Japan represents a severe drag on government finance.
Toshihiro Ihori, a professor of public finance at Tokyo University, said the Finance Ministry's balance sheet reinforced a prevailing view that the value of Japan's total pension liabilities comes close to the nation's annual economic output of 500 trillion yen, or about $4.4 trillion.
The public balance sheet also tries to account for a variety of other assets and liabilities. Experts remain concerned that it does not take into account a galaxy of government-financed corporations that do everything from building roads and bridges to extending housing loans to individuals.
Many of those activities are money-losing operations, which is no surprise considering that the projects were designed with a public intent and not with profits in mind.

Nikkei Index Soars on Optimism Over Exports

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 25

 BODY:
Led by Sony and other exporters, Japan's Nikkei 225 stock average posted its biggest gain in 21 months, surging on optimism that a cut in American interest rates as early as next month will spur demand for Japanese goods in the United States.
The Nikkei 225 rose 504.53, or 3.8 percent, to 13,931.61, its biggest gain since March 19, 1999. The Topix climbed 2.9 percent, to 1,297.81. Kyocera and other computer-related companies rose after the Nasdaq gained 7.6 percent on Friday, easing concern about earnings in the industry. Canon surged as Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Japan reiterated its "strong buy" on the stock. 
 "Expectations of the Fed cutting interest rates halted the decline in the valuations" of Japanese computer-related exporters, said Hideki Miho, who helps manage $7.7 billion in Japanese equities at Invesco Asset Management (Japan) Ltd. "There has been a tug of war between optimism of a rate cut and the warnings of slowing earnings growth. People are now focusing on a rate cut."
In other Asian markets, the SET Index in Thailand fell 0.2 percent, led down by Krung Thai Bank, which dropped on concern that bad loans would hurt its profit. In China, the Shanghai B-share index, which tracks shares that can be owned by overseas investors, rose 2.2 percent on expectations that China's expected entry into the World Trade Organization next year would be a boost to trade and earnings. Other Asian markets were closed today.
Money managers suggested that makers of information-technology products and banks in the region could rise when their markets reopen this week, with Friday's rally on Wall Street easing earnings concerns and optimism growing that the Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates.
"We are expecting U.S. rates to be cut by 1 percent in the first half of next year," said Steve Chou, who helps manage $27 million at Truswell Securities Investment Trust Ltd. in Taipei, Taiwan.
The Nasdaq composite index posted the fifth-largest rise in its 29-year history on Friday, with Qualcomm and Sun Microsystems pacing gains. The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 1.4 percent, led by the International Business Machines Corporation.

 BODY:
Daniel C. Dunham, an architect and an expert on city planning who specialized in designs for the tropics, died on Dec. 19 in New York, where he lived. He was 71.
The cause of death was heart failure, said his wife, Mary Frances. 
 Mr. Dunham was a professor of architecture and city planning at Columbia University from 1972 to 1985, and from 1985 until his death he was professor of architecture at the City University of New York and associate director of the City College Architectural Center.
Some of his best-known works were in Bangladesh, where he designed the railway station for Dhaka, completed in 1968 and believed to be the largest such structure in southern Asia. He also designed buildings for Rajshahi University, the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology and the Mymensingh University of Agriculture.
In India, he designed clinics and family planning complexes, as well as government housing for low- and middle-income residents.
Other commissions included the National Energy Center and an extension for the International School in Nouakchott, capital of Mauritania; the Renewable Energy Research Center in Djibouti; and the Qorioley Community Center Complex in Somalia.
Mr. Dunham was born on Feb. 1, 1929, in Omaha. He studied architecture at Harvard, city planning at Columbia and tropical architecture at the School of Tropical Architecture in London.
He worked frequently as a consultant on projects for the United Nations, the World Bank, the United States Agency for International Development and other aid agencies from the Caribbean to Sri Lanka to China, and wrote books and articles on building in developing countries.

HEADLINE: Edson Mitchell Dies at 47; Executive of Deutsche Bank

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
Edson Mitchell, an American who became one of the most powerful executives of Deutsche Bank of Germany, died Friday in a plane crash. Mr. Mitchell, 47, who lived most of the year in London, was the sole passenger in a Beech 200 aircraft flying from Portland, Me., to his vacation home in Rangeley, Me. The pilot, Stephen A. Bean, 58, also died.
Mr. Mitchell's death leaves a gaping hole in the bank's management ranks. Since joining the bank in 1995 as head of its global markets organization, he took it from an also-ran in trading bonds, securities and foreign currencies to a major and highly profitable player in those activities. 
 In June, he and a colleague, Michael Philipp, became the first two Americans ever appointed to the huge German bank's nine-member management board. Most Deutsche Bank insiders expected Mr. Mitchell to be named head of Deutsche Bank's entire investment banking operation -- a group that contributes nearly two-thirds of the bank's profits -- in 2002. That is when the current head, Josef Ackermann, is expected to become the bank's chief executive, upon the retirement of Rolf-Ernst Breuer, the current chief.
Mr. Mitchell's power would have expanded long before that. The bank is involved in a sweeping reorganization, combining five businesses into two huge departments -- investment banking and distribution channels like brokerage and retail banking. A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman said that Mr. Mitchell was a major force in designing that reorganization and putting it into effect, and would have been one of the leaders of the expanded investment banking arm.
As Mr. Breuer himself found out, though, Mr. Mitchell was as willing to fight his superiors as he was to fight for and along with his colleagues. In April, Mr. Mitchell helped to scuttle what would have been the biggest bank combination in Europe -- the $29 billion merger between Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank.
Dresdner had a highly profitable investment banking arm that Mr. Breuer had publicly called a "jewel." But Mr. Mitchell was widely said to fear that importing that jewel, with its up-and-coming executives, into the Deutsche Bank stable would dim some of his own group's shine. So he and Mr. Ackermann pressured Mr. Breuer to sell Dresdner's investment banking operations, instead. When Mr. Breuer finally relented, Dresdner's leadership, incensed, called off the merger just a month after it had been announced.
Mr. Mitchell spent much of his time in New York. Colleagues say his personality -- brash, sometimes loud, almost always competitive -- fit the New York stereotype.
But, in fact, he never lost touch with his New England roots. Born in Maine in 1953, he earned a degree in economics from Colby College in Maine in 1975 and a masters from Dartmouth in 1978. At his death, he was a trustee of Colby and an overseer of Dartmouth College. He co-founded the Rangeley Lakes Heritage Trust, an environmental organization in Maine.
But he was always willing to travel to further his banking career. He went to Chicago for Bank of America in 1978, then moved to New York to join Merrill Lynch in 1980. In 1995, Deutsche Bank recruited him from Merrill to invigorate its lackluster global markets operation in London.
Soon after arriving there, he persuaded Deutsche Bank to sink millions of dollars into a huge trading floor. His operation became the nucleus for the bank's now-thriving global trading activities.
At Merrill, Mr. Mitchell had developed a reputation as one of the firm's most hard-charging and successful executives. More than 50 of his Merrill colleagues immediately followed him to Deutsche Bank, and dozens more have joined since.
At Deutsche Bank, Mr. Mitchell rewarded loyalty well, coercing his own management into giving his people bonuses and raises even in years when performance was lackluster. But, those who know him say he had a quick temper, and little patience for mistakes or failures. He is described by colleagues as an intense man with a wiry athletic body and a New Yorker's impatience, and a competitive nature that was as apparent on a basketball court or golf course as in a boardroom.
Mr. Mitchell is survived by his wife, Suzan; two sons; three daughters; his parents, a brother and a sister.

HEADLINE: Grant Helps States Limit Under-Age Drinking

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 25

 BODY:
After two teenagers were killed at an unsupervised keg party in a suburb of Hartford in Connecticut, a state where police cannot arrest minors for consuming alcohol on private property, Geralyn Laut decided that was enough. So she started a campaign in that suburb, Glastonbury, that gave the police legal authority to enforce under-age drinking laws on private property.
"To me, that was obvious, let's change the law," Ms. Laut said of her decision in 1998 to challenge local drinking ordinances. "I'm a stay at home mom, and I got a law enacted." 
 Now, in an effort to spread that success in the fight against under-age drinking, a research arm of the Justice Department has joined with people like Ms. Laut to train others around the country to limit the access of minors to alcohol.
A $2 million grant from the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention will operate the Underage Drinking Education and Training Center in Rockville, Md., a suburb of Washington.
In turn, the center will provide training to states that are putting into place a federal initiative called Enforcing Under-Age Drinking Laws, which tries to find new methods to enforce laws.
Johnnetta Davis, director of enforcement training at the center, said the initiative would help local officials determine how under-age drinkers in their communities were getting alcohol and evaluate the example adults were setting for under-age drinkers. It will also create a network to share enforcement techniques.
Ms. Laut said, "If we change our environment at the same time we educate, that is when we will see large strides in the reduction of under-age drinking."
In Virginia, where nearly 4 percent of all alcohol-related automobile deaths in 1998 involved intoxicated teenagers, officials approached the center for assistance.
Maureen Early, education manager for the Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, began reviewing requests for federal training more than a year ago. Based on social and economic factors, four cities -- Blacksburg, Farmville, Richmond and Virginia Beach -- were identified as needing assistance with their enforcement programs.
In the weeks before this holiday season, the towns participated in conferences organized by the training center that examined how minors in each community got alcohol and explored methods of enforcing laws.
The center estimates that 68 percent of drinkers ages 18 to 20 obtain their alcohol from someone over 21 years old, while only 14 percent in this same age group manages to buy alcohol -- illegally, of course -- from commercial outlets.
The issue is of particular concern to Master Police Officer Scott Wichtendahl of the Virginia Beach Police Department. As one of eastern Virginia's busiest resort communities, Virginia Beach sees a large number of party-going youths consuming alcoholic beverages. Perhaps because of increased checks by the police to discourage distributors from selling to minors, many of those under-age are turning to of-age peers as their primary source for alcohol.
To combat the problem, Officer Wichtendahl and other law enforcement officials have put into place a program outlined during the Virginia conference that was organized by the training center.
"We sit on a parking lot and have an under-age child, always 18 or 19 years old, tap someone on the shoulder and ask them to buy alcohol," Officer Wichtendahl said.
Officer Wichtendahl explained that volunteers were trained to tell the adult that they were under-age and cannot legally buy alcohol, an effort to protect the police department from charges of entrapment. "If the adult agrees, it is a violation," he said.
But Officer Wichtendahl said this "shoulder tap" program was not intended to catch every offender.
"We would be fools to think we could arrest everyone that is breaking the law," Officer Wichtendahl said, adding that enforcement programs are most effective "as public deterrents to other would-be third party suppliers."

HEADLINE: Clinton's Comments on His Links to Minorities

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from an interview of President Clinton in the Oval Office by The New York Times:
 
Q. It can be said that the state of race relations has never been better. . . . I want you to try to explain an interesting dynamic, though. Some of your -- many of your policies, especially earlier in your presidency -- welfare reform, the abandonment of the fiscal stimulus package, support of the death penalty -- were opposed by these traditional civil rights leaders, these minority politicians. How do you reconcile this? What's going on here? 

A. Well, first of all, I had a record on civil rights matters and relations with blacks that went back through my whole public life, when I started. I also probably had more extensive personal contacts and friendships before I started -- not so much in the Black Caucus and the Congress, but I mean in the country -- than any white politician who had run for president in a long time, because it's been such a part of my life, it was so important to me -- and because of just fortuitous things -- the first A.M.E. church was in Little Rock. I hosted all the A.M.E. bishops when I was governor. We had black leaders from all over the country come back when we celebrated the 30th anniversary of Little Rock Central High School. Most of the black churches had their national conventions there at one time or another.
When I ran for president in '92, in Chicago, the county attorney, the man who is now president of the Cook County Board, Congressman Danny Davis, three aldermen, three Democratic ward chairs were all from Arkansas. We're all born there. Part of the history of the diaspora after the war, you know.
So a lot of this was just personal, and I think that even when some people disagreed with some of my policies, they knew where I was on the big issues of race and civil rights and equal opportunity. I think that's right. And I think that the fact that when we got into welfare reform, they saw that I was going to fight for what I wanted -- that I did think there should be mandatory work requirements, but I would not abandon the food stamps and Medicaid requirements for the kids.
 
Q. . . .What's your biggest worry about the future of the welfare bill? . . .
 
A. I think the biggest worry -- first of all, I think if there is a recession that makes it impossible for people to work, even though they're able-bodied, we have built in a big cushion of money in there. We gave the states the money in a block of money, based on the welfare rolls in February of '94 -- I believe that's right -- which was the highest welfare rolls we'd ever had. So even though the welfare rolls went down, as long as they were putting it back in. So I think there will be an appropriate response.
What I've always worried about is that some of the people who would be hardest to place might be caught up in time limits because they superficially looked like they could work, but that the states would not provide enough support to make sure they could get into and stay in the work force.
But the other major criticism of the welfare reform bill I just thought was wrong -- and I think a lot of people didn't even know this at the time, meaning a lot of people who were writing about it -- which is that, by agreeing to let the states set the benefit level by block-granting that money, I was somehow abandoning a federal commitment to poor people. But the truth is that since the early '70s, states had been able to set their monthly benefits, they just couldn't go below where they were back then.
So when we started working on welfare reform, the support levels for a family of three -- before welfare -- varied from a low of under $200 a month in Mississippi, Texas and one or two other places to $665 a month in Vermont. And everybody -- so, in other words, they had, in effect, been setting their own benefit levels all that time.
What I was really worried about was the desire of the Republicans in Congress to block-grant the money going -- to stop the food stamps and Medicaid for the kids. But I really felt that if we gave them enough money, and they had to put more money into child care and into job training, into transportation, and all that sort of stuff, this thing would work pretty well. And I think it plainly has.
But I am worried about the hardest-to-place, when you have a combination of tough times and people who may not care about them.

HEADLINE: Efforts to Restrict Sprawl Find New Resistance From Advocates for Affordable Housing

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Dec. 25

 BODY:
Until this year, Habitat for Humanity affiliates in Arizona and Colorado never felt a need to get involved in a political fight. But in the fall they jumped into a battle against a seemingly unlikely foe: the environmental movement.
In one of the most far-reaching efforts yet to curb suburban sprawl, ballot initiatives in both states proposed giving voters an unprecedented level of power to designate wide swaths of land off limits to new housing. 
 Officials with Habitat, which builds low-income housing for needy families, feared that the measures would drive up the cost of land and "basically shut down our ability to acquire land and lots for growth," said Chris Wolf, the organization's director in Phoenix. So the Habitat affiliates joined with developers to oppose the initiatives; in Colorado, opponents even made a television commercial highlighting Habitat's objections.
Nobody argues in favor of suburban congestion. But increasingly the debate over sprawl has turned to whether laws intended to fight it are playing a role in driving up housing prices, at a time when housing affordability in many parts of the country has dipped to its lowest level in almost a decade.
The success of anti-sprawl efforts is evident in the increasing number of communities that have adopted measures like low-density zoning, moratoriums on building permits or voter-approved growth boundaries. Although the Arizona and Colorado initiatives were defeated last month, many similar local proposals in California passed, and battles over anti-sprawl laws continue to rage in suburbs outside Washington, Atlanta, Dallas and other big cities.
Although the battles have been concentrated in the rapidly growing South and West, sprawl has been a concern in the densely populated Northeast as well. Only two years ago voters in New Jersey approved borrowing $1 billion to help preserve about a million acres of farmland and woodland.
As anti-sprawl measures proliferate, developers have enlisted affordable-housing advocates to promote the view that the restrictions make higher home prices inevitable, in effect amounting to a tax on prospective home buyers that hits the working and middle classes hardest.
"One of the unintentional byproducts of efforts to control sprawl is to restrict the amount of land available for housing," said Nicolas P. Retsinas, a former Clinton administration housing official who is director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies, at Harvard University. "When you restrict supply in the face of increased demand, what a surprise! Prices go up."
Efforts to limit construction, critics say, can affect all types of housing, from apartments to mansions. Builders and other opponents contend that even when the limits mainly affect more expensive homes, the trickle-down consequences include rising prices for more modest housing.
But environmentalists and other supporters of growth controls say there is little proof that such measures have any significant impact on housing prices. Susan LeFever, director of the Rocky Mountain chapter of the Sierra Club, notes that cities without strong growth-control laws have seen huge run-ups in home prices, a result of the nation's economic boom.
"It's certainly easy to pull out examples of places with growth restrictions where the cost of housing has gone up," she said. "But it's equally easy to pull out places that don't have growth restrictions where the cost of housing has gone up just as much."
Unless there is a recession severe enough to slow suburban development, experts expect anti-sprawl measures to remain popular with voters and local elected officials.
California saw more growth-related proposals on local ballots this year than at any other time since 1990, before the state plunged into recession, said Bill Fulton, president of the Solimar Research Group, public policy analysts in Ventura, Calif. During the last four years, he said, there have been 118 slow-growth initiatives in California, nearly twice as many as in the prior four-year period.
Most of the proposals in California this year were approved, although a few larger ones failed, notably in San Francisco and Sonoma County.
"In an economic boom is when you see growth restrictions come back," Mr. Fulton said, "but they tend to lag behind a few years."
In King County, Wash. -- Seattle and environs -- housing costs have soared so high that county officials recently ordered a study of whether the state's rules restricting development outside cities was helping drive up prices.
The "surprising conclusion" of the report, due out next month, is that there is no proof the rules have more than a negligible effect on home prices, said Ron Sims, the county executive. He attributes the jump in housing costs to the region's tremendous prosperity and rising incomes, noting that the housing market flattened out this year after the Nasdaq swooned.
In Cary, N.C., though, an affluent town of nearly 100,000 outside Raleigh, Mayor Glen Lang says home prices are already being affected by slow-growth measures approved in the last few years.
"When you have demand and decrease supply, prices rise dramatically," Mr. Lang said.
Both sides of the debate point to the same example: Portland, Ore.
Development is limited outside the growth boundary that has ringed Portland since the 1970's, and critics contend that this is why the city has seen home prices skyrocket. According to the government's Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, average home prices in the Portland-Vancouver, Wash., metropolitan area have risen 148 percent in the last dozen years.
"The development controls have acted as a long-run drag on housing supplies," said Gerard Mildner, an associate professor of urban studies and planning at Portland State University. "The desire to protect open space and farmland has trumped people's concerns about housing affordability."
Defenders of the Portland boundary, however, note that cities without similar growth controls have also seen steep price increases over the same period, including a 128 percent rise in Denver and a 116 percent rise in Salt Lake City-Ogden, Utah.
A study published this summer in the journal Contemporary Economic Policy concluded that while the Portland growth boundary "has likely imposed upward pressure on prices, the results indicate that the effect has been fairly modest," most likely less than $10,000 for a typical home. Higher land prices have been offset by a trend toward smaller lots and other elements of higher-density housing, said one of the study's authors, Eban Goodstein, an economics professor at Lewis and Clark College in Portland.
The debate over growth controls is made all the more intense because of the unequal way the nation's long economic boom has treated Americans. While the last decade has created tremendous wealth, many people -- teachers, police officers, nurses and many others in middle-class jobs -- have watched the cost of housing rise faster than their incomes.
The median price for a single-family home rose about 45 percent during the 1990's, according to the National Association of Realtors. For the wealthiest fifth of American families, that was no problem, as their mean incomes rose 57 percent during that time, according to the Census Bureau.
But the incomes of most other families failed to keep pace with housing prices. The least affluent two-fifths of American families, for example, saw their incomes grow just 35 percent.
While the hottest housing markets have cooled recently -- prices fell slightly in the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle and Portland during the third quarter, according to the National Association of Realtors -- there has been no letup in much of the rest of the country. Prices rose 5 percent in the Midwest and 4 percent in the South during the quarter.
In the last decade, the rise in home prices has been offset somewhat by lower mortgage rates. But during the third quarter, housing affordability reached its worst level since 1992. (Affordability should improve in the fourth quarter, as rates have dropped a good bit since the summer.) Some experts are concerned that the drop in affordability will slow recent gains in the percentage of American families who own their own homes -- advances that have resulted partly from loans made on such less-restrictive terms as smaller down payments.
And concerns about affordability extend to renters: a study issued this year by the Department of Housing and Urban Development found that 5.4 million renter families either spent more than half their income on rent or lived in "severely inadequate" housing in 1997.
In Congress, developers have used the affordability issue to seek relief from restrictions on construction. But while builders argue that excessive growth controls can hurt the local economy, some local elected officials say there is also an economic danger in not doing enough to preserve natural amenities.
"If you're going to manage growth, you can't kill the goose that laid the golden egg," said Kirk Watson, the mayor here in Austin, where home prices have soared during the technology boom. Much of the credit for Austin's boom belongs to the city's beautiful rolling hills and other natural features, which have helped attract a talented labor force, the mayor said.
"The new economic paradigm is about the knowledge economy, and that is always going to follow the quality of life," Mr. Watson said. "Part of managing this boom and growth is preserving what the knowledge economy was looking for in the first place."

Decorations Find a New Market
Sales of Christmas kitsch are growing in China, where hotels, restaurants and shops bought nearly $50 million worth of holiday decorations this year. Christmas has been co-opted by the Communists as good for stimulating business, and it is already a bigger deal than New Year's Eve in China's cities. C3. 

China Adopts Phone Rate Changes
In the phone industry's biggest overhaul, China cut telephone charges as much as 60 percent, simplifying a complicated rate structure to help companies in Asia's largest phone market prepare for greater competition when the nation joins the World Trade Organization. International calls will carry a flat rate of 0.80 yuan, or 10 cents, per six seconds -- a 47 percent reduction -- while domestic calls made from fixed-line phones will be charged a flat rate of 0.07 yuan for every six seconds.

HEADLINE: A War on Poverty Subtly Linked to Race

SERIES: THE CLINTON LEGACY -- Third of five articles: Redefining Welfare

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE and STEVEN A. HOLMES 

 BODY:
As his turbulent first term approached its close in 1996, Bill Clinton faced one of the most consequential decisions of his presidency: whether to sign a popular welfare bill largely shaped by his Republican enemies.
Many of his allies saw the bill's get-tough features as an unthinkable surrender of victories won in the New Deal and the Great Society. In signing the measure, they said, Mr. Clinton would push millions of poor people and minorities deeper into poverty. Worse, many suspected he would be doing so for his own short-term political gain. 
 But others turned the accusation of expedience on its head. They told Mr. Clinton that the welfare restrictions -- time limits and work requirements -- would do more than revamp one discredited program. The restrictions would help create a political climate more favorable to the needy. Once taxpayers started viewing the poor as workers, not welfare cheats, a more generous era would ensue. Harmful stereotypes would fade. New benefits would flow. Members of minorities, being disproportionately poor, would disproportionately benefit.
Whether driven by a vision of social renewal or a clear-eyed look at the polls, Mr. Clinton not only signed the bill but also went on to embrace it as a centerpiece of his domestic legacy, calling it a new "social bargain with the poor."
Now as his presidency comes to a close, Mr. Clinton's contentious drive to "end welfare as we know it" stands as an embodiment of his broader approach to the problems of poverty and race. Blending the causes of the left and the right in ways that unsettled both, Mr. Clinton pursued a bold, some say risky, antipoverty strategy that he hoped would attract public support and avoid the racial backlash that had burdened previous programs for the poor.
At its heart was a demand that the poor go to work, even those with very young children, low skills and low wages. With strict time limits and vast local discretion to turn the needy away, Mr. Clinton carried his antiwelfare crusade much further than even he had once intended. As a result, he leaves far fewer protections for families who, for whatever reason, fail to hold jobs.
At the same time, Mr. Clinton has presided over an unprecedented expansion of aid for poor families who do work. He won billions of dollars in wage supplements and smaller subsidies for everything from child care to children's health insurance, all framed as a moral obligation to "make work pay."
The shift in antipoverty policy, though sold in race-neutral terms, is central to the racial legacy Mr. Clinton leaves. At times he spoke explicitly, even eloquently, about racial justice; he defended affirmative action; and he appointed record numbers of blacks and Latinos to positions of influence. Yet much of his work consisted of more subtle efforts to reshape racial perceptions.
In taking tough stands on issues like welfare and crime, Mr. Clinton sought to reduce stereotypes and resentments among some whites. In seeking new benefits for the working poor, Mr. Clinton understood that an outsize share of the aid would flow to Hispanics and blacks. But neither those efforts, nor many others, were cast in racial terms.
"Clinton understood that welfare had become a racially stigmatized program," said Theda Skocpol, a political scientist at Harvard University who studies programs for the poor. "He ended the most controversial aspects of welfare, but at the same time, he built up supports for working families. And he certainly did see this as an effort to quiet racial disputes about social supports for the vulnerable."
Citing initiatives from urban tax breaks to college scholarships, Hugh B. Price, president of the National Urban League, put it this way: "He has attempted to do things that have been of enormous benefit to communities of color, without labeling them that way. The idea was that you could build a stronger consensus for public policies that were cast in race-neutral terms."
Has the strategy been good for the poor? And have race relations improved?
Any assessment must take into account the extraordinary economic growth that, depending on one's view, Mr. Clinton either inherited or helped create. He will leave office having helped more Americans escape poverty than any other president since Lyndon B. Johnson. The last president to enjoy an extended economic expansion, Ronald Reagan, lifted 290,000 Americans out of poverty. So far, Mr. Clinton has multiplied that record 24 times, reducing the number of poor Americans by seven million.
"This is the first recovery in three decades where everybody got better at the same time," Mr. Clinton said in an interview with The New York Times before leaving office. "I just think that's so important."
And other repositories of social statistics have overflowed with good news. Crime is at a three-decade low. Wages for unskilled workers have reversed a 15-year decline. From Oakland to Newark, urban cores once abandoned as hopeless are sporting restaurants and shops.
The change is evident in politics as well. Twelve years ago, President George Bush came to power after a racially divisive campaign in which his supporters broadcast pictures of a furloughed black rapist, Willie Horton, to paint the Democrats as soft on crime. By contrast, Mr. Bush's son George W., ran this year by labeling himself a "compassionate conservative." He sought to be photographed with minority children and borrowed the slogan of the Children's Defense Fund, a liberal advocacy group: "Leave No Child Behind."
"Who's running against welfare now?" asked Al From, president of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, a political group Mr. Clinton helped start. "Who's running against poor people? Crime and welfare were surrogates for race. By taking both of them away as political issues, we did a lot of good for minorities and low-income communities. We also changed the tone of the political debate to where it is more tolerant and inclusive."
What remains to be seen is how well the welfare cuts, and other policies, perform when tough times arrive. While they welcome the falling poverty rates, some of Mr. Clinton's critics see the past eight years as a landscape of missed opportunities. Even with prosperity and budget surpluses, Mr. Clinton made virtually no progress on one of his central promises, the pledge to provide all Americans with health insurance. If anything, the new welfare laws may have made matters worse, by inadvertently driving some eligible families off Medicaid rolls.
"We should be ashamed we haven't made more progress in this economy," said Marian Wright Edelman, the president of the Children's Defense Fund. "It is totally unacceptable that with this much prosperity we have millions of uninsured children. What's going to happen when a recession comes?"
And while Mr. Clinton has celebrated the welfare law as a success, he signed it over the objection of advisers who believe it will still prove harmful to the poor.
"When unemployment starts creeping up again, a long line of people are going to be in trouble because we've taken away a safety net," said Robert B. Reich, who had been Mr. Clinton's friend for more than two decades before becoming his first secretary of labor.
Even now, many problems persist. The brutal dragging death of James Byrd Jr. in Texas in 1998 and the complaints about racial profiling have marred the racial peace. While poverty is down, the percentage of children born to single mothers remains at an all-time high. As Mr. Clinton himself has argued, even the best government programs cannot take the place of missing fathers.
Still, whatever reversals may lie ahead, there is one achievement that should not be ignored. That is the rediscovered sense that progress is possible on problems once thought impervious to change. Some people say progress is the president's doing, and some say it happened despite him. But few people now share the sense, prevalent just a decade ago, that every war on poverty is destined for defeat.
"The legacy of the 1990's, of which Clinton is a part, is a healthy reinvigoration of our sense that government policies matter," said William Kristol, the editor and publisher of The Weekly Standard, a conservative political magazine that has been critical of Mr. Clinton. "It's been very important to show that these trends don't inevitably continue downward. It's a different world after the 90's."
In a sense it is odd that Mr. Clinton now takes such pride in the welfare law. While it is one of his most popular achievements, it is also an area where his attention flagged, his own plan failed, and his enemies seized control. Mr. Clinton supplied the volatile words that set events in motion, the famous 1992 campaign pledge to "end welfare as we know it." But his antagonist, Newt Gingrich, the Republican speaker of the House, supplied much of the law's content.
From the start, Mr. Clinton was trying a high-stakes linguistic maneuver. "End welfare" sounded bold. "As we know it" offered a hedge. Mr. Clinton's original plan balanced new obligations, like work requirements, with protections for those willing to work. But the president waited 17 months to introduce his plan, did little to promote it, and renounced it a year later, telling a Washington columnist, "I wasn't pleased with it, either."
By then, the Republicans controlled Congress, and "end welfare" gained a more literal meaning. Under Mr. Clinton's plan, mothers could remain eligible as long as they joined a work program. But under the measure he signed, most mothers can get no more than five years' help in a lifetime. The law also made deep cuts in unrelated programs like food stamps, capped federal spending and gave states virtually a free hand in shaping their programs.
"He agreed to 'end welfare as we know it' on Republican terms that were very different from his original terms," said Kent Weaver, a political scientist at the Brookings Institution who has written a legislative history of the law. "It's a bill with fewer protections that has as its primary emphasis getting people off of welfare rather than getting people to work."
In truth, the law created 50 very different programs. Here and there, some combine work requirements with the mix of services Mr. Clinton originally envisioned: counseling, training, placement in jobs. But most have placed a greater emphasis on reducing the rolls. The law's fine print is telling: the "caseload reduction credit" allows states to meet federal work requirements simply by cutting the rolls, whether or not those who leave find jobs.
The welfare rolls, in turn, have plummeted. Nationwide, they have fallen by more than 50 percent since their 1994 peak. Within a year of signing the bill, Mr. Clinton had proclaimed victory. "We know now that welfare reform works," he said.
In part the good news is the shortage of bad news. There are few signs of the widespread deprivation that opponents of the law predicted -- no "children sleeping on grates," as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, warned. On the contrary, women once on welfare are working more, and earning more than ever before. The flood of single mothers into the robust labor market is the law's signal achievement.
The question is how much unskilled single mothers can achieve once they enter the job market. Few manage to keep full-time jobs all year. While their earnings are up, the growth of their paychecks has been largely offset by reductions in welfare and food stamps. Indeed, in purely economic terms, it is not clear whether the average woman leaving welfare is gaining ground.
In a confidential memorandum to President Clinton last year, Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, offered a reading of the evidence more cautious than his.
"Many parents leave welfare for work yet still do not earn enough to raise their families out of poverty," Dr. Shalala wrote, adding that ost studies "indicate that average family income has been unchanged."
Some analysts see those studies as great encouragement. Despite dire predictions, they say, most families are beginning the transition to post-welfare lives -- a point Dr. Shalala herself echoed in a recent interview. With more experience, their earnings will rise. Meanwhile, the bill's supporters say, work gives children new role models and adults new pride.
"Work helps give structure and meaning to people's lives," said Bruce Reed, Mr. Clinton's domestic policy adviser.
But others read the same evidence as a source of worry. If the incomes are not rising now, they say, what happens when the economy slows? Even now, there is some evidence that incomes have fallen, in some cases precipitously, for the most troubled people leaving welfare. Though some have coped temporarily, by living with friends or relatives, it is unclear how long such arrangements can last.
And the effect of one of the law's toughest features -- time limits -- will not be known for another few years. "At that point, we will know if we took too great a risk," Mr. Moynihan said. "I think we did. I hope we did not."
In a recent interview, Mr. Clinton said he shared the concern about the most troubled families, especially when the time limits take full effect. "I am worried about the hardest to place," he said, "when you have a combination of tough times and people who may not care about them."
But for most families, he thought "this thing would work pretty well," he said. "And I think it plainly has."
"Ending welfare" was Mr. Clinton's most famous poverty pledge, but not his only one. He coupled it with a parallel promise to "make work pay" through aid to the working poor. Even while dismantling one safety net, Mr. Clinton has tried to build another with programs for struggling workers: wage supplements, child care and subsidies for children's health insurance.
"We're spending more on social policy, not less," said David Ellwood, a Harvard economist and former administration official. "But we're spending it in a completely different way. We've radically expanded help to working folks."
By far, Mr. Clinton's most significant legacy to the working poor is in a large program of wage subsidies with an opaque name, the earned-income tax credit. The details are complicated, but the bottom line is not: the program provides low-wage workers with annual cash bonuses of up to nearly $3,900. Workers must have children to qualify fully.
With little public fanfare, Mr. Clinton pushed through a vast expansion of the program in 1993, as part of his first budget. Since then, spending on the wage supplements has almost doubled to $30 billion a year. That is nearly twice what the federal government spent on the old welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, even at the its peak.
For an average woman leaving welfare, the annual payments now "make work pay" by turning a job that pays $6.50 an hour into one worth about $8.35 an hour.
"It's the largest antipoverty program since the Great Society," said Mr. From of the Democratic Leadership Council. "People don't give Clinton credit for that, but that's what it is."
While the general public is only dimly aware of the program, in many poor neighborhoods it turns tax season into an annual fiesta. Furniture stores run blowout specials, and used-car sales surge. As with welfare, the benefits disproportionately flow to racial minorities: 23 percent of the wage supplements go to black families and 25 percent to Hispanics.
But the program has proved more popular than most antipoverty initiatives, since its benefits are reserved for workers. Last year, Congressional Republicans sought to reduce the program, citing concerns about fraud. Then Mr. Bush criticized them for balancing the budget "on the backs of the poor," and his poll ratings rose.
Mr. Clinton's other efforts to build a work-based safety net have met with mixed results. He won support for child care subsidies by arguing that they help people work. But despite a doubling of the budget, child care programs still reach only about 10 percent of the eligible families, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Even with subsidies, many parents have a hard time finding good care, especially if they work odd hours.
"We've established the principle that child care is a serious work support," said Joan Lombardi, a former administration child care official. But, Ms. Lombardi added, in terms of financing and quality, "we've still got a long way to go."
If child care is a story of mixed progress, health insurance is a story with little progress at all. Mr. Clinton sought office with a promise to extend coverage to all Americans. But his plan for universal coverage met defeat in a Democratic Congress. And tougher welfare laws have driven some eligible families from the food stamp and Medicaid rolls, as critics feared.
Mr. Clinton did win a program to help insure about 2.5 million children of low-wage workers. But despite eight years of economic growth, there are now more Americans without health insurance -- about 43 million -- than when the Clinton presidency began.
"We've learned that prosperity is never going to guarantee coverage for all workers," said Dr. Judith Feder, a dean at Georgetown University and a former Clinton administration health official. "While we're making some progress for children, we still lack a safety net for adults."
Virtually no one sees a finished product in this work-based safety net. While acknowledging that many holes remain, Mr. Clinton's supporters contend that he has changed the underlying politics in a way that promises future gains.
"The resentments that stood in the way of helping poor people have diminished considerably because we're no longer fighting about whether they deserve help or not," said Mr. Reed, the domestic policy adviser. "Everybody's expected to work, and as a result, society's willing to help."
Though critical of some aspects of the welfare law, Dr. Shalala agrees it has improved the political standing of the poor.
"I think there's a lot more respect on the part of the business community" for low-wage workers, she said. "There has been an education for all those people who used to sit around and say 'if only those people would get a job.' "
Others take a less sanguine view, fearing that the politics will turn when the economy falters.
"I wouldn't give Clinton failing marks by any means," said Wendell E. Primus, a former federal human services official who resigned to protest the welfare bill. "We've clearly made gains in this administration. But I think we missed an opportunity to do even better."
That racial themes would be woven through the domestic policies of Bill Clinton is unsurprising in a way, given his experiences with black Americans during his formative years in Hope, Ark.
As a child in Hope, he had grown to know many black people who frequented his grandfather's store. Throughout his life he was extraordinarily comfortable around black people -- so much so that some leading black commentators, like the writer Toni Morrison, wryly noted that Mr. Clinton was the country's first black president.
But as a Southern Democrat, Mr. Clinton also witnessed how conservatives had lured white voters by tarring Democrats as too willing to coddle black criminals and too supportive of expensive social programs intended for minorities.
Balancing these twin experiences, President Clinton embraced a series of unpredictable positions that in turn angered both conservatives and the leaders of traditionally liberal civil rights groups. Yet both expressed their awe at his ability to maintain his popularity among minority voters.
That popularity had roots both in substance and symbolism. Unlike some past economic booms, this one has been especially good to minorities: the poverty rate among African-Americans has fallen to an all-time low.
As president, he appointed a far greater percentage of minorities to cabinet and subcabinet posts than did Jimmy Carter, who had the second-highest percentage. One of Mr. Clinton's best friends, Vernon E. Jordan, is black and the two are frequently photographed together playing golf and taking vacations.
And in 1995, fearing that the Republicans in Congress might scuttle any federal programs that grant any types of preferences for minorities or women, Mr. Clinton stoutly defended affirmative action, saying the nation should "mend it, don't end it."
At the same time, Mr. Clinton was able to say or do things that rankled leaders of traditional civil rights organizations. As a candidate in 1992, he used a speech at Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition to rebuke the rapper Sister Souljah for suggesting that blacks "have a week and kill white people."
Mr. Clinton said such comments were divisive.
In a 1993 speech at a Memphis church, Mr. Clinton chided blacks for having too high a homicide rate, declaring that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. "did not fight for the right of black people to murder other black people with reckless abandon."
The president also angered many civil rights advocates early in his term when he yanked the nomination of Lani Guinier to head the Justice Department's civil rights division without giving her the chance to defend her unorthodox writings on race and the electoral system before a Senate panel.
Yet despite these actions, Mr. Clinton was able to maintain an extraordinary amount of support from minorities.
"When you think about the record, he did a lot of things like welfare reform that no white politician affiliated with the Republican Party would ever get away with," said Michael D. McCurry, the former White House press secretary.
John Hope Franklin, a historian whom President Clinton eventually appointed to head a commission on race relations, said Mr. Clinton's popularity stemmed in part from his deep, various and long-term friendships with black Americans.
"People admired that Vernon Jordan was his best friend," Mr. Franklin said. "This becomes a part of the lore that African-Americans admire, pass on informally."
Given his ability to bridge the racial fault lines in the Democratic Party, perhaps Mr. Clinton's most important legacy in the area of race and politics has been to bequeath the party the recipe for recreating Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 coalition of working class whites, high-end liberals and minorities. In Mr. Clinton's case, this was accomplished by pushing for conservative to centrist policies that many white working-class voters favored and many civil rights leaders opposed, while using the sheer force of his personality and the projection of good will to maintain support among minorities.
And while some liberal civil rights advocates fumed that Mr. Clinton was pulling the wool over the eyes of minorities, he himself acknowledged that it was his personal rapport with minorities, especially black people, that allowed him room to maneuver.
"A lot of this was just personal, and I think that even when some people disagreed with some of my policies, they knew where I was on the big issues of race and civil rights and equal opportunity," Mr. Clinton said.
Yet, when Mr. Clinton undertook his only large-scale effort in the area of race, his initiative on race in 1997, the results were, at best, disappointing.
The president had given hints of his desire to enter into the tricky world of race relations in his second inauguration address just a few months earlier when he called on the nation to put aside differences and work toward creating "one America." In the succeeding months he had explored the idea of trying to bridge the country's racial divide in conversations with scholars like Taylor Branch and Henry Louis Gates Jr.
Aides said Mr. Clinton was concerned about isolated incidents of hate crimes, segregation on college campuses, a lack of dialogue on race in the country.
But the board, headed by Mr. Franklin, ran into trouble from the start. Its seven members were not well versed in the ways of Washington. Mr. Franklin drew sharp criticism when he said he had not invited critics of affirmative action to a session on how to increase racial and ethnic diversity on college campuses because he did not think they had anything to contribute.
The panel did have some limited effect. It recommended that a special assistant to the president of race and ethnic matters be appointed, which was done. It urged an increase in the budgets for agencies like the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that enforce antidiscrimination laws. That too was accomplished. And it spurred some agencies like the Departent of Health and Human Services to start programs to reduce disparities in health care.
But even the early supporters felt the initiative failed to generate a new national consciousness on race. "The president's initiative on race was basically stillborn," said Mr. Price, the president of the National Urban League. "It was too soft in its focus. Basically the president invited the country to come to the table for a discussion on race, and the country said, We're too busy. I don't think anything was lost on that. But it's hard to tell because it was hazily framed."
Mr. Franklin defended the advisory board's record, saying that it was a victim of unrealistic expectations. "I think we did pretty well" in starting a national dialogue, he said. "The charge to the advisory board was a relatively modest one. We had no illusions about solving the race problem."
The effort might have had more of a force if Mr. Clinton was not enmeshed in the scandal stemming from his relationship with a White House intern that broke about six months into the work of the advisory board. Fighting for his political life, Mr. Clinton gave too little attention to the board's work, and he will leave office without having produced the report on racial reconciliation that he had promised.
"One of the things that to me is so depressing about the Monica Lewinsky affair is that it sucked all the energy out of the race initiative," Mr. McCurry said.

HEADLINE: Three Circuses, a Ring at a Time;
New Yorkers Flock to the Competing Little Big Tops

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
The primordial duel between Paris and New York for international pre-eminence has never been a battle of the circuses. That's because a dozen one-ring circuses have long been an ornament of the holiday season in Paris, while New York has had but one, the Big Apple Circus, for 23 years.
But suddenly New York has caught the fever. 
 Audiences are clamoring to see three major one-ring circuses in Manhattan that have won critical raves. Vying for attention are the home-grown Big Apple; a stately newcomer, Barnum's Kaleidoscape; and Circus Oz, a spiky vagabond from Australia.
So much for the dire predictions of entertainment executives that there might not be enough circus-loving, ticket-buying New Yorkers to support the year-end circus competition.
But "Clown Around Town," the new Big Apple show in its tent at Lincoln Center, is on track to exceed last year's ticket sales. Kaleidoscape has had to add three more shows to handle the crowds mobbing its tent in Bryant Park. And Circus Oz was running at 83 percent capacity last week in the New Victory Theater on West 42nd Street, and this week's performances are close to sold out.
Seen-it-all New Yorkers seem happy to be so well clowned. "This is a circus festival that no one planned," said Leonard Kamsler, a photographer and circus aficionado from Manhattan who was sitting in one of the red crushed-velvet Kaleidoscape seats at a recent performance. "It's the first time we've had so many high-quality circuses in town at the same time."
Raffaele De Ritis, the Italian director of Kaleidoscape, called the shows' collective popularity nothing less than "a celebration of the renaissance of the one-ring circus in America."
Because it's the new toy in town (Circus Oz has been in the city twice before, last in 1998) Kaleidoscape has played to column-fodder names like Tom Cruise, Richard Gere, Lee Iacocca, Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson.
"I think these three shows have different styles and attract different audiences," said Kenneth Feld, the producer and chief executive of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, which created Kaleidoscape 20 months ago and propelled it on a tour of 12 American cities before New York.
The impromptu circus festival is the culmination of years of effort spiced by some unusually sharp partisan dialogue in a tightknit community, by bold showmanship, by fierce marketing and even by a dramatic clown defection.
Mr. Feld ignited the year-end circus wars last summer by announcing the arrival of Kaleidoscape, an elaborately produced, $10 million one-ring show that offers the comforts of padded seats with backs, red-carpeted hardwood flooring and premier "couch" seating at $75 a head.
In August, a Big Apple board member, Alan B. Slifka, publicly worried that the nonprofit Big Apple could be "driven out of existence" by the for-profit Kaleidoscape. Mr. Slifka contended that "the only reason for them to come at Christmastime is to compete with us."
Mr. Feld countered that he chose the city because "New York is the ultimate goal of any entertainment attraction," adding that the end-of-year window "is the time of year when people want to see things."
This season Big Apple, the spunky Manhattan-born institution that will play to a total of 450,000 circusgoers under its tent in Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, is more than holding its own. Loyal fans are flocking to the tent, and the show is having "a great season, we're selling out on a regular basis," said Gary B. Dunning, executive director of Big Apple.
Nevertheless, Big Apple is still smarting from the city's decision to permit Kaleidoscape to pitch its tent in Bryant Park. "Feld is there to make money for himself," Mr. Dunning said, "and we are there to pursue our mission of artistic excellence and give back to the community."
Beyond this, Big Apple is far from overjoyed that Ringling has signed Bello Nock, the vertical-orange-haired lead clown for Big Apple during the previous three seasons, as a star of Ringling's next three-ring arena show. "There was a sense of disappointment," Mr. Dunning said. "But that's business."
Thanks to the new competition, Big Apple has been forced not only to surrender its exclusive primacy in its high-profile season, but it has also had to ratchet up its marketing to maintain visibility. An entertainment executive with knowledge of Big Apple's marketing costs, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the circus would spend $1.3 million this year on television, print and direct-mail advertising, about $250,000 more than last year.
Mr. Dunning would say only that Big Apple was spending "more this year," adding that the cost "comes out of the programs we sponsor." He estimated that Big Apple returns a third of its $19 million yearly budget to city community programs, health institutions and other charitable causes. For years Big Apple has run efforts like the Big Apple Circus Clown Care Unit, which sends trained clowns into city hospitals to cheer up sick children.
Given Ringling's deep pockets, Kaleidoscape's massive publicity effort is three times the size of Big Apple's. Mr. Feld would not say how much the show has spent on marketing and advertising, but several media buyers with knowledge of Ringling's expenditures, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, estimated that the company has spent from $3.5 million to $4 million in television and print advertising for its New York Kaleidoscape campaign.
Furthermore, Kaleidoscape has a cheaper rental deal. Ringling has promised a guaranteed payment of $200,000 to the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation, and more if the show is a hit. Big Apple pays Lincoln Center $400,000 to $500,000 a year, according to people with knowledge of the arrangement.
Meanwhile, the circus performers themselves are trying to remain above the fray. "To us, circus is not a competition, it's not a sport -- it's an art form," said David Larible, the Italian-born master clown who is the star of Kaleidoscape. "And everyone knows everyone else."
His own family has had a close working relationship with the Flying Pages of the Big Apple Circus. Mr. Larible's wife, America, an aerialist, used to fly the triple somersault to the hands of Willy Pages, now the catcher of the Flying Pages troupe. That was when they were all on the Ringling three-ring show. The families' friendship has, they say, transcended the battle of the circuses.
"It is a very tight community, and circus people love to visit other circus people," said Dominique Jando, the associate artistic director of Big Apple. Among Mr. Jando's friends on Kaleidoscape is Philippe Sosman, who performs as Pipo the white-faced clown. Mr. Jando has known him "since he was 5 years old, at Cirque d'Hiver" in Paris, said Mr. Jando, who once performed as a clown himself.
Alexander Petrov, the star wire-walker of Kaleidoscape who traverses a 21-foot-long steel wire carrying a spangled lady, Lucy Kirilova, said, "It's hard to feel competitive with other performers when you've been in the ring with them."
Mr. Petrov has visited with his friend Serge Percelly, Big Apple's featured tennis-racket juggler, who performed in 1991 with Mr. Petrov under the tent of Circus Benneweis in Denmark. "I saw Big Apple's show, and then I went to Serge's trailer to see his wife and two daughters -- I'd never met them before."
All this fraternization has its practical side. "You can get ideas from other shows when they're in town," said Tim Coldwell, a founder of the 22-year-old Circus Oz who is its star clown. "Though hopefully it's not, 'Now I'm going to do that very same thing in my show.' "
Mr. Coldwell's irreverent assortment of clowns, acrobats and musicians performs under a tent in Port Melbourne, Australia, but it can be seen onstage at the New Victory for a top ticket price of $35. Circus Oz "is at a different price point than Big Apple or Kaleidoscape," said Mary Rose Lloyd, director of programming at the New Victory, referring to its competitors' top prices of $62 and $75 respectively. Circus Oz has spent $85,000 on city newspaper and magazine advertising.
If New York enjoys an embarrassment of circus riches, the city has a long way to go before matching the decades-long tradition in Paris, where the tented shows' budgets are heavily underwritten by arts grants from the French government.
Currently Paris is ahead of New York by considerably more than a clown nose: 14 circuses are playing there, including Circus Pinder, with its 4,500-seat tent, more than twice the capacity of Kaleidoscape. Mr. Larible, who worked the Christmas season at the Cirque d'Hiver in Paris in 1979, asked, "If Paris can host 17 circuses, then why shouldn't New York welcome more than three?"
And it is true that Big Apple isn't going away, that Circus Oz plans to return and that Mr. Feld hopes Kaleidoscape can come back to Bryant Park "year after year, as a holiday tradition."
So, depending on the economy and New Yorkers' fickle tastes, "maybe New York can become an annual circus festival," said Mr. De Ritis, the director. "That could further raise the level of audience sophistication, and force all the circuses to maintain a high level of performance -- something that New Yorkers expect."

HEADLINE: Can Capitalism Reduce Flights And Delays At LaGuardia?

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
There are 26,000 airline flights a day in the United States, and sometimes it seems as if every last one of them flies into La Guardia Airport. In fact, only about a thousand of them do on any given day, but that can be enough to create waits of an hour or two to take off or land, and that, in turn, delays air traffic around the country.
So over the next few months, the government plans to reduce the number of flights at La Guardia permanently, using a method almost unheard of in air traffic control: capitalism. There could be some problems on the way, however, as a free-market solution promises to yield a free-for-all. 
 The parties involved agree, though, that the old system has broken down. For decades traffic was kept bearable by a rationing system, based on incumbency, with airlines claiming flights the way Columbus claimed America for Ferdinand and Isabella: they got there first. A second way to add a flight at La Guardia was to persuade Congress or the Federal Aviation Administration that to do so would bring much-needed competition or serve a small community that had few or no connections to New York. Earlier this year, Congress opened the floodgates by increasing access for airlines in that category.
When the delays became unbearable, the F.A.A. held a "slot lottery" to reduce the new flights. But the fix is only temporary.
By Sept. 15, La Guardia's owner, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, together with the airlines, the Federal Aviation Administration and various other interested parties, are supposed to have worked out a new rationing system, which the F.A.A. has decided will be based on "market forces."
The system currently works against new airlines trying to offer service and, perhaps, increase competition that would be good for consumers. Slots for flights at La Guardia come on the market only infrequently but are worth about $2 million, according to people in the airline business; few new airlines have enough capital on hand to compete with established carriers.
Nobody is quite sure how the Port Authority could constructively change the fee system, because of some unusual complications.
For example, it is not clear whether fees should be based on the size of aircraft. Landing fees have always been based on weight -- at La Guardia, $5 per thousand pounds. The idea is that airplanes should be charged the way trucks and cars are on toll roads and bridges, with the heavier ones paying more to make up for additional wear and tear on the concrete.
That means that a 225-seat Boeing 767, which approaches 400,000 pounds landing weight, pays about 30 times more than a small, twin-engine turboprop, like an 18-seat Jetstream 31, which weighs less than 12,000 pounds.
But the Port Authority points out that small planes actually take more runway time to land, not less. Big planes can land relatively quickly behind one another; small ones have to stay farther back to stay out of the turbulence of a larger plane's engines. And they fly at different speeds, 150 miles per hour or so for big planes and perhaps 100 m.p.h. for smaller ones. So depending on landing order, the larger aircraft sometimes have to be held far behind the small ones to avoid overtaking them.
The new regional jets, which are now so popular, start their takeoff slowly and climb slowly, controllers say, a situation that reduces the airport's capacity. The airport could handle more traffic if the mix of planes were not so complicated, said Leslie Warfield, the representative of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association union at the La Guardia tower.
Small planes "place about one and a half times more burden on the airspace," said William R. DeCota, the Port Authority's director of aviation.
But the trend in aviation is toward more and more small planes that can provide service to small cities, or toward policies that allow an airline to offer five flights a day instead of one to draw more passengers. For La Guardia, that also means more planes.
The argument can be made that the airport should charge a flat fee for each plane, regardless of size, which would encourage the airlines to use bigger planes. Or perhaps airports could charge small planes more than big ones.
The idea is tempting because La Guardia handles 95 percent of its annual passenger load on just 75 percent of the planes flying in and out of it. The other 5 percent of the passengers -- about 600,000 people -- fly on planes that make up 25 percent of the landings and takeoffs.
"It would make enormous sense for the runways," said Peter Samuel, a transportation expert who has written about variable toll rates for the Reason Foundation, a conservative research group. "You're wasting scarce time by bringing in a plane with rather few people in it." Variable pricing, he said, would encourage airlines to make "rational use" of a scarce resource.
But many of the small planes are flown by big airlines, as part of their feeder networks to collect passengers for long-distance flights, and they do not want to reduce the number of flights in the small markets they serve.
Alfred E. Kahn, chairman of the Council on Wage and Price Stability under President Carter and known as the father of airline deregulation, said the pricing system should resemble the one used in "bumping" passengers when flights are overbooked. In that case, the airline offers bonuses to people who will get off the plane and take a later flight, rewarding those who value money more than time. A similar system for the airport, he said, would have "intelligent landing fees," in which airlines pay extra and pass the cost on to passengers through higher fares. Those passengers who really want to go to La Guardia would pay for that privilege, he said.
But no one is certain how high landing fees would have to go to alter airlines' behavior. The total airport costs, including rent for hangars and fuel fees, come to only 3 or 4 percent of operating costs for airlines, Mr. DeCota said.
This does not satisfy the have-nots, however. "We cannot go to a scenario where the deepest pockets control that airport," said Edward P. Faberman, who represents the Air Carrier Association of America, a group of small airlines. Even the Port Authority does not seem ready to cut back too much. "How do you factor in things like how to guarantee service to smaller communities," Mr. DeCota said. "How do you allow new entrants to come in?"
An executive at an airline that has many flights in and out of La Guardia said that to change airline practices, "you're going to have to raise the bar very, very, very high." The airport should run on the basis of "public convenience and necessity," he said, which includes service by small planes to small cities. And the allocation has to include traditional services like the air shuttles to Boston and Washington, he said.
The problem is a collision between physics and economics. La Guardia is so small that all of it, runways included, would just about fit into the terminal area at Kennedy International Airport. There are two long runways of 7,000 feet, but they intersect, which means that even in perfect weather, using both of them turns the air traffic controller into a choreographer of a three-dimensional ballet. And of the top 10 domestic airline routes, 9 are out of New York, so the number of planes that want to come to the region's three major airports is inexhaustible.
Another possibile solution is "congestion pricing," varying price by time, as the Port Authority is now considering for drivers at its Hudson River crossings. (The board had considered simply imposing this, but decided on Dec. 14, given the possibility of widespread anger among drivers, to hold hearings next month. A problem with congestion pricing at La Guardia is that airlines get just as angry as drivers do, and the airlines have more lawyers.)
But La Guardia is now so crowded that there is no hour of the day when there is spare capacity.

HEADLINE: Two Grades, One Record

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 25

 BODY:
In her seven years as governor of New Jersey, Christie Whitman has been firm about how she wants her approach to the environment to be measured.
Do not tally up the fines paid by industry and do not count the number of new regulations put on the books, she has urged, but do look at the quality of the air and of the water. And watch for a good balance of competing forces. 
 "This great country of ours has the ability and the will to build a more prosperous America while meeting our environmental obligations," Mrs. Whitman said Friday in Austin, Tex., as President-elect George W. Bush announced that she was his choice to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.
In New Jersey, whose most recognizable symbols might well be a factory smokestack and the Jersey Shore, industry and the environment make for particularly powerful political forces. And Mrs. Whitman is fond of saying that her policies often subject her to vitriol from business interests and environmental advocates alike.
"The fact that we're being attacked by both sides leads me to believe that we're probably right where we need to be, which is in the middle, to find some kind of common ground," she said in an interview earlier last week in her office in the State House here.
Mrs. Whitman has been a national leader in land conservation, a bold experimenter in finding ways to combat air pollution, a magnetic spokeswoman for smart-growth strategies to prevent suburban sprawl. Leading business groups praise what they call her balanced approach to environmental issues. But some New Jersey environmentalists say that she is a foe doing a remarkable job of masquerading as a friend, loudly preaching the eco-gospel while hobbling regulatory enforcement efforts, chipping away at pollution-control standards, and supporting controversial development projects in New Jersey's vanishing wetlands and woods.
Her record as governor includes noteworthy clashes between state regulators and the Environmental Protection Agency over wetlands development, clean air and clean water, raising questions about how Mrs. Whitman will guide policy at the federal level.
As she said in Austin, "Having served as governor, I also know what it's like to be on the receiving end of mandates from Washington."
Mrs. Whitman, 54, has dealt with virtually every major environmental issue in her seven years in office: regulatory reform, suburban sprawl, air pollution and water quality.
As a regulator, Mrs. Whitman has valued consensus and cooperation over confrontation, styling her approach after that of the Netherlands, where businesses are given great leeway to arrive at goals for pollution control on their own terms.
"She and I share the same point of view," Mr. Bush said in announcing her selection. "We share a philosophy that moves beyond the old, central command-and-control mind-set that believes Washington has got all the answers."
Mrs. Whitman took office in 1994 and sharply altered the regulatory policy of her predecessor, Jim Florio, a zealous environmental advocate who had written the federal Superfund law while in Congress.
Conservatives in Congress who have long wanted to cut back or eliminate the environmental agency might be cheered by a review of Mrs. Whitman's first term: Frequently blaming the state Department of Environmental Protection for causing job losses, she cut its budget by 30 percent and laid off hundreds of workers. She ordered that state regulations be no more stringent than federal rules. And she cut inspections, eliminated penalties and introduced grace periods for violators, to the point that collections of environmental fines plunged 80 percent.
Adopting the motto "Open for Business," Governor Whitman eliminated the environmental prosecutors Mr. Florio had introduced, and replaced a public advocate's office, which had at times sued the state on behalf of environmental groups, with a business ombudsman's office to guide businesses through the permitting process. And she sought to move away from punitive measures toward voluntary compliance.
"We'd spent an awfully long time with a very negative business environment for manufacturers," said Hal C. Bozarth Jr., spokesman for the Chemical Industry Council of New Jersey. "What she finally did was to bring the pendulum back somewhere in the middle, to balance economic development and environmental protection."
Jeffrey Tittel, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, who is perhaps Mrs. Whitman's harshest critic, put it another way. "A month doesn't go by where we don't find there's been a rollback or attempted rollback," he said.
If Governor Whitman is seen by many as more green than brown -- stronger at preserving open space than protecting the air, water and soil from pollution -- it may be because her signal achievement was in conservation: borrowing $1 billion to buy up vulnerable parcels of open space in the nation's most densely populated state.
Critics say it will not be enough money to achieve the governor's goal of preserving a million acres of land, and say that on her watch about 60,000 acres have been lost to development each year. Still, more than 250,000 acres of open space and farmland have been protected since 1994, nearly as much as in the prior three decades combined, officials say.
Governor Whitman has spoken frequently of the need to control growth by steering new development to urban areas, redeveloping old industrial sites and reining in suburban sprawl. Yet her administration has supported two projects that would further cut into New Jersey's remaining wetlands: a 200-acre retail development in the Meadowlands, and an eight-mile highway connector through Middlesex County. The federal Environmental Protection Agency opposes both.
The Whitman administration has also been at the vanguard of interstate and international efforts to reduce air pollution, although attempts to reduce in-state emissions have led to embarrassing failures. New Jersey's environmental protection commissioner, Robert C. Shinn Jr., played a crucial role in persuading the Midwestern states to bear responsibility for the air pollution they were exporting to the East, said Ned Sullivan, who was Maine's top environmental official and now runs Scenic Hudson, an advocacy group in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
"The Midwestern states had never, until then, admitted that their emissions from dirty, coal-fired power plants were causing the pollution and health problems that we experienced in New Jersey, New York and New England," Mr. Sullivan said. "Gaining that consensus, based on an analysis of the science, was the critical achievement."
The multistate agreement led to the E.P.A.'s 1998 order requiring power plants in 22 states to curb such smog-forming pollution, to lawsuits against those power plants filed by New York, New Jersey and other states, and ultimately to settlements such as one announced last week by the Cinergy Corporation, a utility in Cincinnati that said it would clean up 10 electric generating plants in Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio.
Mrs. Whitman's efforts to comply with the federal Clean Air Act in New Jersey, however, gave rise to a managerial disaster. The governor chose to enhance the state's automobile-emissions inspections to detect more pollutants. But the contract was delayed for two years, ran about $100 million over budget, and, when it finally opened in freezing temperatures last year, proved a nightmare of frozen equipment, lines dozens of cars deep, poorly trained workers and the occasional mangled tire. That the contractors included several Republicans with ties to the state Republican party did not help.
On water, Mrs. Whitman's record is one of progressive ideas, but, critics say, wanting in execution.
She won praise for establishing 20 watershed management areas across New Jersey, setting in motion what advocates say could eventually prove an effective way to put limits on new development. But in 1996, the Department of Environmental Protection, putting into place the federal Clean Water Act, proposed a set of rules that critics said would have let hundreds of millions of gallons of carcinogens and other pollutants into the waterways. Dozens of lawmakers objected, advocates sued, and the E.P.A. rejected the rules.
The state is now revising its proposal, but has encountered heated opposition from environmental groups as well as builders.
Mrs. Whitman, of course, asks to be judged not on the regulatory process itself but on its results -- in short, on the quality of New Jersey's water, and of its air. Yet the statistics she chooses to highlight almost always allow for a counterpoint.
On Friday, for example, even as Mrs. Whitman was in Austin, New Jersey's environmental agency released a report on the quality of water in the state's rivers and streams. The report, based on data collected from waterways that flow into the Delaware River in northwest New Jersey, painted a somewhat blurry picture.
The portion of rivers and streams "severely impaired" by pollutants had declined to just 1 percent in 1998 from 5 percent in 1993. But in 1993, 67 percent of the waterways, some of which are used for drinking water, were free of pollution. By 1998, that number had declined to 58 percent.

HEADLINE: Another Tradition: Refuge in a Shelter

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
On the coldest Christmas in more than a decade, the hungry and the homeless began lining up early yesterday for hot meals.
Outside the Y.W.C.A. at the corner of Third and Atlantic Avenues in the Boerum Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, the temperature was 19 degrees at 10 a.m. and the line of people waiting for the annual Christmas meal stretched around the block. The doors, scheduled to open at 11:30, were opened early; within the first hour and a half, more than 350 people had been served, and by day's end, more than 1,500 -- about 500 more than in years past. 
 Lee Perlman, one of the volunteer organizers of the holiday meal, said he was unsure how to explain the influx: The cold? A deep need belying an age of affluence? Wider publicity that a meal would be served?
That it was cold was irrefutable. Temperatures yesterday produced the coldest Christmas since 1989, based on the high of 27 degrees at midnight Sunday. Based on daytime temperatures, it was the coldest Christmas since 1983.
Todd J. Miner, a meteorologist with Pennsylvania State University, said a high pressure system over the Midwest and low pressure over southeastern Canada were directing cold air south and east from central Canada into the Northeastern states.
The gusty winds -- as high as 46 miles per hour at La Guardia and 48 miles per hour at Kennedy International Airport -- made the air feel even colder. Wind-chill temperatures were well below zero across the metropolitan region yesterday.
With the particularly cold weather, city police officers as well as social workers were operating at a "heightened level of intervention" regarding the homeless, said the city's commissioner of the homeless services, Martin Osterreich. Homeless people in mental or physical distress found on the street would automatically be taken to a city hospital or homeless shelter for evaluation, he said. Otherwise, they would be offered the opportunity to go to a shelter. If they refused and were not in distress, they would be left alone, he said.
The city had about 300 available beds left for single adults on Christmas Day, with another 400 or so emergency beds that could be set up to supplement its capacity of approximately 7,600 beds for single adults, and 18,000 beds for families, Mr. Osterreich said. In addition, the city had about 169 units of housing available for families, translating into about 600 beds.
By 5 p.m., there had been 1,008 complaints about a lack of heat or hot water to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said a spokeswoman, Carol Abrams. On a typical cold winter day, she said, the agency receives about 1,600 calls, a benchmark it seemed likely to surpass yesterday.
For the families going to the Y.W.C.A., the cold was the least of their worries. They had left homeless shelters, single rooms and overcrowded apartments to trudge, halfway across the city in some cases, to fill their stomachs and their children's hopes.
"This year I cannot buy my children nothing," said Constancia Riveria, a 38-year-old mother of four, including 5-year-old twins. "My husband have no job" -- the candy store where he had worked has closed -- "and I have no job." As it is, the family lives in a one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn.
"This year, I really couldn't afford no presents," said Lois Chadwick, 27, a struggling mother of four who had traveled from the Bronx for turkey, stuffing, presents and diapers.
She said she had just received a letter from her welfare caseworker saying her case was being closed because she had missed an appointment. That left her entirely dependent on her children's father for support. She said that she would like to work so she would not have to depend on welfare, but that she had never really learned to read. And she kept having children "back to back."
Lisa Schnell, 33, had arrived from the Bronx, eight children in tow, aged 14 to 1, to try to fill in the gaps at Christmas. Her children's father was unemployed, and they had been homeless for two years, finally resettling in a home of their own recently. "Christmastime is the hardest time, especially with a large family," she said. "The bills."
A 26-year-old single mother said inflation seemed to be diminishing the value of an already meager public assistance check: $87 every two weeks, with her rent paid as well. She said she braided hair to earn money, but as her son, now 5, grew, so did the bills. And, she confessed, she spoiled him with fashionable clothes. "Now I'm stuck."
For many, there was comfort in the numbers -- visible affirmation that many were as hard up as they were -- and the range of ethnicities, ages and family sizes, a reminder that poverty is not an exclusive club.
"I'm not too embarrassed -- there are a lot of people here today," said a 46-year-old woman who nevertheless refused to give her name. She was at the Goddard Riverside Community Center at the corner of Columbus Avenue and 88th Street on the West Side of Manhattan, where the first people had begun arriving for holiday meals at 9 a.m. She and two sons had been in a shelter since September, after relocating from Maryland. With no home and no job, she said, "I think God is testing us."
For Gerald Dupree, 39, who described himself as a former shoplifter and addict now living in a single-room-occupancy hotel, there was comfort in anonymity -- the warmth of strangers preferable to the turmoil of family. "I wanted to go somewhere where I don't know nobody, and they don't know me, but there's unity," he said. He too found comfort, he said, in seeing others who had been dealt a "bad hand."
At 2 p.m., it was 21 degrees, and people were still coming in the center's doors.

HEADLINE: EN ROUTE: THAILAND;
The Very Pungent Start Of a Most Piquant Sauce

SERIES: Second of three articles on Thai food.

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS 

DATELINE: SAMUT SONGKHRAM, Thailand

 BODY:
IT was with great curiosity and the tiniest bit of apprehension -- that I walked toward the fermentation building at the Thai Fishsauce Factory in this small village 44 miles southwest of Bangkok. The tropical sun was beating down on the corrugated tin roof. Would heat and dissolving anchovies prove too much for a Westerner, even one who loves fish sauce?
There was no mistaking the aroma. Even people who make fish sauce acknowledge that for the first six months of the process, when the anchovies are still visible in the fermenting mixture of water and salt, they smell pretty bad. 
 "Like old sneakers," said Pass Nithipitikarn, the international marketing manager of the factory, which produces Squid Brand fish sauce. His description is more than generous. He quickly added that "the finished sauce is totally different." And it is. But even at its most intense, the smell doesn't seem to bother the workers, who cheerfully remove chunks of fermented matter from the tanks with their rubber-gloved hands.
Fish sauce is to Thailand and Vietnam what salt is to the West and soy sauce is to China. If it isn't in a Thai dish, a bottle of it is certainly placed nearby, along with sugar and fiery minced peppers, sometimes in vinegar, sometimes naked.
In the United States, fish sauce has joined soy sauce on store shelves. It is used for the most part in Southeast Asian dishes, but more and more American cooks are learning that it adds a mysterious complexity to meats and seafood, vegetables and even fruit, contributing a saltiness that enhances sweetness.
Like Gorgonzola and tofu, which are also fermented, fish sauce is something you are either brought up with or have to get used to. Anyone who is willing to get past the odor that emanates from a bottle when the cap is taken off finds that the aroma dissipates after the sauce is added to food. Like Worcestershire sauce, all that is left behind is an elusive flavor. This is not surprising, since both have anchovies in the brew.
Although fish sauce is linked to Southeast Asia, it also has ancient roots in the Mediterranean. A popular seasoning in ancient Rome was a salty sauce called garum made with layers of fish, salt and herbs. This pungent sauce, borrowed from the Greeks, was highly prized. Martial, the Roman poet, wrote: "Accept this exquisite garum, a precious gift made with the first blood spilled from a living mackerel."
Fermentation was a way to preserve foods before refrigeration and canning. The Asian precursor of fish sauce was a strong-smelling paste made from fish fermented with salt and rice bran or rice powder in a ceramic barrel. The first versions of fish sauce were apparently just the liquid poured or pressed from the paste.
Today, the best fish sauce is the color of pale sherry and fairly clear. As a general rule, Thai nam pla is milder and less pungent than nuoc mam, the version manufactured in Vietnam.
While some connoisseurs insist that fish sauce should contain nothing but fish, salt and water, two of the most popular Thai brands, Tepiros and Squid, are flavored with sugar. Both are available in the United States. In one Bangkok supermarket, I counted 20 brands. Quality varies widely; some even contain additives like MSG.
Fish sauce made in the backyard is fast disappearing in Thailand. "In the old days everyone made their own fish sauce during the cold season using a small fish that came from the river," said Dr. Sisamon Kongpan, deputy dean emeritus of research and development in the home economics department of Rajamangala Institute of Technology in Thailand. "They put it in a big closed amphora out in the sun and filtered the liquid that came off. Then they boiled it with galangal and lemon grass. It's a very ancient method."
Dr. Kongpan said commercial fish sauce has been made for about 70 years. These days it is produced in factories like Squid Brand's, with concrete tanks, assembly lines and employees in white uniforms, maybe even an American-style program for food safety. The factory, which was started by Mr. Nithipitikarn's grandfather 50 years ago, produces more than 24 million bottles a year. The aroma is not offensive, except for those moments when an unseen plume of newly fermenting anchovies blown by some unfelt breeze assaults the nostrils.
Most of the anchovies arrive at the plant in September and October, the end of the rainy season when the fish are most plentiful. The anchovies have already been salted to preserve them; now they are salted again and put in wells with water to cover. The brew stews for 12 to 18 months, producing a concentrated mixture that is then placed in another well with still more salt and water. Fermentation continues for four more months.
Then the liquid is siphoned off through a small blue plastic pipe; as with the first pressing of olive oil, this is the highest quality. Sugar is added and the mixture is filtered. The sauce is then bottled, capped and labeled on an assembly line by workers dressed in white coats, hats and hygienic masks.
A final test is done on sample bottles to check the salt content, the nitrogen level and the color. The higher the nitrogen level, Mr. Nithipitikarn explained, the better the quality of the sauce.
Thai cookbooks describe fish sauce as a good source of protein and B vitamins, especially important in a diet of rice, vegetables and very little meat. But one tablespoon of fish sauce contains only one gram of protein and 1,790 milligrams of sodium.
It takes most Americans years to use up a bottle. But Thais treat fish sauce the way Americans treat ketchup: Mr. Nithipitikarn's family of four adults goes through one bottle a month.

HEADLINE: A Year to Forget for the Japanese Stock Market

BYLINE: By MIKI TANIKAWA 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 26

 BODY:
As new government data raise concern that Japan might be falling back into recession, the country's stock market is becoming both a victim of and a contributor to the economic slowdown.
Japan's key stock market gauge, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks, is down 26 percent for the year, its worst performance since 1992. The index hit a two-year low Thursday, to 13,423, before recovering slightly in the three trading sessions since. It ended today at 14,007.85. 
 Thursday's decline set off widespread concern about the economy and was the top story on many of the country's news programs that night, a rarity in Japan.
With the domestic economy on shaky ground -- witness the latest economic reports showing an increase in the jobless rate and a decline in consumer spending -- the stock market was unnerved last week by the influence of markets overseas, specifically the 7 percent decline in the Nasdaq on Thursday.
The reversal in Japanese stocks came after the Nikkei surpassed the 20,000 mark last spring for the first time in three years.
Suddenly, with high-tech industry no longer able to provide an economic spark plug, Japan's wobbly old-economy industries like retailing, construction and banking looked more problematic, said Kazuhiro Miyake, strategist at Mizuho Securities. "As share prices fell, those areas with lingering problems were spotlighted."
The country's banks are saddled with piles of problem loans from those sectors. And the descending share prices sent banks, which depend on their stock holdings to write off nonperforming loans, into deeper crisis, creating a vicious sell-off, Mr. Miyake said.
One fund manager argued that the reason lenders to Daiei -- the country's largest supermarket chain, but one saddled with 2.4 trillion yen of interest-bearing debt -- have not reached agreement to forgive debt to the retailer or to liquidate it was that stock prices were currently too low.
While some analysts fear that the current situation could create an economic crisis similar to the one in 1997 and 1998, others see some positive underlying fundamentals.
Supported by newspaper reports that the Japanese postal ministry would invest 2 trillion yen each year over the next five years in the stock market, the Nikkei gained more than 500 points on Monday.
Naoya Orime, chief investment officer at Merrill Lynch Investment Managers in Tokyo, said corporate earnings were expected to rise an average of 10 to 15 percent in the next fiscal year.
In addition, the yen has fallen to a 16-month low against the dollar and a 9-month low against the euro.
"Investors haven't fully realized how good the current yen level is for exporters," Tatsuhiko Takura, a general manager at Tokio Marine Asset Management, told Bloomberg News. "Their share prices will start to reflect the benefit as people become more confident in a U.S. rate cut early next year."
And the stock price levels, while low, are not as bad as they seem, said Yoshikazu Takao, managing director at Asahi Life Asset Management.
The Nikkei, which is compiled by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, publisher of a financial daily newspaper, was revised in April, with leading information technology companies like NTT DoCoMo replacing some of the old-economy components.
The Nikkei looks low now partly because the information technology shares have fallen so much. The index would be 2,900 to 3,000 points higher without the revisions, Mr. Takao said.
Whether they see a bigger crisis or not, analysts and investors commonly point to one organization: the Bank of Japan.
The central bank raised interest rates in August by moving the benchmark overnight loan rate from near zero to 0.25 percent, ending the so-called zero-interest rate policy despite calls by economic policy makers to wait. The bank's rate increase "was a main culprit" for the faltering stock market, Mr. Takao said. "It hurt sentiments."
Critics have charged that the Bank of Japan adjusted rates higher to prove its mettle and to show that it will not bow to political pressure.
Since the increase, market liquidity has dried up, contributing to the stock market's fall, Mr. Orime said.
A Bank of Japan governor, Masaru Hayami, said in August that the bank raised rates because deflationary concern had been dispelled, but prices have continued to fall.

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW;
Teeming Mural of a War Fought and Lost

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
Steven Soderbergh's great, despairing squall of a film, "Traffic," may be the first Hollywood movie since Robert Altman's "Nashville" to infuse epic cinematic form with jittery new rhythms and a fresh, acid-washed palette.
The agitated pulse of the hand-held camerawork (by the director working under a pseudonym) that roughly elbows its way into the center of the action is perfectly suited to the film's hard-boiled subject, America's losing war on drugs. The color scheme sandwiches a few lush patches between sequences filmed in two hues -- an icy blue and a sun-baked yellow-orange -- that are as visually discordant as the forces doing battle. 
 Where Mr. Altman's masterpiece portrayed American culture as a jostling, twangy carnival of honky-tonk dreams, "Traffic" is a sprawling multicultural jazz symphony of clashing voices sounding variations of the same nagging discontent. The performances (in English and Spanish), by an ensemble from which not a false note issues, have the clarity and force of pithy instrumental solos insistently piercing through a dense cacophony.
The characters run the social gamut, from affluent United States government officials and wealthy drug lords on both sides of the United States border with Mexico and their fat-cat lawyers, to the foot soldiers doggedly toiling in a never-ending drug war.
The most indelible performances belong to Benicio Del Toro as a burly, eagle-eyed Mexican state policeman of pluck and resourcefulness who has the street smarts to wriggle out of almost any squeeze; Michael Douglas, as a conservative Ohio Supreme Court Justice who is appointed the country's new drug czar, and Erika Christensen, as his sullen drug-addicted teenage daughter. Catherine Zeta-Jones is also riveting as a wealthy, ruthless, Southern California matron who is unaware that her husband is a high-level drug smuggler until he is dragged out of their house by federal agents.
The movie, which jumps around from Tijuana to Cincinnati to Washington to San Diego, from a posh Ohio suburb to the inner city to the Mexican desert to the White House itself, offers a coolly scathing overview of the multibillion-dollar drug trade and the largely futile war being waged against it.
But as despairing as it is, "Traffic" is not cynical. It gives its isolated heroes in the trenches their due. One of these is Javier Rodriguez (Mr. Del Toro), a wily, good-hearted Mexican policeman who conspires with the Drug Enforcement Administration to bring down his own boss (Tomas Milian), a corrupt Mexican general who uses torture to get his way. Other heroes include a pair of D.E.A. undercover agents, Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzman), who spend half their lives in cramped vans engaged in surveillance.
"Traffic" is an updated, Americanized version of a 1989 British television mini-series, "Traffik," that followed the drug trade from Pakistan to Britain. From an ambiguous, paranoically-charged opening desert sequence (reminiscent of the crop-dusting scene in "North by Northwest"), in which Javier and his partner, Manolo (Jacob Vargas), surrender a newly captured truckload of cocaine to the corrupt general, to a late scene in which an American agent risks his life to plant a bug in a dealer's mansion, "Traffic" is an utterly gripping, edge-of-your-seat thriller. Or rather it is several interwoven thrillers, each with its own tense rhythm and explosive payoff.
What these stories add up to is something grander and deeper than a virtuosic adventure film.
"Traffic" is a tragic cinematic mural of a war being fought and lost. That failure, the movie suggests, has a lot to do with greed and economic inequity (third world drug cartels have endless financial resources to fight back). But the ultimate culprit, the movie implies, is human nature. Waging a war against drugs isn't just a matter of combating corruption but of eradicating the basic human desire to "take the edge off," as Mr. Douglas's character, Robert Wakefield, says in defense of his nightly drink of Scotch. "Otherwise, I'd be dying of boredom," he adds.
"Traffic" is no friend of the government. When Wakefield returns from Washington, where he has been briefed by the president's chief of staff (Albert Finney) and other major Beltway players in the war, he describes the experience to his wife, Barbara (Amy Irving), and daughter, Caroline (Ms. Christensen), as like being "in Calcutta, surrounded by beggars wearing $1,500 suits who don't say 'please' and 'thank you.' "
While Wakefield is exploring this new turf, Caroline is rapidly succumbing to crack addiction under the tutelage of her cynical boyfriend, Seth (Topher Grace), her classmate at the exclusive Cincinnati Country Day School and as a scary a contemporary teenager as you're likely find in a recent movie. A high achiever who is sullen and angry beneath her preppy glass, Caroline quickly plummets to the bottom. Early scenes of her stoned friends sprawled around a fancy living room, drinking, sniffing cocaine and mumbling fuzzily about their discontents offer a devastating vision of youthful suburban ennui.
The movie does not shy away from portraying the pleasure of drugs, and Caroline's initiation into free-base cocaine by Seth is a voluptuous rush. Her head rolls back, and tears of joy trickle from her eyes as Seth repeats in a soothing voice, "You see? You see?" before making love to her. From that moment, Caroline is hooked, and she becomes a glazed-eyed baby-faced demon whose precipitous fall lands her in a seedy hotel under the thumb of the drug-dealing pimp who introduced her to heroin. As Wakefield tries desperately to wrest her from the gutter, this strand of the movie threatens to turn into a Charles Bronson-like vigilante drama. But the acting is so powerful that the scenes have documentary crediblity.
A parallel strain of the demonic runs through the story of Helena Ayala (Ms. Zeta-Jones), whose comfortable world begins falling apart the moment her drug-dealing husband, Carlos (Steven Bauer), is arrested. Six months pregnant and the mother of a young son, she finds herself a social outcast, her finances frozen, her son's life threatened by Carlos's creditors. "I want my old life back," she declares furiously to her husband over a prison telephone. Then, with coldblooded determination, she sets about getting it back by any means necessary.
Her key to getting it back lies in forestalling the testimony of Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer), a midlevel drug dealer busted by Montel and Ray who is being held in protective custody as the key witness in Carlos's trial. A harsh realist who knows his chances of survival aren't great, Eduardo bitterly scoffs at his captors for "knowing the futility of what you're doing and doing it anyway," and his words resound through the movie. The film's most exciting scenes demonstrate the efficiency of the drug cartels at penetrating the most heavily guarded inner sanctum.
If "Traffic" illustrates how the underfunded, red-tape-bound good guys are no match against the enemy's superior resources, what makes the film more than a powerful thriller is its unflinching contemplation of human frailty. From Helena's take-no-prisoners schemes to stay rich, to a hired assassin tracked down in a gay bar and seduced into a trap, to Carlos's two-faced lawyer (Dennis Quaid), who is tempted to steal from his boss while he is behind bars, the film understands the sheer, brutal force of human desire.
A theme that percolates throughout Stephen Gaghan's screenplay is a reflection on addiction and dependence. From Wakefield's nightly Scotch, to the two glasses of red wine Helena recommends to her friends over lunch at a fancy La Jolla restaurant, to Ray's chain smoking, to the druggy past of Wakefield's wife (was it experimentation or something more?), "Traffic" poses unanswerable questions about selfmedication, pleasure, dependency and addiction. One character, who early in the movie invokes the slogan "In vino veritas" while plying a paid assassin with red wine to coax information out of him, later commits suicide by injecting heroin.
In the end, Wakefield, exhausted and demoralized after all he has been through, delivers the White House address he's been instructed to prepare in a weary, halfhearted voice, mumbling words like "courage," "perseverance" and "new ideas" before announcing a new "10-point plan." But as we've been shown, there are no new ideas. Wakefield's speech ring hollow until the moment he pauses and wonders out loud, How can you wage a war against your own family?
That family, "Traffic" implies, is not just his own drug-addicted daughter but also a culture devoted to instant gratification and quick-fix pain relief. The drugs, after all, don't flow out from the United States into the third world, they flow in. For this is a culture in which, at the end of the day, millions of people, just like Wakefield, find themselves "dying of boredom."
"Traffic" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of violence (including torture), sexual situations and the preparation of free-base cocaine and drug injection.

HEADLINE: Nuclear Power's Future

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The improved performance of American nuclear reactors in the 1990's is a result of concerted efforts to learn from experience and correct weaknesses in existing reactors (news article, Dec. 20). 
 Next-generation reactors embody major further improvements, featuring advanced safety features and economy. Two such reactors are operating in Japan and could be ordered here, public attitudes permitting. New reactors may or may not win out in a simple price competition, but they make sense if we attach a proper value to reducing emissions of pollutants, our dependence on energy imports and our vulnerability to oil and natural gas price rises.
A forward-looking energy policy should emphasize conservation, renewable sources and nuclear power.

We're Not Japan

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
When Lucy tells Charlie Brown that this time she really is going to let him kick that football, you know what's going to happen. When Wile E. Coyote insists that this time he really is going to catch the Road Runner, you know what's going to happen. And when Japanese officials tell you that this time their nation really is on the road to self-sustaining recovery . . .
A new clutch of indicators confirms that, sure enough, Japan's economy is stalling yet again. Business confidence has gone flat, consumer spending is falling, unemployment is rising, deflation is accelerating. And the Nikkei stock index, which was over 20,000 earlier this year, is now oscillating around 14,000. 
 For Japan, it's the same old story. But with the U.S. economy going through its roughest patch in years, with panicky analysts and self-interested politicians declaring that the sky is falling, maybe it's worth explaining why our story remains very different.
You see, the general rule -- the rule to which Japan is the great exception -- is that recessions are not a serious problem for large, modern economies. It's not that the forces that cause recessions have been abolished -- though every long expansion brings foolish proclamations of the end of business cycles. Rather, the point is that recessionary tendencies can usually be effectively treated with cheap, over-the-counter medication: cut interest rates a couple of percentage points, provide plenty of liquidity, and call me in the morning.
Or more accurately, call me in six months -- or maybe as much as a year. Experience suggests that the Fed can almost always persuade consumers and businesses to spend more by cutting interest rates, but that there's a longish lag between the rate cut and the spending increase. And that's why we're still vulnerable to recessions: now and then the Fed gets behind the curve, failing to recognize a weakening economy until it's too late to prevent a slump. That's what happened in 1990; it may be what's happening now.
Specifically, it's now pretty clear that the Fed went an interest rate hike too far -- that while it was right to raise rates in late 1999 and early 2000 to cool off a red-hot economy, that last half-percentage-point increase in May was overkill. Of course, I'm talking with the benefit of hindsight; it seemed like a good idea at the time.
The Fed can and almost surely will reverse that rate hike sometime soon, but the favorable effects of that reversal on spending will take time to materialize. Meanwhile the economy will slow, and could shrink for a couple of quarters, which is the technical definition of a recession. But it should be only a temporary setback -- which brings us to the difference between ourselves and Japan.
In Japan, the sky really is falling. Because the interest rate is already very close to zero (it isn't quite zero, because of the Bank of Japan's foolish decision to raise rates back in August -- but don't get me started), the slowdown is a sign that the nation's basic economic policies aren't working, and that it is long past time to do something radical. By contrast, our slowdown is just one of those things that happen now and then; it doesn't indicate any fundamental flaws in our economic policy, any need to do anything except cut interest rates.
So what should we be afraid of? The nightmare scenario, which cannot be completely ruled out, is that we will turn out to be more like Japan than we think -- that we have just gone through our own version of the infamous "bubble economy," and that we are about to find out that this time cutting interest rates won't do the trick. But at this point that scenario isn't very plausible.
What worries me is not the recession that we may or may not be about to experience; it is the way that our politicians are likely to react to that slowdown. Will they use a mild, easily treated ailment as an excuse to force expensive, dangerous quack remedies down the nation's throat? I am, of course, talking about tax cuts -- which won't cure the short-term slowdown, and will undermine our long-run fiscal health.
We don't need to fear a recession; if it does happen, it's something that the Fed can easily cure. What we do need to fear is fear itself: the all-too-likely prospect that the threat of recession will panic us into doing things we will regret for years to come.

HEADLINE: Management -- Wanted: One C.E.O., Ready to Work;
Long Boom and a Shortage Of Top Executive Talent Fuel Growth of Recruiters

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
The departure of a key manager can create consternation at any corporation, but Michael Sternklar, a principal at the Unifi Networks unit of PricewaterhouseCoopers, knew what to do when it happened to him.
The manager, who had been working closely with a client who paid millions of dollars annually to Unifi, left its Fort Lee, N.J., office last May. Mr. Sternklar did not even think about trying to find a replacement on his own. Instead, he put out an emergency appeal to William Kelly, president of Kelly & Company, a boutique executive search firm that had a continuing relationship with Unifi. 
 "There might be 20 people in the whole United States" who could do the job Mr. Sternklar remembers thinking, and there was no way he could track them all down. "I needed one, and I needed one quickly."
He got one, too. Ed Davey, with more than 20 years of experience in human resources management, accepted an offer to work at Unifi in August.
The predicament Mr. Sternklar faced then is one that more and more companies are finding themselves in these days, as the longest economic expansion in American history coincides with a worsening shortage of management talent. But their quandary is gravy for executive search firms like Kelly.
For all the publicity surrounding the explosion of Internet start-ups and other high-technology concerns, the executive-recruiting industry has been quietly registering double-digit growth every year since 1992, according to Kennedy Information, a firm in Fitzwilliam, N.H., that publishes The Executive Recruiter News.
Recruiters at the smaller, privately held search firms that dominate the industry say their revenues have risen between 30 and 50 percent just over the last two years. At Heidrick & Struggles, one of very few publicly held search firms, revenue has nearly quadrupled since 1995, from $114 million to $415 million in 1999. At Korn/Ferry International, another public company, revenue has more than doubled from $218 million in the fiscal year ended April 30, 1996, to $501 million in the period ended last April.
Joseph Daniel McCool, editor of The Executive Recruiter News, estimates that between 300 and 400 new firms sprang up in 1998 and 1999 alone, bringing the total to more than 5,000. The Internet job-posting site Monster.com, a unit of TMP Worldwide, joined the fray in September with ChiefMonster.com. "There's really no barrier to entry in this business," Mr. McCool said.
The boom is fueled by an old-fashioned supply shortage -- in this case, of people. As older managers retire or defect to rivals or high-technology start-ups, companies are scrambling to lure talent to fill their shoes. And because corporate profits have been rising and the price of technology falling in recent years, they have the cash to do it.
The trend also reflects investors' willingness to spend whatever it takes to hire the people who can achieve good financial results, as well as their decreasing tolerance of anyone who does not.
"Companies have realized in recent years that their key strategic weapon is their people," Mr. McCool said. "What that has led to is companies are willing to pay more for their best people."
The average compensation for chief executives soared throughout the 1990's, for example, rising 23 percent in 1999 alone, to $11.9 million. Recruiters generally are paid one-third of a hired executive's first-year pay package by the prospective employer, so they share in the bounty.
In addition, the willingness of corporate boards to dismiss people who fall below expectations and promote those who exceed them has created a high-stakes game of musical chairs, with executive search firms a big part of the action.
"These are halcyon days for headhunters," said Alan Neely, managing director of the North American advanced technology practice for Korn/Ferry, which focuses on searches for very senior executives. "The war for talent is really raging," and companies are increasingly turning to search firms for help, he added. "It is truly a boom."
Mr. Neely led a Korn/Ferry team to find a new chief financial officer for the company formed from the merger of EarthLink and MindSpring early this year. That search was incredibly high-pressured, because the new entity -- the current EarthLink -- needed to have a the executive in place before the merger was consummated early in February.
"You don't want to be without a C.F.O.," said Garry Betty, EarthLink's chief executive. "The financial markets don't like that."
Finding a new chief financial officer was necessary, though, because the combined company was going to be significantly larger -- too large for either company's previous chief financial officer to handle, he said. After the merger, EarthLink would have roughly $1 billion in annual revenue, compared with $350 million for MindSpring alone and $650 million for premerger EarthLink.
EarthLink authorized Korn/Ferry to begin searching last December, and Mr. Neely's team proceeded to search the company's databases and reports on publicly traded companies. Then members of the three-person team called potential candidates and described the position to them to see whether any were interested.
Fortunately, the combination of EarthLink and MindSpring was very appealing to the candidates because both companies had good reputations, Mr. Neely said. "That obviously affected the speed of the search," he said.
Last Dec. 22, Korn/Ferry presented the resumes of 13 interested candidates for review by MindSpring's chief executive, its largest investor and Mr. Betty.
"It's very unusual to have that many candidates that quickly, but let me tell you, they were in such a rush that we absolutely had to focus," Mr. Neely said.
Among the resumes was that of Lee Adrean, chief financial officer at the First Data Corporation. Mr. Adrean was ideal in many ways: First Data was a large company, with more than $5.5 billion in revenue, which meant that Mr. Adrean had experience both in working with a big company and dealing with investors.
First Data was based in Atlanta, so that it would be easy to set up interviews at EarthLink's offices -- also in Atlanta -- on short notice. Based on his resume, EarthLink and MindSpring told Korn/Ferry to pursue Mr. Adrean, along with a few other candidates.
Although Mr. Adrean was not actively looking to leave First Data, he was worried that the company was planning to shift some operations to Denver. "I didn't feel that was something we wanted to do," he said. This was an important factor in his willingness to talk with Korn/Ferry initially and with EarthLink later.
Mr. Neely's team met with Mr. Adrean in person after Christmas, and by the end of the first week in January he had met with Mr. Betty. The two men clicked.
"Garry and I established a great rapport," recalled Mr. Adrean. "We had a great conversation about the business, what he thought the challenges were."
That rapport was critical to his decision to take the job, he added. "At senior levels, success or failure is more a question of management chemistry," he said. "I like the management team here."
This was a very speedy recruiting mission. Mr. Adrean formally accepted the position at the end of January and joined EarthLink early in March.
"The search was done in essentially four weeks," Mr. Neely said. "Usually a search will take 90 to 100 days."
And finding Mr. Adrean would have been very difficult without the help of the recruiters, Mr. Betty said. "On our own, we would've never gotten to be considered by as many candidates," he said. "I was frankly quite pleased."
EarthLink was fortunate. It is not a simple thing to find candidates who fit in well with employers, and often takes a good deal more time than Korn/Ferry had to find Mr. Adrean.
"There's not a lot of people out there that might meet a company's expectations," said Mr. McCool of The Executive Recruiter News.
It is also difficult to match a potential recruit to an employer. "There might be positions out there that only 100 people are eligible for," Mr. McCool said. "Then you consider how many are mobile, how many would fit into the firm culture -- then that number gets into the single digits."
More and more often the process is complicated by the aversion of the next generation of executives to sacrificing quality of life to further their careers, said Mr. Kelly of Kelly & Company.
"I can put as much money on the table as I want, but I can't get people to stay until 7 o'clock," he said, "There are fewer younger people who are willing to forgo everything for a career."
Another reason for the scarcity of desirable executives is the aging of the baby-boom generation, Mr. Kelly said. With fewer experienced executives to choose from, searches may go unfilled, he added.
"We continue to lose searches to counteroffers," which used to be relatively rare, he said.
"Companies will do more to keep their best people," Mr. Kelly added. "That has more to do with demographics than anything else."
Fiercer competition to recruit experienced managers has meant that searches for executives take longer, on average four months now, instead of three in recent years.
Successful recruiting requires constant attention to who is doing what in a particular industry and how well the executive is doing it, say consultants. When a client company calls seeking a qualified executive, usually the recruiters already know the client firm and what kind of people have done well there, according to Kelvin Thompson, a senior partner at Heidrick & Struggles.
Normally, in a search that is less time-pressured than EarthLink's, the client and the recruiter determine the characteristics of a good replacement executive and figure out where such an executive might be found, he said. "We work with the client to identify target organizations, target companies, which are impressive and have been through some of the same changes," Mr. Thompson said.
Then it's a question of talking to people at those companies, trying to figure out whether they can thrive at the client company, and determining their willingness to jump ship, he said.
Maintaining the databases full of biographical information and also keeping up personal relationships with talented managers can be expensive and time-consuming. That has already led to some degree of consolidation in the industry and will likely lead to more as economic growth slows, according to Mr. McCool.
Still, a downturn will not affect the recruiters for several months, he said. "A lot of firms are still playing catch-up in terms of trying to find the kind of talent that they want," he said. "The executive recruiters won't feel the pain as quickly as their clients."

HEADLINE: Bankruptcy Is Sought By Bradlees

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The discount retailer Bradlees said yesterday that it had filed for bankruptcy protection after exploring several options to change its financial outlook, including a possible sale of the company.
 Bradlees, which is based in Braintree, Mass., said an "orderly wind-down of operations" would allow it to maximize its value. The process is beginning this week, the company said. 
 Pending the bankruptcy court's approval, the company said it had reached an agreement to sell its inventory to a group led by Gordon Brothers Retail Partners of Boston. Bradlees said it expected to retain store associates through this process.
 In its petition for bankruptcy protection, Bradlees cited a general economic downturn, including rising interest rates and higher gas and heating oil prices, as reasons for its financial trouble. It added other problems included new competition, unseasonable weather in the first half of 2000, and more recently, the tightening of trade credit and curtailment of inventory shipments.
 Bradlees operates 105 stores and three distribution centers in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Maine, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
Bradlees was founded in New London, Conn., in 1958. It went public in 1992 and emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February 1999.
Shares of Bradlees were unchanged yesterday at 22 cents.

International Shipping Company to Follow Port to New Jersey

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
When the Port of New York was actually in New York, there was a good reason for D. F. Young Inc. to be in Lower Manhattan. The company, a freight forwarder and customs broker, had to be near shipping operations and financial institutions to exchange documents and coordinate cargo movements.
But all that remains of the once-bustling docks on the West Side of Manhattan are huge old buildings like the former Port Authority Commerce Building at 111 Eighth Avenue and the Starrett-Lehigh Building at 601 West 26th Street, which have shed their industrial past and are becoming the home of telecommunications companies and fashionable offices. 
 The introduction of container shipping moved the port's cargo operations to New Jersey, where land was available to handle and store the bulky containers and there was a land connection with the rest of the United States.
Now, after more than 97 years downtown, most recently at 17 Battery Place, D. F. Young is moving to New Jersey as well. It has recently agreed to lease 14,000 square feet at 1 Journal Square in Jersey City. It is scheduled to relocate early next year and to occupy the entire second floor of the building.
While much of the attention on the migration to New Jersey has been focused on big financial industry companies that have leased shiny new buildings on the Hudson River, the D. F. Young decision shows that smaller companies are moving as well, in this case to a smaller building set well back from the water's edge.
"With the new technology, there was no need to be physically near other companies, so why pay the rents downtown?" asked Gregory L. Collins, a managing director of Julien J. Studley, a brokerage firm that specializes in representing tenants. He said the annual rent per square foot in the old location probably would have been in the $37 to $44 range, while in New Jersey the rent is in the high $20's per square foot.
"When this company was started in 1903, all the shipping companies and banks were all in the bottom of Manhattan," said Thomas Mosimann, the president of D. F. Young. "But the port has moved and most of the other forwarders have followed it to New Jersey over the last 10 to 15 years. We are just following them."
Because many of the downtown buildings were built in the early part of the century, they are typically riddled with interior columns and are not as efficient in their space utilization as newer designs. Mr. Collins said the 1 Journal Square building has a central core and very few interior columns, making it possible to house D. F. Young's 100-member staff in half the space it was renting at 17 Battery Place.
"That is a huge savings," Mr. Collins said.
He said the space devoted to elevators, stairwells and other uses not suitable for offices -- known as the loss factor -- typically runs between 11 and 17 percent in modern suburban office buildings.
"In the city you are talking multiples of that," he said. "We have a stock of old buildings downtown where you have to play hide and seek with columns as you lay out offices."
Mr. Collins said that because many of D. F. Young's employees already live in New Jersey, the relocation of the office, which will serve as the firm's global headquarters as well as the hub of its New York area operations, will ease their commutes. Both surface and in-building parking are available at the site.
Nor need the workers sever their links to the city. If they want to shop at a favorite store in Manhattan or go to a restaurant for lunch, the Journal Square PATH station is a block away, the trip on the underground railway only a few minutes from downtown.
Adding to the economic attractiveness of the move to Jersey City, Mr. Collins said, was the array of state and municipal incentives offered to companies that bring jobs with them. Because Jersey City is an urban renewal zone, the incentives are sweeter than in more prosperous areas.
As a result, Mr. Collins said, D. F. Young will not have to pay sales tax on things bought to improve the new space, funds are available for training workers and there is even assistance with moving costs.
"You can get $1 to $1.50 a square foot credit for moving costs," he said. "That is pretty rare today, but New Jersey will do it." He said the credits and abatements are important to a company in a competitive business, because they lower operating costs. The net effect is that the company is getting its space at a below-market rate.
"New Jersey's incentives are very attractive," Mr. Mosimann said.
The floor of the building to be occupied by D. F. Young was previously occupied by medical offices, but Mr. Collins said the owner, Journal Square Plaza Urban Renewal Associates, was willing to do the conversion to conventional offices for the right tenant.
"Because of the way the space was built out, I think there were limited inquiries for it," he said. But with the new lease, he said, the building will be fully occupied.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Williams Leads 3 Suppliers Of Natural Gas To Large Gains

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Forget nitrous oxide. Natural gas has Wall Street giddy these days.
Investors snapped up shares in natural gas companies yesterday after Williams, a gas trader and pipeline operator, said its fourth-quarter profit would "substantially exceed" analysts' estimates of 17 cents a share. Williams, which operates 27,000 miles of gas pipelines nationwide, said its extra profit would come mostly from trading. 
 The announcement lifted shares of Williams $4.56, or 13.9 percent, to $37.44, and other major gas companies also gained. El Paso Energy, another major pipeline operator, rose $4.06 to $71.88, and Enron, the world's largest natural gas trader, rose $2.31, to $83.50.
Word of higher profits for gas companies may anger consumers, who are facing soaring energy bills this winter. Natural gas prices have quadrupled since last winter, to about $10 per million British thermal units, the standard measurement. But with gas supplies tight, prices appear unlikely to drop soon, analysts say.
An unexpectedly cold winter has caused gas supplies in storage to drop 23 percent from their mid-December average of the last five years, according to the American Gas Association's report for the week ended Dec. 15. And with cold weather continuing throughout the East and Midwest, the most pessimistic analysts now think it is possible the United States will run out of gas in storage by the end of the winter heating season. That could lead to severe price spikes because stored gas accounts for about 20 percent of all gas used during the winter and as much as half the gas used on peak heating days in the East and Midwest.
"We're going to be at record low levels if winter continues," said Donato J. Eassey, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. In addition, with most new electricity plants built to run on gas, demand for the fuel is rising year-round, so gas supplies will probably not be replenished as quickly next summer as they have been in years past, Mr. Eassey said. Reflecting that concern, prices for gas to be delivered next summer stand at more than $5 per million British thermal units, compared with less than $2.50 in summer 1999.
But what is bad for consumers has proved to be very, very good for investors in major gas companies in 2000. While the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has fallen 10 percent this year, Enron has risen 88 percent, El Paso is up 85 percent and Dynegy has more than tripled.
The conspicuous exception has been Williams, which was up only 7 percent for the year before its gain yesterday. Analysts said investors had punished Williams because it owns 85 percent of Williams Communications, which is building a nationwide fiber optic network next to Williams's gas pipelines. With Wall Street concerned about a glut in communications capacity, Williams stock has fallen almost one-quarter from its March high of $49.75.
As a result, Williams is significantly cheaper than its peers, even after today's run-up, Mr. Eassey said. Williams was expected to earn $1.28 a share this year before yesterday's announcement. But that figure has been depressed by substantial losses from Williams Communications, which Williams said in November that it would spin off to shareholders in "the first part" of 2001. Factoring out those losses, Mr. Eassey estimated last week that Williams would earn $1.96 a share this year and $1.65 in 2001.
Williams looks even cheaper, considering that Williams Communications, which is publicly traded, has a market value of roughly $5.7 billion, or $13 a Williams share, Mr. Eassey said. Factor out the value of Williams Communications, and the core Williams gas business trades at only 12 times 2000 earnings, compared with more than 40 times earnings for Dynegy and almost 60 times earnings for Enron.
"I like Williams because it's just flat out of favor," Mr. Eassey said.
While prices may fall this spring, Williams and other gas companies are likely to continue to prosper in the long run, said David Kiefer, portfolio manager of the $4.5 billion Prudential Utilities mutual fund, which has risen 33 percent this year. "We have enough for the next five to seven years, but if we don't start finding as much as we're using, we're not going to keep pace with the growth of the economy," he said.

HEADLINE: In 'the Other California,' A Land Rush Continues

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

DATELINE: TRACY, Calif.

 BODY:
They are the Tom Joads of the new economy. At dawn, they form a serpentine chain of red brake lights in the darkness as they head west over the Altamont Pass, the undulating hills, often shrouded in fog at this time of year, that separate the Great Central Valley from the San Francisco Bay region.
Locally they are called BAT's, Bay Area transplants, long-haul commuters who in the past 20 years have changed the face of this agricultural community. Tracy, about 60 miles east of San Francisco, was founded in 1878 by the Central Pacific Railroad, and has grown to 55,000 residents since 1980 from 18,000. 
 Ninety percent of the new homes here are bought by commuters, said Michael Locke, former Tracy city manager and president of the San Joaquin Partnership, a private economic development group. Collectively, the commuters are transforming new "premium developments" with names like Hidden Lake, Heartland and Countryside into ghost neighborhoods that empty each workday morning.
"You don't question it -- you just do it," said Yolisma Garcia, 44, a divorced mother of four who grew up as a migrant farm worker and now commutes four days a week, telecommuting on Fridays, to her job as a program systems manager for Sun Microsystems Inc.
Ms. Garcia takes the 4:54 a.m. Altamont Commuter Express train to Santa Clara, in Silicon Valley, where the last three cars, some bearing alarm clocks, are kept dimly lit for "sleepers."
The average length of a one-way commute over the pass is 58.3 miles, according to a recent survey co sponsored by the San Joaquin group. The extreme distances to work are spurred by housing prices that fan out like aftershocks from the epicenter -- Silicon Valley and San Francisco. In San Carlos, for instance, in Silicon Valley, where the median home price is $680,000, the mayor recently said he was leaving because he could not afford a home. Every mile east of San Francisco roughly equals a $5,000 reduction in housing costs, Mr. Locke said. The median price in Tracy is $225,000; in Manteca, 15 miles farther east, it is $161,000.
"I look at it as I'm paying myself half a million to commute," said Jeff Essex, 28, who recently moved from Sausalito, across the Golden Gate Bridge, to Patterson, 15 miles south of Tracy, where he commutes via the commuter train to Sunnyvale.
"The Central Valley was always 'the other California,' isolated and distinct," said Carol Whiteside, president of the Great Valley Center, a public-policy organization in Modesto. "Tracy is the intersection where two worlds collide."
By the time Alison Kong-Holtzclaw, a research technician with a medical device company, loads her three sleeping children into her minivan at 5:20 a.m. to take them to day care, her husband, Stephen, has been on the road for an hour, commuting two and a half hours to Menlo Park. By 5:55 a.m., Ms. Kong-Holtzclaw is joining thousands of fellow commuters in the hundred-mile-plus round-trip trek "over the hill" to Fremont and points west and south. She dreams of "continuous sleep," of becoming a stay-at-home mom like so many women she knows in Tracy.
Nancy Vasquez, 40, had been living in Gilroy, 20 minutes from her job, where the family could afford only a small apartment. Now she travels 160 miles a day from Tracy to her job as a harvester for a garlic company.
"I would go by the big houses, especially at Christmastime, and I was always wondering what was inside," Ms. Vasquez said. "Now, I'm in one."
The Tracy she inhabits is ringed by developers' flags and newly landscaped boulevards, where the promise of a four-bedroom house with a pool for $829 a month, "a place big enough for us all to relax," in Ms. Garcia's words, is worth the trek.
The new Tracy, with its spacious houses with tiled courtyards, leaves some old-timers grousing. The old Tracy was rooted in tomatoes, dry beans, sugar beets, walnuts, almonds and apricots. About 500,000 tons of tomatoes were processed annually here by the H. J. Heinz Company until the plant closed two years ago.
"You could tell when it was going to rain, because the wind from the southeast brought the smell of vinegar," said Sam Matthews, publisher emeritus of The Tracy Press, a daily.
The city, which has a Dry Bean Festival each summer with a pinto bean mascot, planned for and courted commuters, though residents recently passed Measure A, an initiative that will limit development in the city to 600 new houses a year. The people who work in Tracy itself, versus "over the hill," cannot afford his-and-her walk-in showers. Most of them live east, too.
The average income in Tracy is now $45,000 to $48,000, compared with $35,000 for San Joaquin County at large, said Mr. Locke of the San Joaquin Partnership. The new Tracy residents have made it possible for the city to sustain new restaurants and a new mall by Interstate 205.
But the tenor of life is changing, symbolized by the closing of the Moose Lodge and some Lions clubs.
"Before you kind of had an idea of who people were and what the makeup of the community was," Mr. Matthews said. "A lot of old-timers still get nervous about the form the city has taken. You go through these new subdivisions and you kind of wonder who they are."
David Bafford, a construction manager, recently quit a job in Foster City, in Silicon Valley, because it required him to leave his house at 4 a.m. Now he commutes only two hours one way.
"I figured out I spent 2,048 hours working last year," Mr. Bafford said with barely concealed disgust. "I spent 1,100 hours commuting. I spent 608 with my family. I spent twice as much time driving as with my kids."
At Merrill F. West High School, Kathy Burrow, a counselor, orients an average of 13 new students a week. Dr. Keith R. Larick, superintendent of the Tracy Unified School District, added, "We laughingly refer to Tracy as U-Haul City."
Although Tracy's relatively lower housing prices have financially liberated some dual-income couples, allowing one parent to stay home with the children, the city's schools are increasingly responding to long commutes. The district just started a program called "parent connect," which gives parents computer access to attendance, tardiness and whether homework was turned in period by period. Parent conferences are scheduled through 8 p.m.
"The parents are under such high stress that at times the last thing they want to hear is that something is wrong at school," Dr. Larick said. "We see a big increase in anger in parents, like road rage. They're just worn out."
David Schroeder, a clinical psychologist with a managed-care program in Modesto, sees a growing number of burnout cases in Bay Area transplants.
"They're very excited at first, because they come out here and can live like a king," Dr. Schroeder said. "They know they can do it. Then they do the commute, with the added three to four hours, for one or two years."
Then, he said, the stress surfaces -- in increased alcohol or drug abuse, especially stimulants; sleep disorders; sleeping pills; and auto accidents. Some adapt by carpooling, or taking the train, or spending some nights closer to work.
"It's a treadmill," Dr. Schroeder said. "Some families can tolerate it, some can't."
Young people like Sarah Jobin, and her stepsister, Natasha Mears, both 15, who are dropped off at Merrill F. West High School at 5:45 a.m., learn to adapt. They huddle together singing the national anthem, waiting for sunrise.
Sarah was skipping school regularly until recently, when she switched high schools. "We never ask to go anywhere, because it's noticeable our parents get up early and home late," she said. "Five days a week they're exhausted and everybody's mad."
Both girls live for Sunday, Sarah said, "the only day we're calm and mellow and together."
From his 1,200-acre farm, David Cordes, 54, can hear the drone on Interstates 205 and 580 and see the train, filled with commuters, wending its way through the pass. It is the land his great-great-grandfather homesteaded 131 years ago, the land he has worked on since age 3.
"Back then, you could look at Tracy and it was a dot of light," Mr. Cordes said. "A little spot between two water tanks."
The old Lammersville school sits on Mr. Cordes's property, a one-room schoolhouse that opened in 1878. It will soon be transported to a park beside a subdivision.
Mr. Cordes recently sold his land to developers, who plan to build an 830-acre high-tech industrial park. He is moving with his family to the Nebraska Sand Hills, where they will continue to farm, the one place he figures there will be no commuters.
Often these days, Mr. Cordes finds himself thinking of something his father told him 35 years ago, something he did not believe at the time.
"My dad said, 'Someday people will come over the hill and this will all be the Bay Area,' " Mr. Cordes recalled. "He said, "I won't see it. But you will.' "

HEADLINE: Specter of Cancer Haunts a School;
Industrial City of Elmira Confronts Environmental Legacy

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

DATELINE: ELMIRA, N.Y.

 BODY:
Years ago they drew little notice, the pond that never freezes, the rainbow of colors glinting off the surface of a creek, the hard-to-pronounce chemicals sprayed, painted and, yes, sometimes spilled around the mile-long stretch of factories on the south side of town.
This small Southern Tier city, which promotes itself as the gateway to the Finger Lakes and the place where Mark Twain wrote classics like "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," owes much of its existence to the less glamorous might of industry, which in the last century turned out cars, tools, typewriters, warplane components, fire hydrants and much more. 
 But as Elmira strives to rebound from years of hard times after the decline of manufacturing, residents have begun to question the legacy of all those factories as never before.
They are especially concerned by suggestions that a number of cancer cases reported by former and current students of a high school here are linked to the school, which was built on land that has supported a diverse array of industry from the Civil War to the 1970's.
The State Health and Environmental Conservation Departments have conducted tests at Southside High School and a neighboring property that is the site of an abandoned plant.
The State Department of Health has received reports of 53 cancer cases among the 7,500 current and former students since the school opened in 1979. It confirmed 25 cases of reportable cancer, meaning those other than the most common, easily treated skin cancers, and determined that the illness was diagnosed in 22 people while attending or after graduating from the school.
The most prevalent forms were leukemia and lymphoma, but the state determined that with the exception of one form of cancer, testicular, the number of cases was not statistically unusual.
The state found fewer than six cases of testicular cancer -- patient privacy rules forbid the department to specify the number when there are more than one and fewer than six cases -- in the last three years and is reviewing the medical records of those young men to assess any common threads.
The State Department of Health, after testing the air and ground, declared the school safe, though its conclusions have been disputed by some parents and by officials who suggest that the state investigation was hasty and not comprehensive.
The state is checking the medical records of the current and former students who have testicular cancer to assess whether there is a pattern of risk factors for the disease, though it is one of the least understood cancers and a link to environmental pollution has not been confirmed.
Testicular cancer accounts for only 1 percent of all cancers in men, according to the National Cancer Institute, but it is the most common form of cancer in men between the ages of 15 and 35.
The school district is also sending out a survey to all former students in an effort to check whether the 53 reported cases, compiled from school and state cancer registry records largely limited to New York State, are the only cases out there. Independent experts hired by the city and school district are also evaluating the state's findings.
Elmira is one of about three dozen communities nationwide that are questioning whether building schools on or near former industrial sites, usually because of cheap, readily available land, is causing ill effects among children, according to the Center for Health, Environment and Justice, a Virginia-based advocacy group founded by Lois Marie Gibbs, who led the calls for federal officials to clean up 20,000 tons of toxic waste that was buried beneath her neighborhood in Love Canal.
As in those communities, the cancer scare here has frayed nerves in town, not only at the notion that children's health may be in danger, but also because some people say the issue is being blown out of proportion. State officials have told residents that such cancer cluster investigations seldom make a direct link between past environmental contamination and illnesses because of the gaps in knowledge about chemicals and because risk factors for cancers include genetics, nutrition and lifestyle.
But parents of the stricken students, while acknowledging it may never be proven that the illness was caused by contamination, remain steadfast in exploring the possibility.
"We are just looking for some type of answer and to see if there is a reason to be worried about any kids in the future," said Andy Patros, whose son, Tom, 21, is one of the former students with testicular cancer.
Mr. Patros used to joke about the "pond that never freezes," a retaining pool next to the school that on a subfreezing morning in December was indeed largely unfrozen. (State officials are exploring the possibility that it does not completely freeze because it is fed by an underground spring.)
Mr. Patros and his wife, Julie, a nurse at a private hospital, were among a group of parents and officials from the neighborhood around the school who sent a letter to the school district in April outlining their concerns about a spate of cancer cases they had heard about from friends and neighbors. This followed the cleanup of the adjacent property, where about 2,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil was removed in 1999 by the new owner of a site where American LaFrance fire trucks were once made.
Former employees have come forward with tales of cavalier handling of dangerous chemicals and common dumping and burying of waste on the property and in nearby creeks and ponds.
Bob Schneider, 79, who worked at Remington Rand, which made typewriters and other office machines, recalled handling both powerful chemicals and metals. His father, who also worked at the factory and who died in 1979 of prostate cancer, "used to get nasty jobs, all this toxic stuff to clean out."
"They would give him time off after he did it, cleaning out all these vats," Mr. Schneider said. "I don't know what it was, but it would make you sick if you smelled it. Smelled like rotten onions or something. They would strip steel with it."
Mr. Schneider, like many others in town, never thought to question the substances they were handling. In the boom times during and just after World Wars I and II, the dozens of manufacturers played a major role not just in the city's economy but in its social fabric as well, sponsoring basketball leagues and charity functions, said J. Arthur Kieffer, the county historian and a former construction worker at the factories.
"We never thought about things like that, contamination or cancer, when people were working in the factories," said Mr. Kieffer, 79. "I am not going to say that's right or wrong, but there were thousands of people working in them factories, and if we are going to say things about the school, the environment caused cancer, then it would seem to me they would have to check the former workers, too."
So far, nobody has proposed that, and the focus has remained on the school and on the children.
The school property, owned by Remington Rand from 1937 through 1972, was acquired by the school district, hungry for cheap land to build a new school, for $1 from the county redevelopment agency. Craig Slater, a lawyer hired by the city to advise it on the state investigations, said records were scarce on whether the property was cleaned up before construction began, but he noted that environmental regulations and awareness of the toxicity of chemicals were not nearly as strong then as they are now.
Jay Grossman, a spokesman for Unisys, which through a series of mergers absorbed Remington Rand, said the company had been monitoring the investigations but did not plan to take any action on its former property because the state had not determined that it posed any health risk.
Just before the school year began, the board closed the school's athletic fields as a precautionary measure after state scientists found elevated levels of dangerous compounds in the soil, but not in quantities, they said, that would pose a health risk.
The contaminants included arsenic, barium, nickel and mercury. PCB's, a known carcinogen, were found in a creek next to the school. Investigators with the Department of Environmental Conservation said the toxic substances on the school site were found well below the surface and were unlikely to cause health problems unless someone dug deep and ingested sizable portions of soil.
Since then, pressure has increased to open the fields in time for spring sports. (The board has opened a practice field a few miles away.)
"All this contamination they are talking about on the south side, they are blowing way out of proportion," said Bill Smith, who worked in a nearby foundry and, even though his sweat was sometimes yellow at the time, says he is still going strong at 77. "I feel sorry for the kids that got cancer, but I'm not so sure it's from the school."
But others in the community contend that state officials have not looked hard enough and say they believe that any health risks go beyond the school.
"You just constantly hear about people getting cancer or dying from it," said Debbie Brimmer, whose children live with their father in the neighborhood near the school. Ms. Brimmer, who grew up in the area, said she once admired the "pretty greens and blues and reds" on the surface of creeks near the school that state officials now say are contaminated with oil and PCB's.
At this point, the focus remains largely on the school, where officials expect their consultants to complete their review of the state testing by Jan. 15.
Nobody expects the questions to end there. Indeed, some say they believe an element of mystery will always pervade, given the gaps in knowledge about pollutants and their health effects.
"As long as they say we tested everything and everything is fine beyond a reasonable doubt, that would be O.K.," said Michael Tobin, 16, a junior at the school who has been treated for cancer. "But I don't expect that any time soon."

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
Of more Web sites and gridlocked skies: Tying up some loose ends as the year runs down.

BYLINE: By Joe Sharkey; The Business Travel column appears each Wednesday. E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
TYING up some loose ends as the year runs out: Last week's column listed some Web sites that are especially useful for business travelers. But I overlooked a few.
"I believe you left out the best of all travel Web sites. It has everything, including many of those mentioned in the column . Try it: www.smilinjack.com," writes a reader, Roger J. Baccigaluppi. 
 Tried it. Mr. Baccigaluppi is right. The site, designed with a motif honoring Smilin' Jack, the dashing comic-strip aviator whose adventures spanned the era from barnstorming to jets, is maintained by Jack Irwin, a St. Louis-based airline pilot. The links -- including world airport and airlines home pages, more than three dozen weather sites, and scores of other travel-related pages -- are terrific.
Speaking of travel Web sites, two rapidly growing national restaurant Web sites are starting to become useful for business travelers who want to book reservations or research dining choices for future destinations.
They are www.opentable.com and its chief competitor, www.foodline .com. Both sites are scrambling to sign up more clients in major business-travel destinations this year. Choices currently range from a dozen or so restaurants in some cities, to 100 and more in others.
Rosters are growing as more restaurants, traditionally among the most hidebound of businesses when it comes to embracing technology, realize that opening their reservations books to the Internet bazaar means they can fill tables that might otherwise go empty. At the same time, assuming enough people actually use these services, restaurants can apply sophisticated data-processing techniques to their customer relations strategies.
Of course, the dot-com graveyard is fast filling up with dearly departed practitioners of technology without common sense. Running a restaurant that people actually return to is a delicate art. One Manhattan restaurateur, Danny Meyer, who is on the board of Open Table Inc., said that he planned to have the Union Square Cafe, Gramercy Tavern and two other popular New York restaurants that he operates listed "within a month or two" on the site.
I wondered if he was worried that we might be edging toward a brave new restaurant world, where a computer will call all the shots. Mr. Meyer said that technology would be a useful marketing tool, but "there is an art to hospitality, whether it's done by computer or by hand."
Used indiscriminately, too much information can present a problem, he said, recalling a lesson he learned when he opened the Union Square Cafe 15 years ago and began keeping various tidbits of customer preferences for future reference. A woman who had been in previously returned with friends and requested the same table. "Not only did I remember the table she'd had, which was of course fine, but I remembered that she was wearing the same beautiful dress, and told her so," he said, laughing. "I was a 27-year-old single guy. What did I know? Luckily, she ended up being a regular."
The year's top story in business travel was, of course, the record number of delays and cancellations on commercial airlines -- a situation so bad that it practically obscured the runners-up, soaring business fares and deteriorating airline customer service. Last month, by the way, the delay fiascos continued. According to Federal Aviation Administration data, November's delays were nearly 50 percent higher than the year-earlier month.
As the skies gridlocked, complaints and recriminations filled the air. Remedial recommendations ranged from resigned acceptance of the status quo (and hopping a train if it's going your way), to entirely junking federal management of the air-traffic control networks in favor of a privatized system.
A column here a couple of weeks ago on delays and various proposals to fix the system made an assertion that needs clarification, according to Dorothy Robyn, a White House special assistant who specializes in aviation issues.
I said that the commercial airline industry widely opposed "user fees." But I didn't differentiate between two kinds of proposed fees. One proposal, more generally palatable to the industry, would impose airspace fees as an alternative to the current ticket surcharge for financing the air-traffic control network. Another, the imposition of higher airport landing fees, is widely opposed by airlines, partly because they are increasingly using smaller, more economical regional jets, with a resulting increase in the numbers of landings.
The snarled air system is a transportation crisis that a new administration will have to confront this year. Soon, some airlines are expected to move more publicly behind proposals to replace the Federal Aviation Administration entirely with a new quasi-public system, based on some formula of fees, that they will manage themselves.
But one thing everyone agrees on is that the current system is in urgent need of repair. "While airlines have developed the most sophisticated pricing models of any industry, we have not introduced basic market-based pricing for allocating air-traffic control and airports," Ms. Robyn said in a speech to an aviation group last summer. "The predictable result is congestion, delays and unhappy passengers."

HEADLINE: Block May Be Revived, but Some Ask for Whom

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY 

 BODY:
For a mostly abandoned block, there is a great deal of activity on West 148th Street between Adam Clayton Powell and Frederick Douglass Boulevards in Harlem.
There is the constant bustle of traffic because cars from the nearby service area for the Police Department and the few neighborhood businesses use the trash-strewn street as a parking lot. Then there are the rodents that leap through the garbage and dart in and out of the boarded apartment buildings. Children play there, too, coming from other streets to throw balls through a makeshift hoop fashioned from a plastic crate nailed to a wooden scaffold. 
 Bright sunlight shone harshly yesterday on the gritty street, and on all the little dumps that have sprung up where entrances used to be, yet the structures' delicate masonry and sturdy brickwork suggest that this was once a noble-looking block.
Area residents say it was not only that, but well known as the "best block in Harlem."
"Now it's the worst block in Harlem," said Talmon Ford, 44, a nurse who grew up on West 148th Street. "You can't find any other place that's totally abandoned like that."
News of the city's plans to revitalize the street, which has New York's highest concentration of vacant, city-owned buildings, has brought out feelings of skepticism and betrayal for many of the former residents -- some of whom still remain so close as a group that they hold 148th Street reunions twice a year.
They say they would like to move back into the buildings they grew up in, but fear that they would not be able to afford the new, higher rents. They have concerns that too few apartments are being earmarked for area residents, and they wonder why the buildings were allowed to decay in the first place.
The city plans co-ops and rentals affordable to moderate-income families, according to housing officials. The apartments are to be awarded by lottery, but preference will be given to area residents for at least 30 percent of the units.
"It seems that they let that block go down, they wanted everybody out," said Mr. Ford, 44, who was talking with friends at Tommy's Barber Shop on Frederick Douglass Boulevard near the corner of 148th Street. "And 30 percent for us? That's hardly nothing from 100 percent. They're just going to draft people into the neighborhood when we would love to live in our houses."
Also in the barber shop was Thomas Prescod, 39, a construction worker who grew up on West 148th Street. "I'd go back to my block in a minute," he said. "There's nothing like that part of Harlem."
Mr. Prescod said he moved out of an apartment at 203 West 148th Street in 1987. But already, he said, the neighborhood had begun to tumble.
Carol Abrams, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said the block was the victim of a "wave of abandonment" that swept through Harlem in the late 1970's and 1980's.
"The economy turned and building owners said, 'Hey -- I can just walk away. The asset is not worth the investment,' " she said.
The city came to own most of the troubled block between 1978 and 1992 because of tax foreclosures, Ms. Abrams said.
Walter Roberts, the department's assistant commissioner for planning support services, described the neighborhood at that point as "very, very scary."
Arson and drugs were major problems, he said, and the apartments were substandard. The occupancy rates were about 50 percent and repairs were done on a piecemeal basis. "There wasn't enough money to do major upgrades," Mr. Roberts said, so officials began to concentrate on finding other places to live for the remaining residents.
Only one building housed tenants by the end of the 90's, he said.
"I think we did what was right for the tenants at the time," Ms. Abrams said. "The tenants who were there certainly have the opportunity to move back. The apartments will be for rent."
Generally, Ms. Abrams said, the department sees a far higher number than 30 percent of community residents return to rehabilitated housing. But whether those tenants will be able to afford the rent is a different issue. In the early 1990's, a one- or two-bedroom apartment on West 148th Street rented to those who qualified for about $215 to $250 a month.
But "quality of life" improvements in Harlem have driven demand for housing to a place that would have been unimaginable just eight years ago, Ms. Abrams said.
"Developers want to develop there and people want to live there," she said.
Still, for all that demand, it was a particularly slow day in the Victory Barber Shop on Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard near 148th Street, where only three customers had shown up by 2 p.m. According to the shop's owner, Osbon Savage, 77, who has been there since 1969, most days are slow.
"What killed my business was when all of them moved out of that block," Mr. Savage said. People waiting to get trims in Mr. Savage's shop repeated concerns about the affordability of the new housing.
"If the people can afford the rent, it will be O.K.," said Brenda Edwards, 40, whose parents once lived on 148th Street.
Tony Rosado, a courier who keeps pigeons on a 148th Street rooftop, said the first thing the city should do is get rid of the rats.
"Personally," he said, "I think that's going to be the hardest part."

HEADLINE: Sales in Holiday Season Rose, Just Barely, Over Last Year's

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
Despite widespread markdowns and a burst of last-minute buying, this year's holiday shopping season is shaping up as among the worst in a decade, industry analysts said yesterday.
The slowdown has come as a bit of an 11th-hour shock to the nation's merchants. As recently as September, retailers expected solid sales through the holidays and ordered merchandise accordingly. But a slew of factors including rising gas prices, a tumbling stock market and a new administration clearly worried about a recession combined to chill customer appetites for everything from home appliances to sweaters. 
 Shortly after Thanksgiving, retailers responded by cutting prices steeply. But even when they were faced with 50 percent off leather jackets at Gap or 10 percent discounts on everything at Home Depot, consumers showed restraint.
"Retailers are going to remember this as a Christmas that took place during a recession," said Carl Steidtmann, chief retail economist with PricewaterhouseCoopers, who predicted that the season would be followed by "less expansion, more consolidation and more bankruptcies" among merchants nationwide.
The day after Christmas, several of the nation's largest chains, including Wal-Mart Stores, Target, Sears, Roebuck and Federated Department Stores, acknowledged that December sales were going to be lower than they had predicted at the beginning of the season.
The International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group, reported yesterday that sales at specialty stores in malls increased only 2.2 percent -- hardly a wipeout, but sharply lower than the 7.7 percent increase last year. The sales looked especially meager after several years of boom times. The news was disappointing across almost all categories, but merchants selling big-ticket, discretionary items were particularly hard hit. For example, jewelry sales were down 3.2 percent from last year, and home entertainment, which included electronics, was down 6.3 percent, according to the council.
Similarly, TeleCheck Services, which monitors check spending nationwide, said holiday sales rose 3.2 percent, exactly half last year's gain and among the worst year-over-year increases since 1991. Merrill Lynch predicted a holiday gain of only 2.4 percent, which would be the worst since at least 1990, according to its calculations.
Mirroring the brick-and-mortar world, sales on the Internet were also a disappointment. Although total online sales grew to $5.83 billion, an increase of 55.4 percent, according to BizRate.com, which gathers consumer information, many Internet merchants had counted on sales at least doubling.
This year, Web merchants were not immune to greater macroeconomic trends. "It reflects the maturity of the business," said Seth Geiger, BizRate's vice president for professional services. "When there is a slowdown in the economy offline, online will feel it as well."
A few retail watchers still held out hopes that a flurry of post-season sales -- up to 60 percent off furs at Saks Fifth Avenue, and up to 50 percent off cleavage-enhancing bras at Victoria's Secret -- would finally ignite a customer spending outburst. But while malls were busy, shoppers seemed to be returning as much as they were buying, and many voiced caution about digging deeper into their wallets.
Yesterday afternoon at the Plaza at Buckland Hills in Manchester, Conn., Dawn Byrne, 34, was exchanging a computer game at CompUSA. With rising fuel costs, she said she still felt she had less money to spend for Christmas shopping, despite having taken on a high-paying night shift at a local Mobil station to earn more money. "It just seemed to be a tough year," she said.
The week after Christmas accounts for roughly 11 percent of holiday sales, according to the shopping council. Still, most economists said that whatever the purchases in the last week of the month, the overarching message from Holiday 2000 is already clear: the American shopper is feeling the pinch.
"It shows consumers are on the leading edge of feeling economic pressure that they have not felt for five years," said Stephen Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. While personal incomes remain strong, Mr. Roach said that Americans at all but the lowest income levels had been hit hard by the drop in the stock market. And everybody, he added, is feeling the pain of higher prices for gasoline and natural gas.
The country's sudden financial queasiness was palpable even over last weekend, which will still probably end up as the busiest shopping period of the year. With a dozen cashiers available, lines at Toys "R" Us in Seattle last Saturday were no more than five deep and customers were waiting no longer than 10 minutes.
"It's been really relaxed and easy," said Joy McGowan, cruising the electronic toys aisle with her husband, Terry, for their four children, ages 11 months to 11 years.
The goal of the McGowans this year, like many Americans, was to spend less, they said. "Last year we went overboard," Mrs. McGowan said. This year, she said, they set out "to emphasize the spirit of Christmas -- love and family."
Taking a break at the food court in Grand Central Terminal in New York last Friday, Allen Balbiera, a financial consultant, said he had been more cautious this year. "I am pretty conscious of what the market looked like in mid-August and what it looks like now," he said.
Consumer spending dropped so swiftly this fall that it left many of the nation's merchants mute or confused. Wal-Mart Stores, which released its disappointing results as part of a Dr. Seuss-inspired poem entitled "Did the Holiday Troll Steal Christmas," had no comment on what went wrong.
Jan Drummond, a Sears spokeswoman, said there were a "litany of things" that could have affected sales, including ice storms and high home heating prices. "But we have not speculated on how exactly they came together to affect Sears," she said.
At Bloomingdale's, Michael Gould, the chief executive, said sales in two core businesses, cosmetics and women's casual clothing, were up by single digits. But he said sales were below forecasts because he had underestimated the impact that the millennium had had on sales last year, particularly in categories like home furnishings and fashion accessories. "We sold an awful lot of evening bags and Waterford millennial flute crystal last year," he said. "And we were not realistic about whether we could match that."
While retailers were hesitating to acknowledge a slowdown, a move that would hurt their stocks further, the market was already taking bets on who would successfully weather a recession. Bonds of troubled retailers like J. C. Penney, Dillard's and Kmart have been trading at low prices for weeks, according to George Strachan, a Goldman, Sachs retail analyst, reflecting investor worries.
"Supermarkets and drugstores are positioned the most defensively. After that comes the dollar stores and to a lesser extent the discounters," Mr. Strachan said.
Dr. Steidtmann of PricewaterhouseCoopers predicted consolidation in electronics and jewelry, areas where sales have been particularly poor. He also said there would be "a lot less new store openings for sure." Retailers have been expanding at an astonishing rate the last several years, leading many analysts to conclude the country simply has too many stores. Among those gobbling up real estate at a voracious pace are Gap and Wal-Mart, both of which had lackluster holiday seasons.
Among Internet companies, stock investors have rewarded Yahoo, which announced yesterday that in contrast to many online retailers, its holiday sales had doubled from last year. Shares of Amazon.com, the Internet's largest retailer, were also up despite the fact that it has not yet reported sales. Still, there were plenty of casualties of the season, most notably the once highflying eToys. EToys, which said that sales were coming up drastically short of predictions, put itself up for sale in the middle of the month.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Comments on the Democratic Party

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from an interview with President Clinton in the Oval Office by The New York Times:
 
Q. There's been a lot written about how you redefined the Democratic Party and turned it in the direction of the third way. . . .
 
A. To me, this whole so-called New Democratic approach was a way of synthesizing our values and our policies in a way that would work. And probably the test of all this is whether it worked or not, and I think that if that's the test, that we pass. 
 And if you look at the debate in this election, to go back to your election question, if you look at the debate -- I remember the first time I heard Governor Bush give his compassionate-conservative speech. He was out in Iowa, and everybody was sitting around on bales of hay. And I thought, this is pretty good; this basically says, O.K., I'm a New Democrat, except I'll do more of it with the private sector than the public sector, and I'll give you a bigger tax cut.
Now, we obviously felt that the differences were much more profound. But the point is that it shows the extent to which the idea of finding a synthesizing, progressive movement that unifies instead of divides people has captured the public imagination.
 
Q. So you think it will last, or too soon to tell?
 
A. I think it will last if that's the only way to get stuff done. For example, if you look at the fact that the Congress is now more closely divided even than it was before, and it was pretty closely divided before, I think that if you want to fight, you can fight, and have a dead-even split on everything.
If you want to do things, I think it will be possible to do quite innovative things in the next four years, important things. But in order to do it, you'll have to define a dynamic center, which is what I've tried to do. I've tried to restore a vital, dynamic center to American life. . . .
 
Q. Your critics say that, on the other hand, when you came into office, there was a Democratic majority in the House, a Democratic majority in the Senate and a majority of Democrats in the governorships around the country. And, of course, none of those majorities now exist. What happened . . .?
 
A. In the Congress, I think we had a combination of two things. First of all, all the Democrats will tell you that we had a lot of older Democrats who represented districts that had grown more and more Republican over the last 20 years, and when they retired, we were going to have a hard time holding them.
And then I don't think it's complicated; I think I got in and I adopted an economic plan that they characterized as a big tax increase, and the benefits of it weren't yet felt, and people weren't sure whether they were getting their taxes increased or not then. I adopted a crime bill which the N.R.A. told everybody was going to take their guns away, and people hadn't felt the lower crime rate or seen the community police on their streets, but they heard the fear. And I tried to pass a health care reform and failed, so that when you fail, people can more easily characterize what it was you tried to do, even if what they say you tried to do has no relationship to what you tried to do.
And we almost had the reverse of what happened in '98. What happened -- so a lot of our people, our base voters in the '94 election, they were kind of sad that welfare reform didn't pass -- I mean, health care didn't pass. They didn't know about, they didn't know how they felt about this economic plan because they maybe didn't feel their lives were better yet. And they didn't perceive that the crime rate had come down yet.
So we were running in the worst of all environments, and I basically have some significant responsibility for that because I jammed a lot of change through the system in a short time. And maybe politically, I made a mistake not doing welfare reform in '94 and trying to put health care off until '95 or '96. And maybe it would have been less. I think we would have lost seats in any case because of the dynamics of who was running and what the seats were and all that. But I think that it was much worse than otherwise it could have been. And it's pretty much what happened to Harry Truman when he tried to do health care reform.
I mean, basically, we sort of repeated the cycle of history. And I just made an error. And I felt terrible about it, and I spent the last six years trying to undo it. We picked up several House seats in the '96 election, and then in '98, when we won seats in the House and didn't lose seats in the Senate is the first time in 122 years that in the sixth year of a presidency, the president's party picked up seats in the Congress.
And this year we did immensely well in the Senate races, because for the first time in six years, for the first time we had a good rotation, and we had good candidates. And because the House was so close, the energy of the Republican right -- the public energy of the Republican right shifted from the House to the Senate the last two years. And I think that's one of the reasons that we did better in the Senate.
When Hastert became the speaker, they tried to present a more moderate image. I mean, there are lots of other things -- I haven't had time to analyze all these House races -- but we're in the position we're in partly because we were going to lose some seats which had been moving Republican when our senior people retired or got beat. But also because of all the things I did in '93 and '94. And one of the things I feel badly about is I think that those decisions were good decisions. I think one of the reasons I got re-elected in '96 is because the economy was in good shape and we were getting rid of the deficit, and a lot of the people who made the decision to do it paid the price.

HEADLINE: A Revival and a Party Transformed

SERIES: THE CLINTON LEGACY -- Fourth of five articles: The New Democrats

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 26

 BODY:
It is easy to forget how beleaguered the Democratic Party was at the dawn of the 1990's.
A generation had come of age with only the dimmest of memories of a successful Democratic presidential campaign. 
 The extraordinary popularity of Reaganism had shaken liberals to their cores, and three straight Republican victories, two of them landslides, led many analysts to conclude that the Republicans had a lock on the White House. Many Democratic Party gatherings were like Irish wakes, filled with mournful, longing tributes to dead heroes and despair about how to move on.
If his critics and his defenders agree on one thing, it is this: Bill Clinton transformed that political world. Whatever the cost -- and some in his party's left say it was too high -- Mr. Clinton restored the Democrats' national stature.
"Just winning two times in a row for the first time in a long time was a huge achievement," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader of the House. "We hadn't had a president since Roosevelt who had done it, and a lot of us had begun to wonder whether it would ever happen again."
First as candidate, then as president, Bill Clinton dealt, one by one, with the Democratic vulnerabilities, perceptions of the party that had become easy targets for Republicans from 1968 on: that the Democrats were soft on crime; that they were big taxers and spenders, addicted to giveaway programs; that they were achingly sensitive to the needs of minorities and the poor but cared little for the problems of the white middle class; that they were more interested in redistributing wealth than in fostering economic growth.
This year's election showed that many of these vulnerabilities remain, just below the surface: Republicans portrayed Vice President Al Gore repeatedly and effectively as a champion of big government and new spending programs. They also pointedly promised a new moral tone in the White House. But much of the post-election analysis has explained Mr. Gore's defeat by pointing to the flaws in his campaign rather than deeper flaws in the Democratic Party, particularly since Gov. George W. Bush's victory was so narrow.
Al From, president of the Democratic Leadership Council, which Mr. Clinton once chaired and used as a launching pad for his presidential campaign, argued that Mr. Clinton's Democratic Party should be measured by the distance traveled rather than the shortcomings of the last campaign.
"Don't forget where we were," Mr. From said. "We'd lost 40 states in three straight elections. If Clinton pulled us to parity in an election where we ran what a lot of people thought was not a stellar campaign, that is some progress."
Stan Greenberg, who was Mr. Clinton's first presidential pollster and who worked for Mr. Gore this fall, said of Mr. Clinton: "He has created the possibility of a Democratic majority. But it's not a Democratic ascendancy."
Critics scoffed throughout the 1990's that Mr. Clinton's New Democratic Party was all about tactics, but inside the White House, the party's new mission was seen as something grander.
Michael Waldman, the president's former speechwriter, remembered that Mr. Clinton declared one night in 1998, while they were working on the State of the Union address: "Roosevelt saved capitalism from itself. Our mission is to save government from its own excesses so it can again be a progressive force.' "
Mr. Waldman added, "We came to believe that the public would be willing to back activist government, but first they had to believe that government had been brought under control."
What Mr. Clinton called "the third way," the political path between left and right, was not an easy journey for Democrats. Even some of his closest aides say they cringed when he declared in 1996 that "the era of big government is over."
James Carville, a longtime Clinton strategist, said he was furious about parts of the welfare overhaul that Mr. Clinton signed into law. Congressional Democrats were often enraged at his willingness to strike deals with Republicans, especially in the difficult middle years of his administration, after the Republicans took control of the Congress.
The question, for different Democrats at different times, was whether the careful repositioning at the heart of Clintonism ceded too much to the right, reacted too much to the polls and endangered the party's soul. But by and large, the party followed his march to the center.
"We are now advocating, almost to a person, that we have to grow the economy first and balance the budget and be fiscally responsible," said Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, often a Clinton critic.
"That doesn't mean you can't be progressive or even liberal," Mr. Kerrey said, "but you've got to give the public economic growth and safety on the street and a defense that's credible. I think Clinton has done that. I think the party is back to being a party of the middle class."
Mr. From offered an even more generous view of Mr. Clinton's accomplishments.
"He modernized the Democratic Party for the information age," Mr. From said. "He made it competitive again in national politics, and it became the model for center-left parties all over the world."
In fact, third-way expertise and the pollsters and consultants who purveyed it became an important export in the 1990's, notably for the resurgent Labor Party of Tony Blair in Britain. And Mr. Clinton clearly helped modernize a Democratic Party that a decade before was committed to a vast public jobs program, tax increases and a trade policy that was staunchly protectionist.
A New York Times/CBS News poll question last fall spoke volumes: When asked which party was more likely to make sure the country was prosperous, the Democrats -- once the party of taxing and spending, "stagflation" and the misery index -- had the edge.
Scholars and strategists are debating how lasting this change will be. Mr. Gore's campaign demonstrated that it was not easy to run as a Clinton-style "New Democrat" and keep the loyalty of the Democratic base. Mr. Clinton's raw political skill, some strategists say, might be a necessary ingredient, which suggests the party repositioning might not be as fundamental as Mr. Clinton's allies suggest.
And there is another, even broader, criticism of Bill Clinton, Democrat: while he was busily trying to rebuild the presidential wing of the party, much of the rest of it was collapsing. When he took office, there were Democratic majorities in the House and the Senate and a majority of the nation's governors were Democrats. As he leaves office, none of those majorities exist, mostly because of the Democrats' devastating defeats in 1994, the first midterm election of the Clinton presidency.
The party has made gains since then. The last election produced a 50-50 Senate and reduced but continued the Republican majority in the House. But the party has not fully recovered. There were powerful underlying trends behind the Democratic losses of 1994, from the longstanding realignment of the South to the complacency of the Democratic majority. But Mr. Clinton, in an interview, acknowledged that his early missteps, notably his disastrous effort to push through a national health plan, played a role.
"We were running in the worst of all environments," he said, "and I basically have some significant responsibility for that because I jammed a lot of change through the system in a short time."
"And maybe, politically, I made a mistake not doing welfare reform in '94 and trying to put health care off until '95 or '96," Mr. Clinton said. "And maybe it would have been less. I think we would have lost seats in any case because of the dynamics of who was running and what the seats were and all that."
"But I think that it was much worse than otherwise it could have been," he said. "And I felt terrible about it, and I spent the last six years trying to undo it."
Ralph Nader, one of Mr. Clinton's harshest critics, said: "The cardinal thing you remember him for was what a selfish politician he was from the Democratic Party's point of view. He lost it all except for himself."
And Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House and the principal strategist of the 1994 Republican takeover in Congress, was cheerfully blunt when asked whether he could have won without Mr. Clinton's blunders.
"Let me give you a clear, unequivocal answer," Mr. Gingrich said. "No."
But for all his flaws, and for all the fault-lines in the party that Mr. Clinton was trying to traverse, he held his coalition together, so masterfully at times that even politicians who hated him could only marvel.
Bill Clinton's redefinition of the Democratic Party succeeded, in large part, because of what Mr. Carville called an "amazing act of political dexterity" that other politicians had tried but failed to pull off.
"He basically moved the party to the center, and kept as his most loyal supporters the traditional Democrats," Mr. Carville said.
In short, he did what George W. Bush is apparently trying to do in the Republican Party.
It rarely looked like a sure thing, and, indeed, Mr. Gingrich, among others, asserted that it was less a visionary strategy than a series of short-term tactical decisions to ensure Mr. Clinton's political survival. It was never easy for Congressional Democrats to parse out, in his actions, what was good for Bill Clinton and what was good for the party.
The tension between the traditional and the so-called New Democrats was a constant of the Clinton era. His insistence on free-trade policies opened a split with organized labor that remains. His welfare overhaul, emphasizing work but also, for the first time, putting federal time limits on assistance for poor women and their children, outraged many on his party's left. (The party's platform in 1972, for example, denounced the very idea of requiring welfare recipients to work.)
He supported the death penalty, anathema to civil rights leaders, and proclaimedhis commitment to putting thousands of new police officers on the streets. And his pursuit of a balanced budget, and ultimately the use of the federal surplus to reduce the debt, led some liberals to wonder why fiscal stewardship took precedence over new government programs.
"In each of these cases, and particularly on the budget, he went further than he needed to to redeem the areas in which the Democratic Party had a weak reputation," Robert Kuttner, co-editor of The American Prospect, a liberal magazine, said in an interview.
In a recent essay, Mr. Kuttner maintained: "The problem with the third way, in the style of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, is that you begin by meeting the conservatives halfway. When that doesn't quite succeed, you meet them halfway again. And again. Soon, you have two conservative parties."
Mr. Clinton's relations with Congressional Democrats were, to put it mildly, rocky. They were outraged at his strategy after the Republicans won control of Congress in 1994, when he distanced himself from Democrats on Capitol Hill, with the help of Dick Morris, a Clinton adviser, in the process known as triangulation.
"We thought it was strangulation," remembered Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and a Clinton fan.
At one point, weary of the administration's tactic of going around its own party to do business with the Republicans, a Gephardt staff member ripped the White House phone from the wall in the Democratic leader's office.
Yet Mr. Clinton, especially toward the end of his administration, was remarkably popular among core Democrats. Part of it was his sheer political skill and his success in arguing that it was better to win and to get things done than to stick with the liberal orthodoxy of the past.
"I never believed there was an inherent conflict between the traditional objectives of progressives and liberals in the Democratic Party and what I thought of as the third way, or the new Democratic approach," Mr. Clinton said in the interview.
The third way, he argued, was simply an effort to break through the either-or choices that characterized the debate between liberals and conservatives and the stalemates that it caused.
"I tried to find some 'both' solutions, some win-win solutions," Mr. Clinton said. "And a lot of people criticized me at the time. They said, 'Well, he doesn't have a foot in either camp. Therefore, he must not have any convictions.'
"But that's not where I saw it at all. For example, I didn't think we could have an economic policy that would work unless we both got rid of the deficit and invested more in education and science and technology."
Mr. Clinton also held a loyal base because he stuck with some of his party's most controversial stands. Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts Democrat, bristled at the accusation that Mr. Clinton had compromised too much of the party's soul.
"What was our soul?" Mr. Frank demanded in an interview. "He stuck with us on affirmative action, on choice, on gay rights, on immigration. What was our soul?"
But Mr. Clinton was more than the sum of his political parts. Rahm Emanuel, a former aide, had a theory that while voters in the center were attracted by the issues, much of the Democratic base was drawn to the man.
Mr. Waldman, Mr. Clinton's speechwriter, agreed. "He's a one-man coalition."
Mr. Clinton was the fatherless son of a single mother, a Southerner, a product of the struggling white working class, a man clearly at home in black churches and communities, a baby boomer, a parent.
Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, said that black voters, a crucial part of the Democratic base, sensed that Mr. Clinton "felt very comfortable in the presence of African-Americans," and the feeling was mutual. His approval rating among blacks hovered around 90 percent in the final years of his administration.
"I hear it over and over again," Mr. Lewis added. "You heard it during the whole attempt at impeachment: Is the president going to be all right? Is my man going to be all right?"
The Democratic base, particularly on Capitol Hill, was also rallied by the enemies he made. Paradoxically, Ironically, during impeachment, the darling of the New Democrats was fortified, and arguably saved, by the old Democrats, including the Democratic leadership, in part because they simply could not abide his attackers: Newt Gingrich, Tom DeLay, Kenneth W. Starr.
"It was the New Democrats who went South on him first," a House Democratic strategist said."They're the people you don't want in the trenches with you."
What does Mr. Clinton leave his party? Clearly, a different image.
"The Democratic Party brand used to stand for a lot of things -- labor unions, big spenders, soft on crime, not necessarily friendly to business, interested mostly in redistribution," said Robert B. Reich, a secretary of labor under Mr. Clinton. "Bill Clinton fundamentally repositioned the Democratic brand."
He has not left the party better off when it comes to questions of values; more Americans give the edge to Republicans when it comes to issues labeled under family values, and Mr. Clinton's personal scandals almost certainly play a part in that, although he denies it.
Whether he left his party an enduring political philosophy is a harder question. Mr. Clinton did leave policies that will, almost certainly, be remembered as Clintonian, like giving poor people more of an incentive to work by expanding the earned-income tax credit and benefits for child care and health care. He left his party the idea that deficit and debt reduction and good economic stewardship could co-exist with the party's traditional commitment to a more equitable society.
"By being actively for deficit reduction, open markets, respecting the Fed's independence, he created the message and the reality that the Democrats are focused not only on equity but growth and managing the larger economy as well," said Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council.
But he did not find a "third way" to create universal health insurance, arguably his greatest domestic policy failure, nor to overhaul Medicare and Social Security for the coming onslaught of baby boomers. Nor did Mr. Clinton resolve the great schism in his party over trade.
Mr. Clinton does leave a party that remembers, thanks to him, what it feels like to win. Even some of his greatest critics on the left give him credit for deflating, with dizzying speed, the Gingrich revolution. In campaigns, Mr. Clinton and his troops institutionalized rapid response and the war room in a party that, just four years before, swore off negative campaigning and then proceeded to lose 40 states. But his any-means-necessary approach also helped transform the Democratic Party into a vast soft-money machine, some critics say.
"There was simply no leading by example by a person who probably, of all the presidents in our time, could have pulled off significant reforms and significant change had he decided to," said Scott Harshbarger of Common Cause.
While giving credit to Mr. Clinton for strengthening the party politically, Mr. Harshbarger argued that he also "corporatized" it.
"When you look at the major donors of the Democratic Party," Mr. Harshbarger said, "with few exceptions, you can't tell the difference between them and those of the Republican Party."
Mr. Clinton clearly hoped for a sweeping political vindication this year -- a Democratic president, House and Senate -- that he did not get. But the election did not spur the kind of soul-searching and agonizing over identity that past Democratic defeats did.
Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, said, "It's clear that the Democratic Party won't ever go back to being the party it was before Bill Clinton." Implicit in the post-election analyses is the belief that Mr. Clinton left Mr. Gore an eminently winnable election.
Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster, argued that Mr. Gore did not defuse the public's concern about big-government Democrats the way Mr. Clinton did. An analysis for the Democratic Leadership Council said that Mr. Gore's "old-style populism" cost him the "new economy voters" whom Mr. Clinton had wooed so skillfully. Some suggested that the candidate who mastered the lessons of Clinton this year was Mr. Bush.
Still, there is an argument that Mr. Gore was hurt, badly, by the shadow of Mr. Clinton and the conservative cultural rebellion against the president.
In a recent analysis, Mr. Greenberg, the former pollster for Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore wrote: "The failure to stop Clinton in 1992, the aborted Gingrich revolution, Clinton's victory in the 1996 election and the impeachment war left the right in rebellion determined to end this era of 'moral decline.' For the ideological right, defeating Gore in 2000 was to be the final act in redeeming the country from Clintonism."
In short, Mr. Clinton bequeathed his successor a cultural war, in addition to a booming economy and a modernized party.
The loss of the White House was particularly painful to Mr. Clinton's most loyal supporters, who thought they were on the first leg of a historic journey. Redefining the Democratic Party, and all the compromises it entailed, would pay off down the road, they believed, when a more confident public could accept the federal government tackling the remaining issues of the social agenda, like universal health care.
Now, they face the prospect of a Republican president who plans to use the surplus and the public's good will for a huge tax cut. It adds to the wistfulness, and the strange mixture of pride and regret, among so many Democrats who joined the governor from Arkansas on his improbable journey to remake their party.
"It depends on what day you ask me," said Mr. Reich, the former secretary of labor, when he was asked asked to reflect on his service. "On Monday, Wednesday and Friday I say, 'Thank God, Bill Clinton was there.' He was a bulwark against the right-wing Republican charge that began early on. He ended, for all intents and purposes, Newt Gingrich's career; he stuck it out in the showdown over the government shutdown and weathered the storm. And he repositioned the Democrats for a much more successful future and presided over a much more successful economy. So my overall sense is buoyant.
"Now, on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, there's a little bit of wistfulness, I suppose. Had we been more disciplined, not tried to do so many different things, had health care been handled more carefully and subtly, had Bill Clinton avoided the reckless engagement with Monica Lewinsky, we could have accomplished much more."

Israelis and Palestinians Weigh Clinton Peace Plan
The Clinton administration expects to receive answers to its Middle East peace proposals that will be qualified but positive enough for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, to go to Washington for talks. The proposals, which Mr. Clinton laid out to negotiators last weekend, call for wrenching concessions by both sides. A3
 
Corruption Charges in Thailand
The government anticorruption agency ruled that Thaksin Shinawatra, the leading candidate for prime minister, had engaged in financial wrongdoing that could disqualify him from holding office. Mr. Shinawatra said he would appeal the ruling to the Constitutional Court, a process that is likely to last past Election Day, Jan. 6. A5 

Bias Attack in Germany
Officials said rightist youths shouting anti-immigrant insults stabbed a man of "Asian appearance" in Guben, a town on the Polish border that was the scene of the killing of a 28-year-old Algerian man last year by a xenophobic mob. The police detained three men aged 16 to 19 in yesterday's attack. The victim, a 20-year-old man, was hospitalized in serious but stable condition. A12
 
Testing Soldiers for Radiation
European NATO allies began checking whether their soldiers had been exposed to dangerous levels of radiation from depleted uranium ammunition used by American warplanes in Kosovo last year. Spain said initial findings were negative. (AP)
 
Rebels May Get a Second Zone
The Colombian government said it was pursuing a plan to establish a second demilitarized enclave for leftist rebels. President Andres Pastrana and other officials met with community leaders in two areas north of Bogota to address concerns about creating such a zone. A7
 
Arrests in Deadly China Fire
The police made an undisclosed number of arrests following a Christmas Day fire in Luoyang that killed 309 people, mostly revelers in a disco, New China News Agency reported. The cause of the fire is under investigation. Residents said emergency exits in the building had been blocked by boxes of merchandise. A3

Galapagos Protest
Fishermen, unwilling to accept limits on their catch, are openly and violently defying Ecuadorean government efforts to preserve a delicate and threatened ecosystem near the Galapagos Islands. The fishermen are protesting a 1998 law that established a marine reserve, prohibiting all but local residents from fishing in the protected area. A1

Administration Drops Prescription-Import Plan
The Clinton administration killed a program created by Congress to allow imports of low-cost prescription drugs. Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, said the program would not be safe and would not save money for consumers, findings that barred the plan from going forward under terms of the legislation that created it. Although George W. Bush said at the Oct. 17 presidential debate that the program "makes sense," his advisers said yesterday that he would consider other ways to moderate spending on prescription drugs, which has grown rapidly in recent years.

U.S. Head Count Due
The Census Bureau will publish the official population count tomorrow, including the state-by-state totals required under the Constitution to determine how many seats each state is allocated in the House. New York is among several states expected to lose Congressional seats, while California is among several hoping to gain at least one. A1
 
Legislation to Protect Sharks
President Clinton signed a measure banning the practice of removing the fin from live sharks at sea and dumping the fish back into the water to die. The legislation, which covers all waters of the United States, provides for international negotiations to prohibit the practice and authorizes research to help conserve shark populations. Shark fins are considered a delicacy in many Asian countries, where they are served in top-class restaurants as shark-fin soup. AP
 
7 Killed in Workplace Shooting
The police in Wakefield, Mass., said Michael McDermott, 42, a software tester, used a rifle and a shotgun to shoot to death seven co-workers at an Internet consulting company, Edgewater Technology. Investigators said Mr. McDermott, who was arrested without a struggle, might have been upset over tax troubles and the company's agreement to an I.R.S. request that his wages be garnisheed to pay back taxes.

Hunt Intensifies for Escapees
A manhunt by state and federal authorities swept across North Texas after law enforcement officials linked a Christmas Eve robbery and killing of a police officer to seven convicts who escaped from a state prison this month. The seven men are being sought on capital murder charges in the death of Aubry Hawkins, 29, a police officer killed on Sunday night while investigating a robbery in Irving, near Dallas. A14
 
Fighting Harassment Complaint
Mayor John O. Norquist of Milwaukee bought a full-page advertisement in The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel to say he intended to remain in office and redouble his efforts as mayor. Mr. Norquist, who is married, announced on Dec. 1 that he had had an affair with a woman who worked for five years as a staff aide. The woman, who left the job in January, has filed complaints of sexual harassment and racial bias against him. A14

A Taste of the Good Life, Served With Gusto

BYLINE: By JOYCE WADLER 

 BODY:
IT can be a delicate matter, asking a businessman about the ups and downs of his professional life, but one thing you don't have to worry about with the chef Mario Batali -- unless we are talking about the proper way to approach and assess his homemade salami -- is delicacy.
Whaddaya wanna know? 
 Why Mr. Batali, the Food Network star with the trademark red ponytail and shorts, broke up with his partner at Po, his first restaurant? -- oops, there's been an 11th-hour chat with his lawyer, he needs to eat his words on that one. Whether he got the money to open Babbo, his three-star restaurant in Greenwich Village, from his wife, whose family owns Coach Farm? (Nope, it was a book advance.) His extracurricular life at Rutgers University? A hundred and fifty Grateful Dead concerts. More?
Here is Mr. Batali, who kind of reminds you of the actor John Goodman, or maybe the only guy you wouldn't mind sitting next to at an airport bar on a long layover, talking about the four months he worked for Marco Pierre White. "The most important chef in London," he calls him. A man of "unbounded imagination."
So why did he work for him for only four months? "He threw things at you," Mr. Batali, 40, says in a quiet moment at Babbo. "A whole pan of hot risotto right at your chest. He's famous for being incorrigible."
(Two phone messages, left for Mr. White in London, brought no reply.)
That scar on Mr. Batali's forehead? Is this a souvenir from his days with Mr. White?
"No," he says, laughing. "That's my near-death experience from last year. Brain aneurysm. I was out with my wife, and I heard this whooshing sound, and my vision was a little funny -- the kind of thing I remember from my recreational drug use in college. They fixed it, but aneurysms are dangerous things -- you can die from them. My wife always uses this to remind me that life is an incredible gift. Like someone could appreciate it better than I could."
Times are good for Mr. Batali. In addition to Babbo, which won the Best New Restaurant of the Year award from the James Beard Foundation in 1998, there are two other restaurants, cookbooks, a wine store and his "Molto Mario" television show. In January, there will be a new show, "Mario Eats Italy."
His philosophy, as told to Nation's Restaurant News: "Italian cooking is not putting together a symphony of nine very strange ingredients, but two or three separate things and allowing them to sing."
He always loved good food. Growing up in Seattle, third-generation Italian, his father an engineer for Boeing, his mother a nurse, everybody cooked. The first career goal of Mr. Batali, who stands 5-foot-11 and weighs 240 pounds, was pro football -- until he realized how big the pros were. He was never one to hit his head against obstacles greater than himself, he notes. Instead, he studied Spanish theater and economics at Rutgers, in New Brunswick, N.J., then cooked in California hotels.
BUT his real training was in Italy in the mountain town of Borgo Capanne, at a family-run trattoria, La Volta. He stayed three years, mostly working for nothing. What great memories: everything was made to order there, he says; O.K., maybe not the ravioli, but you didn't cut an onion before the service started. Mr. Batali returns to the United States, gets a job at a Village restaurant called Rocco, and lives the single chef life: you get out at 11:30 p.m., he says, it still gives you five hours to hang out.
Then one day into Rocco walks a saleswoman for Coach Farm goat cheese, Susi Cahn. Mr. Batali doesn't like her: she is too aggressive, too pushy -- in other words, a good saleswoman. She is also beautiful, which Mr. Batali notices when she comes back to Rocco for dinner one night. His parents also happen to be there, and when dinner is over somebody brings out an accordion and his father plays and they drink Averna and everybody sings. Today there are two sons, Benno, 4, and Leo, 2 1/2, and Mr. Batali sends his wife flowers on the ninth day of every month, because the ninth day of November, in 1994, is when they married.
But let us now accompany Mr. Batali through his empire: Esca, on 43rd and Ninth, where the chef David Pasternack cuts cubes of raw salmon, adds balsamic vinegar and a pinch of sea salt for the visitors, and teases Mr. Batali about getting home at 3:30 a.m. from the R.E.M. Christmas party; to Lupa, on Thompson Street, to taste a sea bass and potato ravioli filling; then to what is clearly Mr. Batali's deepest new love, his salami kitchen, behind his new wine store, Italian Wine Merchants, on East 16th Street.
"If you're a vegan, this is what hell smells like," he says happily, opening the door to a cooler where hams are hanging, then inhaling deeply. "So little time, so many cool things."
He takes out a lardo coppa, a salted pork butt and tries to cut it with his new toy, a $5,000 slicer you use by hand -- otherwise, Mr. Batali says, the heat from an electric slicer might melt some of the "beautiful fat." There's only one problem: the chef can't make it work. Out comes an assistant; the salami is sliced into thin curls and offered around.
"There's a way to eat salami," Mr. Batali says, as a wine lover might discuss wine. "First you rest it on your fingers to warm it up a little. Then you smell it. Then you put it on your tongue and let it sit there for a second, then ----" a happy gulp.
And -- you may not believe this -- the salami sings.

ALUMINUM SMELTER TO REDUCE OUTPUT AND SELL POWER

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Golden Northwest Aluminum Inc. said it planned to cut production by 83 percent through October 2001 because of power shortages on the West Coast. Smelters in The Dalles, Ore., and Goldendale, Wash., will scale back output and allow the Bonneville Power Administration to resell the electricity they would have used to California, where power prices have quintupled in the last year. Aluminum smelters are among the biggest electricity users in the region. Golden Northwest will use profits from electricity sales to keep all its 1,225 employees on its payroll or to supplement unemployment compensation to match their salaries, a spokesman said.

HEADLINE: Evictions Illuminate Issue Of Illegal Loft Apartments

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
The immediate crisis may be over for residents of most illegal loft apartments in New York City, but the larger issue remains: what to do about a growing stock of unlawfully converted buildings and the people who have made them their homes.
An uproar arose Dec. 15 when city inspectors suddenly evicted 60 people from an illegally converted factory building in Brooklyn, citing fire hazards. Officials then confirmed that 120 other sites in Brooklyn were also being investigated. 
 That prompted fears that up to 2,000 other residents would be removed, until Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's office intervened with a pre-Christmas assurance that there would be no mass evacuations.
But rather than resolving the issue, the threat of evictions made the illegal conversions too visible to ignore. And the scope of the problem may be much wider than the 121 buildings that have officially been acknowledged.
There are glimmers of a solution in Albany. By a stroke of good timing, March 31 is the expiration date of the state law that legalized lofts existing in 1980-81, most of them in SoHo, TriBeCa and Chelsea. The chance to renew the law opens the door to changing it.
Some city and state officials are now talking about not just a routine renewal, but an expansion to cover the new generation of illicit lofts that have sprung up across the city, mostly in Brooklyn. The discussions are far from over, however.
Although the Dec. 15 evacuation of the residents of 247 Water Street in Brooklyn was traumatic, the event, by virtue of the publicity it generated, may well prove to be the catalyst for a solution to a broader issue.
"It's almost like when we didn't recognize Red China; it was out there with a lot of people but we couldn't officially talk about it," City Councilman Kenneth K. Fisher, a Democrat from Brooklyn, told a crowd of about 200 loft tenants on Dec. 20 at a hastily called meeting.
Arthur Rhine, a lawyer who has specialized in loft cases for 20 years, said in an interview: "Things are exploding. We've met with several politicians, and things are starting to happen in ways we could only have dreamed about six months ago."
Even before the recent evictions, the loft issue was being reviewed by the chairman of the State Assembly's Housing Committee, Vito J. Lopez, a Brooklyn Democrat whose district includes loft buildings. "We are trying to work in a collaboration with the city and state to consider legislation to grandfather in these loft tenants," said his chief of staff, Diana Reyna.
Chuck DeLaney is the tenant representative on the city's Loft Board, a panel set up to oversee the legalization of lofts that existed in 1980 and 1981, and a leader of the Lower Manhattan Loft Tenants group.
"The situation is reaching critical mass," Mr. DeLaney said. But much remains unclear. "It's hard to craft a solution till you have an idea of what's in play, and nobody really knows what we're talking about in terms of numbers."
Mr. Rhine said the 121 listed buildings were "truly the tip of the iceberg." He added, "I would think there are probably a thousand buildings -- I'm talking just Brooklyn -- and 10,000 tenants." In addition, he said, there are a few hundred buildings in the other boroughs, including 200 in Manhattan.
But the proposal to expand the loft law, which gives legal status to those illegal conversions of two decades ago, does not have universal backing. Some tenants do not want to be covered by it, saying it allows too many landlord abuses.
Some tenants say exploitive landlords encourage them to invest in renovations and then push them out and bring in new tenants at higher rents. "It's a scenario I've seen over and over again," Mr. Rhine said.
Others say they fear that legal status would make their neighborhoods so valuable that they would be priced out of them, or that, if a residential use was allowed, their buildings would be demolished for luxury developments.
Another obstacle to expanding the loft law is that it was intended to be a one-time exemption, allowing the legalization of lofts that had been renovated to meet residential building codes and prohibiting later conversions.
But rising real estate prices in Manhattan and the city's tightening housing market have driven people to vacant industrial space in stagnant neighborhoods. The city did little to stop the trend, Mr. Rhine said. "There are philosophical discussions about what should be, but we're dealing with what is," he said.
Proponents of lofts say they use neglected space, revive neighborhoods, stimulate the economy and ease the housing shortage. Critics say that they are illegal, unsafe and unplanned.
The Center for an Urban Future, a nonprofit research group, said the lofts are squeezing out potential employers. Others argue that many loft tenants are self-employed artists, consultants and other professionals, industries of another sort.
"There's no way to roll the clock back," said Councilman Fisher, whose district includes many lofts in Williamsburg and Greenpoint. The area, he said, had "been transformed, a de facto rezoning from a heavy- industry series of neighbors to a mixed-use and residential neighborhood."
All sides agree that safety is paramount. "No matter how much space or how cool the nabe, it's not a good deal to live in a firetrap," Mr. Rhine said.
While state officials face a spring deadline on the loft law, a different pressure is mounting on city officials.
After one loft building was vacated last year, Mr. Fisher began pushing the city to confront the broader problem. The many agencies involved, including buildings, fire, planning and the Loft Board, complicated the matter.
At a meeting of agencies early this year, everyone acknowledged the problem but no one took the lead or offered a solution, Mr. Fisher said. "No one wanted to be the last one who touched the ball before it went out of bounds," he said.
Although Fire Department officials say they identified the 121 sites a year ago and notified the Buildings Department, that agency said it got the list only recently and acted promptly. The two agencies have often been at odds. Critics say that what really prompted the sudden crackdown was an inquiry from The Daily News about the list.
The resulting evacuation caught the mayor by surprise. He told the two agencies of his displeasure and ordered the other sites reinspected. Teams returning from buildings with the most serious problems reported that none required evictions, and everyone seemed relieved for the moment.
"But now we've got to figure out what to do with all these buildings," Mr. Fisher said.
So far, there has been plenty of blame for all concerned.
"Everybody's wrong here," said Leslie Samuel, a fashion consultant, as he stood outside the Water Street building, where he had lived and worked for six years. "We were wrong for going into an illegal building. The landlord was wrong. The city was wrong for letting it go on, and then for throwing us out without any notice. Now they should all sit down and work it out."

HEADLINE: Is 'Bipartisan' the Slogan du Jour?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "The Nuts and Bolts of Bipartisanship" (Op-Ed, Dec. 24):
Richard Darman cites history in asking Democrats for tolerance so the substantial goals of the Bush administration can be met. I wish he had said this in 1992, when Congressional Republicans viewed Bill Clinton's victory derisively and opposed his initiatives. 
 Mr. Clinton lacked a resounding mandate and so was denied the honeymoon that President Ronald Reagan got. But the bipartisan legislation passed after the Reagan victory resulted in an unbalanced economic expansion financed by deficits that increased the income gap between rich and poor. It also shifted spending in favor of the military and hurt the environment. Now Mr. Darman asks Democrats to support similar goals.
I hope that Democrats will respond with initiatives on campaign finance reform and the environment. Neither Mr. Darman nor President-elect George W. Bush should request a bipartisanship that disproportionately favors them.

Labor Puzzle: As Need for Temporary Workers Soars, Pay Lags

BYLINE: By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
Labor activists say temporary workers are exploited and need more legal protection. Business groups say it just isn't so. The National Labor Relations Board weighed in on the issue last summer, giving temps more leeway to join unions.
 But what about the temps themselves? How vulnerable are they, really? 
 It is an important question because temporary workers make up one of the fastest-growing segments of the workforce, increasing to nearly 3 percent of the total today from less than 1 percent in 1985.
 As it turns out, they are a mixed group. They have missed out on the economic boom, with their inflation-adjusted annual pay rising just 5.1 percent since 1982, to an average of $20,500 today, compared with a gain of 14.8 percent to $36,500, for all nonfarm workers.
 But temporary workers are not necessarily downtrodden. According to the American Staffing Association, a trade group representing companies that supply temporary labor, more than half of temp workers are between jobs and do not need long-term representation. Of the remainder, one-fifth work occasionally because they do not want permanent jobs and one-quarter have stable work and receive the same benefits as traditional employees. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

MARCECA, ROBERT K.

 BODY:
MARCECA-Robert K., 57, President and owner of RKM Enterprises Real Estate Investments Inc. and Kane Realty Services, Inc., died on December 26, 2000 at NYU Hospital in NYC. Mr. Marceca was a real estate investor, developer and property manager. Mr. Marceca was in the real estate business for over 30 years. He developed, owned and managed his own real estate portfolio, both in the U.S. and abroad. During the 1980s he was extremely active in the cooperative/condominium business, having converted over 100 buildings throughout NYC, Westchester and Long Island. In the 1990s Mr. Marceca began buying unsold cooperative shares and condominium units of rent-stabilized and rent-controlled apartments at discounted values and more recently, began acquiring residential rental properties. Mr. Marceca was truly a maverick in defining the undervalued market niche for blocks of unsold shares of cooperative and unsold condominium units. Mr. Marceca maintained relationships with dozens of brokers, banks, financial institutions and private lending investment groups who assisted and participated with him in his many ventures. Robert was born on December 1, 1943 in NYC, the son of Alda Marceca and the late Robert P. Marceca. Mr. Marceca, a devoted family man, is survived by his wife, Nini, daughters Cathy Pilkin, Kobi, Kaylie, Riley and Siena, son, Nico, and grandchildren Kaitlin, Sean and Maggie. His contagious enthusiasm for life, his courage, commitment and leadership will be missed by his friends, colleagues, business associates and employees. Mr. Marceca was also a philanthropist, especially interested in organizations which served children. Mr. Marceca was a devoted member of the Steering Committee for Fight Against Childhood Epilepsy and Seizures (FACES), a charity at Mt. SinaiNYU Medical Center whose mission is to promote improved quality of life for children with epilepsy through clinical care, education, and research. Among Mr. Marceca's many generous contributions to the organization was an apartment for families to use while their child has brain surgery or is monitored at the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at NYU. He was the founder of the Siena New Hope Home, which provides a safe haven to support children and aid them to achieve their maximum psychological, social and economic potential while fully respecting the dignity and worth of each individual. The home presently houses five children at a time. Mr. Marceca was also the founder of the Siena Hostel in Eluru, India, which schools 100 very poor children. He also purchased various supplies for the poor including food for hungry children and vehicles in Brazil, India, Ireland, Albania, Ethiopia and Eritrea. Funeral services will be held for the family on Thursday, December 28, 2000. A memorial serivice wil be held on Wednesday, January 3, 2001, at 10:30AM at the Church of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, 570 E. 33 St., NY NY. Expressions of sympathy may be made in Robert Marceca's name to the Siena New Hope Home, Box 518, New Monmouth, NJ 07748.
MARCECA-Robert K. In memoriam. The friends, colleagues, business associates and employees of Robert K. Marceca are profoundly saddened by his passing on December 26, 2000. After a noble struggle with cancer, he left a legacy colored by his keen intelligence, generosity of spirit, entrepreneurial brilliance and remarkable ability to be supportive of those he cared about. These wonderful qualities shall endure forever in the hearts of all who were fortunate enough to know him. Our deepest condolences to his family.

Technology Issues Down in a Mixed Day for Share Prices

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Technology stock prices fell yesterday, in a weak follow-through to Friday's strong advance. Over all, however, major market indexes were mixed on the day.
Weakness in computer-related companies like Sun Microsystems and Oracle pushed the Nasdaq composite index down 23.50 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,493.52. A rise late in the session limited the size of the Nasdaq's decline: earlier in the day the index was off as much as 80.10 points. 
 Meanwhile, energy and drug stocks lifted the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. The Dow gained 56.88 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,692.44. Merck and Exxon Mobil were big gainers, while the S.& P. 500 rose 9.24 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,315.19.
"There is still some tax loss selling going on," said Andrew M. Brooks, head of equity trading at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. "We are all waiting for the new year. This has been a brutal year."
Barring a solid advance over the remaining three trading days of 2000, the Nasdaq composite index will record the worst year since its inception in 1917. As of yesterday's close, the Nasdaq was down 38.7 percent so far this year. To date, the worst year for the Nasdaq was 1974, when the index fell 35.1 percent.
"It will be tough to prevent this being the worst year ever for Nasdaq," Mr. Brooks said.
Al Goldman, chief market strategist at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis, said "there was some tentative buying in motherhood stocks like utilities and some of the consumer nondurables, but the majority of investors are still concerned the Fed has overdone it, and probably precipitated a recession."
Mr. Goldman said such pessimism was unwarranted. "I think investors are making a mistake if they think the Fed will not be a friend" in the new year, he said. He expects a reduction in short-term interest rates of a quarter point or more by no later than the end of January.
"There are very low expectations for 2001," he said. "I strongly advise investors to be investing here."
With many traders and investors on vacation this week, activity on the New York Stock Exchange was the slowest in almost three months. About 806.5 million shares changed hands on the Big Board.
Among technology stocks, Sun Microsystems fell $1.56, to $30.31. Oracle lost 94 cents, to $30.94, and EMC slumped $2.94, to $65.31.
Yahoo was a technology highlight. The stock gained $1.63, to $31.19, after it said United States orders to Yahoo shopping sites almost doubled this holiday season from a year earlier. Orders outside of the United States were even stronger.
Wal-Mart Stores, a Dow component, fell $1.88, to $50.63. The retailer said holiday sales in stores open more than a year rose less than the 3 percent to 5 percent it had predicted earlier.
Merck led the gains in drug stocks, rising $2.19, to $92.69 a share. Eli Lilly was up $2.25, to $89.94. And Bristol-Myers Squibb closed at $70, up $1.63.
Rising demand for heating oil pushed oil stocks higher. Sunoco climbed $2.31, to $33.50, and Exxon Mobil rose $1.75, to $88.56.

Treasury Prices Fall
By Reuters
Treasury bond prices drifted lower yesterday as traders exploited a lull between the Christmas and New Year holiday weekends to book profits from a powerful surge in recent weeks.
But losses were limited and Treasury yields strayed little from near two-year lows hit last week as sentiment deepened that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates in the near future to rejuvenate a slowing economy.
Extremely thin volumes made for volatile trading, as a pricing error in an electronic trading system sent Treasuries stumbling sharply lower in the morning before the market regained its composure when the snag was discovered.
"That seemed to have been the excitement of the day," said Jay Meany, bond trader at CIBC World Markets.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 12/32 , to a price of 105 9/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.05 percent from 5.00 percent on Friday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 18/32 , to 112 2/32 . The bond's yield rose to 5.42 percent from 5.39 percent on Friday.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of three-month and sixth-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.559	97.219	High Rate	5.70%	5.50%	Investment Rate	5.86%	5.73%	Low Rate	5.40%	5.35%	Median Rate	5.60%	5.45%	Total applied for	$23,238,651	$22,129,602	Accepted	$16,675,151	$14,504,602	Noncompetitive	$1,194,656	$1,018,277	
 
Both issues are dated Dec. 28, 2000. The three-month bills mature on March 29, 2001, and the six-month bills mature on June 28, 2001.

HEADLINE: Hope Is Artists' Medium In a Bronx Neighborhood;
Dancers, Painters and Sculptors Head to Hunts Point

BYLINE: By NINA SIEGAL 

 BODY:
In the late 1970's, while the Bronx was burning, a small cadre of artists gathered in a storefront gallery on Third Street near the Hub at 149th Street, in the heart of a neighborhood rapidly turning to rubble. They put sculptures in abandoned lots, photographed teenagers dancing on linoleum laid over cracked concrete and painted kaleidoscopic murals on the grayest of walls.
The arts scene that sprouted at the Fashion Moda Gallery, founded by a Viennese artist, Stefan Eins, helped ignite the careers of artists like Keith Haring and Jenny Holzer, the radical performance group known as the Guerrilla Girls and 1980's break dancers like the Rock Steady Crew. And it generated enough enthusiasm in the mainstream media for a short while to draw the art world's attention. 
 The spotlight shifted when the gallery closed in the mid-80's. And though that movement has dissolved, artists continue to live, work, and even thrive in the borough. Today, as the South Bronx enjoys an economic resurgence, artists and community organizers in Hunts Point are trying to recreate an arts scene that will draw attention back up to their neighborhood, this time to show off the area's revitalization.
"The difference now is that people aren't being imported into the neighborhood to make the scene," said John Matos, 38, a graffiti artist who exhibited at Fashion Moda in the 80's and has continued to work in his studio near the Hub. Instead, he said, the new scene is more grass-roots.
At the Point, a community center situated between a bank of auto repair shops on Garrison Avenue and a tiny stretch of historic row houses on Manida Street, Paul Lipson, the executive director, is leading an effort to make Hunts Point a magnet for the arts. He has invited dancers and theater artists to use the Point's rehearsal spaces and its theater at reduced rates, depending on their resources. And he has persuaded the landlord of a long-vacant warehouse across the street, the former American Banknote Building, to remodel the space and rent it out as artist studios.
Three new dance companies -- the Arthur Aviles Typical Theater, the Contemporary Ballet Theater and Full Circle Productions -- are rehearsing and performing in and around the Point, developing new work and attracting collaborators to the neighborhood. About a dozen artists -- sculptors, photographers and painters -- and artisans have moved into the Banknote Building.
Eddie Torres, visual arts director of the Longwood Art Project, an arts program and gallery that has been in the South Bronx since 1981, said the longevity of the scene would depend on how deeply artists around the Point could plant roots.
"So often, the temptation when you're an artist is to say that if you're going to make it, you have to go to SoHo or Chelsea," he said. "We want to cultivate the idea that you can stay here and make it here. When I worked in Detroit, we used to have a saying, 'There are stayers and goers.' We want to cultivate a community of stayers in the South Bronx."
The artists who have settled there have done so for the usual reasons artists seek new homes: cheap space and the hope of creating a cutting-edge arts community. At the Banknote Building, artists pay just $400 for a new 650-square-foot studio, about a third of what they might pay in downtown Manhattan.
Pepper, who uses one name, founder of the Contemporary Ballet Theater, a multiethnic dance company that fuses ballet with modern and traditional forms, said she could not ignore the obvious economic advantages of setting up shop in the South Bronx. Two years ago she started a dance instruction program at the Point, and in March she established her company's home there.
Through an arrangement with Mr. Lipson, her company gets free rehearsal space at flexible times. By saving money on rehearsal space, she is able to pay her dancers not only for performances but for rehearsals as well; she is also able to provide a small stipend for travel to and from the Bronx.
"I wouldn't have been able to start as big a company in any other venue," said Pepper, a small woman with an athletic build, locks of braided black hair and fiery eyes. "The spaces downtown are so in demand, there's no availability. Here I could dictate, and I could set up normal rehearsal schedules." She enlisted 34 dancers, including 20 professional adult dancers and 14 neighborhood children and teenagers, for a production of "The Nutcracker" that was presented at the Point last weekend.
Ana Garcia, like many artists working in and around the Point, was drawn by the neighborhood itself.
"Hip-hop originated in the Bronx, so a lot of people want to come here to see it," said Ms. Garcia, 29, who uses the name Rokafella when she dances. She and her husband, Gabriel Dionisio, 32, who goes by the name Kwikstep, established their hip-hop dance company, Full Circle Productions, at the Point this year.
As a group of young acolytes rehearsed head spins and deep back bends in the Point's studio, Ms. Garcia noted that Afrika Bambaataa, the founder of the hip-hop "family" Zulu Nation, grew up in the Bronx River Projects across the river from Hunts Point and helped create the hip-hop movement in the late 70's. He held some of the first parties in the South Bronx to feature break dancing, graffiti writing and D.J.'s.
"He brought artists from SoHo here, and D.J.'s from London up to the Bronx," Ms. Garcia said. "I do want to be part of that history. Being up here, as a hip-hop person, makes sense. It's like a rite of passage."
The first dance company to settle in Hunts Point was the Arthur Aviles Typical Theater, which took over a 3,500-square-foot space in the Banknote Building in the spring of 1999 and turned it into the Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance, or BAAD! Mr. Aviles, who danced for many years with Bill T. Jones, grew up in the East Bronx and said he wanted to return to the borough to "create a dialogue" with his own community.
Mr. Aviles, who is gay, said his main goal was to explore the homophobic attitudes of some Puerto Ricans through his choreography and performances, like a recent production of "El Pato Feo," an interpretation of "The Ugly Duckling," with a transgendered protagonist.
"Here a boy and a boy kiss onstage and everyone goes, 'Ewww,' " he said. "Downtown, people don't go, 'Ewww,' but there's a silent way of dealing with homophobia, and usually it's a way that allows you to talk around the issue and never really talk about it. Here it's direct. And I want to be direct."
Other factors make working in the South Bronx a challenge, he said. For example, when he first began working in Hunts Point, he continued to hold rehearsals in Manhattan because he did not want to inconvenience his dancers. "It made no sense," he said recently. "I made a decision that any dancers who wanted to be part of my company will have to come here." He lost a few dancers, he said, but his company is stronger as a result.
Pepper, too, was wary about venturing to Hunts Point. Instead of asking dancers to meet her at the studio, she would pick them up by car in Lower Manhattan. Now she and her co-artistic director, Chantler L. Townsend, plan to move to a home on Manida Street so they can live as well as work in the neighborhood.
"What Mark Morris is doing near the Brooklyn Academy of Music in Fort Greene, what the Dance Theater Workshop is doing on the Lower East Side, is what we're doing here," Pepper said. "It's a little slower, and it's probably not as visible, but that's what we're doing."
Hunts Point remains one of the city's poorest neighborhoods, and the businesses near the Point still have a ramshackle, haphazard look. With the exception of historic Manida Street, a preserved row of quaint two-story homes, the blocks surrounding the center are mostly filled with new low-income housing developments, pawn shops and discount stores. To get to the Point from the No. 6 subway line from Manhattan, one has to cross a gloomy nine-lane underpass of the Bruckner Expressway where cars and trucks roar by at dangerous speeds.
The Point is a kind of oasis, shielded from the clamor of the surrounding area by large brick walls painted with vibrant graffiti murals by Tats Cru, the resident arts group. Inside squealing children run giddily from one arts program to the next, whether they are learning to play Latin jazz with Angel Rodriguez at the South Bronx Academy of Music, housed in a small room downstairs, or learning about photography in a darkroom set up last year with the help of the International Center for Photography in Manhattan.
The center's vitality both reflects and helps reinforce the slow but steady upturn in Hunts Point. In the last several years new housing has risen in many formerly abandoned lots, and neglected buildings have been rehabilitated. Storefronts on Hunts Point Avenue, the main drag, has attracted new businesses, like stores selling clothing and CD's, and the neighborhood even has its own new credit union and post office.
But while much has changed in Hunts Point since its reputation was forged by the 1981 film "Fort Apache, the Bronx," stigmas endure. While other areas of the city that have been adopted by artists, like the East Village (the once-forbidding "Alphabet City") and Williamsburg, Brooklyn (also troubled by looting, fires and abandonment in the 1980's), have managed to shake off their old reputations, the image of the burning Bronx has proven more tenacious.
"There's still a kind of psychological barrier for some artists and audiences to overcome," said Lydia Yee, curator of the Bronx Museum of the Arts in Morrisania. "Perhaps it is because the images of decay have been so persistent, and there haven't been any other images to counter that idea yet. Those kinds of positive images are slowly starting to make their way into mainstream culture, but it may take another decade or so before that becomes the dominant perception."
The stigma, she said, may be one reason why the South Bronx has had a harder time maintaining artists and art programs. Last fall an arts entrepreneur, Jack White, opened Hunts Point's first commercial gallery, A=I Gallery, at a space donated by ABC Carpet and Home, but within two months it folded.
But Gail Blauner, the manager of the Banknote Building, says she expects no diminution of artists' interest anytime soon. She is renovating the top floor of her warehouse in anticipation that she will be able to rent out the entire building, which had been vacant since 1985, by the end of the year.
"There are a lot of artists out there who are looking for space, and we'refilling up this space very quickly," Ms. Blauner said. "When people come in and see what this little area is, I think everyone walks away with a different attitude. My building already has enough artists so that it seems pretty easy to sell them. If I have a space for them, there are very few people who have not taken it."

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
Plymouth, Minus the Mythic Trimmings

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:

THE TIMES OF THEIR LIVES
Life, Love and Death in Plymouth Colony
By James Deetz and Patricia Scott Deetz
Illustrated. 366 pages. W. H. Freeman and Company $24.95.
James Deetz and Patricia Scott Deetz begin "The Times of their Lives," their scholarly examination of life, love and death in the Plymouth Colony, with a bit of down-to-earth realism about Thanksgiving. 
 They go back to a primary source, a letter written in 1621 by a Mayflower immigrant, Edward Winslow, that, the Deetzes say, is the only "eyewitness description of the events that were to become the basis of a uniquely American holiday." They find that the standard view of the origins of Thanksgiving -- devout Pilgrims looking toward heaven giving thanks in the company of a few Indian -- is essentially mythical.
"In a sense, the most remarkable thing about Winslow's brief account is that it makes no mention of giving thanks," the Deetzes write. What the settlers were doing on that fateful day in the fall of 1621 in Plymouth was to celebrate a standard English custom: harvest home. They probably didn't eat turkey, the authors say, although they drank plenty of beer. There were twice as many Indians as settlers present, and the celebrants most likely sat on chests or stones or logs, not on chairs around what look like picnic tables in typical depictions of the feast.
The point is not only that our concept of Thanksgiving as an essentially American festival of gratitude is a myth. It is also that the Pilgrims are not exactly who we imagine them to be. They are, the Deetzes put it, "a quasi-mythic group of people who are looked upon today as the founders of America, and whose dedication to hard work and noble purposes gave rise to our nation as we know it."
In fact, in a time given to revisionism, skepticism and debunking of national fables, it is not at all clear how many Americans take the semi-apocryphal Pilgrims as historical reality. Still, the Deetzes have written a hard-headed description of what we can know, based on the evidence, of life in the Plymouth Colony during its first century or so. Their book is fascinating on certain subjects: crime among the Pilgrims, their sexual practices, the legal status of women and the frequency of accidental deaths.
On other subjects -- the designs of houses, the artifacts that have been dug up in archaeological excavations and the development of Plimouth Plantation, today's museum of Pilgrim life -- the Deetzes' book is dry, textbookish and of interest more to scholars than to general readers.
What you will not find in "The Times of Their Lives" is much political history or theological description of the Puritans of Plymouth Colony. Indeed, the Deetzes don't even mention the work of such historians as Perry Miller, whose lifetime examination of Pilgrim intellectual life is deemed basic reading by historians. But the Deetzes do show in many ways, from the quantities of alcohol the Pilgrims consumed to the absence of log cabin homes in Plymouth Colony, that the Pilgrims were more flavorful, more colorful, more tempestuous than their religiously righteous images would suggest. The Pilgrims committed adultery (of course, we've known that since Hawthorne's "Scarlet Letter"); there was homosexuality; they were superstitious; and they were litigious: the court records are replete with formal accusations of witchcraft, attempted adultery and defamation.
The Deetzes point out early on that from the very beginning the Pilgrim enterprise involved more enterprise than the search for religious freedom, though they do not discount the importance of religion for many. The original Puritans went into voluntary exile in the Netherlands when they formed the idea of creating a community in the New World. But there weren't enough of them to attract the support of English investors. So among the Mayflower passengers, in addition to the Separatists, who had no use for the established English church, were others who were mainly interested in economic opportunity.
Mr. Deetz, who died a few weeks ago, was a professor of archaeology at the University of Virginia and had been assistant director of the Plimouth Plantation; Mrs. Deetz is a cultural historian and anthropologist. The final chapters of their book are largely histories of American Colonial archaeology, with an account of the project to make Plimouth Plantation historically accurate tacked on at the end. The lay reader will find material of interest here -- that, for example, the Pilgrims ate with spoons, not forks (which were considered a foppish affection until the 18th century).
The Deetzes also make an important observation about the absence of log cabins in Plymouth: "This is yet another small part of the Pilgrim Myth, and as is the case of the other parts of this story, it reflected widely held ideas about the American past," they write, "in which log cabins symbolized the spirit of the pioneers, and how humble beginnings can sometimes lead to greater things."
Despite such valuable insights, these portions of the book smack of shop talk. They are simply not very interesting, especially in comparison with more earthy matters like the kinds of crimes committed in Plymouth and by whom. Examining court records, for example, the Deetzes uncovered the case of Mary Mendame, who in 1639 was put on trial for adultery; her partner in the offense, for which she was publicly whipped, was an Indian named Tinsin. Tinsin was given a lighter sentence because his crime came about, the court found, "through the allurement and enticement" of Mendame.
In short, illicit passions inflamed the hearts of at least some of the Pilgrims, even in the first two decades of settlement. The examples of real life, erotic and not, discovered by the Deetzes give the ostensible founders of the American nation not only a less mythic past but a far more frail human one as well.

HEADLINE: Vietnam's Trade Imbalance And Economy Keep Growing

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE Dec. 26

 BODY:
Higher oil prices have not diminished the allure of Vietnam's own symbol of upward mobility, the motorbike, as the country's slowly opening economy and the prospect of freer trade with the United States bolster consumer demand.
Vietnam imported 1.58 million motorbikes this year, more than double the number imported last year, according to figures released today by the country's General Statistics Office. The bikes, typically with engines of 100 horsepower or less, contributed to an overall $892 million trade deficit for the year. 
 Despite the trade deficit, weak foreign investment, and tottering state-owned industries, Vietnam's government predicted today that the economy has grown 6.75 percent this year, beating forecasts by both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
Oil was a larger factor in driving up Vietnam's trade imbalance. While Vietnam exports crude oil, it lacks the refining capacity to turn its oil into useful things like gasoline for the motorbikes that already clog its city streets. So while higher oil prices have helped bolster Vietnam's oil revenues 70 percent, to $3.6 billion this year, the bill for imported fuel and other petroleum products rose 90 percent to more than $2 billion.
The hope is that exports will get a hand from a new trade agreement with the United States signed earlier this year. Trade experts say the accord, which puts Vietnam on equal footing with America's other trading partners, is likely to be ratified by the United States Congress by this spring, giving a boost to Vietnamese exports of textiles, shoes and seafood. Tariffs on Vietnamese goods will fall from an average of 40 percent to just 3 percent. The World Bank has estimated that would increase Vietnamese exports to the United States more than 50 percent.
But exports are not the only source of wealth in Vietnam's economy, as the boom in motorbike sales attests. There are already an estimated 6.5 million motorbikes in Vietnam, one for every dozen Vietnamese (with each motorbike often carrying three or even four people simultaneously). Yet the average motorbike costs several times what most Vietnamese earn in one year, officially. Bankers and executives say up to $1 billion in cash and gold is saved under mattresses. Vietnamese living abroad, moreover, send back what by some estimates amounts to another $1 billion every year.

HEADLINE: A Park Offers Nature, Not Just Hoops

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
TO sit quietly under a tree. To dance in the grass, play in a stream. Until the recent opening of the Augustus F. Hawkins Natural Park -- a park the neighborhood helped design to include bits of wildness -- these were some things it was impossible to do in South Central Los Angeles. With irresistible symbols that include hills made from recycled Malibu mudslides, residents of one of the city's densest and poorest neighborhoods finally have a park, with an around-the-clock ranger in a Smokey Bear hat and an arroyo with rocks from the Los Angeles River.
"Something we couldn't have, we have now," said Jorge Lopez, who, with his wife, Silvia, was on the neighborhood committee that helped transform an eight-acre storage yard for water pipes into a natural habitat anchored by a giant avocado tree. "We can say, 'This is mine,' like fine jewelry." 
 Any kind of park -- let alone one with an Arts and Crafts-style ranger station -- would be news in South Central. The neighborhood, which is mostly Latino, is perhaps best known to outsiders for the 1992 riots, a landscape dominated by industrial buildings, freeways, rail lines and houses ornamented with security grillwork. A majority of the city's parks are in movie-star habitat, the verdant Santa Monica Mountains. The city's west side, which includes Bel Air and Beverly Hills, has 13,310 acres of public open space, compared with 75 acres for the southeastern section.
The natural park, which local teenagers call "o.g." -- original -- is designed to confound this social geography, to bring "the messiness and utter joys of natural places" to the community, in the words of Randy Hester, a Berkeley landscape architect who worked pro bono on the plan with the neighborhood. The $4.5 million park was financed largely by city, county and state bond measures, including a recent state proposition for safe neighborhood parks.
With its undulating hills, shady walkways and slightly unruly vegetation, including baby cattails along the new arroyo, the park deliberately recalls the work of Frederick Law Olmsted, whose "pleasure grounds" simulated the nature of the countryside in the city. It reflects a growing movement among landscape architects, city planners, environmentalists and neighborhood advocates for natural, ecologically diverse parks that also function as community gathering places.
It is a reaction against the design equivalent of racial profiling -- the assumption, dominant in urban park design from the 1930's until recently, that what poor neighborhoods need most is active recreation dominated by rec centers and asphalt basketball courts.
"In a sense, we've come full circle back to Olmsted," said Walter Hood, chairman of the landscape and environmental planning department at the University of California at Berkeley, who recently designed a small park in this spirit in the Latino Fruitvale district of Oakland. "We're rediscovering the idea of wild, romantic landscapes in the city as a way of balancing social, physical and economic issues."
The formerly foreboding stretch of Compton Avenue where the new park lies, about three miles from downtown, was called the "pipe graveyard."
"This was the most unsightly junkyard you've ever seen," said Rita Walters, the city councilwoman who championed the idea of bringing the feeling of the city's distant mountains and canyons to her flat, tree-starved neighborhood. "Who says wonderful parks are only for the affluent?"
The original plan for the land called for sports fields and facilities, which the neighborhood already had. "It reflected California's fondness for turning everything into an outdoor gym," said Stephanie Landregan, the landscape architect for the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, which joined another state entity, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, in building the park. "What hasn't been given to neighborhoods is a social place, a safe place for people to recreate the spirit, as opposed to recreating their bodies," she said. "That's what this neighborhood said it wanted."
Tom Carter, an English teacher at Edison Middle School, about two blocks from the park, was picnicking with a group of students on a recent Sunday under the cool embrace of the avocado tree. "These kids have nothing," he said. "At night they hear gunfire and mosquos" -- police helicopters, that is, as they are called in a clipped form of the word for mosquitoes.
"The schools are asphalt," he continued. "Except for restaurants and boxing centers, there's very little beauty that's public."
The park's design was a little over a year in the making. Mr. Hester had previously worked with the conservancy on the Big Wild, a system of roughly 20,000 acres of wilderness in the Santa Monica Mountains. He met Ms. Walters in 1991 while re-forming a mountainside that had been graded for a six-lane freeway over the Santa Monicas, which was eventually halted. She saw the earth sculpturing, the natural planting and carefully placed rock, essentially a rebuilt mountain, and said, "I want one of those in my neighborhood," he recalled.
He began canvassing the community with his landscape students from Berkeley, setting up a table in front of Martha Maravilla's M&M Mini Market & Takeout, a little restaurant across the street from what is now the park entrance, which is flanked by massive stone pillars that evoke Yosemite more than South Central. Famous locally for its menudo, or tripe and hominy soup, the restaurant became the unofficial park design headquarters, with blueprints and drawings pinned to the wall beside the pan dulce display. "It was important for the community," said Mrs. Maravilla, who grew up in the Mexican state of Michoacan. "It's back to nature, the way it should be."
The community was given a range of choices, including more typical playgrounds and soccer fields. It went for the greenest alternative. The first priority was to get a 24-hour-a-day park ranger and good security: the residents wanted the park to be fenced and locked at night. South Central is home to at least four major street gangs, and children know to avoid playgrounds and other shreds of unguarded open space.
A close second was a desire for places where older people and families could sit and walk, with benches, like a traditional zocalo, or plaza. They also wanted picnic areas for large groups; natural places for children to explore, especially an arroyo, or stream; and lots of hills, which Mr. Hester calls "miniature mountains," to play in. The hills also allowed for a variety of habitats, from woodlands to fields of native grasses.
"At first people said: 'What do we need to see birds for? The kids want seesaws,' " recalled Mr. Lopez, a member of the Volunteer Neighborhood Oversight Committee. "Then they began thinking of something different. Hispanic people like outdoor fiestas, big parks. Here you can do that, but there is also quiet."
Alma Lopez, another committee member, said: "Our kids don't go to the mountains or summer camp. It's too far to get to nature. We felt we should have nature right here."
Programs will include Saturday morning bus trips to the real mountains, nature talks, tutoring in science homework and a "survival program" -- survival in the wild, that is -- with Ranger Luke McJimpson, who will be living full time above the nature center, which includes a small wildlife museum. The five jobs available in the park -- three full-time and two part-time -- have attracted more than 400 applications from the community.
One recent afternoon, the sun was warm, beckoning the neighborhood to the boughs of the avocado tree. A group of young women had shed their sneakers, just to dance. Children were playing steppingstones in the arroyo, filling their squirt guns in the stream that cascades beneath the glinting windmill. Others tested their scooters on the hills, whizzing past fledgling oaks, marsh grasses and scruffy chaparral.
Cotton-candy vendors, bearing tall plumes of blue, pink and violet, plied their wares, and Maria Jesus Davalos, who grew up in El Salvador, sold homemade gorditas, or corn cakes, from a big silver kettle.
The park -- instantly, it seemed -- had become a living place. Like all living things, it is fragile. "Believe me, it's going to be hard to keep it the way it is," Mr. Lopez said. "I think the community is going to change a little, look out for itself more."
Olee Evans, a phone installer who now lives in the Simi Valley, grew up as a gang member in the neighborhood and knows well the violent dance that turf border wars can bring. He was standing atop the hill with the windmill with his baby daughter, Olesha, looking out from a new vantage point on his old turf.
"Before, this place was rough, frightening, and it could be either one still today," he said. "It's a crosscut of borders." But he predicted that the gangs will respect the park.
"Anything that's change around here is for the better, and this has a little naturalness to it," he said. "It gives you more of a view on everything. It's real out here."

HEADLINE: More Than Just Clutter: Eclecticism by Design

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY STEVENS 

 BODY:
WITH its natural oak Stickley rocker and bench, Arthur English's studio apartment in Manhattan is a paragon of Arts and Crafts style. Or with its shiny veneered 1920's chest of drawers, is it Deco? Wait, with the trendy Danish dining room set, maybe it's midcentury modern?
"I gave up trying to stick to one style," said Mr. English, a computer consultant who moonlights as the host of a public access cable show. "I prefer an eclectic mix of periods, and even though it's a challenge to do it well, right now that look is the hottest look out there." 
 It's official: Empire-style bureaus may be placed next to Eames cubbies, and 1950's Formica kitchen tables will go with traditional American jelly cupboards, original paint intact. Moreover, stark modern plastic chairs may henceforth nestle up to country pine farm tables imported from Provence. So-called shelter magazines are touting eclectic as cutting edge.
Haven't people always lived with a mix of hand-me-downs and new furniture? Of course they have. The difference is that they haven't been told that harmonious-but-fragmented is an official style, one that they should set out to achieve. Besides, how do you really know if you've gotten it right?
People rip out pages of magazines and zip from auction house to antique store in search of the perfect complementary pieces. But designers and shop owners say that putting disparate items together is harder than it seems.
Anne Igelbrink, assistant vice president at Christie's East, said she sees wealthy clients mixing all kinds of styles together. "It's not uncommon to see buyers mixing midcentury-modern pieces with anything from Asian antiques to Biedermeier to Deco," she said.
And it doesn't always work. John Barman, a decorator and designer, says the trend has arisen because there are so many late-in-life couples combining households. He knows because he has seen some terrible fights between couples who, he said, "had sizable collections of English antiques or French antiques or museum-quality midcentury-modern pieces." Someone with an eye can combine those collections brilliantly, of course. But that is often the exception.
"The truth is," Mr. Barman said, "I've seen a lot of nightmare interiors out there."
Dominique Browning, editor in chief of House & Garden magazine, warns that "eclectic can be another word for a mess or an excuse for a mess." The trend may have started, she said, because people want to avoid the tyranny of the decorator and express their own style of mix and match -- which she agrees is "particularly difficult to achieve."
But it can be worth it, she said. "The line of a Louis XVI chair and a Ming table next to each other is surprising," she said. "It makes both pieces suddenly more interesting, and it really wakes you up."
Ms. Igelbrink suggests that "a decorative piece of Nouveau silver goes beautifully on a modern chest of drawers."
Michael Winters, the owner of Brand X Design Lab on East 20th Street in Manhattan, is someone with the confidence to mix away. He has a loft office with George Miller plastic stacking chairs and a 1960's feel. But it also has a 1950's Knoll desk, a Borsani Tecno chair and a pair of Christian Dell lamps from the Bauhaus era. "Oddly enough, it all comes together and works," he said. "At least in my opinion it does," he added, a bit peevishly. And who is to judge?
John Stilgoe, a professor of environmental studies at Harvard University, says homeowners were once well educated about home decor and distinctive styles. There were home decorating guides that laid down strict rules, and no one was going to confuse or mix Arts and Crafts with French provincial.
"People bought furniture in sets because the general consensus was that a room should not be visually jangling," he said. "The trend has shifted, and there are quite a few people out there in search of some sort of guidance. Eclecticism is the answer for many." Rocco Leonardis, a professor of interior design at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan, contends that interior design has been codified since as far back as the second century, making it much easier to achieve status in a society. "The eclectic look, which has become trendy, is not design," he said. "It's collecting, and there's a big difference."
But even if it's collecting, some people have trouble. Deborah Grant, an assistant at a private equity firm, is able to make snap decisions about the financial markets from her office, but finds herself facing a crisis of confidence when she shops for her home. She and her friends are trying to achieve that haphazard-but-intentional look. "None of us want to feel outdated," she said.
She maintains that stores like Pottery Barn, Crate & Barrel and Banana Republic Home are selling the same things, so it takes extra time and a sharp eye to find something unique. "I'm always looking for something a little different because it's cool," she said. "But it's not always that easy."
Greg Wooten and Becca Parrish have decorated their loft in a deliberate mix: a Paul Frankl Art Deco cabinet sits on a primitive folk art rug; a modern industrial aluminum cabinet holds a collection of ceramics from the 30's. "Mixing it up has always been happening in homes and apartments, but most of the time it's by accident," Mr. Wooten said. "Now there is a status attached if you can mix a bunch of different styles and periods." Mr. Wooten and Patrick Parrish (Becca Parrish's brother) recently mixed things up at their furniture store Mondo Cane at 143 West 22nd Street.
Yet Mr. Parrish, too, winces at the combinations some people propose. "Just because you have a beautiful 1920's table and an Eames chair doesn't mean they necessarily go together," he said. "There has to be something sympathetic about the two pieces and then the look totally works."
More and more people are thinking about design these days, says Paul Siskin, a designer based in Manhattan. With the economy still strong, a proliferation of style publications, easy access to eBay and the Internet (where connoisseurship can be cultivated) and increased travel, Americans' level of sophistication is ratcheting upward. "But access isn't analogous with taste," he said. "People need help."
And sometimes no amount of help will settle a couple's design conflict. Someone who wants Zen simplicity is probably never going to tolerate flowered wallpaper. Evan Galen, a Manhattan decorator and designer, says he often feels like a therapist to couples in conflict who think eclectic design will be their salvation. He tried telling one couple that the eclectic look was in vogue. "Unfortunately, when she admitted she hated yellow and he loved it, what she was really saying was that she hated him and he loved himself," Mr. Galen said, with a laugh.
The question remains, however: could a Hoosier cabinet, with its original crackle finish, provide the glue that would bring together a couple like this, her with her Bakelite radios and him with his framed posters from the "Star Wars" movies?

HEADLINE: Regional Trade Pacts Thrive As the Big Players Fail to Act

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Dec. 27

 BODY:
The 15-country European Union dwarfs any Continental rivals, but that has not stopped the tiny European Free Trade Association, with all of four members, from plowing ahead to sign its own market access deals.
The four countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, which account for less than 3 percent of world trade, are intent on expanding the trade network. The group has signed up Mexico, Yugoslavia and the four Latin American countries that make up the regional trade association Mercosur in recent weeks, and is negotiating with Canada and Chile. 
 With 16 deals in place with nations outside the European Union, the group is exploring negotiations with a number of others, including Singapore and Jordan.
The flurry of accords by the 40-year-old trading group is not a European phenomenon. Countries in Asia are also moving rapidly to pin down bilateral trade pacts. Asian-Pacific countries are accelerating efforts to make sure their companies have an equal footing in other markets, particularly with China expected to become a member of the World Trade Organization sometime in the next few months.
Underlying the new web of agreements is not only concern about the neighboring trade giant, but worry that multilateral trade progress is paralyzed.
Ever since the opening of a new global trade round flopped in Seattle last year, efforts to get new negotiations off the ground have been stymied. Medium-size and smaller countries have tired of waiting for the European Union to come up with a unified approach among its fractious members and for the new administration in the United States to set its negotiating course.
There is also concern that the continuing friction between the two biggest trading powers is creating an atmosphere that weakens the World Trade Organization's strength as the ultimate global arbiter of trade disputes.
The director general of the trade organization, Mike Moore, agrees. "Globalization is the word on everyone's lips, yet regional agreements have never been so popular," he said in a speech last month in Buenos Aires.
Statistics bear him out. In 1990, there were 50 regional trade groupings compared with 200 today.
A single regional market "can increase economic efficiency," Mr. Moore said. Such pacts can also help the poorer countries build on their competitive advantages, and increase their political commitment to an open economy, he said.
But regional accords can widen the trade divide between the industrialized and the developing countries, Mr. Moore warned. Regionalism alone "leads not towards an open world economy, but an unbalanced system of hub and spokes, with rich countries at the center, holding all the cards, and developing countries on the periphery."
The trend, however, is toward more such regional deals, with 70 such accords now under discussion.

HEADLINE: Leading Indicators Fall Again, Signaling Slowdown in Economy

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27

 BODY:
The index of leading economic indicators fell in November, the seventh month out of eight without an increase, the Conference Board said today. The drop could be an indication that the economy is slowing more than Federal Reserve policy makers had wanted.
The index, intended to be a predictor of economic activity over the next three to six months, fell 0.2 percent last month after declining 0.3 percent in October. The drop in November reflected falling stock prices and rising layoffs. 
 Except for a revised 0.1 percent increase in September, the index has not risen since March, adding to the likelihood Federal Reserve officials will cut interest rates next month.
"The indicators are pointing to significantly slower growth in the first half of 2001," said Ken Goldstein, an economist with the research group, based in New York. "Still, the index is only 0.4 percent lower than it was one year ago. That is not the mark of any major contraction in business conditions."
Analysts had expected a decline of 0.2 percent, the same as had been first reported for October. Previously reported economic statistics are used to compile the index.
Among the 10 components in the index, 5 had a negative effect and 3 made positive contributions. Two components -- money supply and the spread between the Treasury's 10-year note and the overnight bank lending rate -- had no effect.
Higher jobless claims, slower workweeks, faster supplier deliveries, lower orders for consumer goods and a decrease in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index pulled the index down. Increases in orders for nonmilitary goods, building permits and consumer expectations were positive contributors.
The index of coincident indicators, a gauge of current economic activity, rose 0.1 percent in November. The index of lagging indicators rose 0.3 percent.

HEADLINE: What Tax Cuts Can Buy For Health

BYLINE: By Matthew Miller; Matthew Miller is a senior fellow at the Annenberg Public Policy Center, University of Pennsylvania.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
The buzz in Washington is that education offers the new administration its one early chance for bipartisanship, but that George W. Bush's stubborn pursuit of his $1.3 trillion tax cut could kill such cooperation in the cradle. But the critics of Mr. Bush's plans may be wrong in their pessimism. In fact, his big tax cut could be the basis for achieving a different and surprising bipartisan endgame in 2001 that even President Clinton would have to applaud: extending health insurance to most of the 43 million Americans who lack it.
Here's how. For starters, Mr. Bush knows that in the new divided Congress he won't be able to pass his tax cut as conceived in the campaign. Democrats and even moderate Republicans resist cuts in marginal rates and elimination of the estate tax in ways that shower most benefits on wealthy Americans, even if they pay the bulk of the taxes. 
 At the same time, Democrats are desperate to extend coverage to the uninsured, whose ranks could rise past 50 million if the economy stalls. Even liberals in Congress who have favored a Canadian-style single-payer system have become more pragmatic, saying they're open to such traditionally Republican approaches as tax subsidies for individuals for the purchase of private insurance.
The contours of a deal thus emerge. Mr. Bush puts forward his original tax plan to appease his conservative base, and it goes nowhere. But he can't afford to allow his signature initiative to go down in flames. So, sometime this spring, he orders his aides to come up with a way to salvage it with a compromise that can win public credit as a huge tax cut, but that Democrats will embrace.
The answer they should come back with is plain: Mr. Bush should put a much bigger chunk of his tax cut -- perhaps $50 billion a year -- into health coverage. He already offered small tax subsidies earmarked for the purchase of health insurance in the campaign. That plan offered up to $2,000 per family, at a cost of roughly $10 billion a year. But that plan was largely rhetorical, because decent family health policies cost closer to $5,000. Mr. Bush should make his subsidies much bigger, target them toward those with lower incomes and offer a refundable tax credit for those with incomes too low to pay taxes.
In exchange, Democrats would surely give him some of his original package, like eliminating the marriage penalty and partial estate tax reform. He'll still be passing a tax cut of Reaganesque proportions. But by enabling millions of families to buy private health insurance, he'll also be proving that "compassionate conservatism" is more than a campaign slogan.
If Mr. Bush takes this route, he won't be the first Republican president to offer such a rich health plan. The senior President George Bush, in 1992, proposed health care tax subsidies that, in today's dollars, offered up to $5,100 per family, costing $50 billion a year. That plan was in fact slightly bigger than the one Bill Bradley proposed in his primary campaign this year. Yet in 1992, Democrats, sensing that the president was vulnerable, rejected it as too little, too late. Since then, of course, the number of uninsured Americans has risen by 6 million.
The groundwork for expanding health coverage through tax subsidies has been laid. Rep. Jim McDermott of Seattle, a liberal Democrat, and Rep. Jim McCrery of Louisiana, a conservative Republican, are preparing a bill along these lines. As their cooperation suggests, a potential grand bargain on health care would require Democrats to accept subsidies in the form of tax cuts and Republicans to accept the need to make sure everyone can afford a decent policy.
If Mr. Bush is wise enough to be politically flexible, he can redeploy his tax cut in ways that Democrats and the nation will cheer later.

Fragile Victories

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
In the early 1980's the producers of the made-for-TV movie "The Day After" needed a neighborhood suitable for filming scenes of the aftermath of a nuclear attack. No problem. They filmed at the intersection of Linwood and Prospect boulevards in Kansas City, Mo. Over the past several decades, few things have been easier than locating inner-city neighborhoods that had literally been reduced to rubble, destroyed as if by bombing.
The South Bronx in the mid-1970's was such a nightmare of destruction that it shocked the entire nation. Airline passengers flying over the Bronx on the approach to La Guardia Airport could look out the windows and watch the fires rage. An incredible 40,000 arson fires were set in a four-year period. 
 As spectacular fires blazed just blocks from Yankee Stadium during the 1977 World Series, Howard Cosell told a national television audience, "There it is again, ladies and gentlemen. The Bronx is burning."
That was then. In their new book, "Comeback Cities," Paul Grogan and Tony Proscio describe some of the remarkable, even miraculous improvements that have occurred in previously devastated neighborhoods in Kansas City, New York, Chicago, Cleveland and other big cities across the country.
It's not just the downtown areas of the nation's great cities that are coming back. The ghettos, the slums, the neighborhoods that seemingly had surrendered unconditionally to rot and to fear are in the early stages of a long march back to viability.
Urban issues are among the great unmentionables in American politics and media. But some good things are happening. Mr. Grogan and Mr. Proscio open their book by saying, "The American inner city is rebounding -- not just cosmetically, but fundamentally."
Referring to the area surrounding the intersection of Linwood and Prospect in Kansas City, they write: "Now, after more than 15 years of steady effort, the Community Development Corporation of Kansas City has produced two major shopping centers there, built more than 300 homes, a library, and a senior center, and in all created a bustling, thriving urban crossroad remarkable only to those who remember the wasteland that came before."
In the South Bronx, more than 10,000 new houses and apartments were built from 1988 to 1997. Crime is down dramatically. Property values and real estate tax collections have increased sharply. School attendance is up. And the widespread sense of desolation and despair, which seemed impossible to lift a quarter of a century ago, has largely given way to feelings of enthusiasm and community pride.
These are not isolated occurrences. "Essentially what has happened is that a set of trends that are usually seen as unrelated are converging to lift the fortunes of inner-city neighborhoods," said Mr. Grogan, an urban expert who is now the vice president for government, community and public affairs at Harvard.
Some of the most important factors were:
* The thousands of neighborhood-based nonprofit organizations that have worked quietly but relentlessly over the past couple of decades, in cities from coast to coast, to bring together public and private resources to rebuild neighborhoods.
* The return of legitimate commercial activity to many of these neighborhoods. This has been bolstered by the strong national economy of the last several years, and by the virtual revolution in commercial lending practices sparked by the federal Community Reinvestment Act.
* The historic declines in crime over the past several years.
This nascent revival that is taking hold in so many inner-city neighborhoods is distressingly fragile. An economic downturn, especially one that resulted in significant losses of jobs, could be devastating. Increases in crime could wipe out the painstaking gains of many years. And an erosion of political support for the Community Reinvestment Act, which was attacked by some conservative Republicans last year, would be like a death knell.
The recent improvements in the inner cities are, at best, baby steps in a long, long march. "Comeback Cities" is an optimistic book. With a new, more conservative administration gearing up in Washington, it remains to be seen if that optimism can be sustained.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
A Tennessee shop starts an apprentice program to try to draw talented young people to the field.

BYLINE: By Bernard Stamler 

 BODY:
IT is not a new problem, to be sure: for several years now, executives in the advertising business have been complaining about the difficulty they are having in attracting talented young people to careers on Madison Avenue.
Blame the dot-coms, their high visibility, trendiness and commercial sex appeal; blame a sophisticated 20-something population that has grown up cynical about sales pitches and the people who make them. 
 The fact remains that advertising is an industry where starting salaries, nationwide, languish at or under $30,000 annually, both on the creative and account sides, according to a survey conducted last year by the American Association of Advertising Agencies. Those kinds of numbers are not hard for novice job-seekers to beat, even today, "with a general softening of the economy," according to O. Burtch Drake, the association's president.
So, short of restructuring their wage scales, how can agencies get young people into the business? Many of them have internship programs, of course, designed to introduce advertising to college students. And there are scholarship programs, including one aimed at minority and female students sponsored by the American Association of Advertising Agencies Foundation. It provides grants to students of schools that specialize in advertising, among them the Creative Circus and the Portfolio Center, both in Atlanta, and the Miami Ad School in Florida.
The association has also produced a recruitment video, featuring Donny Deutsch, the prominent advertising executive, and young agency employees from New York shops, who all wax poetic about their jobs.
But there can only be so many scholarships. Videos are, well, just videos. And internships often degenerate into little more than discouraging, low-paying or no-paying "gofer" jobs, according to Ken Sossaman, chief executive of Sossaman & Associates, based in Tennessee. With about 40 employees and $23 million in annual business, his agency is by no means a big shop, even in Memphis, where it ranks "fourth or fifth," he said. But he is faced with the same talent issues as larger agencies.
"I've been frustrated for a long time that I can't get the people I need," he said. "I decided there had to be an answer."
And so he came up with one: the Launching Pad, an apprenticeship program for people interested in advertising careers who might nevertheless drift into other endeavors because of a lack of appropriate training or guidance. The program -- whose logo is a rocket ship -- is set to "blast off" next month with its first five participants, or "crew members," chosen from among 20 applicants from colleges in the South.
The program differs from a traditional internship in a number of ways, Mr. Sossaman said. The participants, who will be paid for working 20 to 30 hours a week, will have "real work" of their own, a project for a local charity that will be their responsibility and that will run in local print and broadcast media when completed. They will also do quick projects for current clients on short notice. And they will work independently on assignments that are similar to the work being done by regular agency employees, he said, so that "we can see what they come up with."
But the biggest difference, he said, is the supervision the participants will receive. Mr. Sossaman has hired Rikki Boyce, a former creative director for his agency and the president of the Memphis Advertising Federation, to be the Launching Pad "captain." She will run the program full time.
"I don't know of any other program like this," Ms. Boyce said, "where there is a person totally devoted to the participants, and to getting them to think differently, strategically."
Applicants for spots on the Launching Pad crew were required to answer questions about how they might conduct a certain kind of advertising campaign, Ms. Boyce said. They also had to provide proof of their creativity, not necessarily in advertising. For example, Jacqueline Daigle, 22, a successful applicant from Louisiana State University, provided a watercolor picture of a costume design she had done for a student production of Stephen Sondheim's "Into The Woods" and a poem she had written. She said she could not wait for the program to begin.
"I am really looking forward to working with creative people who are willing to give other people a chance," she said.
What will happen when the semester-long program ends? Mr. Sossaman said Launching Pad participants would not be committed to work for his agency or for any other agency, although he hopes he will be in a position "to hire the best of them." He said he is also committed to helping them get advertising jobs elsewhere, if that is what they want.
And what if the siren song of the dot-coms still proves too strong, and participants decide that advertising is not for them at all?
"There's always the next group," he said.

HEADLINE: To Bush on Russia: Forward, Not Back

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "A New Look at Russia" (Week in Review, Dec. 24): 
 As an American working with Russians to build a civil society and a market economy, I feel offended by President-elect George W. Bush's focus on cold-war security issues as the means to work with Russia.
Reversing President Clinton's focus on Russian civil society and market reform will not result in what Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's choice for national security adviser, calls her hope for "a more realistic and a more fruitful relationship with Russia." The open discussions on security were possible because of the intensive contact with all sectors of Russian society.
Treating Russia as part of Europe in the State Department, abrogating the Antiballistic Missile Treaty and rattling sabers over missile defense systems will only create impossible conditions for a market economy, increased trade and the protection of civil liberties and human rights in Russia.

Like it or not, appearance counts in the workplace.

BYLINE: By Virginia Postrel; This column appears here every Thursday. Virginia Postrel is the editor at large of Reason magazine and the author of "The Future and Its Enemies: The Growing Conflict Over Creativity, Enterprise and Progress."

 BODY:
FROM Al Gore's earth-tone suits to Katherine Harris's makeup to George W. Bush's post-election boil, the 2000 presidential race was filled with commentary on how the players looked. For the first time, the Gallup Organization even polled people on which candidate was better-looking. (Mr. Gore beat Mr. Bush, 44 percent to 24 percent.) The question was worth asking because the answer was not obvious. Both candidates were way above average.
Critics bemoan the emphasis on the way candidates look as a perverse product of media-oriented campaigns. But even in jobs where no TV time is required, the good-looking have a competitive edge. And, contrary to popular belief, the economic rewards for beauty are greater for men than for women. 
 That is what two economists -- Daniel S. Hamermesh of the University of Texas at Austin and Jeff E. Biddle of Michigan State University -- found in a 1994 analysis of data from surveys of thousands of United States and Canadian households.
Other factors being equal, the unfortunate 9 percent of working men whom interviewers classified as "below average" or downright "homely" made 9 percent less in hourly earnings than did more attractive men. By contrast, the 32 percent of men classified as "above average" or "handsome" got a wage premium of 5 percent. Women took a 5 percent hit for bad looks and earned a 4 percent premium for beauty.
This does not mean the ugly are doomed to poverty, since other factors matter a lot in determining income. The difference between the bottom and top categories, Professor Hamermesh said, "is equivalent to about a year and a half, maybe a bit less, of extra schooling; that's not small, it's not big."
What interests him is why beauty reaps rewards. Are employers just indulging their taste for good-looking associates? Or is there something about good-looking people that makes them more valuable to their companies?
To tease out more specifics about how beauty works in the labor market, in a 1998 paper Professors Hamermesh and Biddle looked at a more homogeneous group of workers: lawyers who graduated from the same law school. The school provided photos of the students, their class rank and law-review status, data on their earnings a year, 5 years and 15 years after graduating, and information about the nature of their practices. The economists then had each photo rated by a panel of four -- a man and a woman under 35 and a man and a woman over 35 -- with a score of five meaning "strikingly handsome or beautiful" and a score of one meaning "homely, far below average in attractiveness."
Again, Professors Hamermesh and Biddle found that better-looking lawyers made more money, especially as their careers progressed. Fifteen years after graduating, they noted, "better-looking midcareer attorneys were billing at higher rates, not just billing more hours."
Within this general pattern, Professors Hamermesh and Biddle looked for differences between subgroups that might indicate why better-looking lawyers earned more. If, for instance, law firm partners simply discriminated to suit their own tastes, then self-employed lawyers should be immune from the economic effects of their looks. But, the economists found, "if anything, beauty pays off more for self-employed junior attorneys than for employees."
That suggests that clients, not hiring firms, make the difference.
To test that idea, the economists looked at the difference between private-sector lawyers, who have to woo clients, and public-sector lawyers, who do not. The results were striking. The private sector not only drew more attractive lawyers to start, but the looks gap grew over time.
Good-looking government lawyers tended to switch to private firms, while less-attractive lawyers moved from law firms to government jobs.
Good-looking people "will go into fields where their beauty is more important," Professor Hamermesh said. "They'll switch to those areas where the payoff is greater." The higher payoff to good looks, he emphasizes, comes from "consumer discrimination," not employer tastes.
That payoff appears to be an international phenomenon. A 1997 study by Professors Hamermesh and Biddle and two Dutch economists, Ciska Bosman and Gerard Pfann, found that Dutch advertising agencies with good-looking executives had higher revenues and faster growth than their competitors had. So attractive executives were not just an office amenity; they were actually more economically productive.
And in a 1999 paper, Professor Hamermesh, Xin Meng of the Australian National University and Junsen Zhang of the Chinese University of Hong Kong found that in Shanghai women in the top 35 percent in terms of looks earned about 10 percent more than women with average or below average looks, other factors being equal. The Shanghai study, "Dress for Success -- Does Primping Pay?" added another element to the economics of beauty: the return on spending for clothes and cosmetics. (This unpublished paper is available at www .eco.utexas.edu/faculty/Hamermesh. Versions of the others are available at the National Bureau of Economic Research site at www.nber.org.)
The economists found that beauty spending did increase earnings slightly, but by no more than 5 percent of what women spent on clothes and cosmetics. Makeup and new clothes were not investments; they were consumption. "You're not dressing for success," Professor Hamermesh said. "You're dressing to make yourself happier."
It is tough to admit that something as superficial and preordained as personal beauty could be genuinely valuable in the marketplace. But the rewards for good looks are too pervasive to blame mean-spirited employers.
"All of our discrimination policies are based on the employer, yet the evidence we have says that there are these wage differentials, they seem persistent, they seem consistent with any kind of theory, and all the evidence points to them being caused by the way consumers feel," Professor Hamermesh said. "In other words, the problem is all of us."
Or perhaps it is no problem at all. Instead of treating beauty like race -- as a suspect category irrelevant to job performance -- maybe we should think of it more like intelligence, charm or musical aptitude. Some people are lucky enough to have it, while others have to cultivate other gifts. And we would all rather enjoy the good looks of others than do without them.

HEADLINE: Bush Could Get Tougher on Venezuela's Leader

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27

 BODY:
After two years in which the United States has carefully avoided a feud with President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, the administration of George W. Bush will probably take a tougher stand against the populist leader, Republican officials and foreign policy analysts say.
There is a growing belief in Republican circles that Mr. Chavez is undercutting American foreign policy by providing oil to Cuba, by opposing "Plan Colombia," which includes $1.3 billion in United States counternarcotics aid for South America, and by giving political support to guerrillas and anti-government forces in neighboring Andean nations. 
 There is also concern that Mr. Chavez, a former paratrooper who led a failed coup in 1992, is distorting the democratic free-market model advocated in Washington by consolidating institutions under his control and setting himself up as an elected dictator.
While there is no bipartisan consensus on whether Mr. Chavez is merely a nuisance or a real threat to United States interests in Latin America, Republican advisers to the Bush team say the friction is increasingly hard to overlook.
"The Venezuela issue is likely to be troubling, or a hot spot in the first three to six months" as anti-drug battalions trained by the United States begin operations in Colombia, said Georges A. Fauriol, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a foreign policy research center with close ties to Republicans.
But the analysts also preach caution. The stakes are high, they note, as Venezuela holds the largest oil reserves outside the Middle East and is America's fourth largest supplier. An openly hostile stance toward Mr. Chavez could do more harm than good.
"It's been a conscious policy of trying to engage with him on a positive basis wherever possible without rising to the rhetorical bait when he pokes us in the eye," said Bernard Aronson, a former assistant secretary of state for Latin America in the previous Bush administration. "His actions are getting harder and harder to ignore. I'm not sure the incoming administration is going to be as tolerant."
Venezuela's ambassador to Washington, Toro Hardy, said that Mr. Chavez had legitimate concerns over Plan Colombia, including a fear that it will bring refugees, renewed violence and an arms race to Venezuela.
"He is a president who believes a nation, no matter its size, has the right to act in a sovereign fashion," he said. "But it in no way is a hostile posture."
Some Clinton administration officials agree. One longtime diplomat who served in Venezuela said Mr. Chavez had not jeopardized the United States priorities of fighting drugs, protecting democracy and safeguarding the oil supply. "All of our interests are pretty well taken care of," the diplomat said. However troublesome Mr. Chavez's moves to purge the judiciary and neutralize political parties and labor unions, the envoy added, "what Chavez did he did on the basis of clean elections. So far he is functioning within the democratic structure."
Republican Party foreign policy experts say they would look to Mexico to help reduce America's dependence on Venezuelan oil, which currently accounts for 13 percent of United States imports. Mr. Chavez has helped in that regard, slashing his nation's oil production to drive up prices; in the process, Venezuela slipped behind Canada, Saudi Arabia and Mexico as a United States supplier.
While governor of Texas, Mr. Bush built a comfortable relationship with Mexico's conservative new president, Vicente Fox, and he is expected to make United States-Mexican relations a cornerstone of his Latin policy.
"We need to cultivate the Mexicans on this," said a Republican foreign policy aide who served Presidents Reagan and Bush. "They could conceivably be a much more reliable supplier."
The next administration is also expected to solidify contacts within the Venezuelan military, which is increasingly uncomfortable with Mr. Chavez, the Republican experts say. Unlike Mr. Chavez, many Venezuelan officers studied and trained in the United States and do not share his suspicions, they said.
Rather than clash directly with Mr. Chavez, the Republicans say, they would favor a quiet effort to prod other Latin American nations to spurn Mr. Chavez and ignore his appeals to regional solidarity. Most of Venezuela's Andean neighbors have already voiced distress over what they say is meddling by Mr. Chavez in their internal affairs, but the most influential nation, Brazil, has taken a more benign view.
"Bush has an opportunity with Venezuela to say, I'm going to deal with the hemisphere respectfully, and to a certain extent, I'm got to let the hemisphere be the judge of Chavez's behavior," said Dan Fisk, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group. "What Chavez wants is to provoke some sort of overreaction from Washington."
The incoming administration will also try to blunt regional skepticism toward Plan Colombia by providing a significant amount of development aid to Venezuela's neighbors, officials and analysts said.
Since Mr. Chavez took office in February of last year, he has seemed determined to display his independence from the United States, a posture that plays well with his nationalistic, mostly poor supporters. He spurned United States flood aid when American troops came to deliver it. He became the first head of state to break the international isolation of Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, when he visited Iraq in August.
He lavished admiration on Fidel Castro, and helped him combat the American trade ban by sending him oil in return for medical service for Venezuelans. He has fostered the greatest increase in tensions with Colombia in two decades, has reached out to Colombian rebels and has predicted that American military aid will lead to a regional conflagration. His expressions of sympathy for anti-government forces in Bolivia and Ecuador have drawn howls of protest from those countries.
He has barred American counter-narcotics pilots from flying in Venezuelan airspace, and he has led the charge in OPEC to force up prices by scaling back production. During the uncertain days after the United States presidential election, Mr. Chavez could not resist a jab at his northern neighbor. "We're willing to help out if necessary," he said.
Such positions play well at home, and some analysts say it is occasionally difficult to determine whether Mr. Chavez's appeals to class resentment and regional leadership are merely bluster.
Toro Hardy, Venezuela's ambassador to Washington, argues that Mr. Chavez has been a reliable economic partner of the United States and has taken major steps toward market reform and privatization that have benefited American investors.
"When two countries have such close economic ties you can't speak of conflicting relations," Mr. Hardy said in an interview.
He denied that Venezuela provides any material support to rebels in the Andean region, and he attributed the concern over Mr. Chavez to "misperceptions." He said Mr. Chavez's five trips to the United States prove he is not anti-American.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Share Prices Move Higher on Hopes of Easing by the Fed

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Stock prices marched broadly higher yesterday even as the index of leading economic indicators, which is intended to predict the economy, fell once again, the seventh time since March it has failed to advance.
With selling to establish tax deductions now largely over, traders and investors not on vacation took some comfort from a report of a late surge of holiday shopping and what seemed a growing suspicion that the Federal Reserve will prove to be a friend to the market as it seeks to prevent an abrupt slowdown from possibly turning into a recession. 
 "Every day that goes by you get the sense that the easing will be quicker and more aggressive," said James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. The cut in rates the Fed has strongly signaled for its late-January policy meeting "could be a half-point," a move that would reverse the final increase in a series of six that ended in May; the first five were quarter-point moves.
Bargain hunting in technology stocks lifted the Nasdaq composite index to its third gain in four sessions after seven consecutive declines. The index climbed 45.83 points, or 1.8 percent, to 2,539.35, just a little below its best level of the day.
This left the Nasdaq, which soared nearly 86 percent in 1999, down 37.6 percent this year. It still has two sessions to help it avoid its worst annual performance, the 35.1 percent slide of 1974.
But individual stocks continued to plummet on bad news. Network Associates, a maker of antivirus software, announced late Tuesday that it would post a fourth-quarter loss and replace senior management. Its shares fell $7.25, to $4.50, and traded as low as $3.25.
"We haven't seen all the overvaluation wrung out of all the tech stocks," said George Cohen, a principal in Cohen, Klingenstein & Marks. He predicted the market would find a bottom in February or March.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average posted lesser, but still solid, advances.
The S.& P. 500 climbed 13.73 points, or 1 percent, to 1,328.92. This narrowed its loss for the year to 9.55 percent. The biggest contributor was Wal-Mart Stores, which gained $1.94, to $52.56. Other retailers also rebounded, aided by a survey by Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and UBS Warburg showing that same-store sales jumped 4.4 percent last week.
For the Dow, the gain was 110.72 points, or 1 percent, to 10,803.16, where it showed a loss for the year of 6.04 percent.
The Dow was paced by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, up $4.19 to $119.19; J. P. Morgan, up $2.63, to $171.63; and three stocks that gained $2.06 each -- Home Depot, Procter & Gamble and United Technologies.
One of the day's better-performing groups was transportation, including railroads. Union Pacific climbed $1.44, to $52.63.

Treasury Prices Fall
By Bloomberg News
Bond prices fell as some investors doubted the economy was slowing enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates before the end of January.
"The Treasury market has been pushed to extreme levels, with investors being fairly aggressive about how much" the Fed would cut rates, said Gary Pzegeo, who helps manage $2 billion at Evergreen Management in Boston. "We're probably due for a bit of a pullback" in prices, he said.
The price of the 10-year Treasury note fell 14/32, to 104 27/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.11 percent from 5.05 percent on Tuesday.
The 30-year bond fell 14/32, to 111 20/32. Its yield rose to 5.45 percent from 5.42 percent on Tuesday.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of two-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
High Price: 99.990
High Yield: 5.130%

HEADLINE: Clinton's Remarks on Foundation of Foreign Policy

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from an interview of President Clinton in the Oval Office by The New York Times:
 
Q. Looking back now, are you convinced that this approach that you developed of using this web of economic engagement . . . has actually worked, and that's proved your thesis that as you engage more economically, you actually do bring countries around to democracy -- this despite the Vietnam and Chinese examples?
 
A. Well, the short answer is, yes, I think it is -- I think it will work. But I think it's a question of whether you -- whether we're prepared to pay the price of time, and what the options are. 
 I don't think there's any way for us to bring openness and freedom to China or to Vietnam more quickly than the one we've adopted. I don't think that either country -- I don't think we have any levers of pressure, for example, that would bring change more quickly. And I think the downsides of adopting a different approach are greater than the upsides.
I think the -- first, let me back up and say my whole view of this period in which we're living is that the world is becoming exponentially more interdependent, and with all kinds of new opportunities and all kinds of new dangers -- that if you want to make the most of an interdependent world, you have to let people within your country have more freedom over the basic aspects of their lives. . . .
 
Q. What kind of time frames are we talking about for China and Vietnam, do you think?
 
A. I don't know. I think, if you look at Vietnam, it was really interesting to me when I was there to see the differences in the approaches taken sort of in gradations from the mayor of Ho Chi Minh City to the prime minister to the president to the general secretary of the party. And if you -- the way they -- even the way they talked was so much a function of their responsibilities and the extent to which they are dealing with the emerging world. I was actually, on balance, quite encouraged by what I saw there and where I think it's going.
In China, I think it's really just a matter of time. If you go to -- as I've said, you've got a lot of different things going on in China. It's a vast country. But if you go to Shanghai, or just go out in those villages -- like I went to a couple of those little villages, where they elected their mayors and all -- I think there's more and more personal freedom, freedom of movement, freedom of choice of career, freedom in educational choices, things that did not exist before.
And I think that eventually the country will become more open and free if we do the right things and they do the right things.
There is always the possibility you will have people get in office in either country that will make mistakes. But I think that the policy is right, and the direction is right.
 
Q. Coming back to Vietnam from a domestic side, were there ways in which you felt your going there and the trip had brought you full circle kind of culturally and politically? . . .
 
A. Well, it was interesting. I had this encounter with the general secretary of the party, sitting there with Pete Peterson, who was a P.O.W. for six and a half years. And he is, parenthetically, not just our ambassador, but a very good personal friend of mine -- we've been close for years -- and a man who is astonishingly free of resentment and demons, given what he went through.
But -- and some of this has been reported, but basically, the general secretary was saying -- he was the most hard line of all the people I talked to -- and he said:
Well, we can talk all about the future here, but we've got to get the past straight. And we didn't invade your country, you invaded our country, and it was terrible. And I'm so glad that so many of the American people opposed it, I'm glad you opposed it, I'm glad the people were in the streets. But it happened, and we've got to somehow work this out.
And I looked at him, and I said, "If you want to talk about history, we can, but -- and it's true that we were deeply divided over the war."
I said, "Most of our division related to what the character of the conflict was, and what if any impact we could have on it."
But, I said, "Mr. Chairman, we were not France. We were not colonialists. We were not imperialists. And people like Ambassador Peterson that served six and half years in one of your prisons, they came here believing they were fighting for freedom and self-determination for the South Vietnamese."
I said: "Now your country is unified, and you are at peace. But you still have to face the age-old questions: How much of the economy should the state control? How much should be in private hands? How much personal freedom should people have, and how many decisions should be made by their families, their villages, or the state?"
And I said, "I think it would be better if we had these discussions looking to the future."

HEADLINE: Ex-Defense Secretary Seems To Be Bush Choice for C.I.A.

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27

 BODY:
As President-elect George W. Bush prepared to name additional choices for his cabinet, former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld appeared to be the front-runner for director of central intelligence, Republican officials said today.
Mr. Bush has scheduled an afternoon news conference here on Thursday to announce what aides said could be several selections. The choices could include Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin to be secretary of health and human services; Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief campaign strategist, to be a special counselor to the president, and Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, to become chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. 
 "You'll have to just wait and see who I announce," Mr. Bush told reporters today in Boca Grande, Fla., where he was fishing with his father, former President George Bush, and his brother Jeb Bush, the governor of Florida.
On Friday, Mr. Bush made a surprise announcement of Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri to be his attorney general-designate. Mr. Ashcroft's name cropped up on early lists of possible candidates, but seemed to fade from consideration because of the strong opposition it would draw from civil rights and women's rights groups.
Aides said that over the holidays, Mr. Bush had closely conferred with Vice President-elect Dick Cheney, who is heading the transition team and has been calling and interviewing cabinet candidates in the past few days.
But even top advisers say they are not privvy to what the two men are thinking about appointments, at least not until shortly before they are announced.
"Cheney's keeping this very close to the vest," a transition aide said.
Selecting Mr. Rumsfeld, 68, a former Republican congressman from Illinois, representative to NATO and secretary of defense from 1975 to 1977, would reunite him with his star protege, Mr. Cheney. The vice president-elect was deputy White House chief of staff to Mr. Rumsfeld in the Ford administration, and later succeeded Mr. Rumsfeld as chief of staff.
Mr. Rumsfeld headed a bipartisan commission that in mid-1998 concluded that American intelligence officials had been far too relaxed about missile threats and noted that other nations could use shortcuts to develop such a weapon. Critics complained that panel's mandate was politically skewed to promote the case for antimissile defenses.
When asked in a telephone interview last week if he would consider a cabinet position under Mr. Bush, Mr. Rumsfeld said, "I'm fully engaged."
But associates say Mr. Rumsfeld, whose name has also been mentioned for defense secretary, has not ruled out an offer.
Other candidates to head the nation's intelligence agencies include George J. Tenet, the current director, appointed by President Clinton, and Paul D. Wolfowitz, a former top Pentagon official under Mr. Cheney.
Lawmakers say Mr. Tenet has lobbied to keep his job, but transition officials said that move was unlikely.
"I had hoped that they would be asking George Tenet to stay on for a while, to take the agency job out of the political cycle," Robert M. Gates, the last director of central intelligence under President Bush, said in a telephone interview.
Mr. Wolfowitz has told friends he is not interested in the intelligence job, which would take him away from his strong suit: policy making.
Mr. Bush still needs to fill the top job at the Pentagon, and Mr. Wolfowitz, along with former Senator Daniel R. Coats of Indiana, are in the running for that position.
But Mr. Coats did not quite meet Mr. Bush's expectations during a meeting here last week, and some in the Bush camp worry that Mr. Wolfowitz is not organized enough to manage the sprawling Pentagon bureaucracy.
Supporters of Mr. Wolfowitz, in particular, have rallied to his defense, noting that since he became dean of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, seven years ago, he has successfully managed more than 300 faculty and staff members at three campuses, and raised $77 million for the school in five years.

HEADLINE: Bushes Relax, Uncontested, in Florida

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: BOCA GRANDE, Fla., Dec. 27

 BODY:
Bill Clinton adopted Martha's Vineyard as his place to unwind, warming to its politically compatible surroundings for golf and dining.
Now George W. Bush, still 24 days from the White House, has claimed Boca Grande, a sort of Vineyard town with December sunshine. The Bush family has been coming here for years, and it is easy to see why. They fit in nicely in a town where it may well be an offense to wear socks with boat shoes, drive around in anything faster than a golf cart, or act impressed by the arrival of celebrities. 
 In fact, the people of Gasparilla Island, where the Bush family has settled into cottages that are best described as faux shabby, insist that they have hardly noticed that their town has been basically locked down by the Secret Service.
"The only people who came out to stare were the vacationers, not those of us who live here," one silver-haired woman, who declined to give her name, said this afternoon.
Then, after she thought she was safely out of sight, the woman wandered over to the split-rail fence that cordons off this island's exclusive golf club to see if she could catch a glimpse of Mr. Bush, his brother Jeb, who happens to be Florida's governor, or former President George Bush. She missed them. But she did see Barbara Bush, the president-elect's mother, stepping out of the Gasparilla Inn here to take her dog for a walk -- or, more accurately, to take her dog for a ride on a golf cart.
Despite appearances, Mr. Bush seems to have spent a good deal of his time here with a telephone in his ear: Casting about for a cabinet, after all, seems a bit more urgent than casting for this island's famous catch, the tarpon, which weigh more and fight harder than the average cabinet secretary. He is expected to announce at least one cabinet appointment on Thursday. But he came here promising to relax, and at times he was spotted doing exactly that.
At nine this morning, the president-elect, the former president and the Florida governor all appeared on a small pier, fishing rods in hand. The elder Mr. Bush was moving slowly with a cane after a recent hip-replacement operation, and he was overheard discussing his strategy for putting his best leg forward when descending stairs.
"Down to hell and up to heaven," he said, leaving reporters to debate, for much of the rest of the day, the political significance of his utterance. All three Bushes seemed delighted that the press corps was barely afloat on a tipping dock that seemed about to dump its contents into Gasparilla Sound.
A few hours later Mr. Bush's boat returned with several good-sized redfish, though it was unclear who had caught them, and under what circumstances.
Clearly the president-elect had arrived in a chad-free zone: While the presidential election ended in nearly a dead heat statewide, this wealthy corner of southwest Florida, not far from Sarasota, is Bush country. He won Lee County, where Boca Grande is located, by 18 percentage points.
"The locals must have figured out how good his presidency would be for the economy," one of Mr. Bush's aides said jokingly as he walked around the sun-splashed town.
Certainly the economy has been kind to Boca Grande: This is not the kind of town where most residents fret excessively about about prescription drug benefits or the monthly Social Security check. Houses on the water -- and the island is so narrow that most houses seem at or near the shore -- are on offer for $3.7 million. At lunchtime today at Jams, just down the block from where the Bushes are staying, the television at the bar was tuned to CNBC's constant updates of the Nasdaq -- and it seemed as if everyone grabbing a sandwich there was paying at least passing attention to the ticker.
The Gasparilla Inn has been preserved to look as if nothing much has happened since the 1920's, when celebrities began hiding out here. Coats and ties are still worn at dinner, even by children. The parlor rooms, decorated with white wicker chairs and floral prints, look like pages from a Laura Ashley catalog. Elderly couples play cards on the portico.
In short, it is the perfect place to assemble a cabinet without anyone noticing.
Except, perhaps, for John Tapley, who definitely noticed the president-elect's arrival. Mr. Tapley mixes cappuccinos at a high-end coffee shop. (There is no Starbucks or McDonald's; Boca Grande has gone to some lengths to make sure it does not look like the rest of Florida.)
Mr. Tapley emerged from his shop on Wednesday to discover that the Secret Service was about to tow away his car. "They said Bush would have to walk around it on his way out of his cottage," he said.
Mr. Tapley did not have the keys, so he sat on the hood, daring the authorities to tow both him and his car. The Secret Service backed off, he said, "until we could work it out."

Stocks Gain on Sales Surge And Hope of Fed Rate Cut
Stock prices climbed broadly as traders and investors took some comfort from a report of a late surge of holiday shopping and what seemed a growing suspicion that the Federal Reserve will prove to be a friend to the market as it seeks to prevent an abrupt slowdown from possibly turning into a recession.
The Nasdaq composite index gained 45.83 points, or 1.8 percent, to 2,539.35. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 13.73 points, or 1 percent, to 1,328.92, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 110.72 points, or 1 percent, to 10,803.16. Page C4.

HEADLINE: Sharp Shift for China's Economy As Entrepreneurs Woo Investors

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Dec. 27

 BODY:
Wang Shuxian, a former farmer who now drives a Cadillac, built his successful textile company with money from friends and family. As a private businessman, he could never sell shares on the country's state-run stock markets. Now he can, in a change signaling that China's economy is preparing to take a sudden turn.
Few entrepreneurs in this socialist country have been able to raise money from public investors without government support, as Mr. Wang was the first to do in September. But many more people like him should soon be closer to realizing the same dream. Absent a political U-turn in Beijing, new rules are allowing privately owned companies access to the country's capital markets, which so far have been effectively off limits for nearly all of them. 
 While the government will continue to play a heavy role in the market, that simple reform could ultimately reshape China's economic landscape as radically as Deng Xiaoping's breakup of the country's Maoist communes did in the late 1970's. With easier access to capital, private companies have a chance at becoming the main engine of China's economy for the first time since a brief period earlier this century and otherwise since the Song Dynasty nearly 1,000 years ago.
The change also has political implications: as China's ranks of private businesses grow in number and wealth, their owners will become an increasingly powerful constituency whose demands the government will not be able to easily ignore.
"The rule of law and access to finance are the two things that will make China's private companies independent from political power," said Andy Xie, an economist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Hong Kong.
Under the existing system, the government, not the market, decides which companies can sell stock to the public. That system puts the power over which concerns get investment money in the hands of local Communist Party bureaucrats, who are most concerned with helping state enterprises in their province survive. The system also encourages bribery and crams the markets with low-quality state companies that would otherwise never be able to list their shares.
State-owned companies get almost all the money raised on Chinese markets. Entrepreneurs remain politically isolated and financially hobbled, unable to sell stocks or bonds or get significant bank loans.
But that should begin to change, as China's securities firms decide which concerns will go public, just as securities firms do in the United States and most other places around the world.
Like most of China's entrepreneurs, Mr. Wang scraped together seed capital from family and friends when he started out 14 years ago. He bought a small textile factory in northeastern Chengde, an impoverished region once the summer playground of China's emperors, and his $6,000 initial investment has grown into the Chengde Dixian Textile Company, with assets worth $53 million and 10,000 employees. He drives a black Cadillac Brougham between rows of yarn-spinning machines to inspect his huge textile mill.
Now Mr. Wang, with about $31 million raised from the first stock offering, plans to expand production and marketing. (He still owns 43 percent of the company.)
And he is confident that he represents China's future. "In less than 10 years private companies will dominate the stock market," Mr. Wang said. "State-owned enterprises are an endangered species."
Allowing private companies to compete with the state for capital is part of a sweeping overhaul of China's economy accelerated by the country's effort to join the World Trade Organization early next year. Beijing realizes that much of the country's floundering state sector will not stand up to the global competition that W.T.O. membership is expected to bring.
Beijing grudgingly accepts that a growing private sector is the country's best chance for saving the economy from foreign domination. Strong private companies are also the quickest solution to the rising unemployment that will come as failing state enterprises throw droves of people out of work.
The transition will take some time. China's private companies disappeared along with all other private property shortly after the Communist Party came to power in 1949. They did not reappear until Deng initiated his sweeping economic reforms in the late 1970's, and they still account for only a small fraction of the overall economy.
Now, once a company has found an underwriter and meets the exchange's listing requirements, it will be free to sell its shares.
"Even private companies will be able to raise capital on the markets," said James Liu, executive vice president of the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
Mr. Liu said the opportunities for private companies will broaden further with the establishment of a Nasdaq-style market in the southern city of Shenzhen as early as next year. This "second board" will have looser listing requirements, enabling smaller, younger companies to raise capital.
China established its stock exchanges a decade ago in an attempt to shift the burden of financing state companies from the country's state banks to the public. It worked in part: about 1,000 companies have listed so far, and the combined market capitalization of the two exchanges, in Shenzhen and Shanghai, is more than $500 billion. That will make the market the third largest in Asia, behind Tokyo and Hong Kong, when China eventually merges its two exchanges as expected in the next few years.
The poorly regulated market is manipulated by the government and industry insiders, and its movement up or down has little to do with the country's economy or the quality of the listed companies. Long-term investors are rare.
Still, with roughly 50 million people trading shares -- more than in any other country except the United States -- and with personal bank deposits totaling nearly $800 million, China's markets have the potential to finance a private-sector boom.
"We wish the market were more for investment instead of speculation," said Zhang Zhuying, a retired factory clerk who spends her days staring at a market-tracking computer screen in the room of a Shanghai brokerage house reserved for people with trading accounts worth at least $60,000.
Companies now compete for the right to list their shares by lobbying the country's provincial governments, which are given quotas by China's stock market regulators limiting how many companies they can approve for listing.
But that means the money all goes to state-owned companies, and there is often corruption. When the Kangsai Group, a maker of Mao suits, wanted to go public in the mid-1990's, its managers distributed shares to any government official who could possibly make a difference.
A subsequent government investigation found that Kangsai gave more than 100,000 shares to each official crucial to approval -- 50,000 to those with an indirect role and 1,000 to any official who asked for shares and might have made trouble if turned away.
Kangsai got its market listing in 1996, selling shares to the public for about $1.33 each. The stock's price quickly surged to $3.61, and dozens of officials became rich selling their shares.
But Kangsai's outdated business ran into trouble as soon as the company had used up its cash. Today, the company is laboring under huge debt, and the stock is trading around $1.50. Several of the officials involved are in jail.
The result of such cases is a stock market larded with sluggish, barely profitable state companies, some with managers who have little idea what to do with the money they have raised. In some cases, the money has gone to pay workers' salaries or simply been lent to other cash-short enterprises at exorbitant rates of return.
Mr. Liu is pushing for the existing stock markets' listing quotas to be used up as soon as possible, so the new rules opening the market to private companies can take effect as soon as possible. "In nine months, the current quotas will be gone," he said.
Even with the expected changes, the state will have plenty of opportunities to steer the system.
China's regulators will continue to control the market in many ways. Earlier this month, they arranged the bailout of the Zhengzhou Baiwen Company, an insolvent state-owned department store operator and wholesaler of household appliances, because they feared that if the company went bankrupt it would frighten investors, set off a market rout and ruin the chances of other low-quality state-owned enterprises to sell shares.
That kind of government manipulation has led to an increasingly dangerous stock market bubble. Despite the low quality of China's listed companies and the poor performance of other Asian markets this year, China's stock market has rocketed higher the last 12 months.
More dud companies. meanwhile, will list on the stock market before the quota system expires. Imminent listings include Gansu Jiugang Group Hongxing Iron and Steel, a remote state-owned enterprise in a glutted industry, and Inner Mongolia Lantai Industrial, a salt maker.
And giving the securities industry the power to decide who has access to capital will not solve all the problems. Securities firms in China are still all state-owned and could be subject to political pressure in picking clients.
The underwriters will also have the power to price initial offerings well below prevailing market prices, as all new shares are priced now. The artificially low pricing ensures that shares surge in early trading, allowing substandard companies to raise capital by selling shares.
Nor will corruption disappear. Bribery and cronyism have allowed low-quality companies to issue shares on exchanges in countries in which there is much less government involvement, from Hong Kong to the United States.
But if underwriters do pick prospective listing candidates on the basis of economics, not politics, China's economic revolution will be under way.
Already, the quota system has expired in the so-called B-share market, where shares are denominated in foreign currencies and intended for foreign investors. (Because of China's tight exchange control rules, foreigners are not allowed to invest in the much larger A-share market, denominated in Chinese yuan.)
Mr. Wang was the first private businessman to test the new rules by issuing B shares.
"It took us about a year, but we didn't have to go through the complicated quota approval process," he said recently. "We went public on the basis of our business, not connections."

HEADLINE: Thousands of Bradlees Workers to Lose Jobs in Shutdown

BYLINE: By EUN LEE KOH 

 BODY:
As the regional discount retailer Bradlees prepares to close its doors within the next two months, 4,700 employees in 54 of its stores in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut will soon find themselves without jobs.
Bradlees Inc. announced Tuesday that it had filed for bankruptcy protection and would sell its inventory to a group headed by Gordon Brothers Retail Partners L.L.C. of Boston. 
 The chain has 51 other stores in Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, and employs 9,800 people.
Company officials said a judge in United States Bankruptcy Court had approved severance pay for its employees, who would get at least two weeks' pay. Sales employees may continue to work for up to two months, until all the stores are shut.
Retail analysts said it was likely that other discount chains, like Kmart, Wal-Mart and Target, would take over Bradlees' stores.
"The empty stores will be extremely attractive for some of those discount stores looking to expand their market," said Eric Beder, a retail analyst for Ladenburg Thalmann.
Officials of Kmart, Wal-Mart and Target declined to comment.
Bradlees had been struggling financially for the last five years. The company operated under bankruptcy protection from 1995 to early 1999.
When a regional competitor, Caldor, closed in 1999, Bradlees enjoyed a slight upswing, but company officials said it was not enough to keep the stores open. They said Bradlees could not hold out against rival stores and a slowdown in consumer spending. The company said that higher gas and heating oil prices had reduced its customers' disposable incomes.
Bradlees' demise was in part a result of the chain's inability to create its own identity, according to retail analysts. As competitors like Target employed flashy advertising campaigns and retailers like Kmart signed on Martha Stewart, the doyenne of home decor, to create her own label for the company, Bradlees lagged behind.
"Bradlees was a good discount store, but beyond that, there was not much there," said Kurt Barnard, the president of Barnard Retail Consulting Group, a company that examines and forecasts trends in the retail market. "Kmart has Martha Stewart. Wal-Mart is known for having the lowest prices. How do you beat that?"
The chain's Manhattan store, in Union Square, is considered a prime retail site.
Real estate brokers said the Bradlees store at that location had suffered from the increasing feeling that Union Square was no longer an area for bargains and discounts. As neighborhoods surrounding the area, like Chelsea and Gramercy Park, have expanded and become more upscale, full-priced retailers have slowly moved in and edged discount stores out.
"Discount stores have become more of an exception than the rule," said Benjamin Fox, the executive vice president of Newmark New Spectrum Retail L.L.C., a New York brokerage firm. "Bradlees had some trouble adapting to the rapidly changing neighborhood."
Arthur W. Strickler, the district manager of Community Board 2 in Manhattan, which encompasses Union Square, said that the area had changed and that the Bradlees store did not "really fit with the image of the neighborhood anymore."
Unlike Bradlees stores in other parts of the Northeast, the one in Union Square, on the south side of 14th Street west of Broadway, is more likely to be replaced by an office building or several smaller upscale stores rather than another discount store, Mr. Fox said.

HEADLINE: In Ice-Coated Arkansas and Oklahoma, Chaos Rules

BYLINE: BY STEVE BARNES 

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 27

 BODY:
Struggling for balance after the second sweeping ice storm in as many weeks, Arkansas and Oklahoma looked to the heavens and the Weather Channel for relief today. The former offered only gray skies, but the latter suggested that Thursday could bring at least temporary sunshine and temperatures well above freezing.
Both states will need plenty of both. A Christmas night barrage of sleet and freezing rain robbed more than 500,000 people of electricity and other basic services and brought much of the region's commercial life to an abrupt halt. 
 "We've got chaos on a grand scale," said Jennifer F. Gordon of the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management.
Gov. Mike Huckabee declared 29 Arkansas counties disaster areas. The situation was much the same in neighboring Oklahoma, which Gov. Frank Keating declared a disaster area today as 120,000 people waited for power to be restored.
Slick streets and highways made driving potentially lethal throughout the region. In Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas, the National Guard was called out to help people reach shelters and to search the highways for disabled vehicles.
In the Texas Panhandle, where Amarillo received more than a foot of snow on Tuesday, thousands of travelers were still stranded today as snow continued to fall.
The authorities estimated that 16 people had been killed in traffic accidents and other events related to the winter weather across the nation's southern midsection.
The storm shut down air travel throughout the region in one of the year's busiest travel seasons. The Little Rock airport, closed since Monday, reopened one of three runways this afternoon. American Airlines canceled 738 flights on Tuesday at the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport and another 73 today.
In Texas and Louisiana, up to 156,000 people were without electricity today. The number of homes and businesses in Arkansas without power reached 400,000 at one point in the day, but by this evening the number had fallen to about 270,000.
Entergy Corporation, the largest provider of power in Arkansas, said that it had more than 6,000 repair personnel, many recruited from surrounding states, at work on repairs, but cautioned that service, especially in more rural areas, might not be restored for several days.
Power lines that had been repaired only days ago were brought down yet again by large tree limbs coated with ice, cutting the current and blocking traffic on streets and highways. Towering oaks and magnolias in the most affluent neighborhoods of Little Rock were among those falling victim to the storm. In some places, the night was pierced by the blue-white flash of exploding transformers as utility poles snapped under the burden.
Most government buildings in central and southwest Arkansas were closed today, but at least some of the grocery stores that were shuttered reopened today.
From the Ozark Mountains of northwest Arkansas to its southern timberlands and east to the Mississippi delta, residents of the state were coping as best they could, relying on hundreds of National Guardsmen and other emergency services personnel to help them reach sanctuary. More than 50 shelters were opened in Arkansas by the Red Cross and other nonprofit organizations, utilizing churches and National Guard armories.
Interstate highways through Arkansas began to clear at mid-day, although bridges and overpasses remained treacherous and authorities urged travel only if necessary.
The situation was at crisis levels in several southwest Arkansas counties that had no power for a second day today. The loss of electricity shut down water and sewage pumping stations in a number of small towns near Texarkana, and telephone service was often intermittent and in some cases nonexistent.
Hot Springs, Ark., fabled for its curative mineral water, was without it today, its pumps lifeless for want of power.
The storm was fueled in part by warm moist air rushing north into the region, where it met a layer of cold air trapped near the ground. In McAlester, Okla., this afternoon, the mixture created a rare thunderstorm of falling ice. Icy conditions were expected in the southern Appalachians today as the storm system moved east.
Governor Huckabee of Arkansas said the economic impact of the back-to-back storms would be huge.
"We're losing a lot of commerce right now and that's going to have a big impact in terms of tax revenue, although I don't think it can be measured yet," Mr. Huckabee said.
James Lee Witt, the Arkansan who is director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was at his Yell County home for the holidays "and still is, without electricity or water," Mr. Huckabee said.
"James has promised to expedite all our requests for federal assistance," said Mr. Huckabee from the governor's mansion in Little Rock, which lacked power and telephone service for 24 hours until Wednesday afternoon.
The two spoke by cell phone.

UNION PACIFIC PLANNING TO CUT ABOUT 2,000 JOBS

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Union Pacific Corporation said yesterday that it would cut 2,000 management and union jobs, or 4 percent of its work force, early next year and take a $70 million charge as fourth-quarter profit falls short of analysts' forecasts. The railroad company based in Omaha, said it would earn 87 to 90 cents in the quarter, less than the average estimate of 93 cents in a First Call/Thomson Financial analyst poll. Union Pacific and other railroads have reported declining shipments of chemicals, grain and other products in December as the United States economy slows.

EXECUTIVES SPLIT ON 2001 OUTLOOK

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Business executives in Connecticut are divided in predicting how their own companies and others in the state will perform next year, according to a quarterly economic survey by the Connecticut Business and Industry Association. About half of the executives who responded said they expected Connecticut's economic performance to remain stable, while 16 percent said they expected it to improve and 32 percent said they expected it to worsen. When it came to their own companies, 51 percent of the executives said they expected to do better in 2001, 32 percent expected stability and 16 percent expected their firms' performance to decline, the survey found. "The outlook for the new year is the most sobering we've seen in quite some time," said Peter M. Gioia, an economist for the association. "Yet despite the newfound caution, there is positive news regarding exports and continued anticipated growth in production and sales." The survey had 342 respondents, a 17.1 percent response rate, and a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points.

HEADLINE: Economic Engine for Foreign Policy

SERIES: THE CLINTON LEGACY -- Last of five articles: A New World View

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
There arrived a moment in his presidency when Bill Clinton's view of America's role in the world grew up in a hurry.
It came on a frigid January day in 1995. Robert E. Rubin, who had just been sworn in as treasury secretary, followed Mr. Clinton into the Oval Office to deliver some bleak news. 
 "Bob came in and essentially told us that Mexico had 48 hours to live," recalled Samuel R. Berger, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser.
Mexico was facing economic implosion, the result of a dive in the value of the peso after years of financial mismanagement and corruption. Foreign investors were fleeing, and the State Department had warned of unrest and a flood of illegal immigrants to the United States.
Someone asked how much a bailout would cost.
"We said $25 billion," recalled Lawrence H. Summers, then a senior treasury official and later Mr. Rubin's successor. "One of the political guys in the room said, 'You mean $25 million, don't you?' No, we repeated, it was billion with a 'B.' And then there was a chorus of, 'This could cost you the election.' "
It did not. Mr. Clinton sidestepped an angry Congress to raise the money. The bailout worked, and Mexico repaid the loans, plus a billion dollars in interest. Rightly or wrongly, Mr. Clinton and his aides contend, the reforms they demanded from Mexico in exchange for the money helped democracy flourish.
In retrospect, Mexico was the test for what became the signature change in American foreign policy.
To deal with a world no longer dominated by nuclear rivalries, Mr. Clinton would place a brand of economic diplomacy at the core of his foreign policy. The man who came to office criticizing President George Bush for putting commerce ahead of human rights ended up arguing, quite passionately, that the spread of American-style capitalism would eventually help spread American-style democracy. Particularly after his re-election in 1996, Mr. Clinton supported the use of economic enticements to bring about political change, including lifting cold war embargoes, signing more than 300 trade agreements and even teaching countries the basics of contract law.
Whether he was in an Irish village, a Vietnamese industrial park or at Beijing University, the message was the same: Prosperity would create choices, choices would lead to a demand for information, and that information, provided at the speed of the Internet, would bring political change. In time, perhaps, dictatorships and one-party rule would fall.
Mr. Clinton will leave office with the experiment under way but the thesis unproven. Some of the fledgling successes he has nudged along, like Poland and South Korea, were well along the path before he came to office. Others that began the trip toward democracy have since floundered. A case in point is Indonesia, where an economic collapse ousted a dictator but then plunged the country deeper and deeper into chaos.
At moments it seemed that Mr. Clinton's approach would backfire at home. For a few scary months in 1998, the financial crises in Asia and Russia seemed to put the world at risk of an economic meltdown. The danger faded, but even today, there is a sense of precariousness in the world economy, with the American economy slowing while Japan remains in a recession.
His boldest experiments at using economic incentives to achieve democratic reforms have been in China and Russia. Critics have called them failures, but the administration has argued that the verdict is still out.
In China, the market economy has flourished, and state-owned enterprises are changing or have closed. For his part, Mr. Clinton wants to be remembered as the man who pushed China toward capitalism, just as President Richard M. Nixon is remembered for opening links to China and President Jimmy Carter for normalizing relations. In 1999, Mr. Clinton first rejected, and later signed, an accord in which China agreed to open its markets to foreign imports in return for entry into the World Trade Organization.
Mr. Clinton argued that the accord would spark political openness, but in Beijing, leaders believe they can enjoy the benefits of market reform without loosening their political grip, and by some accounts, they have imprisoned more dissenters than during the Tiananmen crackdown.
In Russia, where Mr. Clinton had the most at stake and may have been the most naive, democracy came before Western-style capitalism, and the capitalism that took root -- after the Americans pressed for speedy privatization -- was of the crony kind.
Now Russia's inability to compete appeared to be causing a return to the days of central control and sporadic challenges to American power.
Mr. Clinton arrived in Washington before globalization had become a buzzword. And while he had talked about using economic levers to change the behavior of nations in the post-cold-war order -- most notably in a speech at Georgetown University in 1991 that became the template for his plan -- his initial strategy was far simpler, and more mercantile.
Job No. 1 was using diplomatic power to open markets for American goods, helping to create jobs and lift the United States out of a recession. But in his zeal for free trade, he was at odds with most of the Democratic Party.
His first struggle, winning passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, alienated labor unions and others who had voted for him and who feared that any free-trade agreement would drain jobs from the United States.
The struggle set the stage for others: Mr. Clinton set up a war room, lobbied interest groups, cut deals with members of Congress and exaggerated the benefits for American workers.
The next year, he used the same strategy to win passage of the largest global trade deal in history, establishing the W.T.O. as the arbiter of world trade.
But the political cost was high. Mr. Clinton had further alienated the unions, and in a recent interview, he admitted that he was never able to persuade most Democrats to support his approach. Traditional Democrats struck back by denying Mr. Clinton the authority to negotiate trade accords that Congress could not alter. Labor and environmental groups got even five years later in Seattle by sinking his next major trade initiative.
Mr. Clinton also used the threat of economic retaliation to get Japan to open its markets in what proved to be partly successful. The move was a departure from the cold war stance of his predecessors, who had regarded Japan as first and foremost an ally against the Soviet Union. Many in the State Department and the National Security Council were concerned that such pressure would damage the United States' relationship with Japan, and Japanese bureaucrats fanned those fears.
"There was always a tension between mercantile diplomacy and economic diplomacy," said Mr. Summers, the treasury official.
The administration's biggest victory with Japan was an automobile accord in which Japan -- under threat that Mr. Clinton would block imports of Japanese luxury cars -- agreed to allow in American cars and parts. But Japan's sinking economy made much of the agreement worthless.
In the end, the mercantile phase petered out.
"People looked and said, 'How much are we getting for this?' " said one senior official who had been in the middle of the fray. Moreover, the American economy was taking off, easing the pressure on Mr. Clinton to reverse trade deficits.
Some administration officials said those early trade decisions were a learning experience. "If engagement is only for commerce, you will not be enhancing your interests," Mr. Berger concluded. "If we use it to press nonproliferation and human rights, then it advances our interests and reaffirms the theory."
Time and again, though, Mr. Clinton learned that economic engagement had its limits. Old trouble spots -- the Middle East, Iraq, Northern Ireland -- would not go away, and they remained immune to economic incentives.
In dealing with the Middle East, Mr. Clinton drew praise from supporters and detractors for his tenacity and his mastery of the history and politics of the region. But sometimes -- especially during the Camp David summit last summer -- it seemed that the timetable was driven more by Mr. Clinton's political agenda than by whether a deal was near. Even so, in the last hours of his administration, he was still trying to negotiate a settlement in the Middle East.
In places like Cuba, domestic politics prevented the president from gradually lifting an embargo as he had with other countries. There was the failed intervention in Haiti in 1994 and the delayed bombing of Bosnia in the summer of 1995. In between came a showdown with North Korea over nuclear site inspections, a confrontation that William J. Perry, Mr. Clinton's former defense secretary and a special envoy to North Korea, said with the safety of hindsight "took us closer to a general war" than most Americans realized. The president, said a top White House aide, referred to many of these problems as "the underbrush he had to clear away before he could launch his real agenda."
Mr. Clinton was also criticized as failing to articulate clear standards about when America should cede power and when it should use it.
Conservatives said he gave away too much sovereignty to the United Nations -- which was still waiting for Congress to pay the United States' dues -- and to other international organizations, including the World Trade Organization.
Michael Mandelbaum, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, dismissed the administration's approach to peacekeeping as "foreign policy as social work."
"Their view of the world was that they were going to right every wrong," Professor Mandelbaum said, "and use the armed forces as the diplomatic equivalent of a Swiss army knife."
But he and others concluded that Mr. Clinton's foreign policy legacy was being shaped more in the Treasury Department than in the State Department. Madeleine K. Albright was increasingly playing the role of secretary of state for the Middle East and Eastern Europe; she ceded swaths of the world to Mr. Rubin, Mr. Summers and other officials.
A former top aide to Dr. Albright said, "The State Department was simply not equipped to handle the new challenges, so it stuck to the traditional ones."
And Professor Mandelbaum noted: "It was no accident that at the end of the cold war we found ourselves in the midst of financial crises. Markets were suddenly bigger, broader, faster and encompassed more shaky economies. Nothing in the foreign policy manuals tells you how to deal with these, and it took more than a little nerve."
In the new world, leaders accustomed to setting their nations' agendas found themselves subject to the judgments of foreign investors. If a country's deficits looked too high, its ability to repay loans too dubious or if political chaos made it unsafe for new factories, money would move out with the flick of a few keys. Alliances meant little, and traditional foreign aid seemed trivial. Cash flowed to the most competitive countries; those unable to swim in the new sea found life rafts unavailable.
That was the lesson in Thailand in July 1997. The collapse of the Thai currency crippled investor confidence, which quickly caused an economic contagion throughout Southeast Asia and South Korea. Cautious because of Congressional opposition to Mexico's bailout, the Treasury Department was at first hesitant to put too much American cash on the line, so it worked through the International Monetary Fund. And for months, the fund made the situation worse for the poor, requiring cuts in social programs before it would provide loans to forestall default.
By early 1998 rioting broke out in Indonesia, and soon its dictator of three decades, Suharto, was ousted. Russia was the next to be infected, and the United States rushed to provide emergency cash for fear that in disintegrating, its old nuclear rival would lose control over its weapons.
"There were constant fights between the Treasury and the State Department over whether this was wasted money," a White House official said, "because it was clear the Russians weren't going to enact the reforms."
For a few weeks in the fall of 1998, it looked as if the contagion might hurt American markets, but the disaster was prevented with a cut in interest rates by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, a move coordinated with several major countries.
Initially, the administration blamed the global panic on the developing countries, for economic mismanagement. But opinions have shifted.
"I think that the Asian financial crisis and the Mexican crisis were as much caused by the industrial nations' financial institutions," said Mr. Rubin, who now heads one of those institutions, Citigroup. And he conceded that the United States put too much emphasis on opening countries to international investments and not enough on how to handle that money.
"With the benefit of hindsight," he said, "I would say that we should have put more of an emphasis earlier on getting the rest of it right" -- making sure countries had a regulatory structure and an understanding of what could befall them if the world picked up its money and moved it elsewhere.
In the end, intervention by the monetary fund and the United States worked, and the crisis eased. Mr. Clinton gets much of the credit. Quietly, without stirring opposition in Congress, he kept American markets open to ever-larger floods of imported goods, which helped afflicted nations export their way back to health.
But many of the long-term reforms that he talked about so passionately were never executed. Japan, Russia and South Korea made modest changes but reverted to their old habits. Indonesia continued its slow disintegration.
Rising oil prices saved Russia, but much of the force went out of American efforts to turn it into a nation of laws, where the government collected taxes and corruption did not undercut markets.
And in retrospect, Russia proved unwilling to phase out its role as arms merchant to rogue countries, an unspoken quid pro quo for economic aid. Just a few weeks ago, Russia told the White House that it was abandoning an accord signed by Vice President Al Gore and then Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin to halt conventional arms sales to Iran.
"We probably underestimated the basic difficulty of the institutional transformation of Russia," one senior official said. "Was Russia in worse shape than we recognized in '96? Probably."
But Mr. Rubin says, "Whatever money we spent, it was worth it for a world in which we are not now in a nuclear standoff."
Similarly the much-talked-about effort to build a "global financial architecture" has faded. There have been some changes -- countries now must reveal more financial information to investors, and the monetary fund has changed many of its lending practices -- but even the president has stopped talking about redesigning the world's financial system.
Eventually the backlash from the crisis came full circle, colliding with Mr. Clinton's free-market dreams.
The Asian crisis confirmed what many developing nations had suspected: globalization was a rich country's game, and the rules were rigged to favor the most competitive. The free-market system let the United States ship its goods, open its factories and move capital anywhere it wanted. But poorer nations often found that their products could not compete and that their low-tech exports were subject to tariffs and quotas that American, European and Japanese industries would not eliminate.
So when the United States proposed a further opening of world markets, developing nations struck back, starting in Seattle in late November 1999.
Trade ministers were gathering for a new round of global trade talks. Charlene Barshefsky, Mr. Clinton's trade representative and an advocate of using trade accords for political ends, peered out the window of a suite in the Westin Hotel. "Where are the barricades?" Ms. Barshefsky demanded.
For the administration, it was the start of a disastrous week. For months, unions, environmental groups, rights activists and others had been planning to grind the meeting to a halt, to make the point that their issues were being ignored. And on top of that, representatives of many poor nations were determined to stop America's agenda.
Mr. Clinton's comments only made the situation worse.
In an effort to appease the protesters and help Mr. Gore in the coming election, the president arrived in Seattle and began talking about establishing labor and environmental standards for all nations. The comments stiffened the resistance of countries like India and Egypt, which were convinced that Mr. Clinton was trying to impose American-style work rules intended to make their goods less competitive.
In an interview a few weeks ago, Mr. Clinton said: "A lot of the people in these developing countries who were marching are mad at America because we, almost alone among the advanced countries, would like to have a global trading system that has minimum labor and environmental standards. And so a lot of them thought that's my indirect way of being a protectionist, in protecting the good jobs in America and keeping them poor."
It was not the case, he said. But he lost the argument, and the talks collapsed.
Ms. Barshefsky pressed on, piecing together an agreement with Jordan meant to spur trade in the Middle East, and negotiating the deal of her political life, the one with China.
The China accord could eventually redefine the United States' relationship with Beijing. And if Mr. Clinton is right, it could result in the erosion of the Communist Party's control. He argued exactly that, as he was selling Congress on the merits of the deal, making his now-familiar pitch that "in the new century, liberty will spread by cell phone and cable modem." But even as China has opened up economically, the State Department has documented six years of intensifying crackdowns on dissent.
Elsewhere in the world, Mr. Clinton has adjusted his pitch. In the past year, he has talked far more about the fate of the poor.
"His Africa trips had a big impact," said James Steinberg, the deputy national security adviser until last summer. "He saw with his own eyes that even when governments wanted to do the right thing, their huge debt and AIDS and other impediments, made it hard to get off the ground."
The president promoted an initiative to forgive debt -- which Congress passed last year -- and he told the Indian Parliament that it was no longer acceptable that "part of the world lives in the information age" while the other "has not even reached the clean water age."
This sounded big-hearted, but it was also rooted in a new reality: The world's developing nations were gaining clout by forming coalitions.
"They are now willing to say, We are not going to do it the American way," one Clinton adviser said. "The Bush people are about to find that out."
But if there was a single moment at the end of Mr. Clinton's presidency that crystallized the successes and the limitations of his effort to use global capitalism to drag nations toward democracy, it came in Hanoi, on a Saturday afternoon last month.
To the rising alarm of Vietnam's leaders, Mr. Clinton's trip was drawing huge crowds, among them former Vietcong guerrillas who toted along their grandchildren to see the leader of the nation with which Vietnam once fought. "He will bring the Internet," one aging veteran said, and then confessed he had never sat in front of a computer.
It was just what Mr. Clinton wanted to hear. But then he met Le Kha Phieu, the Communist Party's general secretary, who had stopped many of the reforms started in the early 1990's, warning that globalization was a fancy word for surrender.
"We have seen the collapse of the U.S.S.R.," he told Mr. Clinton, and yet "we are still on our feet, we have reaffirmed socialism." They spent the next hour politely arguing whether America had imperialist designs on Vietnam in the 1960's and, by implication, whether it had them now.
The Vietnamese leader's message was clear: Just because we trade with you, don't expect us to embrace democracy. An hour later, Mr. Clinton got a much more mixed message from the mayor of Ho Chi Minh City, who asked about low-income housing and job creation.
Which side will prevail?
"I don't think there's any way for us to bring openness and freedom to China or Vietnam more quickly than the one we've adopted," Mr. Clinton said later.
But he added: "I don't think freedom is inevitable, or the triumph of democracy is inevitable. But I think it is rendered far more likely by the power of our example and the strength of our engagement."

CORRECTION-DATE: December 29, 2000, Friday

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption and a front-page article yesterday about President Clinton's foreign policy misattributed the signing of a trade agreement with China. It was the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, not the president, who signed the agreement in 1999. (This year Mr. Clinton signed the legislation that granted permanent normal trading status to China.)
The caption also misstated the timing of Mr. Clinton's visit to Beijing. It was in 1998, not after the agreement was signed.

GRAPHIC: Photos: UNEASY RELATIONS -- Dealings between President Clinton and the military got better, but the going was often painful. Page A17. (Amy Toensing for The New York Times)(pg. A1); In 1999, President Clinton signed an accord in which China agreed to open its markets to foreign imports in return for entry into the World Trade Organization. Mr. Clinton visited China a short time later and met with the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, left. (Ralph Alswang/The White House); President Clinton watched the handshake between the Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat in 1993, left. But an accord failed and by 1998, Benjamin Netanyahu was Israeli prime minister, center. He would be followed by Ehud Barak, right. (Paul Hosefros/The New York Times); (Reuters)(pg. A16); President Clinton, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen at a memorial service at Andrews Force Air Base in 1998, honoring Americans killed in embassy bombings in Africa. (Stephen Crowley/The New York Times)(pg. A17)

Museums
 
"AMAZONS OF THE AVANT-GARDE," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 7). A concise exercise, monographically arranged, this show focuses on six Russian women who painted around the time of the revolution. Several continued to work much later and do more than paint, but this is a tendentious affair, plausibly so. If just a couple of the women, Natalia Goncharova and Liubov Popova, were truly great painters, the exhibition still isn't a case of special pleading. The Russian avant-garde wouldn't have been what it was without them collectively. The story as it unfolds here seems, if anything, more remarkable, not less, for having as little to do with sex as it does and almost everything to do with painting. Many of the works have a surprising fortitude. Revolution. A brave new art world. The dream persists even though the form it takes keeps changing. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $8 for students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman). 

* "THE DRAFTSMAN'S ART: MASTER DRAWINGS FROM THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF SCOTLAND," Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through Feb. 25). This beautiful exhibition of 70 master drawings from the 16th to the 19th century, many of them recently acquired, has been organized with an eye to achieving a harmonic convergence of diversity, continuity, quality, fame and obscurity. Leonardo, Raphael, Boucher and Seurat are here, in outstanding form, but so is an exquisitely detailed rendering of two Restoration gentlemen by David Paton, a Scottish miniaturist, and an almost cinematic genre scene that is considered the masterpiece of Etienne Jeaurat, a contemporary of Chardin. In between are works by Zuccaro, Pietro Testa, Pietro da Cortona, Hans Baldung Grien, Hendrick Goltzius and much more. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $7; $5, students and the elderly (Roberta Smith).
 
 * "THE EMBODIED IMAGE: CHINESE CALLIGRAPHY FROM THE JOHN B. ELLIOTT COLLECTION," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 7). In China the written word has traditionally been the highest art form and a source of political and emotional power. To see that power in action, check out this grandly scaled exhibition, which brings together two superb calligraphy collections -- from Princeton University and the Met -- in the most comprehensive survey yet seen in these parts. The dozens of scrolls covered with handwritten words collectively radiate a kind of conversational buzz and suggest a richly varied cast of personalities: fastidious court functionaries, impulsive social agitators, unworldly monks, visionary poets. Together they offer an icebreaking introduction to an art that to anyone who doesn't know Chinese can seem unapproachable. Hours: Sundays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5 for students 12 and older and the elderly (Holland Cotter).
 
 "AN ENGAGEMENT WITH FOLK ART: CYRIL I. NELSON'S GIFTS TO THE MUSEUM OF AMERICAN FOLK ART," 2 Lincoln Square, at West 66th Street, (212) 595-9533 (through Jan. 7). This show celebrates the largess of Mr. Nelson, a book editor and folk art collector who has given 113 objects to the museum with the promise of more. The works, from the late-18th to the mid-20th centuries, cover the traditional areas of folk art -- portraits, landscapes, sculptures, painted and decorated furniture -- but the focus is on American needlework: quilts, coverlets, blankets and the like. Among the quilt spectaculars is the "Samuel Steinberger Log Cabin Quilt, Courthouse Steps Variation," by a 19th-century immigrant. Painted furniture, too, shines in this show. The painting and sculpture pieces make a more modest impression, but over all, what's on view represents a refined, solid ensemble that is very visitable. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Free (Grace Glueck).
 
 "THE FIGURE: ANOTHER SIDE OF MODERNISM," Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Staten Island, (718) 448-2500 (through Jan. 14). This vast, uneven but enthralling grab bag of a show invites us to count the ways that artists have painted the human figure during the last 50 years. The curator, Lily Wei, selected 125 paintings by as many artists, including most of the usual suspects, from Willem de Kooning to Lisa Yuskavage. Among the best works are a huge grisaille painting of a towering giantess by Alfred Leslie; Alex Katz's radiant portrait of his wife; Catherine Murphy's intensely realistic picture of big feet; and Elliot Green's fusion of a Mondrianesque grid and a rubbery cartoon couple. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $2 (Ken Johnson).
 
 * "SOL LEWITT: A RETROSPECTIVE," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Feb. 25). Unexpectedly, the most beautiful exhibition by a living artist in a New York museum in a long time and an antidote to the nonsense in several other museums around town. Just about every other wall is covered with wall drawings, alternately eye-popping and gossamer. Those out there (you know who you are) who run from any artist linked to Conceptualism may want to stop and re-evaluate your views after seeing what's here. The master of chaste white cubes has undergone a transformation since his last retrospective in the late 70's. Now opulence emerges from the same seemingly prosaic instructions he came up with years ago. The appeal is still to patient observation, a lesson for everyone, delivered elegantly. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays and Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $8 for students and the elderly (Kimmelman).
 
 "PIERRE ET GILLES," New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Jan. 7). No history of postmodern photography, fashion photography, celebrity portraiture, record album covers or the highbrow beefcake tradition would be complete without the work of the French photo team known as Pierre et Gilles, who have collaborated on over-the-top, tightly styled, hand-finished photographs since 1976 and become wildly famous in Europe in the process. In their first American museum retrospective, their work feels more than a little embalmed, existing behind a not-so-invisible shield of artistic conservatism. Certain images come to life as art objects -- most notably, one of a beautiful young sailor up to his chest in water with an iridescent night sky behind him -- but those are few. Hours: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, until 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3 for students, artists and the elderly (Smith).
 
 * "POWER AND DESIRE: SOUTH ASIAN PAINTINGS FROM THE SAN DIEGO MUSEUM OF ART, EDWIN BINNEY III COLLECTION," Asia Society at Midtown, 502 Park Avenue, at 59th Street, (212) 517-2742 (through Jan. 7.) The album-size paintings known as Indian miniatures, produced for an elite clientele who demanded the finest workmanship, are rightly renowned for their suave forms and brilliant colors. They also embody the moral values, political ambitions and personal aspirations of the culture that produced them. All of these ingredients come into play in this show of 67 top-of-the-line examples from the 16th to the 19th centuries. They add up to a kind of grand but intimate theater, equal parts farce, melodrama and mystery play, where men strut like gods, gods have the failings of men, and nature is a gorgeous curtain behind which infinity lies. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $4; $2 for students and the elderly (Cotter).
 
Galleries: Uptown
 
* JAMES CASTLE, "The Common Place," Knoedler, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550 (through Jan. 13). Though deaf, speechless and illiterate, Castle (1900-77) drew with miraculous originality and steadfastness of purpose for most of his life. This exhibition presents more than 100 drawings, assemblages and small books, all created using homemade and found materials. The artist's strangely somber views of the ordinary rooms and grounds of the Idaho farm where he grew up have a haunting, deeply moving presence (Johnson).
 
Galleries: 57th Street
 
"FOUR NON-OBJECTIVE PAINTERS," Katharina Rich Perlow Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 644-7171 (through Jan. 6). Once an art world legend, the German-born painter Hilla Rebay (1890-1967) was a founder and the first director of the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, which evolved into the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. She also served as director of that institution, from 1937 to 1952. In 1939, with Guggenheim's backing, she brought her friend Rudolf Bauer, the painter, from Germany to the United States, and promoted his work. Rebay and Bauer were devotees of Non-Objective painting, defined by Kandinsky as art with no detectable reference to real-world sources. Their paintings are displayed together here, but it turns out that Bauer, a weak painter who could nevertheless create spirited Kandinskyesque collisions of form and color, makes a better showing. Also on view is "Berlin at Night," a group of mildly naughty drawings by Bauer, who before his Non-Objective career was a caricaturist for satirical German magazines. And there are several paintings from the period by the American painters Balcomb Greene and John Ferren, but not a strong enough showing to amount to much (Glueck).
 
 SOL LEWITT, PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3292 (through Feb. 3), and Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1105 (through Jan. 13). Running concurrently with Mr. LeWitt's beautiful retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art, these exhibitions present new works by the prolific muralist and sculptor. PaceWildenstein offers an explosively vibrant wall painting appropriately titled "Splat," a fiberglass sculpture in primary colors that looks like an extraterrestrial mountain range, and large, sumptuous gouache-on-paper studies. Paula Cooper features an enormous but comparatively inert concrete block work, a six-sided structure you can see into but can't enter (Johnson).
 
 GWYNN MURRILL, Washburn, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-6780 (through Jan. 20). Three bronze deer rendered life-size in a smoothly simplified manner by this Los Angeles-based sculptor have a tense, remarkably animated presence. An eagle and a cheetah seem artificially stylized by comparison (Johnson).
 
Galleries: Chelsea
 
ROBIN LOWE, "Erehwon," Bonakdar Jancou, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144 (reopens Tuesday; through Jan. 13). Mr. Lowe's large, Magic Realist paintings look like scenes from a Jungian dream. A winding road leads into the forest. A lawn gnome with a lamp guards a broken-down farmhouse. A white goat drinks from an aboveground swimming pool in a stony field. Painting in saturated colors with hallucinogenic precision, Mr. Lowe gives vivid visibility to offbeat, psychologically intriguing fantasies (Johnson).
 
 "MODERNISM DEFINED: JULIUS SHULMAN AND RICHARD NEUTRA," Yancey Richardson, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 343-1255 (reopens Tuesday; through Jan. 6). Now 90, Mr. Shulman began photographing the buildings of the modernist architect Richard Neutra in 1936. His black-and-white images of clean, airy, minimally furnished houses from the 1940's and 50's are more than just lucid documents; each glowing miniature conveys a heavenly vision of modern serenity (Johnson).
 
 "NEUTOPIA," Audiello, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 675-9082 (reopens Tuesday; through Jan. 20). Five artists playfully redesign modernity. Both Christopher Schank and Carlos Ancalmo skillfully build elaborate surrealistic, multileveled architectural structures of wood, foam, plastic and other materials. Pablo Vargas-Lugo turns cardboard boxes into works of surprising Constructivist elegance. Jay Davis's glossy pictures are like a combination of traditional Japanese landscape painting and science fiction illustration. And Anna Sew Hoy creates absurd conjunctions of child-size bicycles and giant blobs of putty (Johnson).
 
 * CINDY SHERMAN, Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100 (through Jan. 6). With her latest untitled series, Ms. Sherman is back in front of the camera again, disguised as women who, you might say, used to be somebody, maybe. They grin at the camera in clownish make-up, wobbly wigs and discount blouses, proud, valiantly oblivious to, or simply defiant of, our condescension, like the beauty pageant queen who drops her baton in the talent contest but keeps beaming. Formal devices by Ms. Sherman get overlooked because of the human element: the pattern of pigtails against plaid shirt; the purplish freckled face of a woman with purple shirt and purple cap. This formal order becomes a rational structure that gives to the work its mix of frigidity and heat, a perfectly ambiguous cocktail for an ambiguous moment and an antidote to the weary sophistication of which there is too much in art now (Kimmelman).
 
 "THRIFTING," Lombard Freid, 531 West 26th Street, (212) 967-8040 (through Jan. 6). Seven emerging Texas artists who cleverly recycle found materials. Bill Davenport makes eccentrically poetic works, like a group of blue cans bearing mounds of fake snow; Katrina Moorhead transforms a piece of plastic-foam packing material into a wonderful little swimming pool using miniature tiles and real grout; Brad Tucker produces funky conjunctions of words, materials and objects; and Francesca Fuchs merges consumer products and abstract wall painting (Johnson).
 
 FATIMAH TUGGAR, Greene Naftali, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 463-7770 (through Jan. 6). Born in Nigeria, educated at Yale, Ms. Tuggar works in a variety of mediums to sensitize viewers to the gulf between African and Western experience. In large computer-processed photomontages, she mixes and layers disconnected images -- placing Western fashion models in an open-air African meat market, for example -- to surrealistic and politically provocative effect (Johnson).
 
 MARY WEATHERFORD, Debs & Company, 525 West 26th Street, (212) 643-2070 (through Jan. 6). Since bursting on the scene at the end of the 80's with her feminist revisions of Noland, Johns and Warhol, Ms. Weatherford has followed an unpredictable path. Her new canvases, punctuated by starfish, seashells and sponges, hover uneasily between faux-naif landscape and sophisticated Color Field painting (Johnson).
 
Galleries: SoHo
 
"DEATH RACE 2000," Thread Waxing Space, 476 Broadway, between Grand and Broome Streets, (212) 966-9520 (through Jan. 13). Organized around a ramshackle wooden racetrack built by Andreas Schlaegel, Phillip Zaiser and Thomas Zipp, this sophomoric mess of a 30-artist exhibition means to satirize violent, addictive and otherwise excessive behaviors supposedly driving modern society to destruction. The few interesting works include a funny video by Omer Fast, who used his own voice to replace all sounds in scenes from a Mel Gibson movie, and a life-size machine-gun-toting camel built of cardboard by Alex Baggaley (Johnson).
 
 "FROM INSIDE THE BODY: CHINESE NEW PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO," Ise Cultural Foundation, 555 Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 925-1649 (through Jan. 6). Most of the 11 participants in this show are appearing for the first time in the United States, and together they give some idea of ways in which many young Chinese artists, with access to international art magazines, museum catalogs and the Internet, are tailoring global styles to culturally specific ends. Some cook up contemporary riffs on traditional genres; others dive straight into a hallucinatory present, with themes that sometimes dovetail with those in recent work by artists in New York (Cotter).
 
 MATT GRAY, "White Rabbit," Sandra Gering, 476 Broome Street, (212) 226-8195 (through Jan. 6). Big color photographs of two albino rabbits in a white box by this New Mexico artist. They are visually rich and dreamily weird, and they evoke a surprising range of associations, from Kasimir Malevich to Robert Ryman and Lewis Carroll to the Jefferson Airplane (Johnson).
 
 KEVIN LARMON, Curt Marcus, 578 Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 226-3200 (reopens Tuesday; through Jan. 6). Mr. Larmon, who has been exhibiting regularly in New York since 1984, updates the old Surrealist-Abstract Expressionist connection. Working toward the centers of raw plywood panels, he layers grisaille glazes over loose, swirling pencil lines, creating murky depths, serpentine biomorphic forms and tension between illusory dream space and the raw immediacy of paint and wood (Johnson).
 
Other Galleries
 
* SIAH ARMAJANI, "Glass Room," Senior & Shopmaker Gallery, 21 East 26th Street, (212) 213-6767 (reopens Tuesday; through Jan. 6). You couldn't live in this endearingly homespun "glass room," but then, it's not meant for that. Made of glass and plastic bricks and set on wagon wheels like a prairie schooner, it is packed with fanciful allusions and tributes: to country carpentry, old-style American farm life, vernacular rural architecture and at the same time the futuristic visions that glass seems to offer. Despite its transparency, it has a more private aspect than the long roster of bridges, houses, reading rooms, gardens and other structures -- some functional, some purely aesthetic -- with which Mr. Armajani has adorned the built world. Enigmatic yet accessible, sturdily constructed but for contemplation only, "Glass Room" is a sparkling addition (Glueck).
 
 ANDREW FORGE, New York Studio School, 8 West Eighth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 673-6466 (through Jan. 6). A Pointillist-derived system of colored dots has for years been the lyrical basis of painting by Andrew Forge, an English-born painter, critic and teacher. Worked on the canvas in dense but nuanced arrangements made from close observation of "places, seasons, times of day, conditions of light," the dots usually can't be read as specific imagery. But sometimes they hover on the edge of representation, evoking trees, a pond and other aspects of nature. To be savored rather than looked at hurriedly, they resonate in the mind (Glueck).
 
 PAUL PFEIFFER, the Project, 427 West 126th Street, Harlem (212) 662-8610 (reopens Wednesday; through Jan. 7). The emotional, almost religious intensity that infuses Mr. Pfeiffer's tiny wall-mounted video tapes, and created such a buzz around the artist last spring, is all but absent in this show. The power of his work stems from intimate encounters with small, moving images lifted from existing film and ingeniously Pfeifferized. Thus a large installation and some manipulated photographs founder on the seas of one-liner cerebralness. Only "The Long Count (I Shook Up the World)," based on the 1964 Clay-Liston fight, reflects Mr. Pfeiffer's poetic understanding of the meanings to be found at the nexus of the body, the camera and American life (Smith).
 
Last Chance
 
"A NEW YORK CIRCLE," Susan Teller, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 941-7335 (through tomorrow). Selected by a veteran New York modernist painter, Fannie Hillsmith, this exhibition of works by friends and acquaintances evokes a midcentury period when the progressive art world was far smaller and more intimate than today and the common language was Cubism. Besides Ms. Hillsmith's own robust Cubist still lifes, the show includes fine small works by luminaries of American art like Louise Nevelson, Suzy Frelinghuysen, A. E. Gallatin, Alice Trumbull Mason and Charles Shaw (Johnson).
 
 "HIP-HOP NATION: ROOTS, RHYMES AND RAGE," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Sunday). The complex cultural amalgam of music, poetry, break dancing, art and fashion that is hip-hop poses a serious challenge to any art museum, but with the proper resources and curatorial expertise, it could have been met. Instead this show offers a partial outline of hip-hop history, conveyed by photographs, posters, magazine and album covers, memorabilia and monotonous expanses of clothes that make the show nearly indistinguishable from the gift shop. Garnished with graffiti art, it bypasses many other equally interesting connections to contemporary art. Because the show omits music videos, it manages to be virtually devoid of the sounds, words and moving bodies that are the essence of hip-hop. The results are a cross between a mall and a mausoleum. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of each month); Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $4; $2 for students and the elderly (Smith).
 
 * "THE IMPERIAL GAZE," Sepia International, 148 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 645-9444 (through tomorrow). The British photographer Samuel Bourne was in India for only seven years (1863-70), but he took thousands of pictures, established a lucrative business and became well known for his cityscapes and pictures of architectural monuments. Like many quest-driven travelers, though, he wanted, even needed, something from India: in his case, an experience of the Sublime in nature. In Kashmir, he encountered an earthly Eden, and on arduous treks to the Himalayas he discovered the meaning of hugeness. The pictures that resulted are part of one of the richest bodies of photographic work to emerge from British India (Cotter).
 
 "IN THE PRESENCE OF SPIRITS: AFRICAN ART FROM THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF ETHNOLOGY IN LISBON," Museum for African Art, 593 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1313 (through Sunday). The more than 140 objects on view relate to the secular and the supernatural in African culture: masks, power figures, dolls, decorated stools and chairs, pipes, posts and other artifacts. Outstanding is a group of initiation masks made from wood and more fragile materials like feathers, fabrics and barkcloth fibers. Ranging from fierce to benign in expression, they are giddily imaginative. Impressive, too, is a selection of dolls from the Ambo people of southwestern Angola. The objects in the show were chosen for their high aesthetic value, and it doesn't disappoint. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for children, students and the elderly; free on Sundays (Glueck).
 
 ARNOLD MESCHES, "Echoes, a Century Survey," Donahue/Sosinski Art, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 226-1111 (through tomorrow). An impassioned Expressionist painter, Mr. Mesches, now 77, has stayed with figuration through all the art world "isms" of his time. His work combines his interest in 20th-century history -- wars, strikes, the Holocaust, class and economic struggles -- with his own immigrant family saga. He gets it down with the energy, bold colors and lively humor (if not great painting) that keep you looking. An old-fashioned show about feelings in an era of art world ironies, it nevertheless works. The painting helps: its rough, guileless, straight-from-the-tube abruptness strikes just the right note (Glueck).
 
 * RICHARD NONAS, "A Ghost in Every Kayak," Five Myles, 558 St. Johns Place, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, (718) 783-4438 (through Jan. 31). Established by the theater director and performer Hanne Tierney in memory of her son Myles, a news photographer killed in Sierra Leone in 1998, this maverick gallery has an entrancing show put together by Mr. Nonas. Examples of his floor-hugging post-minimalist work run down the center of the gray-painted space. Walls are hung with an extraordinary collection of boats, full-scale replicas and near-abstract models fashioned by the artist (Cotter).
 
 * "OPEN ENDS," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9480 (closing in stages, beginning on Tuesday). The third and final cycle of "MOMA 2000" covers 1960 to the present and fills nearly the entire museum with almost a dozen different theme shows. "White" is one theme. Memorial art is another. Childhood and lost innocence is yet another. Like previous installments in this year-and-a-half-long navel-gazing reconsideration by the museum of how to present its permanent collection in anticipation of its future home, the show has the effect of being clever and a little too solipsistic: it's about smart curators' making occasionally vivid and previously unseen connections among disparate works without making particularly fresh sense of the period as a whole. It's artistic game playing, highly pleasurable up to a point. The themes are always arguable, which is part of the game. This also becomes an occasion for the museum to parade acquisitions of the last decade, which include Gerhard Richter's series of paintings based on the Baader-Meinhof gang, occupying an entire room and probably the exhibition's high point. Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays, and Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8:15 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and the elderly (Kimmelman).
 
 * "PAINTERS IN PARIS: 1895-1950," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sunday). This show of more than 100 paintings celebrates the Met's acquisitions of works by School of Paris painters, going back to 1946 when Gertrude Stein bequeathed her portrait, done by Picasso in 1906. That portrait served as a cornerstone for later acquisitions in the field, particularly over the last 20 years. The museum's increasing interest and diligent wooing of collectors have brought not only single works but also groups and entire holdings, like the 18 major objects bequeathed by Florene M. Schoenborn in 1995 and the Jacques and Natasha Gelman trove of 85 masterpieces accessioned in 1998. The treasures on view include works by some of the 20th century's greatest: Bonnard, Braque, Chagall, de Chirico, Derain, Gris, Leger, Matisse, Miro, Modigliani and Picasso, in an animated arrangement that should beguile the most jaded Met-goer. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).
 
 "RAVE REVIEWS: AMERICAN ART AND ITS CRITICS, 1826-1925," National Academy of Design Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880 (through Sunday). A year after the Academy opened as a school for art instruction, it organized its first annual show, 170 contemporary portraits, landscapes and historical sagas. This entertaining hodgepodge of a show, described as "the first comprehensive historical examination of American art criticism," brings together more than 70 paintings and sculptures that first appeared in these shows, with the reviews they got at the time. One immediate and large success was Winslow Homer's "Prisoners From the Front" (1866), which portrayed a lineup of scraggly Confederate soldiers with their leader confronting a smartly uniformed young Union officer. The contrast made by Homer between the two sides was seen by the painting's most perceptive reviewers as a comment on why the South lost the Civil War. Hours: Wednesdays and Thursdays, noon to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $4.50, students and the elderly (Glueck).

HEADLINE: Pacific Crossroads, Deep in Hibiscus and History

SERIES: ON THE ROAD

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: HONOLULU

 BODY:
The mythic Honolulu of grass skirts and towering palms has been familiar to Americans for generations.
In 1866 Mark Twain came here as a correspondent for The Sacramento Union, extolling the beauty of "the dusky native women" in his dispatches and marveling at "a summer calm as tranquil as dawn in the garden of Eden." A century later, the biographer Leon Edel found "a beatitude of the leisure life," with hibiscus and plumeria blossoms on his lawn and "the sound of the ocean breaking with a regular beat." 
 Gathered around their radios, our grandfathers listened to Webley Edwards and his long-running show, "Hawaii Calls." They heard Bing Crosby crooning "Sweet Leilani." They sailed west, some of them, on the luxurious Matson liner Lurline; here they discovered the charms of the ukulele, the lei and the muumuu, and the unfamiliar flavors of fresh coconut and pineapple. They bought Asian objets d'art at Gump's, Honolulu's emporium deluxe, now replaced, sadly, by yet another Louis Vuitton boutique.
The handsome Duke Kahanamoku won Olympic gold medals in swimming, and later introduced the world to surfing, which he learned on the beach at Waikiki, where his statue stands today.
Statehood and jumbo jets brought later generations to a more worldly city, made increasingly famous by celluloid images: Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr making love, or so we assumed, on a deserted beach; Elvis Presley singing "Can't Help Falling in Love" in "Blue Hawaii"; and, on the small screen, Jack Lord in "Hawaii Five-O" and Tom Selleck in "Magnum, P.I."
In 1931 Ellery J. Chun, a Yale-educated tailor, gave the city one of its enduring emblems, the luridly colored aloha shirt, a classic of kitsch couture. During World War II, G.I.'s bought thousands of them. Harry S. Truman wore them, and so did Elvis.
But there is another, less carefree Honolulu, invisible to the hordes who populate the high-rises on the brutally overdeveloped, relentlessly commercial Waikiki. For all the grandeur of Diamond Head, the voluptuous beauty of orchids and bougainvillea and flame trees, the seduction of sun and sea and trade winds, this city, like all cities, has its problems.
Far too heavily dependent on tourism now that industrial cultivation of pineapple and sugar cane, which made it rich, has ended, Honolulu's economy rises and falls with those of California and Japan, which supply most of its visitors. As mainland cities boomed in the last decade, this one stagnated, with house prices and investment falling, bankruptcies multiplying, unemployment and welfare caseloads rising.
Honolulu is burdened by a sclerotic state government, based here, and an overblown system of public welfare. State income taxes are the nation's third highest. The dominance of a single party, the Democrats, inhibits change. Alarmed by indications that Hawaii voted at the lowest rate of any state this year, The Honolulu Advertiser mourned a "democratic system left to rot through indifference or even hostility."
Fearsome rush-hour traffic jams strain the gentle aloha spirit to the breaking point, and the city worries that it may be turning into a junior-varsity Los Angeles.
Yet Honolulu remains a place of boundless tolerance, where most babies are born of mixed ethnic stock, and prejudice is viewed with great disdain. A local woman whose forebears came from Germany, Spain, Korea, Japan and the Philippines gaily told my wife, Betsey, and me that she was "real chop suey." People of Japanese origin eat fried rice and Peking duck; people of Chinese origin eat sushi. McDonald's serves hamburgers here, but it serves saimin noodles, too.
There can be few more exuberant neighborhoods in the United States than Honolulu's Chinatown on Saturday morning, market day. The sidewalks and the aisles of food markets are jammed not just with Chinese speakers but with Thai and Lao and Samoan and English speakers, all darting in and out of noodle factories, lei shops (try Lin's at 1017A Maunakea Street), curio dealers, chop suey joints, hairdressers, benevolent societies, duck-to-go dealers (try Nam Fong at 1029 Maunakea Street), jewelry stores, acupuncture clinics, herbalists and hole-in-the-wall restaurants, all the while taking care to avoid basket weavers squatting at the curb and graphic artists laying out their wares on the pavement.
"Honolulu has become a Eurasian experience in my lifetime," said Jay Fidell, a lawyer who came here 35 years ago from Queens. "The business community is completely polyglot. I know of no place in the world where race means less, though there is a divide between those who were born in Hawaii and those who have moved here."
 
Feats of Navigation
As far as we know, the first settlers reached these islands 1,500 years ago, sailing across immense reaches of the Pacific from the Marquesas Islands in twin-hulled canoes. It was a brilliant feat of navigation, using only the stars and the currents, that was matched about 500 years later by a group of Tahitians, who probably conquered the Marquesans. Both groups were Polynesians, like the Maori tribesmen of New Zealand; when Captain James Cook reached the islands in 1778, he found that his Maori interpreter could understand what the Hawaiians said.
Cook, a Briton, claimed the Hawaiian archipelago for his country and named it the Sandwich Islands, in honor of the Earl of Sandwich, the patron of his expedition. Cook was killed on a second visit the following year, but the Hawaiian flag still bears the Union Jack in its upper left-hand corner, as if to remind us of his exploits.
Over the three decades ending with his death in 1819, the great King Kamehameha I, based in Honolulu, united all the islands under his rule. After he was gone, the missionaries came, sailing from New England around treacherous Cape Horn in handsome schooners that took about nine months to reach here. Hiram Bingham of Bennington, Vt., preached the first sermon here in 1820 and began the five-year task of building Kawaiahao Church in 1837.
The church still stands, not far from the state capitol in the center of Honolulu, a copy in coral blocks, hand-hewn from local reefs, of a village Congregational church in New England, with a broad central aisle, pews for 1,500 and a fine old wall clock from Boston.
Whaling ships followed, and their sailors transmitted venereal and other diseases to Hawaiian women, who died by tens of thousands. But the missionaries persevered in their mission, banning alcohol and the hula, the enormously expressive dance through which the Hawaiians told the story of their culture, and devising the long, shapeless muumuu to disguise womanly curves.
The missionaries' story is told just across the street at the Mission Houses Museum, installed in three unadorned buildings where the stiff-necked New Englanders kept their stores, devised a written form of the Hawaiian language and printed the Bible in it. Incredibly, lumber for two of the buildings was shipped from Boston to islands covered with vast hardwood forests.
"They came to do good and stayed to do well," modern Hawaiians like to say about the missionaries.
That is not quite true. It was the children and grandchildren of the missionaries -- like the descendants of Amos and Juliette Cooke, of whom more in just a moment -- who grew rich and powerful. By 1862, haole (foreigners) owned 75 percent of Hawaii's land, and a handful of haole companies still control much of it.
 
A Native Minority
The sugar barons from the mainland played a crucial role in deposing the last Hawaiian queen, Liliuokalani, in 1893. The American president at the time of the coup, Grover Cleveland, called it a disgrace, but in 1898 the United States, egged on by Theodore Roosevelt and his cronies, annexed the islands, which were admitted as the 50th state, with Honolulu as its capital, in 1959.
Iolani Palace, a frothy confection of Corinthian columns and New Orleans-style cast iron, with a Grand Hall full of gleaming woodwork and an equally grand Throne Room, stands as a forlorn reminder of the vanished monarchy. And the Hawaiians and part-Hawaiians constitute a largely landless minority in their own islands, outnumbered by the descendants of the Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese, Filipinos and mainlanders who have made their way here.
The Bishop Museum, too little visited by tourists, contains convincing evidence of the artistic gifts of the first islanders. Among its treasures are a newly restored six-man outrigger racing canoe, a utilitarian object in highly varnished wood that embodies the very idea of speed even on dry land; a life-size wooden image of the war god Ku, scowling fiercely, knees bent and teeth bared, one of only three such images to have survived; feather-topped staffs called kahili, which were symbols of royal standing; and a group of fabulous helmets, capes and cloaks, fashioned from the red, yellow and black feathers of tens of thousands of birds.
Anna Rice Cooke, a wealthy descendant of missionaries, married to another, gave Honolulu its Academy of Arts, designed by Bertram G. Goodhue, which sits beneath a mighty monkeypod tree, across the street from Thomas Square, a park full of banyans. On its doorstep during our last visit, we ran into Barney A. Ebsworth, a St. Louis art collector who maintains a house here.
 
Early Views of Hawaii
"This is the best general art museum anywhere in the tropics," he said, which sounded like hyperbole to me until I toured the galleries.
In fact, Honolulu's is a gem among smaller American art museums. Not surprisingly, it has a comprehensive collection of early views of Hawaii, as seen through the eyes of 19th-century British and French visitors. Not surprisingly, it has a choice selection of objects illustrating the mingling of Oriental and occidental artistic traditions in porcelain, textiles, ivory, silver and many other mediums; for us, highlights included a particularly delicate Chinese Chippendale cabinet; large, detailed watercolor illustrations of a mango and a pineapple, done in Canton in 1865, and a room lined with 20 panels of a French panoramic wallpaper, titled "Natives of the Pacific," dated 1804.
There are also good groups of Polynesian, Melanesian and Indonesian objects; a contemporary wing with substantial works by Nadelman, Frankenthaler and Nam June Paik, among others, and old masters from the collections of Mrs. Cooke and Samuel S. Kress (including a first-rate Piero di Cosimo).
But perhaps what surprises most in this handsome group of single-story pavilions, grouped around a series of six courtyards, is the collection of modern masterworks, many of them bought in the 1920's by Mrs. Cooke. Sitting in mid-Pacific, she developed a taste for Gauguin, van Gogh and Pissarro at the same time as the sophisticated collectors of Paris and St. Petersburg.
Nor did Mrs. Cooke stop there. In 1925 she built a house high on Makiki Heights, overlooking the city, leaving it to her daughter, Alice Cooke Spalding. In 1988 it became the city's Contemporary Museum, notable for a multiroom installation by the English painter David Hockney, evoking his wide-eyed, childlike sets for Ravel's opera "L'Enfant and les Sortileges," and for a pair of George Rickey sculptures made wildly kinetic by the breezy site.
 
Rich in Music and Dance
Music and dance have played a major role in Hawaiian life from the start; Don Ho did not spring from a musical desert. As Matt Catingub, the young conductor of the Honolulu Symphony Pops, gently reminded me, choral music has a proud tradition throughout Polynesia, especially in Fiji and New Zealand (birthplace, of course, of the great part-Maori soprano Kiri Te Kanawa).
Over the years, the islands have developed a special affinity for ukuleles, adapted from the four-stringed braguinha brought here in 1879 by immigrants from the Portuguese island of Madeira; for slack-key guitars, tuned lower by Hawaiian cowboys decades ago to give a warmer, more "tropical" tone and to make them easier to play; and for the Hawaiian steel guitar, a horizontal instrument, with a singing tone created by a sliding steel fret.
Mr. Catingub, jolly, dynamic and ponytailed, is the son of Mavis Rivers, the jazz singer, and his big band has accompanied Rosemary Clooney on tour. The symphony's musicians, he said, "have the ability to play anywhere, but they've decided that they would rather live here in paradise." The same players play for pops dates and for classical concerts, which this season have attracted soloists of the caliber of Pinchas Zuckerman and Vladimir Feltsman.
Samuel Wong, a New Yorker whose wife, Hae-Young Ham, plays in the New York Philharmonic, is the orchestra's music director. He has made some progress in easing its chronic financial troubles.
Meantime, new life has been breathed into traditional Hawaiian music and into the hula by younger musicians like Keilii Reichel, an instrumentalist, singer and hula master. The visitor can now find performances of the real stuff as well as the hokum of years gone by.
The musical revival mirrors a growing Hawaiian sovereignty movement. Although fewer than 1 percent of Hawaii residents are of pure Hawaiian ancestry, about 20 percent classified themselves as part-native in recent surveys. The centennnials of the overthrow of Queen Liliuokalani in 1993 and of American annexation in 1998 inspired demonstrations, sanctioned to some degree by the governor at the time, John D. Waihee, the first of native Hawaiian descent to hold the job. Since then, the movement has gained wide acceptance across ethnic lines here, but there is no agreement on specific goals. Do the Hawaiians want true independence? A commonwealth? Nation-within-nation status?
Jerry Burris, editor of The Advertiser's editorial page, sees the sovereignty movement as a cultural rather than a purely political phenomenon, and a pressure valve for bitterness. Ultimately, he said, it is "a bid for entitlements by the have-nots of our society, people who want money, land and a lot more social progress."
Samuel P. King, a senior federal judge in Honolulu, told me that "a broad majority thinks these people got a raw deal and deserve something." Still, he clearly considers the whole idea a bit dangerous.
"I have three-sixteenths Hawaiian blood," he said. "My grandson -- the one in that sky-diving picture on the wall -- he has three-sixty-fourths. Everyone here marries outside their group. It's one of the triumphs of this place, or so we have always thought. I'd hate to think our values are changing."
For years, native Hawaiians took great pride in the Bishop Trust. Founded by the last lineal descendant of Kamehameha I, devoted to the maintenance of schools for children of at least partly Hawaiian descent, its wealth totals more than $6 billion. At one time it owned 10 percent of Goldman Sachs, the investment firm, as well as a bank, a shopping center and an aluminum plant in China. But the five trustees were forced out in 1999 for failing to perform their duties adequately while paying themselves $1 million a year each.
"They treated it like a cookie jar," said Judge King, a Republican, who helped lead the fight to oust them, "or a Democratic pension fund."
Politicians of many ethnic backgrounds have succeeded or nearly succeeded in Hawaiian politics in recent years, including Jews, an Italian-American, a Chinese and the current governor, Benjamin J. Cayetano, who is of Filipino stock. But nobody doubts that Japanese-Americans run the show; they have done so, most of the time, since 1962, and their leading figure, Senator Daniel J. Inouye, remains the state's dominant politician. Wounded in World War II as a member of the storied 442nd Regimental Combat Team, the most highly decorated unit in American history, he has held high public office since 1954.
Democrats have clung to power, with a few close calls, with the help of the longshoremen in the 1950's and 60's and the public employees' unions since then. They reward their friends and punish their enemies. After complaining about a futile 13-year struggle to gain planning permission for a Waikiki project, a prominent local businessman smiled and said: "But you can't expect any more. We belong to the wrong tribe here. We're Republicans."
The East-West Center at the University of Hawaii, which many Hawaiians had hoped would make their islands the Pacific's gathering place, has developed more slowly than many had hoped, hobbled by cuts in federal appropriations.
From time to time, someone proposes a new idea for diversifying the economy: high tech, biotech, aquaculture. So far, none has really caught on, largely because of a lack of capital and of the needed skills.
"There's also a lack of leadership," Mr. Burris said. "The government is stone-honest, but it's out of gas, out of ideas. To tell you the truth, we have a kind of cargo-cult mentality here. We look up at the sky and tell ourselves: 'Something will happen, because it always has. Pearl Harbor. Jumbo jets. The Japanese land boom. Something.' "
 
A Solitary Capital
With more than three-quarters of Hawaii's people and three-quarters of its jobs, Honolulu thoroughly dominates its state. It is a smallish city, with a metropolitan population of 865,000, about the same as greater Albany, and a relatively slow rate of growth. It is remarkable in its isolation. It can be reached from the rest of the United States, of course, only by sea or by air. No other city of significant population leads such a solitary existence.
Tokyo is 3,860 miles away, Los Angeles 2,553 miles away.
Yet this is the crossroads of the Pacific, and on one day in its history it grasped the nation's consciousness as few other cities of its size ever have. That day was Dec. 7, 1941, the fateful day the Japanese staged a sneak attack on Honolulu and its great naval anchorage at Pearl Harbor, the day Franklin D. Roosevelt vowed would "live in infamy," the day the United States was brusquely plunged into World War II.
Honolulu remains a military town. Big installations lie all around its periphery: the Army at Schofield Barracks, the Air Force at Hickam Field, the Navy at Pearl Harbor and the Pacific Command at Camp H. M. Smith. High above the city, in the volcanic crater known as Punchbowl, 33,230 of the dead from World War II, Korea and Vietnam are buried on gentle, grassy slopes. One of them is the most famous American war correspondent, Ernie Pyle.
 
The Day to Remember
Moving as the Punchbowl is, it cannot match the emotional wallop delivered by the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial, a simple structure built athwart the sunken hulk of one of the battleships sunk almost 60 years ago by Japanese dive bombers and torpedo planes as they lay at anchor off Ford's Island in Pearl Harbor, long known as "the Gibraltar of the Pacific." Shattered by a 1,760-pound armor-piercing bomb that ignited the forward ammunition magazine, the Arizona went down in a mere nine minutes, with the loss of 1,177 of its crew, including the captain.
More than 1.5 million people visit the site every year, and on almost every day some are Japanese. At a visitor center on shore, operated by the National Park Service, a powerful but remarkably unjingoistic film, narrated by the actress Stockard Channing, supplies the historical context.
Transported to the memorial by launch, the visitor sees an American flag flying from a pole attached to a rusty strut that once supported one of the ship's tripod towers. The base of a gun turret and several other bits of corroded metal protrude from the water, and fuel oil, still leaking slowly from a ruptured tank below, forms a kaleidoscopic slick on the surface.
A few hundred yards away, another battleship, the U.S.S. Missouri, rides at anchor. Japan formally surrendered on the Missouri's deck on Sept. 2, 1945, in Tokyo Bay.
The beginning and the end come together at Pearl Harbor.
Names of the Arizona crew members whose war ended in its first hour are inscribed on a marble wall at the memorial. Among them, I discovered to my astonishment -- to my horror, really -- is my own. My head spun and my eyes must have bugged when I saw it up there: R. W. Apple. Who was he?
His name, a helpful park service historian told me, was not really identical to mine; he was Robert William, and I am Raymond Walter. He was from Illinois, a fireman first class, meaning he tended the ship's huge boilers. No relative, as far as I know, yet Apple is not a common name, and I feel linked to him just the same. In the past, I always thought of my father when someone mentioned Pearl Harbor because I had been driving around with him when word of the attack came over the radio on that Sunday afternoon long ago. From now on I will also think of this other R. W. Apple, perishing on the Arizona.

Mr. Schmidt, an economist in his mid-30's, had just bought a stereo receiver, amplifier, compact disk player and a pair of big speakers. 
 "This is something I have wanted to do for a long time," Mr. Schmidt said. "I am feeling very good."
He is not the only one. For the first time in years, consumers in Germany and across much of Europe are beginning to save a little less and spend a little more. In the run-up to Christmas, they have been splurging on mobile phones, computers, trendy clothes, toys and perfumes.
In Germany, Europe's biggest economy, many retailers say their sales have climbed more briskly than at any time since the early 1990's. In France, popular shopping areas have been packed throughout the Christmas season. At the Gallerie Lafayette in downtown Paris, sales in the last week before Christmas were 7 percent higher than a year earlier. At Marionnaud, a French perfume retailer, Christmas sales are up 30 percent.
In Italy, where the government prodded shoppers by giving taxpayers a $180 refund in November, retailing executives are hoping that sales this Christmas will be 15 percent higher than in 1999.
By usual American standards, it is still a modest shopping spree. Executives and analysts predict that retail sales will climb just 2 percent in Germany and slightly more in countries like France, Europe's two biggest economies. That is not much better than in the United States, where retailers are moaning about an unexpectedly painful slowdown in business.
But by European standards, the renewed willingness to spend is a big change. For years now, European consumers have been so frugal that they constituted a drag on overall economic growth. They had good reason: unemployment rose steadily through most of the 1990's; tax burdens, already high, climbed even higher; economic growth, heavily dependent on exports, stalled on several occasions.
Here in Germany, retail sales have been essentially flat for four years. At the same time, price competition has become steadily more ferocious. The result has been slumping profits or big losses at many of the country's biggest retailers. Even Wal-Mart Stores, which acquired and renovated two shopping chains, has been struggling to make money here.
Now, many economists predict that consumer spending will be an important source of economic growth. Unemployment has begun to decline, promoting an increase in consumer confidence. Tax cuts in Germany and France are expected to leave extra money in consumers' hands. And even though the stock markets have plunged in Europe as much as in the United States, European consumers have been less vulnerable because they invest less than Americans.
"This will be a strong year for retailing," said Serge Solie, an industry analyst at EIFB, the brokerage arm of Credit Industriel et Commercial de Paris. "The main reason is that we will see, once more, a decrease in the unemployment rate. If that indicator is on a good trend, it will be a good year."
According to the German Retail Association, the mood among shopkeepers is much better today than it was one year ago. Industry surveys suggest that sales climbed 2 percent this year and will climb another 2.5 percent next year. Modest as that sounds, it is the first real increase in sales, after adjusting for inflation, in several years.
That does not mean that boom times have suddenly returned. German car sales have plummeted in the last year, mainly in the area of midprice and low-price vehicles. And even though computer sales have been fairly strong, competition has become so tough that stores have steeply cut prices and their margins.
Ernst Schmid, the owner of HiFi Profis, a chain of three stores specializing in upscale stereo and television products, is pessimistic. "I would have to say the consumer climate has actually gotten worse," he said today, just a few minutes after he had booked the big sale of equipment to Tobias Schmidt.
Still the improvement in consumer mood is palpable even here. Today, three days after Christmas, Germans were flooding their main shopping districts. At the Sport Halle, a big downtown store in Frankfurt devoted entirely to sports merchandise, clerks were so busy that the top manager had to step in and help ring up sales.
Though Germany continues to have restrictive shopping laws -- stores were closed on Christmas Eve because it was a Sunday -- they are increasingly ignoring regulations that are supposed to prevent them from advertising big markdowns. In practice, stores have been filled for weeks with special offers as audacious as at any American retailer.
All of that may or may not mean that retailers finally enjoy a good year in 2001. But for consumers like Alexander Gemeinder, an 18-year-old who recently landed a job as an office assistant, prospects are almost certainly cheerier. With money in his wallet, Mr. Gemeinder recently bought three watches to match different sets of clothes.
"This year was definitely better than the year before," he said. "I think things will be better in the year ahead as well."

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Declined In December

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 28

 BODY:
Consumer confidence in the economy fell in December to the lowest level in two years as stocks slumped and energy costs rose, a private survey showed today.
The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence dropped to 128.3 in December -- the lowest since December 1998 -- from 132.6 in November. In 1985, the average index reading was 100. 
 "It's pretty clear that the falloff of the stock market is taking its toll on confidence," said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics in Pepper Pike, Ohio. He said that suggested consumers would be more conservative in their buying.
Another report showed sales of previously owned homes rose more than expected in November as cheaper mortgage rates supported one of the pillars of the record 10-year economic expansion.
The Conference Board's index measuring consumers' expectations for the economy six months from now also fell to a two-year low. The outlook index dropped to 95.8 this month from 101.2 in November and was the lowest since October 1998.
Fed policy makers and economists watch the confidence report to gauge how changes in confidence might affect consumer spending.
"If expectations continue on this downward trend, a more severe economic slowdown may be on the horizon," said Lynn Franco, an economist at the Conference Board in New York.
One reason for a drop in consumer optimism is rising energy costs. Heating bills will be substantially higher this winter than forecast a month ago after a surge in natural gas prices and low supplies of oil, the Energy Department said earlier this month.
Also, after enjoying several years of stock market gains, investors have seen the values of their portfolios shrink this year. The Dow Jones industrial average is down more than 5 percent this year and the Nasdaq composite index has slumped more than 37 percent.
That has not kept consumers from buying homes, though, especially as mortgage rates drop. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to a year-and-a-half low of 7.13 percent this week, according to Freddie Mac. The rate has stayed below 8 percent since mid-August.
Sales of previously owned homes rose 4.4 percent, to an annual rate of 5.22 million in November, according to the National Association of Realtors. That left sales on pace for 5.01 million units this year, second only to the record 5.2 million in 1999.
A drop in optimism is one reason home sales probably will fall next year, according to an association forecast.
Companies are starting to lay off workers to trim costs, which is likely to further weaken consumer confidence. The number of Americans who filed for the first time for state jobless benefits fell 23,000 last week to 333,000, the Labor Department reported today, adding that holiday estimates by states may lead to large revisions in last week's numbers.

HEADLINE: At Last, We Elders Get Some Respect

BYLINE: By Annie Gottlieb; Annie Gottlieb is writing a book on turning 50.

 BODY:
Now that the election fracas is behind us, those of us with gray hair should be the ones to lead our riven country's healing process, former Senator Alan Simpson has suggested. Though he was referring specifically to fellow elder statesmen like Bob Dole and Howard Baker, I bet I'm not the only one with gray hair who's silently cheering.
Having been a little girl in the feminine-mystique 50's, I'm still thrilled every time I see a woman senator, astronaut, surgeon, soldier or firefighter. Having entered my 50's in the brutally youth-besotted 90's, I'm now even more thrilled every time I see a frankly "mature" person -- as the euphemism goes -- claim our culture's center stage. 
 We've seen a lot of them lately. All it takes is a constitutional crisis to bring the people who really run the country out of the woodwork -- and they've got lines in their faces and gray in their hair. But even before the election, there was a shift in the wind. This fall, people in their 60's and 70's turned up as stars on a spate of new television commercials. Cuban septuagenarian Ibrahim Ferrer of Buena Vista Social Club won the Latin Grammy for best new artist. A mediascape that not long ago was monotonously smooth, spandexed and nubile has now sprouted an intriguing crop of wrinkles, bumps and age spots. Older people, it seems, are suddenly cool.
I date the turn of the tide to the downturn of the Internet economy. I remember hearing a silver-haired fund manager on CNBC say back in April that the young guys in his firm were no longer coming to him to tell him they knew better. Chastened dot-com hotshots in their 20's are now turning to seasoned executives for advice on how to make a real-world business work. Suddenly maturity and experience are something to be worn in public, a silver badge of what's been gathered and gained, not just a crumpled record of what's been lost.
I know this sounds like a thinly disguised gloat of a resurgent baby boomer. Believe me, young ones, it isn't. It's more of a call for balance and exchange.
We live in a remarkably age-segregated society. Our country is studded with college campuses, singles bars, office parks and Sun Belt retirement communities where there's little, if any, interaction between generations. But isolating youth from age, each in its own cozy, customized ghetto, has impoverished both. Could it be that, whatever our age, we're finally finding a monoculture of our peers too one-dimensional?
Before the 1960's, the viewpoint of older people probably dominated society too much. In recent years (and yes, we boomers started it), the pendulum has swung too far the other way. In a culture ruled by a commercial caricature of youth, even young people suffer. Values meant to sustain everyone, like loyalty, community, continuity and "the long view," are dismissed as boring (or unprofitable) and banished to the gray ghetto.
Each stage of life really shines only in the setting of the others, like a jewel in a ring. We need one another -- young, middle-aged and old. The truth is, we who are no longer young know we need you -- your energy, freshness, fire. It's gratifying to see that you still need us.

Positive Data Cool Trading In Treasuries

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Treasury prices were mixed yesterday after a jump in sales of existing homes and gains by Wall Street stocks quieted talk that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates before its policy meeting late next month.
The National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes rose a strong 4.4 percent in November to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 5.22 million units in November, well above an expected 4.9 million homes. 
 The buoyant housing market overshadowed a report showing that consumer confidence sank to its lowest level in two years, a further sign of a weakening economy that has sent investors scrambling to buy low-risk government debt.
The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence fell from 132.6 in November, to 128.3 in December -- its lowest reading since December 1998. But the drop was foreshadowed by a sharp decline in a separate consumer sentiment index released last week.
"The drop in confidence is not too surprising," said Henry Willmore, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital. "But home sales were significantly stronger than expected."
Consumer confidence has an important influence on consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of economic growth. Stronger home sales can bolster activity by spurring construction and purchases of durable goods like home appliances and furniture.
Furthermore, American blue-chip stocks pushed higher for the fifth consecutive day and even the battered technology shares put together a three-day rally, taking some luster from bonds and reducing the risk that eroding stock wealth could drag the economy lower still, prompting swift action by the Fed.
"The fact that the stock market is starting to act a little better might forestall talk of an intermeeting rate cut," said Bill Hornbarger, chief fixed-income strategist at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 2/32, to a price of 104 25/32. The note's yield was unchanged at 5.11 percent.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 5/32, to 111 25/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.44 percent from 5.45 percent on Wednesday.

Dow Finishes With Gain For 5th Consecutive Session

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks moved higher in heavy trading yesterday as investors contemplated earnings, the economy, their taxes and waning consumer confidence. Bargain hunting led to solid gains in the Dow Jones industrial average, which rose for the fifth consecutive session, but investors waffled when it came to technology.
"They are basically putting together some judgments about next year," said Barry Hyman, chief investment strategist for Weatherly Securities. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 65.60 points, or 0.6 percent, to 10,868.76. The Nasdaq composite index, which fluctuated throughout the day, was up 18.41 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,557.76, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 5.30 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,334.22.
Gains were limited to stocks that inspired some confidence in investors, who also continued selling companies, high-technology ones especially, with a weak earnings outlook.
A big question on Wall Street is whether the Nasdaq will be able to end the year on a three-day winning streak. Since Labor Day the tech-focused index has not had more than two straight upward sessions.
If stock market history repeats, Friday will be a winner as investors wrap up tax-related selling and move on to bargain hunting, said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst for Wachovia Securities.
"Historically, the last day of the year has an 85 percent chance of being an up day," Mr. Harrington said.
Mr. Harrington also predicted that the market would not be deprived of its annual January effect, in which money comes back into the market after investors have sold stocks in December for tax purposes. He said investors are likely to use the money to snatch up deals in the beaten-down technology sector, off about 40 percent for the year.
"Once we get into January, we might have a whole change of character in the market," Mr. Harrington said. "You have a very good chance of a very rigorous technical rebound in so many of these battered stocks."
But the tech beating continued yesterday.
Dell Computer and I.B.M. suffered in the early going on news that Prudential Securities lowered fourth-quarter estimates for the two computer makers. Dell was off 6 cents, to finish at $17.94, while I.B.M. fluctuated. It gained 56 cents, to $85.25. The Dow's gains were limited by the latest evidence that less-confident consumers are buying fewer computers. Intel lost $1.63, to $30.94. Microsoft fell $1.88, to $44.56.
The New York-based Conference Board reported earlier in the day that consumer confidence in December fell to its lowest level in two years, dipping slightly below analysts' forecasts.
But retailing stocks, which have suffered as shoppers have become more frugal, were mixed. Best Buy rose $1.81, to $28.56, but Gap fell 50 cents, to $25.06.
Blue chip sectors were again viewed as safer bets during a moderating economy and bearish market. Merck, the drug maker, rose $2.06, to $94.75, and Humana, the health insurer, advanced 44 cents, to $15.38.
Financial issues trended up, analysts said, because they will benefit if the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates next month as expected. J. P. Morgan rose $1.38, to $173.
Another factor in yesterday's session was window dressing, an end-of-quarter attempt by mutual fund managers and other institutional investors to make their holdings look better by dumping poor performers and picking up hot stocks. "People are just straightening out their portfolios, getting rid of their losers," Mr. Hyman said.

HEADLINE: First Union's Work in Progress

BYLINE: By RIVA D. ATLAS

 BODY:
G. Kennedy Thompson has been waging an uphill battle to win over Wall Street ever since being named chief executive of the First Union Corporation in March.
In his nine months on the job, Mr. Thompson, 50, has taken bold steps to revamp First Union, which with $247 billion in assets is the nation's sixth-largest banking company. First Union has been in turmoil after two ill-fated acquisitions and disappointing earnings that have taken the stock from a high of $66 a share in July 1998 to a recent low of $24. (It closed yesterday at $28.75.) His most aggressive action was a $3.8 billion pretax charge announced in June, one of the largest ever taken by an American corporation. 
Still, Wall Street remains skeptical. First Union's stock has fallen 4 percent since Mr. Thompson was appointed to his post, and trades at less than 10 times this year's estimated earnings.
It is no surprise that investors are wary. Mr. Thompson has yet to prove he is capable of doing more than patching up First Union. For its stock to revive, he must demonstrate he can position the bank to grow.
Investors say Mr. Thompson is making sensible decisions, but until they see evidence that the company is back on track, they are reluctant to give him the benefit of the doubt.
"I admire Ken Thompson's candor and honesty," said Thomas Finucane, a portfolio manager of John Hancock's Regional Bank Fund, a longtime shareholder. "But investors have lost a lot of money in the stock. Management needs to restore its credibility."
To be sure, Mr. Thompson faces some daunting challenges. Retail banking, which accounts for 30 percent of operating profits, is a mature business, with consumers continuing to shift assets out of savings accounts and into brokerage firms.
Since 1994, the bank has been aggressively diversifying into the brokerage, money management and capital markets businesses, which in recent years have been fast-growing areas. But these are linked to the economy and financial markets, and, at least in the near term, are not likely to deliver the profits the bank had anticipated.
Mr. Thompson acknowledges the markets will slow his plans, but is confident that in time he will win investors over. "I'd love for the stock to be at $50 a share, but I don't go home and beat myself up," he said in an interview at the bank's Charlotte, N.C., headquarters earlier this month. "I can't emphasize enough how focused we are on creating shareholder value."
Last week, Mr. Thompson demonstrated this focus, announcing that he was cutting First Union's annual dividend of $1.92 a share in half, saving $1 billion annually.
Mr. Thompson said he cut the dividend to give the bank a cushion against worsening conditions in the capital markets. "We heard specifically from a number of shareholders that a stronger balance sheet and lower dividend payout would be attractive to them," he said.
Mr. Thompson, who comes across as earnest and determined, is not nearly as charismatic as First Union's previous chief executive, Edward E. Crutchfield Jr., who in 16 years took what was once a sleepy North Carolina bank through a dizzying 82 acquisitions, building a retail banking franchise that extends across 11 states.
Two of Mr. Crutchfield's later deals sent First Union into a tailspin it is still trying to recover from. In November 1997, it acquired the CoreStates Financial Corporation in Philadelphia for $20 billion, paying a record six times book value -- to this day the highest such multiple paid in a large banking deal, according to SNL Securities, a Charlottesville, Va., research firm. Later that year, it paid $2.1 billion for the Money Store, a subprime lender.
By 1999, problems stemming from the CoreStates deal hit First Union's bottom line. Twice last year, First Union was forced to reduce its earnings expectations.
Mr. Crutchfield said he was stepping down in March, but despite the bank's woes, he was not pushed. Disclosing he had lymphoma, he said he wanted to focus on his treatment.
Within months of his promotion, Mr. Thompson took action. In June, he announced the $3.8 billion pretax write-off, which would cover shutting down the Money Store, an admission that the deal had been a failure. The bank also wrote down the value of certain corporate loans, and announced plans to sell its mortgage servicing and credit card operations and shed several branches.
Mr. Thompson further proved his willingness to own up to the bank's problems after First Union filed its third-quarter financial statement on Nov. 13. In that filing, First Union disclosed that it might have to reclassify a large loan as nonperforming in the fourth quarter, thanks to deterioration in the operations of the borrower (while First Union did not disclose the borrower or the loan size, industry executives said the bank was referring to a $450 million loan to Sunbeam, the housewares maker).
The bank could have left it to analysts to comb through the document and find the information for themselves. But its chief risk officer, Robert Nimmo, called attention to the write-down at an analysts' conference in Charlotte the next day. The purpose of the conference was for bank executives to describe their plans for the future, but Mr. Nimmo's words drew analysts' attention back to the unpleasant present.
It must have been frustrating for First Union's executives to see analysts so easily distracted. And First Union's honesty won it few plaudits: the bank's stock dropped 9 percent that day as shareholders worried that a softening economy meant more troubled loans were lurking.
But while analysts have been busy handicapping First Union's potential loan losses, an ultimately more important question is how well positioned the bank's businesses are, particularly in a softening economy.
Mr. Thompson has made progress fixing the retail banking franchise, and the bank's brokerage and money management business is doing well. But the outlook for capital markets, still a work in progress, is clouded by the recent downturn on Wall Street.
At first, it seemed that retail banking would be Mr. Thompson's biggest problem, as the bank struggled to recover from missteps after the CoreStates acquisition. Soon after the deal closed, First Union began an initiative aimed at directing customers away from branch personnel and toward phone lines or the Internet. That backfired, and First Union lost more than 20 percent of the two million CoreStates customers.
First Union has started to correct the problem. Retail deposits are up 0.6 percent from February through the end of October, according to a bank spokeswoman.
The retail bank should benefit from an expected decline in interest rates. Still, even in the best of situations, Mr. Thompson is aiming for earnings growth of 6 percent from this business over an economic cycle.
While retail banking seems on the right track, Mr. Thompson is hitting turbulence in the capital markets. "It's unfortunate, because they needed the growth in these businesses to make up for the retail bank," Mr. Finucane of Hancock said.
First Union is confronting a slowdown on Wall Street, particularly in corporate lending, which accounts for more than half the division's revenue.
It has captured a respectable share of the lending market, and is ranked fourth among lenders to highly indebted companies, up from 11th place five years ago, according to preliminary data from the Loan Pricing Corporation, a research firm. But the business is in a cyclical slowdown, as a weakening economy makes it difficult for borrowers to meet obligations.
Not only are new loans scarce but after the Sunbeam disclosure, investors worry that First Union will be forced to mark down more loans on its books. Mr. Thompson says these fears are overblown, noting that the next largest nonperforming loan on the bank's books is less than one-tenth the size of Sunbeam's. Still, even a pile of smallish loans could hurt earnings.
In its other Wall Street businesses, First Union has made minimal progress despite the long bull market. It ranks 14th among underwriters of high-yield bonds this year, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data, and just 32nd among advisers to mergers valued at $250 million or less, the market singled out by First Union. (The bank says a lot of the deals it works on are private and therefore are not credited in the rankings.) It is ranked just 38th among equity underwriters.
First Union has been in the equity business less than three years, and while it is rarely the lead banker, it has garnered some co-manager slots on stock offerings. But the business is still operating at a loss, a First Union spokeswoman confirmed.
"We don't measure our success by league tables," Mr. Thompson said, referring to Wall Street rankings, but he said the bank was looking to slow expense growth in the area. First Union recently laid off seven securities analysts and cut a few investment banking jobs.
"We still see capital markets as a growth engine for us, but there will certainly be less growth in the short to intermediate term," he said.
The most stable of First Union's businesses is capital management, which includes brokerage accounts and money management. The division has $173 billion in assets under management, up from $47 billion in 1995. First Union is now the nation's sixth-largest brokerage firm, and its $86 billion Evergreen Funds division is the 20th-largest mutual fund family, according to bank statistics.
While First Union has been an active acquirer of mutual fund and brokerage firms, nearly 25 percent of the division's growth has been from market appreciation, said Donald McMullen Jr., head of capital management. That growth could slow in the near term, he acknowledges, amid a choppy market climate.
Mr. Thompson is promising earnings growth of 15 percent annually from capital markets and capital management, but the markets' downturn means that goal is probably a few years away. "We've hit a speed bump, as have others in the industry," he said. "It will slow our progress, but it won't change our direction."
Still, Mr. Thompson does not have an endless amount of time to execute his plan. With a cheap stock and an enviable franchise in some of the wealthiest markets on the East Coast, some investors say the bank could prove a tempting takeover target. The most likely buyer: FleetBoston Financial, which has a robust franchise in New England but is looking to expand in the mid-Atlantic region.
What may buy Mr. Thompson time is that Fleet probably cannot afford to do a deal right now. While its stock has not performed nearly as poorly as First Union's, it is still trading at just 11 times expected earnings, making it a weak currency for deal making.
"First Union's management would be out of their minds to sell at the present time," says H. Rodgin Cohen, chairman of the New York law firm Sullivan & Cromwell and a longtime legal adviser to the bank. "If I am right as to the value of the franchise, it is an absolute steal right now."
Mr. Thompson says he has no plans to surrender control anytime soon. "We think we can build shareholder value by instituting our own plan," he said.
For First Union and its competitors, a lot will depend on the health of the economy. "We think all the bad news is in the stock. It's a great franchise," says Alan Straus, an analyst for the Merrill Lynch Basic Value Fund, who has been adding to an existing stake in First Union. "There's probably 50 percent upside from here, looking out two years." Still, he adds, "If there's a serious recession, all bets are off."

HEADLINE: Levi Jackson, a Pioneer at Yale, Is Dead at 74

BYLINE: By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN

 BODY:
Levi Jackson, a star running back whose selection as Yale's first black football captain in November 1948 drew national attention as a symbol of racial progress in American life, died on Dec. 7 at his home in Detroit. He was 74.
The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said. 
 When the Yale football players selected a captain for the 1949 season, it was only 19 months after Jackie Robinson had broken major league baseball's color barrier. There had been only one black football captain among Ivy League teams, but that was in 1893, when William Lewis, a center for Harvard, was named acting captain after the regular one was hurt.
So when Yale selected the first black football player in the school's history to be its 70th football captain, newspaper and magazine editorials hailed the choice, and scores of congratulatory letters arrived at Yale.
Levi Alexander Jackson was as surprised as anyone.
"Bill Conway, who was the captain in 1948, raised a glass of Champagne and said, 'Here's to the 1949 captain,' " Jackson remembered. "When he mentioned my name, I almost fell out of my seat."
But Jackson seemed a logical choice.
As a freshman, playing fullback and punting for Yale's nationally ranked team, he ran for 806 yards, fifth most in the nation, and was cited by the Gridiron Club of Boston as the best college football player in New England. He was hampered by injuries as a sophomore, but led Yale in every offensive category except passing in his junior year.
Jackson was a "townie," having played football and basketball at Hillhouse High School in New Haven before joining the Camp Lee, Va., football team while serving in the Army in 1945. His father was a chef and steward at Yale dining halls.
Encouraged to attend Yale by his high school coach, Reggie Root, a former tackle and head football coach for the Elis who was rejoining Yale as an assistant coach, Jackson enrolled with most of his tuition financed under the G.I. Bill. But he arrived with much apprehension.
"I was the last of six kids, the only one who got a college education," he recalled. "I had the feeling that I did not belong in a rich man's institution. I'm a high school graduate and I'm going to school with a lot of prep school grads who went to Choate and Exeter."
Four years later, he graduated with majors in sociology, psychology and economics. He set 13 modern Yale football records, and his 2,049 career rushing yards are the sixth most in Yale history. He also played basketball at Yale, and was the first black student in one of Yale's socially prestigious senior societies, selected by Berzelius.
Jackson joined the Ford Motor Company in 1950 and held major executive positions in urban affairs and labor relations. After the 1967 Detroit riots, he worked with the New Detroit Committee, which was formed by business and community leaders to create job opportunities for inner-city residents at Ford and other companies. In 1969, at the height of the Vietnam War, he was appointed to the National Selective Service Appeal Board, which settled disputes over eligibility for the military draft. He retired from Ford in 1983 as a vice president.
Jackson is survived by two daughters, Denyse Jackson, of Detroit, and Sherrill Jackson, of Rochester Hills, Mich.; and two sisters, Mable Coleman and Phyllis Winston, both of Boston.
Amid the success at Yale, Jackson faced a few unpleasant moments in his athletic career. But his teammates rallied behind him.
When the basketball team stopped in Dallas on a trip to the West Coast, Jackson was denied access to a hotel dining room. The other players ate with him at the manager's office.
Jackson remembered a moment near the end of the football team's 35-0 loss to Vanderbilt at Yale Bowl in 1948. As he told it: "One of their centers got in the game. He said, 'You better watch yourself, brother,' and started jawing, 'Nobody comes through here, particularly you.' He was pointing at me.
"One of our guards stood up and said, 'Hey, if you were any good, you would have been in the game a long time ago.' That shut him up."

HEADLINE: Montgomery Ward to Close Its Doors

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN with CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
Montgomery Ward & Company, once the greatest American retailer and the pioneer of many sales practices that became widely accepted, said yesterday that it would go out of business after 128 years.
The company, owned by General Electric, said it would close its 250 stores and dismiss the 28,000 associates who run them in the coming months. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection yesterday for a second and final time and eliminated 450 national jobs immediately. The company is based in Chicago and now operates in 30 states. The stores closest to New York City are in Poughkeepsie and Kingston. 
 Ward said the disappointing holiday season was the final straw. "Sadly, today's action is unavoidable," said Roger Goddu, chairman and chief executive, in a statement. "Overall weak holiday sales and a very difficult retail environment simply did not permit us to complete the turnaround that might have been possible in an otherwise thriving economy."
But whatever the immediate reason, Ward's demise was long in the cards. Retail historians date the start of the decline to the postwar boom of the 1950's, when its rival, Sears, Roebuck & Company, moved aggressively into the then nascent suburbs, while Ward, under the steely leadership of its then chief executive, Sewell Avery, hoarded cash and waited for a second Great Depression.
"It has been a slow-motion train wreck," said Sid Doolittle, a Chicago based-retail consultant who was an executive with the company for 28 years.
In 1872 Aaron Montgomery Ward, a traveling dry goods salesman, started selling to farmers by mail through a one-page catalog list. By inventing the general merchandise mail-order catalog, Mr. Ward could keep prices low through bypassing the middlemen, like small-town shopkeepers and itinerant salesmen. Sears was not founded until 14 years later and its catalog came years later still.
In 1875 Mr. Ward pioneered another practice now taken for granted -- "satisfaction guaranteed or your money back."
A decade later, Ward's book was 240 pages and the shopper's bible for America's rural folk. The company went public in 1919 and began opening its own stores in the next decade.
As the company grew into one of the biggest retailers in the country, its colorful history became intertwined with the nation's own.
It was a Ward advertising writer who in 1939 wrote "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" as an illustrated poem to hand out to children visiting Ward's Santa for Christmas.
In 1944, Mr. Avery, the chief executive who would run the company as it lost out to Sears in the 1950's, defied the War Labor Board's attempts to force recognition of a union. President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered that he be seized. Many newspapers published a front-page picture of the unflappable Mr. Avery, his impeccable double-breasted suit and pocket handkerchief unmussed, being carried out of his store by two soldiers.
But Mr. Avery and his company were at their height. It was a perch soon to be lost, however. Mr. Avery had saved Ward in the 1930's from bankruptcy by foreseeing the Great Depression and halting expansion and hoarding cash. He repeated this formula after the war, but this time Sears got it right by spending heavily to be the first to serve consumers in the suburbs blossoming across the nation.
Ward eventually caught on and tried to move to the suburbs, too, but by then Sears was already well ensconced in important malls in good locations at intersections of the emerging interstate highway system. Ward could never catch up.
In an attempt to diversify its assets, Mobil Oil bought 54 percent of the wounded company in 1974 and then the rest two years later. Mobil invested a lot of money, but the company's struggles continued. In 1985 it shut down the catalog business that had made its fame.
Three years later, struggling to free itself from Mobil, Ward instead set the stage for another bout of corporate ownership. GE Capital and Kidder Peabody, then a G.E. subsidiary, helped arrange and finance a $3.8 billion management-led buyout of Montgomery Ward in 1988. GE Capital retained a 50 percent stake in the retailer.
Faced with tough new discount competitors like Target and Wal-Mart, the business continued to flounder and filed for bankruptcy in 1997. By that time, GE Capital had invested $180 million in Montgomery Ward and lent it far more than that. As part of the bankruptcy reorganization, General Electric helped to recapitalize the company, and wound up owning it.
In the years since, General Electric brought in new management and invested heavily in modernizing the stores, but nothing seemed to pump up sales or profits. Several analysts recalled a mid-December meeting with General Electric's chairman, John F. Welch Jr., and Dennis D. Dammerman, chairman of GE Capital Services, at which the two executives acknowledged that Montgomery Ward would lose $227 million after taxes this year. "They cited it as one of a number of situations where they were contemplating taking actions to reduce losses going forward," said Martin A. Sankey, who follows the company for Goldman, Sachs.
General Electric was never particularly enthusiastic about the retail business and, considering the losses, yesterday's announcement did not surprise analysts.
The timing of the Montgomery Ward closing probably had as much to do with taxes and the reporting of earnings as with stanching the losses. General Electric reaped $1.4 billion earlier this year from the sale of its stake in PaineWebber, and that gain will probably be used to offset charges associated with the closing of Montgomery Ward.
"The result is that there would be no net impact on earnings from the closure," Mr. Sankey said. G.E. put out a statement confirming that there would be no impact on earnings.
The rough holiday season has already claimed other casualties. Bradlees, a discount chain in the Northeast, said earlier this week that it was going out of business.

HEADLINE: Lack of Power In the West Proves a Boon For Some

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Dec. 28

 BODY:
Of all the ways in which the West's electricity problems are creating havoc in the marketplace for power, here is one of the strangest: there is a fortune to be made these days in not producing aluminum.
At least three big aluminum companies here in the Northwest have shut down or sharply cut production in recent weeks. Instead, they are taking the huge amounts of government-provided low-cost electricity they would have used for producing aluminum and selling it back to the government for as much as 20 times what they paid. 
 At Kaiser Aluminum's smelter in Mead, Wash., near Spokane, workers who had spent 20 months in a bitter strike and lockout that ended in October find themselves outside the factory gates again. Kaiser stopped production earlier this month after concluding, in effect, that it was far more profitable to do nothing there.
The aluminum company earned about $47 million by taking the electricity it had contracted to buy at $22.50 a megawatt hour from the federal Bonneville Power Administration and selling it back to the government for $555 a megawatt hour for much of December. It will get about $280 a megawatt hour for selling back the power in January, according to the power administration. A megawatt is enough to power about 1,000 average-size homes.
Under pressure from local and federal officials, Kaiser has agreed to pay its employees their regular wages and benefits for now, though it is unclear how long the company will continue to do so, as is the matter of when the plant will reopen. Its current federal contract could allow Kaiser to reap a windfall from reselling electricity through next October.
"This whole thing is a business deal, I understand, but it still feels like a slap in the face," said Joe Lerch, a maintenance millwright with 22 years of experience at the smelter, where his father, brother and son have also worked. "I'd rather be working. I really would."
With California hovering near a breakdown in its electricity supply system in recent weeks, and with Northwest suppliers under orders by the federal government to ship power south, the decision to curtail electricity-intensive industries like aluminum producers is not irrational, federal power planners say.
And the low-cost contracts that were signed years ago, guaranteeing the industries a set amount of electricity at a set price, were generally regarded at the time as important economic tools to keep industry and jobs in the region.
That was before the wholesale price of electricity skyrocketed because of the shortage.
"Some people are asking now, Why would you sign a contract like that way back in 1995?" said Mike Hansen, a spokesman for the Bonneville Power Administration, a federal agency that distributes hydropower from 29 dams in the Northwest. "The answer is, we needed them as much as they needed us back then."
Under their contracts, the power administration says, Kaiser and other companies are required to keep much of any windfall in the community, in part by continuing to pay workers and in part by reinvesting proceeds to improve their plants.
For instance, power officials said today that they were close to concluding an arrangement with Golden Northwest Aluminum, a major producer with plants in The Dalles, Ore., and Goldendale, Wash.
Under the deal, the two plants plan to shut most of their operations for several months and resell the electricity.
Part of the proceeds are to be reinvested in upgrading the plants and in financing new power-generating capacity, including gas- and wind-powered generators that would make the plants energy self-sufficient by 2007. The 1,200 workers are to be paid full wages, with most working on the upgrading project or in other jobs at the plants. Some revenue, depending on fluctuations in the market price of electricity, would be refunded to the power administration, letting it lower rates elsewhere.
The deal is still in negotiation, but federal, company and union officials all agreed that it was a responsible way to improve the plants' efficiency and keep jobs in those communities.
"It's really an example of good corporate citizenship," said David Foster, the Northwest regional director of the United Steelworkers of America. "The needs of ratepayers, workers and the regional economy are all being addressed in this."
Mr. Foster said he hoped that Kaiser would make the same commitment.
But the future of Kaiser's smelter, and of the workers, remains uncertain. Scott Lamb, a spokesman for Kaiser, which is 63 percent owned by the Maxxam Inc. of Houston, said the company "certainly wants to do what is right and fair" at the plant.
Under their contract, most workers are guaranteed least 70 percent of their base pay after Feb. 1, even if they remain out of work, while the company is likely to continue reselling its electricity through October.
At that point, its government contract expires. Under new contracts, negotiated in recent months as demand for electricity intensified, Kaiser, Golden Northwest and Columbia Falls Aluminum of Montana -- which has also cut back on manufacturing and resold power -- will not be allowed to resell unused electricity.
Mr. Hansen said the power administration believed that Kaiser had "contractual obligations" to keep the revenue it derived from reselling power in the local economy.
Mr. Lamb, the Kaiser spokesman, noted that Kaiser had undertaken a risk by signing long-term fixed-price contracts five years ago, at times paying more than the market price it could have gotten for electricity elsewhere.
"Unequivocally, it is economically more feasible to sell the power now," said Mr. Lamb. "The company is trying to manage its assets to maximum potential, and in this case we find ourselves in an unusual situation where we can generate far more cash by selling electricity than we can by making aluminum."
After Oct. 1, Mr. Lamb said, Kaiser intends to restart the smelter at at least 40 percent of its full capacity.
Dan Russell, president of Local 329 of the Steelworkers, said the company should use its profits from reselling power to upgrade the plant.
"If they take that money and do the right thing, a year or two from now we could say that was a good move, you took care of us, you took care of the plant and we're all better for it," said Mr. Russell, a crane operator with 32 years at the plant. "That's my optimistic viewpoint of what they'd do. But we'll just wait and see. They could also just take the money and run."

HEADLINE: The 4th Day of Christmas: 3,000 Philosophers Thinking

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
When 3,000 philosophers get together in one place, you might expect them to focus on some of the hotter philosophical issues of the day: Bush versus Gore as seen through the eyes of Kant; a post-empiricist critique of the validity of counting dimpled chads; an Aristotelian analysis of the chances of a recession.
But a stroll yesterday through the seminar rooms and informal gossip sessions of the 97th annual meeting of the American Philosophical Association, Eastern Division, found that philosophers are not given to instantaneous reactions to the course of human events, and they are certainly no longer king. 
 George Matthews, an instructor at the Pennsylvania College of Technology -- where, he said, it is not uncommon to be teaching philosophy to welding students -- said that the problem with the gathering was "the problem philosophy professors face every day."
"The reputation of philosophy," he said, "is that it is difficult and useless, as my students tell me every day. Unfortunately, this is not the best grounds for disproving that."
The association, with 10,000 members, is meeting for three days, through tomorrow, at the New York Hilton. It is the philosophical world's big meeting of the year, though there are smaller meetings of the Central and Pacific divisions at other times.
If one thing united these philosophers, from the association officers to the lowliest adjunct professor, it was a passion for their calling, their inferiority complex and uncertainty about the economic and intellectual future of their subject.
In theory, 21st-century philosophers, much like Socrates and Plato in ancient Greece, could be speaking out on the great issues of the day, putting a more sophisticated spin on them than, say, priests, rabbis, lawyers, politicians and newspaper reporters. Roger S. Gottlieb, professor of philosophy at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts, pointed out that it was the philosopher and theologian Paul Tillich who said that God is whatever is of ultimate concern. So religious leaders and philosophers, Professor Gottlieb added, "are really working the same beat."
Yet preachers loom large in American society, while the public profile of philosophers has shrunk steadily since John Dewey (1859-1952), a leader of this very association, brought reforms to education, Mr. Gottlieb said. Even at this conference, the stars of the philosophical world -- Peter Singer, Richard Rorty -- were represented by their books, rather than in person.
Pristinely impractical, the association didn't even attempt to make news; unlike conventions for teachers, say, or toy manufacturers, there was no press operation, nor even a press release. Asked to recommend a topical seminar, Stephen O'Sullivan, a philosophy instructor at Suffolk County Community College on Long Island, thumbed through the 242-page program, past classical programs like Locke and Berkeley ("Locke, Stock and Barrel," as they say in the trade) to Applied Ontology and -- in the current events category -- "Gun Control," all the while fretting, "I'm looking, I'm struggling for you," before giving up.
The conference was packed with graduate and postdoctoral students there for the "meat market," as one put it, the evening cocktail parties where university officials recruit young professors, and where as many as 200 to 300 candidates might be seeking a single position.
"Sometimes philosophers get so absorbed in the internal structure of what they're doing that they only talk to themselves," said J. B. Schneewind, chairman of the board of officers of the American Philosophical Association.
Many of the younger philosophers at the conference, like Kathleen Dougherty, a postdoctoral student at the University of Maryland, said they were specializing in ethics. With ethics a rising concern on Wall Street, in medicine, in the law and in family life, you would think there might be a high demand for ethicist philosophers in private industry. But few do go into private industry, Dr. Dougherty said, because most are more interested in theoretical than practical ethics.
Dr. Dougherty, cradling her 6-month-old daughter, Emma, said that motherhood had made her a bit more down to earth. "Parenthood does make you wonder whether we care too much about philosophy and not enough about real life," she said.

HEADLINE: Mayor, With Legacy in Mind, Wants to Seal It in the Charter

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that he would name a commission to propose changes in the City Charter to "institutionalize" the work of his administration after he leaves office at the end of next year.
The revisions would be the third time in four years that the mayor has tried, to great uproar and with mixed success, to change the city's basic governing document. Last year, voters resoundingly defeated charter revisions that the mayor had initially sought to keep Mark Green, the public advocate and a major Giuliani irritant at the time, from succeeding him. Mr. Giuliani later said the proposed charter change was his biggest mistake of the year. 
 Mr. Giuliani did not specify what changes he wants this time, but he said he would discuss them in detail during his State of the City speech next month. He also said that the changes would be "not disputable" and would deal with the mechanics of government. Much of what he was seeking, he added, could be found in "Reinventing Government" by David Osborne and Ted A. Gaebler, the 1992 book about streamlining government that became a bible of the Clinton administration and big-city mayors across the country.
"I'm an exception to the usual approach that runs the city of New York," Mr. Giuliani said. "And therefore, in the eight years that I have in office, I might as well take advantage of that exception, to try to push things in a direction that I think are more positive. And then somebody after me, if they have a different approach, has the perfect right to try to push it back in the other direction. But I also have a right to make it a little difficult to do that."
Mr. Giuliani made his remarks during his annual review for reporters of what he considers his greatest triumphs of the year.
Speaking at City Hall in a relaxed manner in the ornate Committee of the Whole Room, beneath the elaborate domed ceiling and a large painting of James Monroe, Mr. Giuliani began by saying that 2000 "was a difficult year for me personally -- a very challenging year, and one that I'm probably always going to remember and one in which I think I developed a lot."
This past spring, over the course of three chaotic weeks, Mr. Giuliani announced that he had prostate cancer, was seeking a separation from his wife, was involved with another woman and was withdrawing from his United States Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
As his major accomplishments, Mr. Giuliani cited the city's robust economic health, the lowest unemployment rate in a decade, record job growth, a continuing decline in the crime rate, his financial support for the city's cultural institutions, the end of tenure for school principals and the beginning of the end of social promotion of students not academically ready for the next grade.
Mr. Giuliani also said that crime reduction and welfare revision under his administration had helped the city's minorities more than did the work of their own political leaders. He also said that he had no regrets about not having relationships with those leaders.
"If you engage in dialogue with political leaders that pander -- I'm not saying they all do, some do, some don't, some really want change -- then you end up watering down your change so much that nothing changes," Mr. Giuliani said.
Mr. Giuliani said there were many things he regretted during the year, but that he would keep those to himself.

HEADLINE: What's Fair Rent on the Palace? Royalty and the Church Disagree

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
It is a rent fight for the ages.
The Archdiocese of New York is battling with the royal family of Brunei over the rent for the land under the 54-story Palace Hotel, which sits across Madison Avenue from St. Patrick's Cathedral. 
 A corporation tied to the royal family has owned the hotel since 1993, and has paid the archdiocese $1 million a year in rent, a sum unchanged since 1979. But property values in Manhattan have risen enormously since then, and the rate is now up for review under the terms of the lease.
The church wants to get close to $9 million a year for one of the most valuable blockfronts in the city. But according to people involved in the negotiations, the fabulously wealthy royal family of Brunei, a tiny oil-rich sultanate on the Southeast Asian island of Borneo, does not want to pay more than about $4.5 million.
The family contends that the landmark Villard Houses, which adjoin the Palace on Madison Avenue and house the hotel's Gold Room and Le Cirque 2000 restaurant, drag down the value of the hotel.
As with all good real estate disputes, the lawyers are poring over the terms of the lease, which was first signed in 1974 by Harry Helmsley, the original owner of the Palace, and Cardinal Terence Cooke.
The archdiocese is to file suit in State Supreme Court today asking a judge to rule that in valuing the land, according to the language of the lease, it is to be "considered vacant, unimproved and unencumbered," and therefore unaffected by the buildings on the ground.
The next step would be for the two sides to pick an impartial "umpire" to determine the current value of the land, and ultimately, the rent.
"They've been paying $1 million a year since 1979," said David S. Brown, director of real estate for the archdiocese. "You can see it's been quite a bargain. We want a fair result. We don't bring lawsuits very often, if ever. But the diocese uses its funds to serve the religious, charitable, and basic human needs of millions of people in this area."
Real estate experts said it would be next to impossible to separate out the value of the Villard Houses, which are an integral part of the hotel's operations today. Indeed, the hotel's tower soars to 54 stories because the builder transferred air rights from the houses and agreed to renovate the brownstones.
Mr. Brown said that a representative of the royal family sent a letter to the archdiocese shortly after Thanksgiving saying that the two sides were too far apart on the current value of the land. The royal family believes the land is worth about half of the figure the archdiocese has in mind.
It is no simple matter to figure out just who is in charge of the Palace: Prince Jefri Bolkiah, whose company bought the hotel seven years ago for $202 million, or his older brother Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, who runs the country. Prince Jefri, who has a reputation as a profligate playboy, was forced to resign as finance minister in 1998 after his investment company lost an estimated $27 billion. And earlier this year, the sultan's government sued Prince Jefri, accusing him of misusing billions of dollars in state money.
In May, Prince Jefri reached an out-of-court settlement with his brother's government in which he relinquished control of all the hotels, buildings and property he acquired with government money. To cover the prince's financial losses, the sultan has sold assets ranging from a Boeing 747 to 150 Rolls-Royce cars and several hotels. But it is unclear whether the Palace was involved in the settlement.
Thomas Russell, a director of the prince's company, Amedeo Hotels L.P., did not return calls requesting comment.
In the 1990's, the prince did give the New York Palace a plush $100 million makeover, erasing all the vestiges of its previous operator, Leona Helmsley.
And while its 901 rooms are often full and unusually spacious for New York hotels, the Palace itself is no longer counted in the top tier. According to hotel experts, the Palace has an average room rate of $345 a night, or about half that of the St. Regis or the Four Seasons.
"It's a serviceable hotel at a good location," said Michael Fishbin, a hotel consultant at Ernst & Young. "In its heyday, it was among the top 10. It's not on that list anymore."
The Palace Hotel was born amid controversy and has endured one scandal after another over the last 25 years. In the mid-1970's, Harry B. Helmsley, the developer who controlled office buildings, hotels and apartment complexes throughout the city, touched off a stormy protest by preservationists when he announced plans to lease the property from the archdiocese and demolish the landmark but crumbling Villard Houses to make way for a large hotel.
Critics wanted the brownstones restored as part of the city's historic legacy. In the 1880's, the railroad tycoon Henry Villard hired the firm of McKim, Mead & White to design the six houses around a central courtyard in what is regarded as one of the finest evocations of the Italian Renaissance in New York.
After lengthy negotiations, Mr. Helmsley was carried, in his own words, "kicking and screaming" into preserving the houses and incorporating the brownstones into the hotel, which opened in 1981 as the Helmsley Palace.
And for the next decade, the Palace was where the developer's wife, Leona, fashioned herself as the "queen" of hoteliers in national advertising campaigns for the family's hotel empire.
Mr. Helmsley signed a 99-year lease in 1974 with Cardinal Cooke, who wanted to consolidate the archdiocese's offices in a single building on First Avenue, but retain ownership of the Madison Avenue property. Rent started at $1 million a year in 1979, with the lease specifying reviews in 2001, 2051 and 2073. Real estate executives said that land leases today would include annual rent increases that would at least kept pace with inflation.
In any event, Mr. Helmsley, a consummate dealmaker who died in 1997 at age 87, was not worried about a rent increase in 2001. "I remember sitting at the original meeting with Helmsley when he said, 'The heck with it; it's 25 years from now,' " said one executive who worked with the developer at the time.
The Palace got top rates and a reputation for impeccable service for many years. But after Mrs. Helmsley's 1989 conviction for tax evasion, her partners in the hotel, including the actor Paul Newman, filed suit, claiming that the Helmsleys had engaged in fraud and mismanagement of the Palace. Occupancy dropped below 30 percent during the Persian Gulf war and the recession in 1991, and the hotel's reputation went into decline.
In 1993, the partners finally forced the sale of the hotel, one of the Helmsleys' most cherished assets, with the prince emerging as the winning bidder.

HEADLINE: THE 43RD PRESIDENT: MAN IN THE NEWS;
A Pentagon Veteran; Donald Henry Rumsfeld

BYLINE: By JAMES RISEN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 28

 BODY:
When Donald H. Rumsfeld began his first tour of duty as secretary of defense in November 1975, the Vietnam War had just been lost and the American military was at perhaps its lowest ebb since World War II. At 43, Mr. Rumsfeld was the youngest defense secretary in history, but he had just 14 months to make his mark on military policy before the end of the Ford administration.
Now, a quarter-century after Vietnam and nearly a decade after the cold war ended, Mr. Rumsfeld is coming back for a second chance, this time to direct a very different American military. Named today by President-elect George W. Bush as his choice for secretary of defense, Mr. Rumsfeld, if confirmed, will oversee a military that includes many soldiers who were not even born when he first ran the Pentagon. 
 Not only have the threats to the United States changed markedly since he was first appointed by President Gerald R. Ford, but the military's place in society has also been transformed, posing new political challenges that were not even on the Pentagon's radar screen Mr. Rumsfeld's first time around.
Yet his supporters say Mr. Rumsfeld, 68, will not be stuck in the cold war past. His leading role on important current issues, from national missile defense to the management of the government's space operations, has won over a younger generation of Republican experts on military and national security matters, and has gained him the strong support of Congressional leaders as well. And, of course, it does not hurt that his one-time protege Dick Cheney is now the vice president-elect.
Above all, aides and supporters point to his repeated efforts to develop a consensus on controversial issues as a key to his management style, an attribute that will almost certainly be a necessity as the Bush administration seeks to increase defense spending and win Congressional approval for a national missile defense program.
There are few active figures who span more of the history of the modern Republican Party, or who have the government resumes to match that of Donald Henry Rumsfeld.
Born in Chicago in 1932, Mr. Rumsfeld became a Navy pilot after graduating from Princeton in 1954, and later served on the staffs of two congressmen. He married Joyce Pierson in 1954, and they have three children. After a brief stint as an investment broker in Chicago, Mr. Rumsfeld was elected to Congress as a Republican from Illinois in 1962. He remained in the House until 1969, when he resigned to join the Nixon administration as director of the Office of Economic Opportunity. It was in that job that he first encountered a young Dick Cheney, whom Mr. Rumsfeld hired as an assistant.
"I remember that Don asked me to interview Dick for a job, and I came back and told him I thought he was pretty good and we ought to hire him," recalled Frank Carlucci, then on the Office of Economic Opportunity staff and later secretary of defense in the Reagan administration.
That was the start of a Rumsfeld-Cheney working relationship that rapidly propelled Mr. Cheney to the highest levels of the government. In those days, the power in the relationship flowed from Mr. Rumsfeld, as he brought along Mr. Cheney; now the mentor is being returned to power by the former protege.
After serving as United States ambassador to NATO at the end of the Nixon administration, Mr. Rumsfeld became President Ford's White House chief of staff, and he again brought Mr. Cheney with him. When Mr. Rumsfeld was named secretary of defense, Mr. Cheney succeeded him as White House chief of staff.
During that first stint at the Pentagon, Mr. Rumsfeld tried to increase the defense budget, while also dealing with some of the thorniest issues of the cold war, and found himself debating Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger over the direction of strategic arms negotiations with the Soviet Union. Today, Mr. Kissinger expresses strong support for Mr. Rumsfeld's appointment. Referring to those negotiations, Mr. Kissinger said, "We did not always agree on the details, but I literally cannot think of a better person for the post."
After President Ford was defeated by Jimmy Carter in the 1976 election, Mr. Rumsfeld went into the corporate world, where he served as chief executive officer of the drug company G. D. Searle & Company in Skokie, Ill., until 1985.
In recent years, Mr. Rumsfeld has re-emerged as a leading force in Republican circles on national security issues, gaining prominence on the contentious issue of whether the United States should build a national missile defense. Named by Republican Congressional leaders to lead an independent commission to review and assess the ballistic missile threat to the United States, the commission caused a stir when its findings were released in 1998 and found that the ballistic missile threat from countries like North Korea and Iran was growing, and appeared more serious than the intelligence community had previously concluded. The Rumsfeld panel's findings helped renew a public debate over the need for a national missile defense.
More recently, Mr. Rumsfeld led a commission to review the management of American space operations, which is scheduled to issue its findings in January.
Meanwhile, Mr. Rumsfeld's close ties to Mr. Cheney appear to give him the kind of standing within the new administration's national security apparatus that other candidates for the defense job seemed to lack. In fact, Mr. Rumsfeld may not be as easily overshadowed by the new secretary of state, Gen. Colin L. Powell, as other candidates mentioned for the defense post.
His broad experience may also allow him to play a role in a wide range of foreign policy issues. Mr. Kissinger observed, for instance, that Mr. Rumsfeld's time as ambassador to NATO should make him sensitive to relations with the European allies, and that he may play a significant role in allaying European concerns over the Bush administration's policies on issues like the United States' role in the Balkans.
And Mr. Carlucci noted that Mr. Rumsfeld's outlook on national security was close to that of Mr. Cheney and General Powell. Like General Powell, Mr. Rumsfeld can clearly remember the lessons of Vietnam.
"All three of them believe in a strong military," Mr. Carlucci said, "and all three are very reluctant to use force unless it is in the interests of our national security. They have clearly learned the lesson of history."

HEADLINE: 10-YEAR ESTIMATE OF BUDGET SURPLUS SURGES ONCE MORE

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 28

 BODY:
The Clinton administration handed a parting gift to President-elect George W. Bush today, projecting that the federal budget surplus would swell substantially, to nearly $5 trillion, over the next decade.
Administration officials said they expected the surplus to total $4.996 trillion in the 10 years beginning with the start of the next fiscal year, on Oct. 1, 2001. That amounts to an increase of just over $800 billion from the administration's previous projection, of $4.193 trillion for the 10 years that started this October. 
 Although such long-range projections are subject to change with ups and downs in the economy and are not a tool of great precision, the new estimates give Mr. Bush more wiggle room in his efforts to convince Congress and the public that his tax cut proposal, valued at some $1.6 trillion over 10 years, is affordable.
Clearly aware that the figures would further intensify the pent-up Republican demand for tax cuts, President Clinton used the release of the new projections to make a case for using the surplus to eliminate the $3.4 trillion national debt faster.
Speaking to reporters at the White House, Mr. Clinton said the debt could be paid off by 2009 or 2010, two years ahead of his previous estimate. And he said that staying a course of debt reduction would yield benefits to consumers and the economy in the form of lower interest rates and the flexibility to allocate tax revenue to more productive uses than paying interest on Treasury bonds.
The upbeat estimates Mr. Clinton is handing off to Mr. Bush stand in contrast to the bad news on the budget delivered to Mr. Clinton in late 1992 by the departing administration of Mr. Bush's father. As he prepared to take office, Mr. Clinton was informed that the budget deficits he was inheriting would be even worse than previously projected.
Now the surplus projections continue to rise despite the recent slowdown in the economy.
The administration did not release the economic growth assumptions it used in its calculations. Jack Lew, the White House budget director, said the assumptions were "consistent with updates" on economic conditions through last month, and continued the practice of assuming moderate growth rates.
In any case, much of the improvement came not from economic changes but from the change in the time frame covered by the projections. The new estimate drops the surplus projection for the current fiscal year and adds the much higher projection for 2011.
The new figures also incorporate the added government spending signed into law by Mr. Clinton this month after long negotiations with the Republican Congress.
They assume that spending will continue to increase in line with inflation, but do not include the costs of any big initiatives like the addition of prescription drug coverage to Medicare or the addition of private investment accounts to Social Security.
The administration's projections are to be followed next month by new surplus estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, whose figures are more typically used in turning proposals into legislation. The budget office is also likely to show the surplus rising hundreds of billions of dollars, probably to a level higher than the figure of nearly $5 trillion used by the White House today.
By the Clinton administration's calculation, $2.543 trillion of the surplus is to come from the Social Security system and is therefore off limits, by the agreement of the two parties, for tax cuts or new spending.
An additional $532 billion comes from excess Medicare revenue, money that the administration says should go to debt reduction but that the Bush campaign counted on to help pay for its proposals.
Nearly all of the rest -- $1.914 trillion over the 10 years ending in 2011 -- comes from general tax revenue and is up for grabs in the debate over tax cuts and new spending.
Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, said the new figures supported the president-elect's belief that a tax cut was affordable and timely. And he said there was enough money available to cut taxes and reduce the debt.
"The latest set of estimates reinforces how much room there is in the federal budget to cut taxes while securing other priorities," Mr. Fleischer said. "We can pay down debt and cut taxes. Both are worthy goals, and President-elect Bush will pursue both vigorously."
Mr. Fleischer said the new administration was developing its own surplus projections and would have them by February, when it submits budget priorities to Congress.
Mr. Clinton was careful to say that it was up to the new president and Congress to decide how to handle the surplus, and he said it would be unrealistic to think that neither party would push for new programs to address its priorities.
But he made clear that he would like to see the Bush administration make its decisions in the framework of a commitment to pay off the debt by the end of the decade.
Mr. Clinton has increasingly viewed fiscal responsibility as among his leading achievements. And he has found debt reduction to have powerful political appeal, capable of trumping tax cuts.
The debt is the legacy of many decades of deficit spending, much of it during the 1980's and early 1990's, and its practical effect is to require taxpayers to pay hundreds of billions of dollars in interest costs each year. Not since America's early years has the nation been completely debt free.
"This shows the long-term consequences of a long-term responsible budget policy," Mr. Clinton said of the growing surplus projections. "There are huge economic benefits. And if we continue, then we can honestly say for the first time since Andrew Jackson was president in 1835, the children of America will face the future unburdened by the mistakes of the past."
Although the surplus figures give Mr. Bush more room in setting his budget priorities, they are unlikely to end the partisan fighting over whether his tax plan is affordable.
Democrats say that if the Medicare surplus is set aside for debt reduction, Mr. Bush's proposal for $1.6 trillion in tax cuts will eat up all of the available, non-Social Security surplus of $1.9 trillion, once interest costs are included. By allocating a part of the surplus to tax cuts rather than debt reduction, Mr. Bush's plan would leave the government with a higher interest bill than assumed in the surplus calculations.

HEADLINE: Fork in Arafat's Road

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 28

 BODY:
The Clinton administration has confronted Yasir Arafat with one of the most painful choices of his enduring career: the unknown territory of a comprehensive peace or the familiar role of victim.
No one is quite sure which way Mr. Arafat will turn. With President Clinton leaving office in three weeks, time is of the essence, and Mr. Arafat is not known for speedy decisions. 
 The White House, Arab leaders and the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, have all tried to steer him toward the peace package, which would give him sovereignty over the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem and the longed-for Palestinian state. In exchange, Mr. Arafat would be required to sign away one of the fundamental tenets of the Palestinian nationalist movement, the right of refugees to return to what is now Israel.
In short, Mr. Arafat has been presented with something close to Israel's best offer -- too good an offer, in the eyes of many Israelis. Part of Mr. Arafat's quandary is that he probably understands that there is not likely to be a better deal than this one.
One question is whether his people accept or believe that. Mr. Arafat knows that he is likely to face serious repercussions if he forecloses the options of the millions of Palestinian refugees, many of them in refugee camps that are now 50 years old.
Among others, Mr. Arafat would face the wrath of extremist groups like Hamas, the fury of the refugees themselves and perhaps threats from inside the Palestinian Authority to his own position.
Mr. Arafat's popularity has steadily eroded over the last five years, mostly because of corruption in the Palestinian Authority and a failed economy, and the Palestinian streets have been awash in violence and rage for the last three months. So accepting what is perceived as a flawed deal could make his standing tenuous.
The Palestinian leader's choice is freighted with other questions that have little to do with the actual merits of the deal, but have plenty to do with its sustainability.
Israel is in political turmoil over proposed concessions, and there is no guarantee that if Prime Minister Ehud Barak signs an accord before Mr. Clinton leaves office, the deal will survive opposition in the Israeli Parliament.
Parliament is not in session now, but members of the opposition Likud Party have started circulating a letter to Mr. Barak listing their objections to the proposals, for which they said they could obtain the signatures of a majority of legislators.
Nor is there any guarantee that Mr. Barak will win re-election on Feb. 6, even with a peace agreement, or that a deal would survive under his opponent, the hawkish Ariel Sharon.
Mr. Sharon, who is leading in public opinion polls, has said he opposes the package, which gives sovereignty to the Palestinians over the very holy site he visited in September in a gesture that was followed by the uprising of the last three months.
But if Mr. Arafat rejects the proposals and refuses to come to Washington to work on the details, he knows that he will make Mr. Barak's defeat, and Mr. Sharon's victory, far more likely.
And under a Sharon government, Mr. Arafat could well face more Jewish settlements, more bloodshed and the likelihood that he would not see such a favorable offer again for a long time.
"Will the Palestinians gain more by having to deal with a flawed program or from the opprobrium of a Sharon government?" said Rashidi Khalidi, professor of Middle East history at the University of Chicago, summing up Mr. Arafat's quandary.
Mr. Khalidi suggested that the Palestinian leaders had to wonder whether they could survive the wrath of their people if they accepted a deal that fell short of popular expectations.
Negotiators for Mr. Arafat have complained in the last several days that many "clarifications" are needed -- up to 26, according to one report -- before they could seriously contemplate the Clinton deal.
Yet Mr. Arafat, who has made few public comments on the proposals, probably understands that Israel will not budge on the basics: refusing to have the large majority of refugees return, retaining major settlement blocks in the West Bank, and maintaining a security cordon along the Jordan Valley.
Arab diplomats said today that there were legitimate questions that Mr. Arafat had about the Clinton proposals for which he needed positive answers. But compared with the broad contours of Mr. Clinton's proposals, these were details, though important ones, they said.
They centered chiefly on whether the Palestinian state anchored on the West Bank would be a contiguous piece of land or whether it would be cut by roads built by the Israelis to get from one settlement to another. The Palestinians are also concerned about how the neighborhoods of East Jerusalem, which the Clinton plan says will be under Palestinian sovereignty, would be linked.
If these and other important questions are dealt with by the Americans, then Mr. Arafat should move ahead, an Arab diplomat said today.
"The Arab side does not want to say 'No,' " this diplomat said. "This is a workable solution, unlike Camp David." At that summit meeting six months ago, the Israelis expressed total opposition to Palestinian sovereignty over the Temple Mount, which Muslims call the Noble Sanctuary.
In the end, the Arab diplomat said, Mr. Arafat will never be able to satisfy the Palestinian diaspora. The shape of that part of the deal had been clear for years: that the Palestinians on the inside -- on the West Bank and in Gaza -- would get a state, but those who fled from properties in what is now Israel would have to settle for some form of compensation, and resettlement elsewhere.
Mr. Arafat, he said, would have to live with the accusation that he had sold out the refugees.
Despite these difficulties, the diplomat said, Mr. Arafat still has a concrete victory to sell. "He needs to go out and say: 'I brought you back Jerusalem with full sovereignty, something you never dreamed of,' " the diplomat said.
As Mr. Arafat pondered his fateful choice, he maneuvered for time today, calling for a meeting on Monday of a committee of the Arab League. There, he will look for solid support in his decision.
The negotiators in the Clinton administration, frustrated by Mr. Arafat's slowness, tried to see a silver lining in the proposed gathering. They argued that the moderate Arab leaders have supported the proposal and would continue to shore up Mr. Arafat if the meeting went ahead.
By Monday, though, the big problem would be the calendar. Mr. Clinton has not set a deadline for receiving formal replies to his proposals.
But after the middle of next week, there would be little time for the Clinton administration to conduct the arduous negotiations needed to complete a final accord.

HEADLINE: BEATEN TRACK: A special report.;
I-95, a River of Commerce Overflowing With Traffic

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Every weekday before sunrise, Dick Chartier buckles himself into a mud-brown United Parcel Service truck outside Providence, R.I. He dangles a balsam-fir air freshener from the dashboard. He secures his provisions: turkey sandwich, apple, bottle of juice. He drapes his coat on the seat, settles behind the wheel and steels himself to stay there for a long, long time. He always does.
"This is my living room," Mr. Chartier says. "For 10 hours every day." Or 11. Or 12. Or longer, if there is rain or road work or, God forbid, even a minor accident ahead of him. In snow, the round-trip drive from Warwick, R.I., to Secaucus, N.J., has taken 17 hours. The cab of his tractor-trailer has doubled as his bedroom. 
 This is because, for the last two years, Mr. Chartier and his Ford rig have elbowed their way down the busiest stretch of what traffic experts say is the busiest, most overburdened and, in most parts, least attractive highway in the nation, Interstate 95.
Between Maine and Virginia alone, the interstate cuts through a commercial corridor containing almost a quarter of the American population. It is the major highway feeding 13 major airports, 11 major seaports, and more than two dozen railroad stations. It is surrounded by 30,000 miles of other busy roads that all flow, one way or another, into I-95, which has become the Mississippi, the Nile and the Euphrates of the East Coast, rolled into one.
And in many places, this asphalt river is overflowing. At the notorious portion south of Washington known as the Mixing Bowl, where I-95 intersects with the Capital Beltway, as many as 400,000 vehicles -- roughly as many cars as there are people in Atlanta -- crowd through the interchange every day. Traffic engineers call it the largest highway interchange in the world.
Just up the road, where the interstate crosses the Potomac River, the Woodrow Wilson Bridge is designed to carry 75,000 vehicles a day. It is now deteriorating under the pressure of 190,000 a day.
In Delaware, where holiday standstills can stretch more than five miles, tollkeepers set up "bucket lanes" in which highway employees tote plastic toll buckets from car to car because the cash tollbooths are swamped.
At the northbound rest stop near Darien, Conn., near a McDonald's that is among the busiest McDonald's franchises in the country, the stackup of tractor-trailers is so immense that the town's top official, worried about a possible pileup or explosion, has asked the governor to impose a limit on the number of truckers who can pull over there for the bathroom or a burger.
The Connecticut transportation commissioner was candid about the traffic on the state's 118-mile share of I-95, which often resembles a huge parking lot: "It's way beyond what anyone ever envisioned when the road was designed and built."
The statement was sobering. It was also made back in 1985, when an average of 80,000 vehicles a day passed one of Connecticut's busiest points, near Greenwich. Last year, the daily count there was 130,000 vehicles. By the year 2020, it will probably rise to 172,000, about three times as many vehicles as there are residents today in Greenwich.
Not surprisingly, I-95 can also be a deadly line down the country's right side. More than 3,000 people have died on the highway in the last decade, with Florida consistently producing the most fatalities.
Even a small accident on a highway so busy can tie up traffic for miles. Major accidents -- the collapse of a bridge in southern Connecticut, a tire fire that weakened an overpass near Philadelphia in 1996 -- can tangle traffic and commerce throughout an entire region for weeks.
The interstate was born in disjointed pieces in the late 1950's and completed in 1987 as an almost continuous 1,900-mile connection between Florida and Maine.
It has never been romanticized or doted over like its quaint East Coast sister, U.S. 1, which runs alongside the interstate for much of its length. It is unlikely that anyone will ever care to preserve a piece of I-95 for a museum, as the Smithsonian Institution did this year with a stretch of the old Route 66.
It does not inspire the kind of hatred among truckers that Interstate 40 does as it crumbles its way across Arkansas. It is not as thoroughly jammed as spots on the dreaded San Diego Freeway in Los Angeles or the Southwest Freeway in Houston.
But as the primary artery through the Northeast, the country's financial heart, and as the only major highway linking the states of the Eastern Seaboard, I-95 is arguably the most exasperating and essential highway in the nation. It has also become a kind of nation of its own, one where the uniformity of the gas stations, fast-food chains and floodlighted rest stops makes it difficult to discern, after a day on the road, whether you are in New Hampshire or North Carolina, Maine or Maryland.
It is a nation with its own semi-permanent citizenry, of interstate truckers and intrastate commuters, a population that orders its lives and its livelihood almost exclusively around one span of asphalt. This population is growing steadily. And that is never more apparent than during a week like this one, when hundreds of thousands of extended families stage their sad annual holiday competition to see which can get stuck in traffic the longest.
Over the last decade, surveying the growing numbers, state highway officials have started to realize that it is all but futile to try to build their way out of the problem. The only way to keep it from getting worse, they say, is to transform the culture of highway transportation itself, to convince people that driving on the interstate is not always the best way to get from state to state.
In fact, it can often be the worst way.
But Mr. Chartier, the U.P.S. trucker, like hundreds of thousands of drivers around him every year, has no choice. And so he perseveres. He knows his share of the interstate the way he knows his own front yard. So he knows, for example, that as certainly as the sun will come up, he will hit his first traffic jam every morning just east of Branford, Conn. The backup will last for 40 miles, until Stamford or about 9:30 a.m., whichever comes first. His left leg will wear out from working the clutch.
He could get angry about this, he says. But it would do him as much good as getting angry about the law of gravity.
"The first few months I drove this," he said the other day, crawling through Branford, "it really worked my nerves. I was thinking, 'Jeez, how am I going to make my time with all of this traffic?' But they really don't say much when you're late. I mean, what can they say?
"They could put wings and a propeller on the truck, I guess," he added.
 
Visions of a Superhighway
The nightmare of traffic jams and the dream of superhighways to make them go away have been around almost as long as the car itself. In 1937, during a meeting at the White House, President Franklin D. Roosevelt sketched six lines across a United States map, three east to west and three north to south, envisioning a network of interstate toll roads that were never built.
State officials in the Northeast, where traffic problems first developed, banded together to try to create their own version of interstates long before Congress signed the Federal-Aid Highway Act in 1956 to build them.
In 1942, the state officials petitioned, without success, to get federal help for a superhighway to be called the 7-State Highway, through Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, says Larry Larned, a former highway engineer and road historian for the Connecticut Department of Transportation. Except for Rhode Island, the 7-State Highway would have run through the same states that I-95 does now.
Mr. Larned -- who almost died working to build I-95, plunging into a frozen river in 1962 while surveying in Connecticut -- points out that what drivers now know as I-95 was originally just new signs posted on highways that Northeastern states had already built to ease congestion: the New Jersey Turnpike, the New England Thruway, the Connecticut Turnpike.
"The number really came fairly late in the game," Mr. Larned says. "And that's one of the confusing aspects of the road."
Or at least it helps explain some of the confusing aspects of the road. Such as why I-95 does not actually run uninterrupted from Maine to Florida, but disappears in New Jersey, quietly morphing into the plain old New Jersey Turnpike after Exit 10 south and not reappearing until Delaware, except for a stray strand in Pennsylvania. (This is because residents of Somerset and Mercer Counties in New Jersey fought a plan for the interstate to branch off from the turnpike and run through their communities. The plan, finally scrapped in 1983, exists only as a dotted line on old state maps.)
Or why, for example, the highway takes a detour around Boston instead of going through it. (Fierce opposition in the late 1960's to building the highway through residential neighborhoods.)
The entire highway, now longer than the Great Wall of China, was supposed to have been completed by 1972. But it was not finished until 1987, when the last 33.8-mile stretch was opened in Florida between St. Lucie and Palm Beach Counties.
During the years that Florida residents and officials fought over whether to finish the link, a disconnected stretch that had already been built attracted traffic nonetheless: it became a popular landing strip for cocaine smugglers.
During its history, I-95 has been known by several nicknames. State troopers once referred to parts of it as Cocaine Lane because drug traffickers seemed to use it as often as truckers in many states. Other stretches, mostly in the South, have been called Iron Road by law enforcement officers because the highway is a favorite route for the transport of illegal guns.
Probably the least fitting nickname was the one applied to the Connecticut Turnpike portion of the interstate when it was first built, the Ribbon of Hope, because many Connecticut residents saw the road as a thoroughfare to new economic prosperity.
Now, of course, there are those in the state who move their businesses to get away from the highway. Like Laszlo Birinyi, who runs a stock market research firm. Two years ago, Mr. Birinyi moved his office from Greenwich to Westport, near his home, in part because of the congestion and frustrations he suffered on his commute.
"In Greenwich," he says, "you never schedule a meeting at 4 o'clock because it will always be over at 5 -- so people can try to beat the rush. If you don't get out by 5, you wait until after 8.
"The highway weighs heavily on your life," he says.
 
Culture of Congestion
Especially these days, the highway also shapes people's lives, creating a kind of congestion culture. It forges floating communities that are borne of the necessity of being on -- usually stuck on -- the interstate.
Every morning, Mr. Chartier, 58, pulls his U.P.S. truck over at the Exit 53 southbound rest stop near Branford, because that is where the backup begins. He waves to the Seventh-day Adventists who are proselytizing in the parking lot.
"When the traffic eases up here, they move up to the next rest stop to follow the crowd," he says.
He may spot a bedraggled woman or two, the rest-stop prostitutes whom truckers call "lot lizards." He always gets his coffee at the McDonald's, and it is always waiting on the counter for him by the time he emerges from the bathroom. He says hello to Gladys, one of the managers. She talks about growing up in South Africa; he talks about growing up in Rhode Island. Outside the window, the bumper-to-bumper traffic oozes by.
On a highway whose chief aesthetic feature is its featurelessness, drivers seem to long for any signs of life beyond the breakdown lane. They have, for example, formed almost emotional attachments to a 14-foot-high white marble statue of the Virgin Mary that stands near the northbound side of the highway in Childs, Md. The statue, called Our Lady of the Highways, was built in the early 1970's by the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales in memory of three victims of a 1968 pileup.
The Rev. Richard R. DeLillio, the development director for the Roman Catholic order, says that truckers sometimes call the priests in a nearby retreat center to tell them that the spotlight that illuminates the statue at night has burned out. "They'll say, 'Hey, you'd better change the bulbs, Father. We couldn't see the Stone Lady tonight.'
"People count on it," Father DeLillio says.
But loneliness is usually a distant second to anger as the most prevalent emotion on the road. A few miles north of the shrine, at a cluster of tollbooths on the Delaware Turnpike, Tracy Maguire says she sometimes feels as if drivers view her and her fellow tollkeepers as the personification of the highway's problems.
"I've had people throw money at me as they go through," Ms. Maguire, 30, says. "Had people call me all kinds of names.
"Some people in the booths have been brought to tears," she adds. "It happens when it's real busy out here. But I've never cried. I'm not going to let anybody make me cry." In fact, she has become the cheerleader of the 3-to-11 p.m. shift. "I tell people, 'Hey, shake it off. You're better than they are and you know it.' "
And a little stubborn cheerfulness, in the face of so much frustration, makes some friends. An Utz driver will hand down a few bags of sourdough pretzels as he passes. A Wonder Bread driver will do the same with loaves of bread. Around the holidays, the truckers present Ms. Maguire with bouquets of flowers or Christmas bags filled with candy. ("You don't eat the candy," she says. "I just have a rule against that.")
After two years in the booth, Ms. Maguire still finds it hard to believe the amount of traffic at her left elbow every day.
"Sometimes I'll say to people, 'Don't you have homes? Go home. Watch a video. Get off the turnpike, for God's sake.' "
 
One Solution: Stay Away
To many drivers who inch down I-95, it often seems as if the highway was built long ago and then largely left to its own devices, save for the state troopers who hand out tickets and the construction crews.
But over the last several years, highway officials along the northern third of the highway, where traffic problems have become most severe, have realized that "rather than just building and maintaining it, we all have to start thinking about managing it as a 7-day-a-week, 24-hour operation, like a company or a factory," says John J. Baniak, executive director of the I-95 Corridor Coalition.
The coalition, which represents a dozen states and the District of Columbia, was formed in 1993 to address the severe congestion and the kinds of major accidents that can paralyze whole states. People in the coalition talk very little about highway construction. When they do, they seem to suggest that building extra lanes will never be more than a temporary solution.
"We've done a great job of building the interstate highway system," Mr. Baniak says. "It's really a modern wonder. But it really is reaching a kind of saturation point."
Instead, traffic strategists have decided to concentrate on two almost stunningly straightforward jobs. One is finding quicker and more effective ways to clear obstructions from the interstate, like stalled cars, wrecks, debris and construction work, so that every inch of existing asphalt is used.
The second job is more important and more difficult: basically, persuading drivers to stay away from I-95, mostly by giving them more accurate, prompt news, nearly all of it bad, about accidents, construction and rush-hour traffic jams.
Over the last few years, several states have created elaborate traffic management centers that are open 24 hours, helping state troopers, dispatching roadside aid trucks and conveying information to drivers through electronic road signs and highway radio channels. The traffic centers resemble miniature NASA control rooms, filled with officials who monitor radar screens, computers and banks of television sets that tell them, second by second, what is happening along the highway.
Spending a weekday morning inside Connecticut's traffic control center in Bridgeport is like sitting in the cockpit of a giant airplane that the pilots can do very little to steer. It is to see at the same time how sophisticated traffic management has become and exactly how hard it is to make a difference.
On a recent Tuesday, at 6:38 a.m., a traffic coordinator named Robert Didato scanned the television screens that flash images from more than 90 cameras along I-95 in Connecticut. What he saw was what he usually sees around that time: fields of brake lights stretching on endlessly south in the pre-dawn darkness.
He activated a warning that would soon be flashing in yellow on several electronic highway signs, one that he or someone in the control center activates almost every weekday morning now: rush hour, 20 mi. delay, Exits 27-9.
"Usually on Mondays, the delays start at around 6 in the morning," Mr. Didato said. "This is a little early for a Tuesday."
He settled in with his colleagues for a busy morning. The rush does not usually ebb until after 9 a.m. these days. Sometimes, he said, it has lasted as late as 10:30. And on Fridays, the afternoon rush can begin as early as noon.
"Believe me, it takes almost nothing to completely screw things up out there," he said.
Shaking his head and smiling, Mr. Didato added: "They keep coming. They see those signs every morning. Every morning the signs say the same thing. But they just keep on coming anyway."

HEADLINE: Canada's Haven: For Notorious Fugitives, Too?

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: OTTAWA

 BODY:
From a Vancouver detention cell, Lai Changxing, the man charged with masterminding the largest corruption scandal in modern Chinese history, presents Canada with a devilish dilemma.
Deport him to China for trial on economic charges, an almost certain guarantee that he would be executed? Or grant China's most-wanted man asylum and unwillingly tell the world that Canada is a sunny place for shady people, a haven for international suspects facing excessive punishment at home? 
 "Canada is clearly not a safe haven for criminals," Murray Wilkinson, a Canadian immigration enforcement officer, said recently at a political refugee hearing in Vancouver. Referring to Mr. Lai and his wife, Tsang Mingna, who is also under detention, he charged that they were "trying to hide behind the refugee system of Canada."
The case has implications for the United States. An American interagency report released this month by the White House said Canada had become a North American port of entry and haven for Asian gang leaders, who could "conduct criminal activities that impact our country."
Traditionally, Canada, a liberal country without a death penalty, has resisted deporting asylum applicants who are likely to be tortured or executed after returning home.
But Mr. Lai, 42, who quietly appears at detention hearings dressed in green prison garb, is no ordinary asylum applicant. And China is no ordinary petitioner. Two months from now, Canada, which wants to diversify trade and reduce dependence on the United States, is to send to China a 10-day trade mission of 300 business executives, led by Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
Mr. Lai, according to court documents sent from China, was the kingpin of an enterprise that smuggled $6.4 billion worth of goods into China, evading $3.6 billion in duties.
Operating out of the southeastern Chinese port city of Xiamen, Mr. Lai, Chinese prosecutors say, smuggled shiploads of oil, rubber, cars, cigarettes and cellular telephones and other electronic equipment. Navy boats escorted the ships into harbor as part of a vast ring of corruption that Mr. Lai oiled with millions of dollars of bribes and a guest house known as the Small Red Mansion. There, he wined and dined key officials and secretly videotaped them cavorting with "hostesses."
The son of peasants who has only a sixth-grade education, Mr. Lai built a commercial trading empire in southern China and in Hong Kong. At the height of his power, in the summer of 1999, he was chairman of the Yuanhua Group, which had holdings that included the Xiamen municipal soccer team and a replica of Beijing's Forbidden City, a tourist attraction north of the city. Just before his fall, he broke ground on what was to be the city's tallest building, the 88-story Yuanhua International Center.
But according to the Chinese government, Yuanhua, which means Fare Well, flourished because he avoided import duties by paying off dozens of military, police, customs and party officials.
In summer 1999, Beijing decided to crack down on the smuggling ring. Feeling the pressure, Chinese court documents say, Mr. Lai went to the top, offering a $240 million bribe to Prime Minister Zhu Rongji.
Through his lawyers, Mr. Lai asserts that he merely ended up on the wrong side of a political fight in China and that testimony against him was obtained through torture.
On Aug. 14, 1999, Mr. Lai, using a Hong Kong passport, fled with his wife and three children to Vancouver.
Two of his brothers did not move fast enough and were arrested. In June, Chinese government investigators visited Mr. Lai in Canada, bringing along one brother in an attempt to persuade him to come home. Mr. Lai probably knew at that time that the Chinese authorities had jailed eight relatives. He declined to return to China, and the family promptly filed for refugee status.
In Canada, Canadian officials say, Mr. Lai lived an easy life, consorting with members of Chinese gangs, losing at least a quarter of a million dollars at gambling tables, and paying his bills from a $1.5 million account at the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. In September, he and his family were found eligible to pursue refugee status, and in October they filed the necessary documents.
Meanwhile, back in southeastern China, things were not going well for the relatives, business associates and government contacts Mr. Lai left behind.
Last month, 12 defendants were jailed for life, and 58 others received lesser jail sentences. The brother who visited him in Canada received 10 years. A brother lured from Australia received 15 years. Death sentences were meted out to 11 defendants. This month, a second round of trials began in Xiamen and other cities for up to 100 suspects.
On Nov. 23, Mr. Lai was arrested in a casino hotel in Niagara Falls, Ontario.
"The Chinese want him back very badly, and Canada seems to be going along with it," complained Alistair A. Boulton, a Vancouver lawyer who is seeking to have the detained couple released, pending a decision on their application for refugee status. Asserting that back in China the couple would face the death penalty, he said of his clients, "They do not want to be killed."
Sometimes, Canada has deported criminal suspects after negotiating promises from foreign officials to forgo the death penalty. But earlier this year, this did not work with China, a country that does not have an extradition treaty with Canada.
In January, Canada deported to China Yang Fong, a 35-year-old Chinese citizen wanted on charges stemming from a 10-year-old computer fraud case that involved $130,000. Canada deported Mr. Yang after receiving promises that he would get no more than a 10-year sentence. Instead, Mr. Yang was executed.
Believing that execution is the fate that awaits Mr. Lai, his lawyer plans to fight any removal from Canada. Mr. Boulton said that if Mr. Lai and his wife were sent to a third jurisdiction, Hong Kong or Panama for instance, they would end up in China "lickety split." He added, "If Canada cannot stand up to China, I don't see why Panama would."
So far, prospects for release do not look good. In one hearing, Mr. Murray, the government officer, argued that the Lai family's unwillingness to surrender their Hong Kong passports showed "an intention to use those passports to flee Canada when they decide the stove gets too hot."
Daphne Shaw Dyck, an immigration and refugee board adjudicator, seemed to agree on Dec. 5 when she refused to release the couple on bond, saying a "huge bond would be unlikely to tether them to Canada as they have a great deal of money, which judging from Mr. Lai's gambling activities in Canada, they are quite prepared to lose."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
From Spotted Owls to Caviar

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 29

 BODY:
Armen Petrossian likes to think of himself as being to caviar what, say, De Beers is to diamonds.
Ever since his father and uncle fled to Paris more than 80 years ago to escape the turmoil of the Russian Revolution, the family has been running a business that along with a handful of other companies handles most of the West's imports of caviar from the Caspian Sea. That region accounts for about 80 percent of all the caviar sold in Western Europe and North America. 
 But even in the midst of holiday festivities -- the peak period for downing these $100-an-ounce fish eggs -- caviar dealers are finding it hard to celebrate.
Recently, these companies came under threat when several conservation groups in the United States petitioned the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to halt imports of beluga caviar, the most prized grade of sturgeon eggs, by placing the fish that yields beluga on the list of endangered species.
A decision by the Fish and Wildlife Service to add beluga and a lesser-known sturgeon, kaluga, to its critical list would effectively ban trade in the caviar from those species.
At the same time, a report by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, an international agency that governs commerce in rare wildlife, concluded that several sturgeon species from the Caspian Sea were not being adequately protected. But at a meeting in West Virginia earlier this month, a committee of Cites, as the agency is known, concluded that a ban was not advisable because of the economic disruption it would cause in the impoverished Caspian region, which lies between Russia and Iran.
While the regulators weighed their options, the conservation groups -- the Wildlife Conservation Society, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Seaweb -- appealed to Americans to stop eating beluga caviar, to reduce their consumption of alternative wild caviar varieties and to purchase caviar only from farm-bred sturgeon.
Last year, the United States imported more than 107 tons of all types of caviar, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. Of that, about 14 tons was beluga caviar, which is the most expensive type, and virtually all of it came from the Caspian.
Germany, the world's biggest importer, bought 44 tons of all kinds of caviar, including less-expensive kaluga and osetra grades, in 1999, although almost 17 tons were re-exported through Hamburg, which is the world's biggest clearinghouse for caviar. Much of the re-exported caviar went to the United States.
Dr. Ellen K. Pikitch, director of marine conservation programs for the Conservation Society, said that at present kill rates, sturgeons would soon disappear from the Caspian. According to recent statistics from Traffic, a wildlife trade monitoring program run by the World Wildlife Fund, fishermen kill about 1,600 female sturgeons a year to extract caviar, while hatcheries produce only about 1,800 a year. Hatcheries account for 97 percent of the fish that are harvested.
But, Dr. Pikitch said, to obtain the 1,600 females, fishermen probably kill twice that number of sturgeons because of difficulty in distinguishing between male and female. This level of catch, and unknown amounts of bootleg fishing that many believe has flourished since the collapse of the Soviet Union and its control of the industry, has led scientists to conclude that Caspian sturgeons are in danger of being fished out of existence. By the late 1990's, the number of beluga sturgeons spawning in the Caspian dropped to about 1,800, according to Western estimates, compared with 26,000 in the mid-1960's.
"Most people purchasing the product are not even aware they are eating the eggs of an endangered species," Dr. Pikitch said.
Even if the sale of caviar is an important source of export income to people living on the great inland sea, no one in the industry is arguing that it is an essential commodity. "It's a relatively small market," said Christian Zuther-Grauerholz, of Kaviar Kontor Hamburg, a trading house, "but it is a unique product, it has a value in itself."
What troubles dealers in caviar is the fragility of the market. Overfishing in the mid-1990's caused large amounts of black market caviar to flood the West. But as the sturgeon population in the Caspian was being dangerously depleted, official exports dropped and prices increased drastically.
The 44 tons imported into Germany last year compared with 67 tons in 1998. That decrease caused retail prices to jump 30 percent to 40 percent, Mr. Zuther-Grauerholz said. His company, Kaviar Kontor, was set up this year to sell residual supplies of caviar from Dieckmann & Hansen, a leader in the trade until it went out of business earlier this year because of the scarcity of caviar.
Mr. Zuther-Grauerholz said a ban on caviar trade with the West would not resolve the problem. Instead, illegal flows of caviar would be deflected to the internal Russian market, where a newly emerged middle class would provide an adequate base to absorb supplies unable to reach the West.
To be sure, it is unclear whether American consumers will heed an appeal to boycott beluga. But European leaders in the trade fear the appeal will create uncertainty and that a collapse of the trade will paradoxically create greater problems for the Caspian Sea sturgeon.
Beginning in the 1950's, Mr. Petrossian explained, officials in the former Soviet Union gradually established hatcheries, mainly in the Volga delta region, to replenish the supply of sturgeons. A ban on trade with the West, he said in an interview, would cause funds to dry up that go to supporting the hatcheries, while black market fishing would persist. Caviar trading would simply move underground, he said.
As an alternative to a caviar ban, Mr. Petrossian, as president of a trade group called the International Caviar Importers Association, has appealed to the five countries now bordering the Caspian -- Russia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan -- to strictly regulate fishing and the caviar trade. The association was founded in 1998 by 11 European caviar importers in France, Germany, Switzerland, Spain and Britain.
But the proposals also foresee the creation of a kind of caviar monopoly in the West, to be restricted to licensed importers who would deal only in registered shipments of caviar, thus eliminating middlemen between local Caspian suppliers and the importers. The proposed system also foresees systematic financing for the sturgeon hatcheries.
Markus Rusch, owner and general manager of Altonaer Kaviar Import Haus, in Hamburg, and a founding member of the importers association, supports the idea. "The more you concentrate the trade, the easier it is to control," he said. But he added that the first step would have to come from Russia and the other Caspian Sea states, to enforce a ban on poaching and illegal caviar trading.
Proponents of a ban on caviar trading acknowledge that obstructing the trade would dry up funds for the hatcheries. But Dr. Pikitch of the Conservation Society said financing would have to be made available from alternative sources.
As for driving the trade underground, she said: "It's hard to imagine things could go more underground than they already are."

HEADLINE: Midwest Factory Survey Shows Continued Slowing

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 29

 BODY:
A closely watched survey of manufacturing activity in the Midwest has found that manufacturing contracted in December for a third consecutive month, as inventories and order backlogs shrunk.
The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago said today that its monthly index of regional manufacturing was 44.7 in December. In November, the index was at 41.7, its lowest in more than nine years. 
 Index readings below 50 mean the number of manufacturers reporting improved business was smaller than the number indicating deteriorating business. Analysts had expected a December reading of 43.
"It's looking pretty dim" for manufacturing, said Suzanne Rizzo, an economist with MFR Inc. in New York. "The Chicago index is definitely not looking real healthy at this point."
Manufacturers are being hurt in particular as purchasing managers seem to be cutting back on stockpiles, she said.
The Chicago index is based on a survey of purchasing managers in northern Illinois and northwestern Indiana, one of the biggest manufacturing regions in the country. Investors pay attention to the Chicago survey because it sometimes foreshadows the manufacturing index of the National Association of Purchasing Management, which measures factory conditions nationwide. That report will be released on Tuesday.
The Chicago purchasers' inventories index decreased to 36.8 this month -- the lowest since 1991 -- from 43.6 in November.
Order backlogs, a gauge of pent-up demand, fell to 32.2 this month from 33.8 in November.
The new-orders index rose to 41.6 in December, close to the 37.9 in November that was the lowest reading since August 1982.
The purchasing managers' index showed that Chicago-area manufacturing activity contracted for the fourth time in five months, adding to the evidence of a manufacturing-led slowdown in the economy.

HEADLINE: A Drought Hit Market For Capital

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
On Wall Street, what started out as a bang-up year for sales of new stocks and bonds ended with a whimper.
Companies raised less money from American investors in the fourth quarter of 2000 than in any quarter since the spring of 1997. Total proceeds from sales of new securities in the quarter were $393 billion, down 2.5 percent from $403 billion in the fourth quarter of 1999, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data in Newark. 
 For the full year, companies raised $1.95 trillion, down about 8 percent from $2.13 trillion in each of the two previous years. The decline interrupted a five-year streak of stunning growth during which annual underwriting proceeds nearly tripled and profits for investment banks exploded.
"We started the year with great enthusiasm but that exuberance gave way to deep concern that slowing economic growth could lead to a recession," said Richard Peterson, market strategist at Securities Data. "Wall Street got a cold splash in the face after several buoyant years."
Still, investment bankers escaped 2000 with even more money in their pockets. Largely because the market for first-time offerings of stock was still booming in the first few months of the year, disclosed fees for underwriting increased for the sixth consecutive year, rising 6.6 percent, to $12.5 billion.
Initial public offerings, or I.P.O.'s, are the most lucrative deals, paying fees to investment banks of about 7 percent of the money raised, on average. I.P.O.'s accounted for a larger share of all underwriting fees, rising to about 34 percent in 2000 from 31 percent last year.
But the market for I.P.O.'s dried up by the end of the year, with dozens of deals being postponed or withdrawn for lack of interest. Weak demand for new stocks spells trouble for Wall Street heading into 2001, threatening to cut deeply into the revenue and profits of major investment banks.
"The year is likely to get off to a slow start," said Jon Anda, co-head of global equity capital markets at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "But I'm still pretty optimistic about the intermediate term."
Wall Street executives said they did not foresee a rebound until the Federal Reserve Board started cutting interest rates. The markets are expecting a rate cut in January and, executives said, a half-point reduction is probably necessary to restore investors' confidence. Even then, they said, the market for new securities will recover gradually.
"What we believe we're going to see over the first six months is a very cautious approach by issuers and investors alike," said Marwan Marshi, head of domestic capital markets at Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup. "We need sustained stability before we will see the type of activity we saw in early 1998 and throughout 1999."
Back then, American capital markets were firing on all cylinders. But since late March, various sectors have sputtered and swooned, most notably the high-yield bond market, which virtually ground to a halt. Companies issued only about $43 billion of junk bonds in 2000, less than half the volume of 1999 and a third of the record level of 1998.
The corporate bond market also weakened in 2000 after some household-name corporations ran into financial troubles that led to downgrades of their supposedly safe bonds. "Issuers became defensive and both issuers and investors were gun-shy," Mr. Marshi said. "A lot of people who had never seen volatility in the credit markets had all of a sudden been sensitized."
Salomon moved ahead of Merrill Lynch to rank first among underwriters of investment-grade bonds by managing far fewer but much larger offerings. Mr. Marshi attributed the firm's gains to its elephant-hunting strategy, aiming at the companies with the biggest financing needs and using Citigroup's huge balance sheet to package underwriting and lending services. It helped, too, that Salomon had built a strong franchise in advising telecommunications companies, the sector that dominated bond issuance in 2000.
In overall underwriting, Merrill maintained its position as the top-ranked firm, though Salomon moved closer. Merrill was the lead manager for 2,736 offerings that raised about $290 billion, or 14.8 percent of the total. Salomon was second with 12.9 percent and Credit Suisse First Boston, which acquired a competitor, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, was third with 10.8 percent.
Merrill dominated the growing market for bonds that can be converted into stock. For the first time, companies raised more money by selling convertible bonds -- $59 billion -- than junk bonds. Convertible bonds tend to pay investors lower rates of interest but offer the promise of stock that could appreciate quickly.
The bond markets were so shaky that major corporations refrained from raising capital unless they needed it badly. Much of the corporate borrowing that occurred was in the telecommunications industry, where companies needed money to build networks and to pay for wireless spectrum purchased in government auctions around the world. European phone companies, like Deutsche Telekom and British Telecommunications, had multibillion-dollar bond sales.
Wylie Collins, a managing director at Merrill Lynch, said he thought the bond markets would be at least as active in 2001 as they were this year, fueled in part by companies' need to finance pending acquisitions and other deals they plan to make.
"The Fed is expected to be more accommodative and that will bring more issuers in," Mr. Collins said.

HEADLINE: LTV Seeks Bankruptcy, Citing Slower Economy and Steel Imports

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 29

 BODY:
The LTV Corporation, the nation's No. 3 steel maker, filed today for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in its history, blaming a slowing United States economy and competition from imported steel that LTV says is unfairly priced.
The company said late today that it had reached a financing agreement with Chase Manhattan Bank after warning that it might be forced to immediately close its plants, lay off all its 18,000 employees and begin selling core assets. 
 William H. Bricker, LTV's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement: "We now have the funds to continue the normal operation of our businesses and develop a restructuring plan that will result in a viable, successful LTV."
The LTV bankruptcy petition, which was filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court in Youngstown, Ohio, is the latest evidence of the woeful state of the United States steel industry. For several years, steel makers have been struggling with overproduction, fierce competition from lower-priced imports and more recently, with a strong dollar and a weakening auto industry, which uses much of the steel.
In November, the Wheeling Pittsburgh Steel Corporation, another big steel producer, filed for bankruptcy protection. Earlier this week, the company said that it would temporarily lay off 1,400 employees in Ohio and Pennsylvania.
Shares of most big steel makers, including the USX-U.S. Steel Group and Nucor, have been battered in recent years. And on Thursday, trading in LTV was halted by the New York Stock Exchange after the company said it might file for bankruptcy protection. Six years ago, LTV shares traded above $16. They last traded at 38 cents, down nearly 92 percent this year.
Today, however, Chase permitted LTV to use some of its cash on hand to continue operating rather than to pay down debt, preventing LTV from shutting down, the company said.
Wall Street analysts said other steel makers could be teetering toward bankruptcy, and even with the Chase financing, LTV could have a hard time securing more financing at favorable terms.
"The state of the steel industry is so bad, I don't think they'll be able to get the financing they would have gotten five years ago," said Barry Vogel, an analyst at Du Pasquier & Company. "There are going to have to be some closures of plants out there."
Executives at LTV and other steel makers say the government has failed to stop unfair trade practices that have permitted foreign competitors to "dump" excess steel in the United States market at below the cost of production. This, they say, has helped drive steel prices to a 20-year low. Through the first nine months of this year, the plunge in steel prices has caused LTV to lose $368 million on sales of about $3.8 billion.
But steel industry experts say that some of the bigger integrated steel makers, like LTV, are also being hurt by higher labor costs associated with unions and older, inefficient equipment. Newer so-called minimills that make scrap steel are in a better financial position because they are much more efficient and have lower labor costs, analysts say.
Regardless, the steel industry is in trouble, experts say, because the world has too much steel-making capacity. The experts say that it may be necessary for some companies to collapse or consolidate before supply and demand come back into balance. One analyst said the recent troubles in the industry could lead to mergers that are long overdue.
"The domestic steel industry has failed to consolidate," said Michael F. Gambardella, an analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities. "The writing has been on the wall for many years and they've failed to do it, even though it makes sense."
Now, all the steel makers are trying to cope with the news that the big automakers are forecasting double-digit drops in demand for their cars and with an economy that seems to be curtailing demand for construction and big appliances that use steel.
Analysts say operating rates at steel plants have dropped drastically in the last few years and are expected to fall even more, possibly to their lowest point since 1986.
For LTV, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in 1986 and emerged in 1993, the challenges are greater than ever. The company did not say today how much financing it would receive from Chase Manhattan, but The Associated Press reported this week that LTV was seeking $225 million.
Just a month ago, the company lost its chief executive, Peter Kelly, who resigned after two years of huge losses. LTV has more than $1 billion in long-term debt. Earlier this month, it dismissed 500 workers and idled a Cleveland blast furnace.
It has been a long slide for LTV, which started in Dallas as an electric company and then shifted to aircraft in the 1940's and 1950's. Once named Ling-Temco-Vought, the company later changed its named to LTV and began acquiring steel-making properties in the Midwest on its way to becoming one of the nation's top steel producers, with $4 billion in sales in 1999. It moved its headquarters to Cleveland in 1992.

HEADLINE: Hedge Fund Retrenches by Giving Back Almost $2 Billion

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM 

 BODY:
One of New York's biggest but lowest- profile financiers has returned about $2 billion to investors in his $9 billion hedge fund in an effort to slim down his operations and improve performance.
For Louis Moore Bacon, 44, it has not been a distinguished year, but by some measures he has done well just by surviving. Mr. Bacon runs Moore Capital Advisors, a private asset management firm that is thought to be the world's second- largest hedge fund behind Pequot Capital of Westport, Conn. 
 Hedge funds are the exclusive investment vehicles that cater to the wealthy and to institutional investors like college endowments and pension funds.
Mr. Bacon is one of the last major practitioners of macro investing on the scale of men like George Soros and Julian H. Robertson Jr. Macro funds, which dominated the hedge fund industry in the early and mid-1990's, make big bets on the direction of global stock, bond, currency and commodity markets and use considerable amounts of borrowed money, or leverage, to increase the stakes.
In the last couple of years, the macro style has faltered and the old titans have fallen on hard times as the hedge fund industry has come to be dominated by other styles of investing. Mr. Robertson closed his Tiger Management investment empire in March and Mr. Soros started scaling back his funds in April. Both men managed more than $20 billion in 1998 but were battered by bad bets early in the year.
Mr. Bacon has also suffered, though not to the extent of Mr. Soros or Mr. Robertson. The flagship Moore fund, Moore Global Investment, fell 8.6 percent this year through the end of November, according to a report published last week by M.A.R./ Hedge, a hedge fund industry publishing and tracking firm. The return was confirmed by one of Moore's investors.
The M.A.R. report also said that Moore Capital was returning up to $2 billion to its investors to reduce its asset base. While Mr. Bacon was unavailable to comment, Moore Capital said in a statement that "the M.A.R. article was correct in stating that we were down in November and that we had a program to reduce our asset base and our goal has been met."
"We are, however, expecting to be up slightly for the year, not down," the statement concluded.
Returning money is common for hedge funds, especially as they grow over $1 billion, because smaller pools of money can be moved in and out of positions faster and attract less attention from other money managers. Moore has already returned $4 billion to investors since 1988.
"In this business, size is the penalty of success, not the reward," Mr. Bacon wrote in a letter to his shareholders in late May.
Moore suffered a setback early in the year when the firm's top stock strategist, Stanley Shopkorn, departed. Mr. Shopkorn now works with Stanley Druckenmiller, who left his position as the top strategist for Mr. Soros this year. To at least one Moore investor, Mr. Shopkorn's departure and Moore's overall girth were reasons for concern.
"After Shopkorn left, with the size of the assets under management and with the equity exposure they had, we felt they were managing too much money," said Mark Kenyon, the president and chief executive of Union Bancaire Privee Asset Management in New York, a unit of U.B.P., a privately held bank based in Geneva.
Mr. Kenyon's firm, which invests about $6 billion in hedge funds and other financial instruments, withdrew more than half of its investment from Moore during the course of the year. Mr. Kenyon, however, said he was open to returning some of the money to Moore in the future. Even though his firm abandoned most of its macro investments in 1998, including those with the Soros and Robertson firms, U.B.P. has stuck with Moore.
Indeed, the firm's previous performance has justified the enormous fees it charges -- a 3 percent annual fee and 25 percent of profits. Since 1988, the Remington Investment Strategies Fund, one of Moore's two main funds, had a 26 percent average annual return after its fees, through midyear 2000. That puts it well ahead of the 16.6 percent total return of the Standard & Poor's 500 index. In that time, the Remington fund had only one down year, 1994.
"It's unfair for us to jump on one year," Mr. Kenyon said. "If you did that, you would have left him in 1994."
Mr. Bacon's firm has operations throughout the world in a broad variety of markets. But some of his mistakes might look familiar to the average investor. Among his stock holdings are struggling Internet stocks like eToys and iVillage, which each fell more than 95 percent in 2000. In general, macro funds have suffered from an increasingly volatile market in which indexes can fluctuate 5 percent in either direction on any given day, making it difficult to change course.
"Julian Robertson's problem was that at a time when the market was rushing wholesale into technology he maintained his value approach and got slammed for it," said Greg Newton, president of M.A.R./Hedge. "Soros followed the market into technology just in time to save his '99 performance, but then he had a terrible 2000."
Mr. Bacon got off to a sluggish start in 2000, but did not suffer the losses that Mr. Soros and Mr. Robertson did. His firm made a series of bets based on its projections for the direction of the economy and inflation, which were not fruitful.
"We are still licking our wounds and pondering our shortcomings," he wrote in his May letter. "Losing on four sides of a trade -- the dollar, bonds, the technology sector and the old-economy stocks," he wrote, "leaves one humbled and scratching one's head."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
STOCKS ARE LOWER ON THE FINAL DAY OF A BRUTAL YEAR

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The stock market stumbled hard once more yesterday as it wound up a brutal year that began with euphoria but ended with thousands of devastated investors and the worst returns in more than two decades.
Leading the dive from highs established early in the year were technology, media, telecommunications and Internet shares, which sent the Nasdaq composite index down 39.3 percent, its worst annual loss ever. 
 The prices of some popular Internet stocks now hover dangerously close to zero. More than two-thirds of stocks in the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index were down 30 percent or more for the year, while a third of those traded on the New York Stock Exchange were off that much. In total, about $2.7 trillion in shareholder value evaporated in the course of 2000.
For the first time since 1984, investors did better in the Treasury market, where notes and bonds returned just over 13 percent.
"Investors thought it was easy, that you could buy technology companies and they went up every day," said Frederick B. Taylor, chief investment officer at the United States Trust Company. "Now we have learned that is not the case."
Even if, as many strategists expect, the second half of 2001 will bring a revival of the market, the beginning of the year could continue to be rough. Forecasts of corporate earnings are being reeled in, and investors are waiting anxiously for the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates.
"We are shaking off the bottlenecks and excesses of the last run," said William Rhodes, chief investment strategist at the Williams Capital Group, "and you have to do that to get ready for the next run."
It was also a year of embarrassment for the many Wall Street analysts who persisted in promoting the new economy and technology companies long after the stocks began crumbling -- and then ended the year talking about how the technology bubble had burst.
Perhaps the only comfort in this year's decline is the recognition that it followed a remarkable record of gains. All three major indexes had double-digit returns in each of the previous five years. And the Nasdaq, which fell the hardest this year, had double-digit returns in 8 of the last 10 years, including an astounding 85.6 percent jump in 1999.
Moreover, outside of technology and e-commerce companies, the market did not do nearly so badly. Without such stocks, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index would have been up about 3 percent this year, reflecting the relatively strong performance of the old economy, as utilities, energy, tobacco, health care, bank and brokerage house stocks all had good years.
The Nasdaq had its worst year since its founding in 1971, after plunging 51 percent from its record high in March. Stalwarts of the technology bull market led the collapse, with Dell Computer plunging 66 percent and Microsoft, 63 percent.
The Street.com's index of Internet stocks rose 177.7 percent in the seven months leading to its March high, then plunged 77.5 percent by the end of the year. Among its components, Priceline.com dropped 97.2 percent; Yahoo, 86.1 percent; and Amazon.com, 77 percent for the year.
The S.& P. 500, denied a positive return by the technology drag, finished the year down 10.1 percent, its worst year since an 11.5 percent decline in 1977. Among the most widely held stocks, Lucent Technologies plunged 81 percent; Xerox, 80 percent; and AT&T, 67 percent.
The best performers from the old economy -- like Philip Morris, which surged 91.3 percent as fears abated about the damage from tobacco litigation -- helped limit the decline in the Dow Jones industrial average to 6.2 percent for the year. But that was still the Dow's worst year since 1981, when it fell 9.2 percent.
In preholiday trading yesterday, the Nasdaq was unable to end the year quietly. The index plunged 87.24 points, or 3.4 percent, to 2,470.52. It was the 94th trading day of the year in which the Nasdaq fell 2 percent or more. The Dow fell 81.91 points, or 0.8 percent, to 10,786.75. The S.& P. 500 dropped 13.94 points, or 1 percent, to 1,330.28. The losses came amid relatively high trading volume, with slightly more than a billion shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
Have investors learned from this down year? Will they again chase after technology stocks -- or the next hot sector -- for their promise rather than their profits?
"If the market turned on a dime today and headed up for the next several months, it would be a lesson soon forgotten," Mr. Taylor said. "But I don't think that is going to happen."
Market strategists are also keen to learn whether investors have lost their habit of recent years of buying on the dips, a practice that helped the stock market recover from previous sharp slides during its long bull run.
For now, at least, caution seems to be trumping hope. "Investor expectations clearly have been wound down, and they are not buying on the dips," said Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment officer at Credit Suisse First Boston.
As the New Year begins, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries may add itself to the list of other problems that the market and investors face. It is planning to try to stem the recent decline in oil prices with production cuts early next year, a move that if successful would just cut further into consumer spending and economic growth. The price of oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange finished the year at $26.80 a barrel, down from the $37.20 high in September, and up just 4.7 percent for the year.
A further decline in the dollar, which has dropped 12 percent against the euro since October, might also worry investors, as it signals that foreigners are less attracted to the American market. But for the year, the euro was still down 6.3 percent against the dollar, its second year of decline since its inception in January 1999.
As the new year begins, investors also face a further round of earnings warnings for the fourth quarter of 2000. On Oct. 1, analysts were expecting 15.6 percent earnings growth for the S.& P. 500 in the quarter, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks corporate earnings.
That projection already has dropped to 4.8 percent. "We don't have any reasonable sense of when the bottom is going to be and how deep it is going to be," said Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call.
Many factors contributed to the bursting of the dot-com bubble last spring and the subsequent tumble in the shares of companies like Lucent and Cisco Systems whose products form the backbones of the Internet.
The mad rush for any stock with a technology handle drove valuations to the moon. So it was easy, once extravagant expectations for sales growth and earnings began to be disappointed, for investors to find a reason to flee. Such disappointments abounded, as six interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve finally began to slow economic growth and tighten credit and, in turn, consumer spending began to slow.
So since September, investors have heard little but company after company warning that earnings and sales will be lower than expected.
Many of the factors that sent stocks lower helped the Treasury market rally. The prospect of slowing growth, combined with investors looking for a haven in the Treasury market, helped push prices higher and yields lower. Government budget surpluses, which led the Treasury to curtail the issuance of new debt and begin buying back existing long-term debt, made Treasuries more attractive, adding to the downward pressure on interest rates.
And as economic data began to confirm in November that the economy was slowing, the rally in the bond market gained momentum.
This month, when Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, signaled that growth had slowed so much that the central bank was ready to cut interest rates if there was a hint of a recession, rates fell even further. Investors are signaling that they are expecting the Fed to cut its short-term interest rate benchmark very soon, possibly before the next policy meeting at the end of January.
In trading yesterday, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note was at 5.10 percent, down from 5.11 percent Thursday and from 6.44 at the end of 1999. The yield on the 30-year bond was at 5.46 percent, up from 5.44 percent Thursday but down from 6.48 percent a year ago.
With interest rates where they are now, it would not take much of a decline next year to push long-term rates down to their lowest levels in more than 30 years. And such a decline could eventually give the economy and the stock market the jump- start they need to make 2001 turn out fine by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: For Defeated Incumbents, Shock and an Interest in Want Ads

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
The spacious storefront office of Assemblyman Nelson Antonio Denis in East Harlem bustled with activity just a few short weeks ago. Now, it is nearly empty. The phone lines were disconnected a week ago, and callers are given no forwarding information. A moving company, courtesy of the State of New York, came in a day later to take back all of the office furniture and computers.
Mr. Denis, a 46-year-old lawyer completing his fourth year in the Assembly, lost in this year's Democratic primary to former City Councilman Adam Clayton Powell 4th. And Mr. Denis is learning some of the cruelties that come with the end of a politician's tenure in elective office. "The difficult thing," he said, sitting on a folding chair in a barren vestibule warmed by a portable space heater, "is that I never expected to lose. It still doesn't seem real." 
 For any politician, losing an election is a difficult emotional experience. But for an incumbent, a loss is apparently steeped in indignity. It is the bitter feeling of losing despite the exposure and power garnered by incumbency, the free mailings to constituents and the experience of having been successful in past elections.
In fact, more than 90 percent of all incumbents in the State Legislature are re-elected, according to a study by the New York Public Interest Research Group.
For the five incumbent members of the Legislature who lost re-election races this year, this was their last week in public office, with the victors taking over Jan 1. Four of the five were defeated in primary elections in September, and another lost in the general election in November. And while they all said that they had had time to adjust to their new unemployed status, the final days, they said, were particularly difficult.
While their losses are weeks or months old, they said they could still felt the sting of defeat.
"Sometimes, I think about what I could have done differently," Mr. Denis said. "You sometimes can't help retrace your footsteps.Sometimes, I wonder if things would have turned out differently if I had taken a more negative tone in the campaign," he added. "But that's not the way I do things. Plus, you can't go back and do things over again."
David Rosado, a two-term state senator from the Bronx, said he, too, was haunted by his defeat in the September primary and often rethought the campaign to consider where it might have gone wrong.
"This is the first time I ever lost an election, and it's tough for me," said Mr. Rosado, 58, who served in the City Council and the Assembly before running for the Senate in 1996. "I often spend time looking back and thinking about the mistakes I made this time.
"Normally, I run a very hands-on campaign," Mr. Rosado said. "But in this race, I let other people run my campaign. When I think about the campaign these days, I know I would have done a lot of things differently, if I could do it over again."
Mr. Rosado lost a particularly bruising battle -- in a case of political musical chairs -- to Pedro Espada Jr., the former state senator whom Mr. Rosado had unseated four years before. Their rivalry had been high-pitched ever since, adding to the sting of Mr. Rosado's defeat. But Mr. Rosado said that despite feeling wounded by the loss, he harbored no ill feeling toward Mr. Espada.
"I wish him the best of luck, I really do," Mr. Rosado said, before offering a commentary on the race.
"He deserves to be congratulated," the senator continued, sounding something short of magnanimous. "After all, he spent a lot of money on his campaign -- a lot more than we did. He spent money like he was running a campaign for governor instead of the State Senate.
"I didn't have that kind of money for mailings and ads on cable television. I couldn't even defend myself from his attacks. But I wish him the best. Really."
Assemblyman Robert A. Daly, a Republican from Niagara Falls, said he was not surprised that he lost after one term in office representing a heavily Democratic district. "But it's still tough," he said.
Mr. Daly, 40, lost in the November election to Francine DelMonte, a Democrat and a longtime aide to former Assemblyman Joseph T. Pillittere, Mr. Daly's predecessor.
"You are so focused during the campaign, so thoroughly focused," Mr. Daly said in a recent interview. "I put so much of my time and energy into this campaign. And then, it's over and you realize that you won't have that job anymore. And you have to ask yourself, what is the next step for me going to be?"
For Mr. Daly, who with his wife is raising four sons, the next step has been hard to define. Like other defeated incumbents, he has been confronting the prospect of finding employment at a time in life when many people are settled in their careers.
A salesman for an office products company before running for the Assembly, Mr. Daly will take a job as a special adviser for the New York Power Authority, The Associated Press reported yesterday.
For the defeated incumbents, what comes next remains an unresolved issue, even as they pack their belongings and move out of their government offices.
"I haven't quite figured that out," said Edward Griffith, a Democratic assemblyman from Brooklyn who was defeated in the September primary after 28 years in office. "I have looked into a number of things. But nothing is certain."
Alfred T. Coppola, 58, a state senator from Buffalo who lost in the September primary, said that his financial situation necessitated his working.
"I don't have any idea what I will do," said Mr. Coppola, who lost to a Buffalo city councilman, Byron W. Brown. "I've been working in government as a city councilman for 17 years before coming to the Senate, so I'm not eligible to collect on the 20-year pension. As it stands now, I would be getting just $10,000 a year. And I cannot collect Social Security because I'm just 58."
When asked about the future, he said, "Nothing has come up at this point in time, but I will have to do something."
Similarly, Mr. Rosado said he would receive a monthly pension of about $900 -- half of what it would have been had he served another two-year term.
"So, I've got to work now," he said. "I've got to look for a job. I don't think I will have too much of a problem finding one. But I've still got to go out and find one."
Mr. Denis said he would practice law full time, explaining that he wanted to maintain a presence in the neighborhood he represented for the last four years. He said he had no particular plans to run for office again, but he added that he had not ruled it out, either.
"You never know what the future holds," he said. "I just might do it again one day."

HEADLINE: Germany's Financial Heart Is Open but Wary

SERIES: CROSSING BORDERS: Testing Tolerance

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Dec. 28

 BODY:
With its cluster of high-rises known as the "Frankfurter Manhattan," its big banks and its bustling airport, this is a town with pretensions. Petra Roth, the mayor, sees it as a "global city providing hub functions for the continent," a place that should be "as cosmopolitan as New York."
On one level, such ambitions seem droll. The first reaction of Jeffery H. Perkins, an American banker, to the city was, "You can't be serious -- where is it?" The compact downtown area evokes Des Moines more than Manhattan. But on another level, the mayor has a point: Frankfurt is a city of foreigners. 
 Not just dapper corporate types like Mr. Perkins. Frankfurt is home to 80,000 Muslims, most of them Turks of modest means. Foreigners, including a large contingent from the former Yugoslavia, make up 30 percent of the population, one of the highest ratios for any town in a Europe troubled by immigration. But there is no blood on the streets. Quietly flows the Main River beneath that mock-New-World skyline.
As Germany goes these days, so goes Europe. And if Frankfurt, the headquarters for Europe's new Central Bank and so the capital of Europe's nascent shared currency, the euro, is comfortable being a part-Muslim city with 27 discreet mosques, perhaps the so-called "New Europe" of one money and blurred borders can be a more tolerant place.
"Xenophobia is very unusual in Frankfurt," said Francesco Rinaldi, an Italian banker. "Perhaps it's the 300 foreign banks, or the vast airport, or the long American presence." Not until 1994 did 30,000 American troops pack up and go home -- the cold war won and, so people here say, the city shaped in the soldiers' open, can-do spirit.
But even here, at the heart of American-influenced Europe, far from the traumatized psyche of a former East German city like Dessau, where rightists this year killed one African immigrant (whose wife was German), the ghost of xenophobia is not entirely absent. For Frankfurt -- like Germany, like Europe -- is struggling to define a shifting identity.
As the departed American soldiers suggest, this city is no longer part of a cold war country living what Zafer Senocak, a German intellectual of Turkish descent, has called a "quasi a-national existence under the umbrella of the West." Far from it: this is now the financial center of a strong Germany seeking to define and express a new national pride.
But Frankfurt is also the capital of a unique experiment in dismantling the nation state through the voluntary abandonment of sovereignty involved in giving up national control of monetary policy and adopting a common currency.
So the continent's largest state, one reborn only in 1990, yet also one in dismantlement, veers this way and that in its mood, one minute nostalgic for a "proud Fatherland," the next in the vanguard of what Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, himself a child of Frankfurt, calls the postnational era.
Its unease about national identity -- and the anti-immigrant outbursts that sometimes accompany it -- is often evident, as it is in other nations of the 15-member European Union, a bloc integrating ever more without putting the experiment directly to the vote of its 360 million citizens.
Recent surveys suggest that a conservative-nationalist mood may be ascendant in Germany. Over the past year, the number of Germans who believe defense of the nation state is important has risen to 56 percent from 48 percent, according to surveys conducted for the European Union. Other polls suggest that as many as 67 percent of Germans feel there are too many foreigners in the country.
But Frankfurt has not experienced the xenophobic attacks of some other smaller German towns, suggesting that anti-immigrant violence may often exist in inverse proportion to the number of foreigners actually present.
"We have few problems in Frankfurt and many in Dessau, where immigrants are 1 percent of the population," Otto Schily, Germany's interior minister, said in an interview. "Fears of foreigners are often wild fantasies."
Frankfurt has been trying to open minds to foreigners for a long time. A decade ago, prodded by Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the French-German hero of the May 1968 student uprising in Paris, now a Green politician who makes Frankfurt his home, this city opened a "Multicultural Office" -- a department committed to furthering and recognizing the cultural diversity of the population.
Today, however, multiculturalism is out of fashion at a city hall under Christian Democratic control. Mr. Cohn-Bendit's office has been placed within a new "Integration Department." The two names -- the former a celebration of cultural diversity, the latter an invitation to cultural conformity -- reflect Frankfurt's shifts.
"A measure of national pride and a desire that immigrants adapt to national customs is normal," said Albrecht Magen, 71, the Christian Democrat who heads Frankfurt's new drive to "integrate" immigrants. "You cannot always remind us of our history in order to deny Germany any national sentiment. If you remind somebody constantly that he was a bad boy at school, he will probably be a bad boy."
For this retired lawyer, the move away from the "ungovernable parallel worlds of multiculturalism" is salutary. Integration, he adds, "does not mean we want to baptize the Muslims"; it means they should adapt to Germany, learn its language, know its laws.
These conflicting currents are familiar to Petra Bayam, 35, a Frankfurt corporate lawyer. Now, at the end of the holy month of Ramadan, she finds herself sitting without shoes at a table set for a Turkish feast.
Around her sit a dozen relatives, mostly young Turkish-Germans, fluent in German but not -- yet, at least -- German citizens. A nephew, Behadir Bayam, 15, says: "When I'm in Turkey, people say, 'Come here, you German.' When I'm here, people say, 'Come here, you Turk.' So I'm not sure who I am."
So it goes among Europe's immigrants, often seen, seldom understood, elusive shadows on the landscape. Across the continent, residents seem to have caught a collective bout of cold feet about integrating immigrants, and perhaps nowhere more so than in Germany, which has the largest number of foreigners -- 7.2 million -- although the highest percentage is in Switzerland.
In countries from Austria to Belgium, European societies with uncertain identities in the cold war's aftermath have been looking for another external enemy against which to define themselves -- and often seem unable to find a better target than the migrant.
Four decades have passed since Germany, which unlike France and Britain had no former empire to turn to for laborers, signed an agreement with Turkey to bring in "guest workers." Recruitment officially stopped in 1973, but the "guests" stayed and multiplied -- and today number more than 2.1 million, many in the Frankfurt area.
Their presence troubles a lot of Germans, who feel exploited by the Turks, or deceived by such eternal "guests," or wary of Islam, or threatened in a German national culture now being rediscovered.
The "Turkengefahr," or Turkish danger, is a still potent ghost in the history of Germany and especially Austria, where many battles were fought against the invading infidel. Martin Luther called the Turk a "cunning, cruel, devious, impetuous murderer"; such stereotypes are not easily overcome.
But Ms. Bayam overcame them. Born Petra Fuchs, the only child of a Catholic mother and Protestant father, she this year married her longtime boyfriend, Hulisi Bayam, another lawyer, the son of Turkish immigrants from Antalya. Such mixed marriages, while growing in number, remain rare.
They started dating at university. Her parents, professionals, were "a bit surprised." His parents, construction-site and factory laborers, were a "bit worried." She went to Turkey and discovered her prejudices: "I had thought all the women covered their heads and all the men were machos," she says. "But Turkey was not like that."
Hulisi Bayam had already defied the stock images. He arrived in Germany in 1973 at age 9, speaking not a word of German. Today, his German is of an almost stylized perfection, his urbane manner exudes sophistication, and his consulting company, Bayam AG, is an important bridge between the German and Turkish business worlds.
They were married on Feb. 12 in a Frankfurt church. The priest, a broad-minded man, was amenable -- to the point of allowing an Islamic prayer to be spoken by a Muslim cleric. It was the first time such an eclectic ceremony had been permitted in the church.
The one small problem involved the photographs. The photographer, a German, was troubled by the fact that Hulisi is shorter than Petra. So he placed the groom above the bride on a staircase. When some of Petra's German friends saw the pictures, they perceived in Hulisi's positioning a sign that "he's a Turkish macho."
So it goes with stereotypes; they endure. Islam equals fundamentalism. Turks often run fruit and vegetable stores in Germany: proof that at heart they are peasant farmers. They speak poor German after many years: evidence of their ignorance.
But in the couple's families, familiarity brought rapid conciliation. "Of course, Hulisi's family had always thought in terms of a Turkish wife, but they accepted me quickly," Ms. Bayam said. "And my own had always taught me that nationality or religion should play no divisive role. They were open to Hulisi."
Indeed, Ms. Bayam's mother, Marritta Fuchs, knows what it is like to be a stranger. After World War II, her family, wealthy landowners, were given one hour to leave the Sudetenland as Czech forces drove out ethnic Germans in revenge for Hitler's war. She eventually settled in Frankfurt, and the lesson she gave her daughter was not one of rancor; it was one of the folly of ethnic hatred.
The lesson was taken to heart. Ms. Bayam -- widely traveled, wary of any national sentiment, an internationalist -- is representative of a broad swath of young Germans who, prodded by horrific history, have perhaps moved further beyond patriotic feeling than any other people in Europe. These Germans find it natural to reach out to and embrace other cultures -- sometimes as an escape from their own.
But another broad swath of Germans, in the east of the country but not only there, are reacting against the likes of Ms. Bayam. They cling to a homogeneous image of a German "Volk" determined by bloodlines; they want to wave German flags and sing the German anthem without feeling Hitler forever precluded such "normal" expressions of patriotism; they seek to reinforce a renascent German identity.
Many in this group are no more than conservative patriots. But others are the rabid nationalists who, in 1992 and 1993, set fire to Turkish homes in Molln and Solingen -- killing eight Turks in all. In a community that is now the largest minority of another faith in Germany since the prewar Jews, these memories live on.
Mr. Bayam, a thoughtful man, is at home in Germany -- more so than in Turkey, he says. Like other immigrants, he has benefited from the very things -- free university education, free health care -- that tend to breed resentful talk of foreigners "exploiting" European welfare systems. But he is troubled by the direction taken now by many Germans -- indeed, by conservatives across Europe -- who are essentially telling immigrants: conform, or go home.
It is still a battle, he says, to convince Germans that Islam can also mean tolerance, and that Turks are part of this society, here to stay. More than 25,000 Turks are now enrolled in Germany's universities, more than 50,000 own businesses, and, in 1999, 84,000 were granted German citizenship -- by far the largest group of foreigners.
Citizenship laws were somewhat liberalized in 1999, breaking with old German notion that bloodlines define the nation, but not as much as many Turks wanted. And over the past year, the conditions of that citizenship seem to have become ever more exacting.
"The buzz word in Frankfurt is integration," Mr. Bayam said. "But does integration mean I have to give up my Turkish identity? Then I say, no. Does it mean Christianity? Then I say, no. Or does it mean that I learn other things and Germans help me do so and we talk and reach out to each other? Then I say, yes."
At his feast table, Mr. Bayam's 72-year-old mother, Fatma, sits to his left, and his sister-in-law, Makbule Bayam, on the other side. Fatma wears a head scarf; Makbule does not; both speak broken German.
Makbule has worked for 18 years in an old people's home. She started out cleaning, then cooking. Then she was asked to help with the old Germans: cleaning, feeding and changing often helpless people.
At first she declined. Then, she agreed, but only to wash the women. After five years, she said all right, she'd wash the naked old men, too. She earns good money, close to $2,000 a month, and like the other immigrants there -- Turks, Portuguese, Indians, Yugoslavs -- she is ready to do work that Germans are reluctant to do.
This is a glimpse of Germany's -- and Europe's -- future: a fast-aging, generally prosperous population, dependent on immigrants. Of the Turks in Germany, 70 percent are under 35.
Mr. Bayam's mother is bright-eyed and vigorous, the matriarch. When she arrived in Germany three decades ago, she worked first in a bread factory. Later she moved to a loudspeaker company, where, on arrival, her colleagues told her to remove her head scarf. The manager was called, and after some discussion decided that, with or without a head scarf, she worked well, and could do as she wanted.
At the feast, Fatma's head scarf is gold and black, similar in color to the stylish silk scarf her German daughter-in-law wears around her neck. They embrace: an image of barriers broken.
Frankfurt has worked hard to cut through divisions. The city avoided ghettos by scattering foreigners in various districts and has tried to contain conflicts through social workers trained to defuse tensions over loud foreign music or pungent lamb. Thirty percent of marriages in the city are now mixed -- between Germans and Italians, for example -- although very few cross the Christian-Islamic divide.
The Integration Office, headed by Mr. Magen, has had its successes -- notably with a program called "Mamma speaks German," an attempt to teach the language to immigrants like Makbule Bayam, whose German-born children are fluent.
Over all, however, Mr. Magen feels integration is becoming ever more difficult. He complains about a backlash, among Turks, to resurgent German national pride; he says the several Turkish satellite television stations now available here reinforce divisions, and help keep Turks Turkish.
Like Ms. Bayam, this apparently well-meaning man has his own private history of German integration. His father, he confides, was a Jew -- baptized and entirely assimilated, but still a Jew by Hitler's definition -- and had to hide during the war. "After the war," he says, "We just became Germans."
And why are Germans, his countrymen and women, afraid of Islam? Because, he says, they are no longer real Christians and are bewildered by the intensity of many Muslims' attachment to their religion. Because they have "Uberfremdungsangst" -- a fear of an "overforeignerization" that will destroy their culture.
But what is this culture, exactly, in the land of Goethe and Auschwitz, a place where Turkish kebabs are as popular as wurst, and 9 percent of the population is foreign? That is hard to say. "Look," says Mr. Magen, finally and enigmatically, "Life is not black and white. It is gray."
The view from his window is gray, out across an old bridge over the Main to a church spire on the other side, and behind the church the high-rises of Frankfurt's little Manhattan (with 15 more skyscrapers planned), and along the river bank the Jewish Museum, everywhere the impression of a shattered history.
Germany is not black and white. It is gray. But the hues of east and west, of Islamic culture and what some now call Judeo-Christian values, of Bayams and Magens, have yet to blend comfortably -- even in a city like Frankfurt where they co-exist in peace.
 
Crossing Borders
 
Articles in this series have examined the ways in which migration is changing the face of Europe. Previous articles dealt with criminal groups smuggling asylum seekers into a Europe that needs but does not welcome them; how East European women are tempted west, then sold into the sex trade; and the travails of "new Europeans" living the clash between the cultures of their parents and those of their adopted homelands.

HEADLINE: Uneven Choices for the Cabinet

 BODY:
President-elect George W. Bush continued to build his cabinet team yesterday, mixing interesting choices for the departments of Education and Health and Human Services with an unsettling pick for the Interior Department. Both Tommy Thompson, the Wisconsin governor, who will run H.H.S., and Rod Paige, the Houston public school superintendent, who will run Education, will bring experience and a reputation for flexibility to their jobs. Gale Norton, the former Colorado attorney general, chosen for Interior, brings considerable familiarity with environmental issues but also a reputation as a dedicated property rights advocate with deep reservations about the Clinton administration's aggressive efforts to enlarge federal protections for wilderness and wildlife.
Mr. Thompson is the architect of one of the country's most innovative welfare reform policies. As such, he promises to bring creativity to the federal agency that oversees welfare, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. When he became governor in 1987, about 100,000 Wisconsin families collected welfare benefits. As he prepares to leave, the number is down, by one measure, to about 20,000. Wisconsin's robust economy has been one big reason for this decline. Another has been Mr. Thompson's innovative policies. Like others in his party, he preaches individual responsibility and work. Wisconsin's program puts everyone in some type of job, including community service for those unable to find employment in the private sector. 
 But Mr. Thompson also insists on spending government money to provide the working poor with ample medical insurance, child care assistance and other support services. When the new welfare law comes up for reauthorization in 2002, some Republicans will argue for cutting back federal money because welfare rolls have shriveled. Mr. Thompson can be expected to pull hard in the opposite direction, calling on Congress to keep funding flowing so that states can make sure that people who have left the welfare rolls stay off.
The biggest question mark about Mr. Thompson is his record on abortion. He is adamantly pro-life, and signed some of the nation's harshest anti-abortion laws. One, blocked by the Supreme Court, would have imposed sentences up to life on doctors who perform so-called partial birth abortions. Mr. Thompson cannot change the basic laws governing a woman's right to choose, but his department is enormously important to women's reproductive freedoms. For example, under President Clinton officials at the department fought hard to make available the "morning-after" pill, whose use is opposed by many right-to-life groups. The fear among women's groups is that Mr. Thompson will reverse this and other enlightened policies.
Mr. Paige, the education secretary-designate, is credited with greatly improving Houston's school system, including a significant increase in test scores. A Republican and longtime Bush family friend, he would be the second African-American in the cabinet alongside Colin Powell. Based on his public record, Mr. Paige seems a wise choice to help Mr. Bush carry out his campaign pledge to bring innovative solutions to educational problems.
Of the three designees, Ms. Norton is clearly the most controversial. Both she and Mr. Bush sounded the right notes in their remarks yesterday. Ms. Norton spoke of the "awesome responsibility" of managing the public lands and of her wish to "preserve our wonderful national treasures, restore endangered species, and help Americans enjoy the great outdoors."
Nevertheless, her political pedigree is deeply disturbing. She has been associated with two of the worst Interior secretaries in the department's history, James Watt and Donald Hodel, both appointed by Ronald Reagan. As a young attorney she was hired by Mr. Watt for a staff position at the Mountain States Legal Foundation, a sort of right-wing answer to the Sierra Club that favors traditional Western economic interests like ranching, mining and forestry, and has litigated vigorously against the Endangered Species Act and other basic federal statutes that the Interior Department is sworn to uphold. In the mid-1980's Ms. Norton served as associate solicitor at Interior, where she helped craft the legal basis for Mr. Hodel's efforts to open the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration. Mr. Bush promised during his campaign to ask Congress to open the plain for drilling, and in Ms. Norton he has an enthusiastic ally.
As attorney general, Ms. Norton was a strong advocate of Colorado's "self-audit" law, which grants companies amnesty from enforcement of federal air and water pollution laws if they police themselves. This law angered the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington but was much favored by Colorado businesses.
Ms. Norton's task is to rise above the policy of reckless commercial exploitation espoused by old patrons like Mr. Hodel and honor her department's broader mandate to protect the nation's natural resources. Even a cursory inspection of the opinion surveys will tell her that Americans in overwhelming numbers will want her to do exactly that.

Jackson's Teammates Saw Only a Captain

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW 

 BODY:
THE vote was held in secret, in a room in Ray Tompkins House beside the Yale gym in New Haven in late November 1948. It was to determine the captain for the 1949 Eli football team. A school sports ethic held that no one was to discuss whose name he was going to write on the paper ballot.
As one of the guards on the team, Lenny Fasano -- now Dr. Fasano, an internist in New Haven -- recalls, the vote was 49 to 1 for a fullback and punter named Levi Jackson. 
 "Levi was so adored and beloved by the rest of us, and he was such a good player, that I couldn't believe anyone voted for someone else," Fasano said. "After the vote was announced, and we followed the traditional drinking a glass of Champagne to our new captain and then throwing the glasses against the wall, I said to Levi, 'I've got to find out who voted for the other guy.' He said: 'I did, Lenny. I wouldn't vote for myself.' "
The election made national news, for Levi Jackson was black, the first of his race to be chosen for the prestigious honor in the history of Yale football. Editorials praised the so-called "broad-mindedness" of the electors as being "wonderful." Two, however, saw it a bit differently.
"What the hell's so wonderful about it? This is America, isn't it?" asked Bill Corum, sports columnist for The New York Journal-American. And Red Smith replied to the rhetorical questions in his column the following day in The New York Herald Tribune: "A small echo answers, 'Hooray!' Look, what the Yale kids did wasn't anything wonderful. . . . It's what decent people expect of decent people." He added: "When you say the Yale football players have struck a blow for tolerance, then you are condescending to Levi Jackson. . . . Do you tolerate right guys?"
Of course, Corum and Smith knew the significance of such acceptance of a black, 19 months after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in major league baseball. And what they were saying in their bitter irony was: Why should something like this have taken so long, at Yale and elsewhere in America? Where were the masses of decent people? Why should there even be a need for "racial progress," which Jackson's election supposedly symbolized?
Jackson, who set 13 modern Yale football records, died earlier this month at age 74. He graduated from Yale with majors in sociology, psychology and economics, had served in the Army, became an executive with Ford, rising to become one of its top executives before retiring in 1983 as a vice president. He was active in community affairs in Detroit, his adopted hometown -- he was reared in Branford, Conn. -- and was appointed to the National Selective Service Appeal Board, which settled disputes over eligibility for the military draft.
"Levi and I talked often about the black athlete in America," said Fasano, who went to grade school, high school, college and served in the Army with Jackson, a lifelong friend. "He wasn't happy with black athletes leaving college early, or even going straight to the pros."
Fasano said Jackson believed black athletes "had to take advantage of an education, otherwise you won't be able to rise."
"With no education, you go from being a star in sports back to the ghetto."
Jackson lived what he believed. "I remember even in high school that Levi would stay up to 1 or 2 in the morning, studying," Fasano recalled. Jackson, whose father was a steward in the Yale dining halls, was the youngest of six children and the only one to get a college education -- helped by the G.I. Bill of Rights, after he served in the Army during World War II.
"It upset him when some black athletes acted inappropriately," Fasano said, "but he said he comprehended where some of that came from. Having been so discriminated against by whites, these athletes had so much hatred in them that it blinded their judgment. Levi said, 'They have to learn that they will not be able to compete in this world with that attitude.' "
Denyse Jackson, one of Jackson's two daughters, recalled that her father "never said a mean thing about anyone."
"He always tried to understand," she said. "And he always wanted to be known first, not for football, but for having got his education."
About that vote for the Yale captaincy, Fasano recalled: "You know, it didn't dawn on us that we were voting for someone of a different color. And when he was carrying the ball, we would have killed ourselves for him. We didn't tolerate Levi Jackson, we loved him."

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
Saints to Play It Again, With a Focus on Faulk

BYLINE: By CHARLIE NOBLES 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Dec. 29

 BODY:
Jim Haslett is acutely aware that his New Orleans Saints have a 7-1 road record, best in the National Football League, while they have won only three of eight games at the Superdome. That is where they will meet the St. Louis Rams on Saturday in a National Football Conference first-round playoff game.
"We've thought about busing them to the airport and flying around the city a couple times and landing," Haslett said with an impish smile. 
 Short of doing that, Haslett hopes he has at least devised a way to slow down Rams running back Marshall Faulk, who was named the league's most valuable player on Wednesday. This past Sunday, at the Superdome, Faulk punctured the Saints for 220 rushing yards and 2 rushing touchdowns, and added 7 receptions for 41 yards and another touchdown in a 26-21 St. Louis victory that forced Saturday's rematch.
"The films showed that we freelanced too much in the last game," Haslett said. "Some of it was just the frustration of playing a back of such quality. But it's correctable. We'll try to play disciplined football, like we have for the last couple of months. We'll be trying to take away what he does best."
In the next breath, though, Haslett wondered aloud whether the Rams have too many offensive weapons for any defense to contain, with quarterback Kurt Warner -- the league's most valuable player last season -- and two of the N.F.C.'s top receivers in Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt to complement Faulk.
St. Louis, which will be playing its third game against the Saints in 35 days (they split the first two), is the league's dominant offensive team this season. The Rams set N.F.L. records for offensive yards (7,335) and passing yards (5,492), eclipsing the 1984 Dan Marino-led Miami Dolphins.
Moreover, they led the league in yards per game (458.4), points per game (33.8), rushing touchdowns (26), passing touchdowns (37) and they had an incredible 47.5 percent third-down conversion rate.
Haslett said that even if the Saints had "15 or 16 guys" on the field defending the Rams, they would still have a hard time.
The Saints have a double challenge in attempting to eliminate the Rams, last season's Super Bowl champions. Besides St. Louis, they have their own demons to address: they have never won a playoff game.
The Saints' playoff history requires 3 pages of a 278-page media guide. It includes four games -- all losses, with the last coming in 1993. This is the tale of woe for a franchise that joined the N.F.L. in 1967.
Haslett, however, has made significant inroads in doing the seemingly impossible. The Saints are 10-6, same as St. Louis, despite one of the league's worst run of injuries. Strikingly, they begin their run in the playoffs with an inexperienced quarterback in Aaron Brooks and a veteran running back in Terry Allen, who was unemployed barely a month ago.
Brooks replaced Jeff Blake, who went out with a broken foot on Nov. 19, and Allen took over for the 1998 Heisman Trophy winner, Ricky Williams, who broke an ankle on Nov. 12.
Saturday's game did not sell out until today. It is as if Saints partisans are sensing they might be let down yet again.
"People still look at us and think: 'When's it going to happen? When are we going to see the same old Saints?' " guard-center Tom Ackerman said. "Well, these are not the same old Saints. It's not even close."
If the Saints figure out a way to stymie Faulk, the spotlight will surely fall on Warner. The 18 interceptions he threw this season are the most by any quarterback in the playoffs, and 12 of them have come on the road. He was out with an injury on Nov. 26, when New Orleans defeated the Rams, a 31-24 victory that some call the biggest in Saints history.
