HEADLINE: Iran's Chance: U.S. Troubles in Iraq Create Opening for Regional Shift

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Nazila Fathi contributed reporting from Tehran, and Nada Bakri from Beirut, Lebanon.

DATELINE: CAIRO, Feb. 17 

 BODY:
In recent weeks, President Bush and American military officials have increasingly accused Iran of meddling in Iraq's affairs. But from Iran's perspective, given its longstanding interests in Iraq, it is the United States that is meddling in its backyard, analysts inside and outside of Iran say. 
 From the very start of the American occupation of Iraq, at least some in the Bush administration saw an opportunity to curtail the influence of Iran's radical Shiite leaders by producing an alternative, moderate center of Shiite Islam that would effectively neuter Tehran in ideological, political and strategic terms.
This was abundantly clear to Iran's clerical rulers, whose paramount priority since they seized power in 1979 has been to preserve their revolution and their grip on their own country. 
 Faced with more than 100,000 American troops next door and a White House that pursued a policy of pre-emptive war, Iran's leaders moved quickly to try to prevent the United States from gaining a permanent foothold.
 ''Iran's policy in Iraq works to prevent the U.S. from feeling safe and secure,'' said Talal Atrissi, a researcher and writer on Middle Eastern affairs based in Lebanon. ''It works to prevent the formation of a pro-American Iraqi government, in favor of at least an Iraqi government that does not feel enmity toward Iran.''
 While the United States sees in Iraq a venture that will affect its foreign interests for years to come, Iran sees an occupied neighbor with close religious, cultural, political and economic ties. Though Iran is Persian while Iraq is Arab, both have majority Shiite populations that have mingled, religiously and culturally, for centuries. 
 ''We have been there for thousands of years,'' said Reza Alavi, a historian and a former managing editor of the Harvard Middle Eastern and Islamic Review, who said his own grandfather -- like many Iranian Shiites -- was buried in the Iraqi holy city of Najaf. 
 Mr. Atrissi said: ''The Iranian historic, religious, economic ties with Iraq make Iran keen on preventing the U.S. being the sole authority in Iraq. They feel a duty to preserve these ties, and to protect their national security, which is threatened by the U.S. presence in Iraq.''
 In strategic terms, America's failure to secure its position in Iraq has presented Tehran with a rare opportunity to recalibrate the balance of power in a neighborhood that had long been hostile to its aspirations. 
 Before Sept. 11, 2001, Iran was virtually surrounded by the Sunni-dominated states of Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, with Turkey, a NATO member, on its northern flank. 
 Now, with the initial rout of the Taliban in Afghanistan and the ouster of Saddam Hussein, its most powerful and fearsome competitors, Iran is trying to assert itself as the dominant regional power.
 In defiance of the United Nations Security Council, the Iranian government has proceeded with a nuclear program that it says is for peaceful purposes, but that the West says is aimed at developing weapons. Iran has strengthened ties with Syria, built the militia Hezbollah into a state within a state in Lebanon and offered support to the radical Palestinian group Hamas. 
 But the cornerstone to its regional plans lies in Baghdad.
 In economic terms, Iran has an interest in a stable, Tehran-friendly Iraq. For decades, while Mr. Hussein was in power, Iraq was an economic obstacle for Iran, a wall blocking trading routes and diplomatic ties with its Arab neighbors.
 The chaos in Iraq still means that Iran's trade with Syria has to be routed through Turkey. But Iranian officials say they hope someday to link the railroads of Iran and Syria with Iraq's, redrawing the economics of the region.
 But Tehran's interests in Iraq cut much deeper than the economic. They range from its ideological desire to spread its influence throughout the Arab world -- part of the so-called Shiite revival -- to its connection to the people and holy sites of Iraq.
 ''Iran and Iraq's national interests are intertwined,'' said Farzaneh Roostaee, foreign editor of Shargh, a popular reformist daily in Iran that the government shut down late last year. ''Both geographically and religiously, the two countries have many common interests. No matter how much Americans try, they can not separate these two countries from one another. It won't work.''
 The connections extend to the political sphere, as well. Iraq's two dominant Shiite parties, Dawa and the Supreme Council for the Iraqi Islamic Revolution, or Sciri, have deep roots in Iran, where many Shiite leaders fled to escape Mr. Hussein's violent repression of Shiites, which intensified after the Iranian revolution. 
 Several top Dawa leaders, including Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki and a former prime minister, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, along with Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, the leader of Sciri, lived for years in Iran before returning to Iraq after the American invasion. Sciri was founded in Iran in 1984, and its armed wing, the Badr Brigade, fought with Iran in the long, bitter war with Iraq in the 1980s. 
 The militant Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr travels frequently to Iran; American officials said he went there this week to escape the security crackdown in Baghdad, though Shiite officials disputed that. And Mr. Sadr's potent militia, the Mahdi Army, is said to have received training from the Iranians. 
 There are deep spiritual connections, too, centered in Najaf and Karbala, the Iraqi cities which have for centuries been central to the Shiite faith. Long before the Iranian city of Qum grew into a hub of Islamic learning, Najaf was the center of thinking for the Shiite faithful. In the early 1900s, the religious scholars in Najaf effectively exported what came to be known as Iran's constitutional revolution. 
 Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini lived in Najaf for 12 years during his exile before returning to lead the overthrow of the shah of Iran and the installation of the clerical system. It is believed that Imam Ali, the son-in-law and cousin of the Prophet Muhammad, is buried there, and his tomb is a leading site for Shiite pilgrims. 
 Karbala resonates throughout Shiite ideology and faith as the site of the martyrdom of Hussein, the grandson of the prophet, and his followers at the hands of a far larger Sunni army. His tomb is in Karbala, and his death in battle is central to Shiite notions of justice, self-sacrifice and opposition to oppression. 
 The religious centers are so important to Iranians that legions of them still visit the shrines even amid the chaos and bloodshed in Iraq today. 
 ''There are still a lot of lower-middle-class Iranians who want to go to Iraq,'' said Mr. Alavi in Iran. ''It is a really big deal to them. They want to go, as they say, to 'kiss the feet of Imam Hussein.' ''
 Those links to Iran's religious and revolutionary identity, combined with the presence of American troops in Iraq and thousands of NATO forces in Afghanistan, are more than enough justification for Iran to try to counter American influence next door, political analysts in the region said. 
 ''It is not logical to have an American presence in Iraq, and Iran sitting passively, waiting for the formation of an anti-Iranian Iraqi government,'' Mr. Atrissi said. ''From the Iranian perspective, Iran is a country defending its national security.''

HEADLINE: The Liberal Reagan

BYLINE: By RICH LOWRY. 
Rich Lowry is the editor of National Review.

 BODY:
RONALD REAGAN
 Fate, Freedom, and the 
 Making of History.
 By John Patrick Diggins.
 Illustrated. 493 pp. 
 W. W. Norton & Company. $27.95.
Ronald Reagan's reputation has been rising for so long, it is no longer shocking to read a respected historian hail him as, after Abraham Lincoln, ''one of the two or three truly great presidents in American history.'' That's how John Patrick Diggins describes Reagan in a book that is a bid to save him from the dismissiveness of liberal historiography on the one hand and from his conservative worshipers on the other.
 A history professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and the author of many works on American intellectual history, Diggins remembers Reagan as standing for ''tear gas and police'' as governor of California and for ''the age of avarice'' as president. The release of Reagan's writings a few years ago ''came as a surprise'' to him, ''revealing an intelligent, sensitive mind with passionate convictions.'' 
 Having grappled with his newfound respect for Reagan, Diggins attempts a major reinterpretation in ''Ronald Reagan: Fate, Freedom, and the Making of History.'' ''Far from being a conservative,'' he writes, ''Reagan was the great liberating spirit of modern American history, a political romantic impatient with the status quo.'' In Reagan, there is less Edmund Burke, who ''believed in history, precedent and order,'' than Tom Paine, who ''believed in hope, experiment and freedom.'' And so, Reagan was essentially a liberal.
 True enough, in a way. It has often been remarked that America doesn't have a European-style conservative tradition, devoted to defending the prerogatives of an established church or aristocracy. American conservatives like Reagan have always sought instead to conserve the habits and institutions of classical liberalism. And yet, in the contemporary context, Reagan's anti-statism -- no matter how hopeful and optimistic its packaging -- made him unmistakably a conservative.
 Diggins seems blinded by Reagan's sunniness, which, in this interpretation, was not just a matter of temperament, but reflective of a deep philosophical and religious conviction. Reagan, Diggins maintains, sought to rid ''America of a God of judgment and punishment.'' This is absurd. Reagan had a charitable view of human nature and a relaxed, nonjudgmental air, but there is no denying his deeply felt social conservatism. He wrote -- as a sitting president, no less -- the anti-abortion tract ''Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation.''
 Where Reagan really wins over Diggins is in his handling of the endgame of the cold war. On this, Diggins is at his most effusive, and also sees the greatest opportunity, as he puts it, ''to rescue Reagan from many of today's so-called Reaganites.'' 
 Reagan was certainly much more than a conventional conservative hard-liner. He hated nuclear weapons; his dream of the Strategic Defense Initiative (S.D.I.) derived directly from his nuclear abolitionism. While conservatives tend to dismiss the value of dialogue, Reagan put great faith in one-on-one talks and in his own prowess as a negotiator. Diggins can find much that is congenial here. The mistake he makes is attempting to co-opt Reagan entirely to his own preferred policy of compromise in foreign affairs.
 He argues that ''Reagan began to think for himself in his second term,'' as if his confrontational approach to the Soviets until then had been foisted on him. Reagan's attitudes, he maintains, ''underwent a profound change, one that made defeating Communism or winning the cold war a less urgent choice than saving the world from destroying itself.'' This is revisionism gone amok. Reagan always thought he could save the world precisely by defeating the Soviets. Asked by an adviser in the late 1970s what his theory of the cold war was, Reagan replied, ''We win and they lose.'' Early in his administration, he oversaw the development of several key documents realigning American national security policy along these lines. His administration would ''contain and over time reverse'' Soviet expansionism, while pursuing ''negotiations to eliminate, on the basis of strict reciprocity, outstanding disagreements.''
 Reagan stuck to this policy. What happened in the mid-1980s was that he finally had a negotiating partner in the Soviet reformer Mikhail Gorbachev. As Diggins notes, Reagan was far ahead of other, less flexible and less imaginative conservatives in recognizing that Gorbachev represented real change. But Diggins underestimates how Reagan's most important act as a negotiator was saying no -- rebuffing Gorbachev's attempt at the 1986 Reykjavik summit to confine S.D.I. to the laboratory. The Soviets were terrified that they wouldn't be able to keep up with American technology. Once they realized they couldn't kill S.D.I. in the crib, greater political and economic reform was their only alternative.
 Diggins is so enchanted with Reagan the dreamy optimist that he obliterates his stern side, making for a lopsided portrayal. He insists that Reagan didn't truly believe in evil, and so dismisses Reagan's famous 1982 ''evil empire'' speech as the work of one ''ill-advised speechwriter.'' But Reagan used such language throughout his life. In the 1960s, he was calling the Soviet Union the ''evil enemy.'' During his first press conference as president, he said the Soviets ''reserve unto themselves the right to commit any crime, to lie, to cheat.'' Not very sunny.
 If Diggins's account of Reagan is ultimately unpersuasive, both liberals and conservatives will find it challenging. And if the repetition and poor organization of this book sometimes keep it from being enjoyable reading, it is nonetheless a sign that across the political spectrum we are beginning to agree that Ronald Reagan was an important, even admirable, figure. What liberals and conservatives will probably never agree on is why.

HEADLINE: Bernanke's Optimism Prompts a Market Rally

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, gave a relatively upbeat forecast on inflation and the economy last week, and the markets responded with big gains. 
 Mr. Bernanke appeared before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday. While he made it clear that the Fed would raise interest rates if needed to fight inflation, he also said that the prospects for a decline in inflation and of a modest cooling of the economy were quite good. 
Shares of Alcoa gained almost 7 percent for the week, the best performance among the Dow industrials. A report in the news media said that two companies were independently trying to buy the aluminum company, which fueled hopes for a pickup in takeover activity. Shares of Caterpillar, the heavy-equipment maker, jumped 4.4 percent for the week. It announced plans to buy back $7.5 billion in stock over the next five years. 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 186.74 points, or 1.5 percent, to close at 12,767.57. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 17.48 points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 1,455.54. The Nasdaq composite gained 36.49 points, or 1.5 percent, to close at 2,496.31. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond fell to 4.69 percent from 4.78 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: For New Line, an Identity Crisis

BYLINE: By SHARON WAXMAN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 18 

 BODY:
For six weeks in 2005, Robert K. Shaye, the founder and co-chairman of New Line Cinema, lay in a coma in a New York City hospital, fending off death from a sudden infection. 
 He survived, narrowly, and over many months quietly made his way back to health, a dizzying and unexpected turn for one of Hollywood's mavericks.
 Now Mr. Shaye, 67, is back to what he has done for nearly 40 years, running New Line, a midsize studio in a world of competitive behemoths, at a time when the company, owned by Time Warner, has been beset by rumors of dysfunction and executive change, and bedeviled by a slate of unsuccessful films in 2006.
 That too is an unexpected turn for a studio that three years ago capped the phenomenally popular ''Lord of the Rings'' series with a best picture Oscar for the last installment, ''The Return of the King'' -- a first for the studio. 
 Since then, according to both Mr. Shaye and Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the president of Time Warner, the studio has been financially successful, earning more than $100 million every year for the last three, largely in revenue from previous hits that continues to stream in through DVD and other post-theatrical sales. ''New Line is very profitable,'' Mr. Bewkes said in an interview. ''We're making money hand over fist.''
 But in Hollywood and on Wall Street, some question the focus at New Line. After the success of ''Lord of the Rings,'' some had expected the studio to pursue a more ambitious agenda than the urban comedies and horror films of its past. That might have included pressing ahead with ''The Hobbit,'' from the ''Rings'' author J. R. R. Tolkien, to which New Line shares the rights.
 Instead, Mr. Shaye has been trading insults with the ''Rings'' director Peter Jackson, while the studio has struggled to find a new breakout hit.
 ''I wouldn't characterize it as financial crisis, even if they had a bad year,'' said Harold L. Vogel, an entertainment analyst. ''It's more like an identity crisis. It's a fair question: where do you go from here? Everyone has the same problem, whether you're 90 or you're 20. And they're facing it now with a little more emphasis.''
 If critics have observed that the studio seems distracted, there may be good reason. Mr. Shaye's illness, the seriousness of which was not disclosed to the public before now, apparently derailed the studio for a portion of 2005 and affected the slate in 2006. And last year he took time to direct his own movie, ''The Last Mimzy,'' a family-oriented science fiction adventure (co-written by New Line's president of production, Toby Emmerich) that will open in theaters next month. 
 In an interview in his office in Los Angeles last week, Mr. Shaye said that he had as much enthusiasm for running his studio as ever, and said he believed that this year's releases would do well. ''I started this company in 1967,'' he said. ''I still come to work every day. I still have the same passion I had then.''
 Mr. Shaye acknowledged his disappointment in the studio's performance in 2006, with duds like ''Snakes on a Plane,'' which cost $33 million to make and took in only that much in domestic theaters despite higher expectations, and ''Tenacious D: 'The Pick of Destiny,'' the Jack Black comedy with a budget of less than $20 million, which took in a scant $8 million in domestic ticket sales. 
 ''After last year I will take a more considered approach to the green-light process,'' he said. ''I will act as more of an adversary, or critic, of the decisions advocated by others.'' 
 But he said the studio would continue to aim for its traditional zone of comedies and genre films, with a couple of highbrow dramas and one or two big-budget bets, in the range of $100 million and above.
 For this year, those big bets include ''Rush Hour 3,'' the next in the successful series of martial arts comedies, and ''The Golden Compass,'' a fantasy adventure with special effects and a budget of $150 million, a potential new franchise for the studio. 
 The studio has also secured a $350 million line of credit in a financing deal with the Royal Bank of Scotland, giving it a financial cushion. 
 Mr. Shaye spoke in detail for the first time about the illness that almost killed him two years ago. In March 2005, he said he suddenly came down with a lethal form of pneumonia, from streptococcus A bacteria, similar to a rare illness that precipitously killed Jim Henson, the ''Muppets'' creator, at age 53 in 1990. 
 On the advice of a doctor, Mr. Shaye checked into NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and was placed in a medically induced coma in the intensive care unit for six weeks. (In his film ''Mimzy,'' Mr. Shaye names one character Dr. Sherman, in tribute to one of his caregivers.) 
 He emerged from the coma and after two months in the hospital, he was permitted to go home to his Manhattan residence. Even then he took many months to recover, unable initially to walk for more than two or three minutes at a time, and slowly taking up work again. 
 But Mr. Shaye says he thinks more clearly now than he did before his illness. ''It's difficult to explain, but I have a clarity of thought and, I believe, of reason, which was one of the gifts'' of his illness, he said. And, he added, ''I certainly appreciate the normal functioning of life a lot more.'' 
 One thing that has not been blunted by illness is Mr. Shaye's temper, which flared last year when he was asked about a lawsuit filed by Mr. Jackson over profits from ''The Lord of the Rings.'' 
 Mr. Shaye, criticizing what he called Mr. Jackson's ''arrogance'' and calling the director ''myopic,'' told Sci-Fi Wire: ''I don't care about Peter Jackson anymore.'' He added, ''He wants to have another $100 million or $50 million, whatever he's suing us for. He doesn't want to sit down and talk about it. He thinks that we owe him something after we've paid him over a quarter of a billion dollars.''
 Asked about the remarks last week, Mr. Shaye said that he made the statement ''in a moment of emotion'' but did not regret it. ''I regret losing a friend,'' he said, as he showed a visitor a Gandalf sword that Mr. Jackson had sent him as a gift, before the lawsuit.
 A representative for Mr. Jackson declined to comment.
 But the ill will has held up plans to make ''The Hobbit.'' Without specifically saying he would not make the film with Mr. Jackson, Mr. Shaye made it plain that he had no interest in working with difficult filmmakers. ''Some directors are impossible,'' he said. ''Are there a few people I wouldn't work with? Yes, but I won't name names.''
 And he would not comment on reports in the news media that the ''Spider-Man'' director Sam Raimi had been asked to direct ''The Hobbit.'' He said, however, that although there was no workable script yet for the film, he intended to release it in 2009. 
 The Hollywood rumor mill has worked overtime in debating the future of New Line, which has had to justify its existence repeatedly over its 40-year history. Some people have questioned, for example, why the studio that made Will Ferrell's breakout hit ''Elf'' in 2003 has not made other movies with him. 
 Until now. This month New Line began production on ''Semi-Pro,'' starring Mr. Ferrell; Mr. Shaye said that Mr. Ferrell had not found material he wanted to make at New Line until now, and chose not to make a sequel to ''Elf.'' 
 And although the studio is now part of Time Warner, current and former executives said that it continues to operate much like a family. Mr. Shaye, the father figure of the group, described his partnership with his co-chairman, Michael Lynne, this way : ''I'm emotion. He's reason.'' 
 But as in a family, some producers and agents complained of confusion in their business dealings with the studio. Several said they had made deals with Mr. Emmerich or another executive at the studio, only to have Mr. Shaye redefine the terms later. 
 An executive connected with the coming film ''Rendition'' said the same thing happened on that project, a big-budget production under way in Morocco, starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Reese Witherspoon and Meryl Streep. Weeks after the producers closed the deal with the studio, said the executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect his business relationships, Mr. Shaye came back to them and placed additional conditions, like finding a financing partner.
 In an e-mail message, Mr. Emmerich disputed that account, saying that Mr. Shaye had reservations about the script from the start.
 Still, some agents and producers point out that the loose atmosphere at New Line can also lead to daring decisions, like the one that led to the ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy. 
 Mr. Shaye denied that any executive changes were in the works, and said that Mr. Emmerich would continue to run production, while Russell Schwartz would continue to run domestic marketing. 
 Mr. Bewkes, the Time Warner president, said that he regarded the three years of success with ''Rings'' to be an anomaly -- albeit one that brought in well over $3 billion in revenue to New Line. 
 ''The business they're in is a combination of all those 'little titles,' which add up to a steady stream for the indie business, and occasional but pretty regular big commercial franchises, like 'Rush Hour,' 'Lord of the Rings' or 'The Golden Compass,' '' he said. ''I feel confident about New Line's future.'' 
 And Mr. Shaye, whose contract is up in 2008, seemed to fully agree. ''It's never business as usual, because the business is unusual,'' he said, adding, ''but we'd rather work on movies than anything else -- every one of us.''

Billy Bob Thornton won critical and popular acclaim in 1996 with ''Sling Blade,'' a film that he wrote, directed and starred in as a mildly retarded killer. Since, he has played everything from a thief hiding out in a red suit in ''Bad Santa'' (2003) to Davy Crockett in 
 ''The Alamo'' (2004). 
 He plays a Texas hero again in ''The Astronaut Farmer,'' above, a sort of ''Right Stuff'' meets ''Field of Dreams'' story about a retired astronaut who is building a rocket in his barn, in his own private bid for space flight. SHELLY FREIERMAN

HEADLINE: Buffalo Looks For Work But Debates Casino's Value

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: BUFFALO 

 BODY:
The gray girders going up in an uninviting stretch of the Cobblestone District near downtown Buffalo seem a promising sign. Almost any economic activity is usually welcomed in this city that has become an emblem of faded industrial glory.
 But these gray girders are the bones of a 6,000-square-foot gambling hall that the Seneca Indians intend to open in May, a marker for a far larger, $125 million casino that the tribe hopes will attract gamblers from Cleveland and Pittsburgh and transform Buffalo into a leisure hub.
But even in a city from which jobs and residents continue to flee, many business and political leaders see the casino as fiscal and civic poison. Though the Seneca Gaming Corporation promises 1,000 jobs and $5 million a year for the city, some think the casino would topple Buffalo's shaky economy because as a tribe the Senecas do not pay property or sales taxes. Bars, restaurants and hotels without such advantages will close, the critics worry, while crime and gambling addiction rise in their place.
 The debate over the new casino, one of the nastiest recent public arguments in Buffalo, was only a war of words until a federal judge ruled last month that the National Indian Gaming Commission had acted improperly when it granted the Senecas permission to run a casino. The judge ordered the commission to reconsider, which could take six months. 
 While the casino is in limbo, a broader dispute rages that goes to competing visions for Buffalo's future. Backers say a casino would help builders and raise property prices and begin to redefine a city that has struggled to make up for the loss of manufacturing jobs. Casino opponents prefer to showcase Buffalo's affordability and educated workforce in hopes of attracting science and technology jobs, while redeveloping the waterfront -- including the Cobblestone District around the casino's plot. 
 ''Buffalo is making slow progress, but there is no silver bullet,'' said Dianne Bennett, president of Citizens for a Better Buffalo, which is organizing the financing and legal team in the federal and state lawsuits to stop the casino. ''We have a biomedical center, a state university. We don't have to apologize for anything, and there's no reason to abandon our legacy.''
 But Rajat Shah, senior vice president of corporate development at Seneca Gaming, said: ''The future is in tourism. We're the leading edge to change the focus of the economy.''
 Some casino experts say the city has an image problem. The winters are long and harsh, and with so many other casinos around -- including the Senecas' own competing outlet 30 minutes away in Niagara Falls and new slot parlors in Philadelphia -- luring gamblers here may be a long shot. ''I find it difficult to look at Buffalo as a competitor to Atlantic City or Las Vegas or the Catskills,'' said Eugene Martin Christiansen, chief executive of Christiansen Capital Advisors, a gambling industry consultant. ''It takes a lot of time to get there, and once you're there, you are in Buffalo.''
 The showdown in Buffalo comes amid a growing reaction to the Indian casinos that have been moving from remote reservations to cities and towns. Though legal under certain conditions, off-reservation casinos are lightning rods for critics who say the laws meant to compensate tribes for historical wrongs are being distorted; some in Congress are trying to rewrite regulations for the granting of Indian casino licenses.
 ''The movement to stem off-reservation applications has bubbled for some time,'' said Paul DeMain, managing editor of News From Indian Country, a newsletter. ''It's really the rising wealth of tribes in certain areas and the impact they have on the political process. There's a certain resentment.''
 Casinos near cities have created their own particular problems. Some tribes with casinos have tried to block other tribes from opening. Commercial operators resent Indian casinos that do not have to pay many taxes or follow certain labor and health regulations. 
 In Buffalo, Mayor Byron Brown has tried to steer a middle course. The casino was approved by his predecessor; Mr. Brown persuaded the Senecas to agree to invest about $5 million in infrastructure like roads and sewers, and to try to save half its planned jobs for city residents.
 ''Our position was not to argue that a casino is good or bad; those decisions were made at a higher level,'' said Mr. Brown, who made a point of saying that he is not a gambler. ''As mayor, my responsibility is to protect the interests of the community.'' 
 But Joel A. Giambra, the Erie County executive, joined the lawsuits challenging the casino. He says a gambling hall downtown would aggravate Buffalo's social problems and attract few out-of-town visitors.
 One of the main objections is that the casino would be a few blocks from the Commodore Perry Homes, a low-income housing project. Experts say that people who live within 10 miles of a casino are twice as likely to become problem gamblers, and that the poor are more susceptible to the casinos' allure. ''This is like putting open candy in front of kids and saying if you don't want to eat it, keep your hands away,'' said Darius Pridgen, a pastor at the True Bethel Baptist Church, which is near the casino and the Perry projects. 
 The current debate is the latest chapter in a long-running battle over how to compensate the Senecas for abuses perpetrated against them centuries ago. In 1990, Congress paid the Senecas $60 million to resolve long-term leases of their land to local residents. The tribe signed a compact in 2002 with New York that let them build three casinos in and near Buffalo.
 One casino, on a reservation 75 miles south of Buffalo, was easily built because it was within sovereign Seneca territory. The one in Niagara Falls, which opened on New Year's Eve 2002, and the one here were placed on property bought with proceeds from what regulators deemed was the settlement of a land claim, effectively making them satellite reservations.
 ''We're home again,'' said Barry E. Snyder Sr., the chairman of Seneca Gaming. ''We lost a lot of land but we're able to recover some of it.''
 Opponents, including John J. LaFalce, a former Democratic congressman who was a co-author of the Seneca Settlement Act in 1990, say the agreement was never meant to pay for casinos. Joseph M. Finnerty, the lawyer coordinating the state and federal lawsuits, argued -- and a federal judge has now agreed -- that the Indian Gaming Commission never determined that these were Indian lands.
 ''The Seneca have peddled this myth that any land they buy with money from the Seneca Settlement Act automatically creates sovereign Seneca territory,'' Mr. Finnerty complained. 
 While the Senecas' legal right to build a casino in Buffalo is sorted out, the arguments continue. Both sides point to Niagara Falls, where Seneca Gaming converted the convention center into a casino and built a 604-room hotel, to underscore their cases.
 Mr. Shah of Seneca Gaming said the casino has lifted land prices in Niagara Falls, and that hotels have benefited from the overflow when the Senecas' hotel is booked. The nearly 3,000 workers at the casino and hotel receive average salaries of $38,000, he said, plus health insurance and retirement plans.
 ''The magnitude of what we're spending here has not been seen in decades,'' Mr. Shah said. ''We're trying to recreate the Las Vegas feel.''
 The casino drew 8 million visitors last year and saw revenue jump 41 percent last quarter. But the streets nearby are lined with boarded-up homes, restaurants and hotels.
 ''There is no evidence of new economic activity because of the casinos,'' said Mr. Giambra, the county executive. ''In downtown Niagara Falls, even the tumbleweeds have left.''
 And Buffalo does not even have a world-famous waterfall to draw international visitors. Attracting high rollers from Pennsylvania or Ohio, as the Senecas intend, may be difficult when the snow piles up.
 Critics fear that if out-of-towners do not materialize, the casino will intensify marketing to local residents, who will shift their spending from nearby restaurants, movie theaters and shops to the slot machines. They also worry that theft and other problems, on the rise since the opening of the nearby casinos, may also increase. Visitors to the Jewish Family Services Gambling Recovery Program in Buffalo have doubled since 2001.
 ''The tough thing in Buffalo is that this is a proud community and all the jobs that have left were an incredible psychological blow to people,'' said Larry Quinn, who is the general manager of the Buffalo Sabres hockey team and is also helping develop the city's waterfront. ''Right now, you can understand that when something like this comes along, people might say it's the best we can do.''

HEADLINE: HOUSING MARKET HEATS UP IN CITY

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON

 BODY:
Since the new year began, a burst of activity has broken out in Manhattan and several Brooklyn neighborhoods as New Yorkers frenetically hunt for co-ops, condominiums and town houses, sending prices higher despite sluggish sales in many other cities.
 Preliminary indications from real estate firms showed that this increased activity, with open houses jammed and bidding wars taking place, has occurred in all price ranges -- from tiny studios in the East Village to red-brick mansions on the Upper East Side -- in counterpoint to the heavily weighted record sales of luxury properties that led the market in the late summer and fall.
Real estate brokers and statisticians are quick to point out that not every single apartment is flying into contract. During the last quarter of 2006, the major real estate agencies differed on which way prices were headed. 
 But now, the three largest real estate companies in the city agree: for January, at least, both prices and the number of signed contracts rose in double-digit percentages compared with the same month in 2006. 
 With higher Wall Street bonuses, a strong regional economy and pent-up demand from New Yorkers who were once worried that the city's real estate market would crash, buyers' attitudes have done an about-face. ''Their psychology has changed,'' said Frederick W. Peters, the president of the Warburg Realty Partnership. ''For almost two years, they've been scared that the market would plummet and they'd end up like fools who paid too much.'' 
 Real estate experts say they see no reason for the trend to not continue, with economists predicting stable mortgage rates and a continuing city budget surplus. However, other factors may alter New Yorkers' renewed interest in buying real estate, including an expansion of the Iraq war, a changing employment picture or another terrorist attack.
 Yet, there is ''cautious exuberance,'' according to Steven L. James, director of Manhattan sales for Prudential Douglas Elliman.
 A week ago, one open house attracted 100 people to an Upper West Side one-bedroom; a $2.475 million house in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn sold in a day.
 Across the board, the prices of Manhattan apartments are rising. Jonathan Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm, said the number of contracts signed this January was 19.4 percent higher than in January 2006. Prices were up 14.4 percent in the same time period. Inventory, which was mounting last summer, is shrinking fast. 
 Now, according to Mr. Miller, statistics showed that sales of studio and one-bedroom units, stagnant over the past year, were up 13.7 percent in January. ''It's not like a lot of huge sales at the high end skewed the average up.''
 According to a report released last week by the National Association of Realtors, prices are falling in many other metropolitan areas around the country. The report covered only the last quarter of 2006, and showed a modest increase of 3.1 percent for the New York area, which includes parts of northern New Jersey. 
 Anecdotally, there isn't much talk of falling prices in Manhattan and in the most sought-after neighborhoods in Brooklyn, where young people looking for a break, empty nesters looking for a guest room and foreigners looking for a pied-a-terre say they want to live. 
 Katalin Shavely, a 30-year-old bedding designer in Manhattan, devotes her weekends to scanning the classifieds and attending open houses, searching for just the right one-bedroom apartment for less than $750,000. She can't find it. ''I made a mistake,'' she said last week. ''I should have started looking before Thanksgiving.'' 
 Mr. Miller said New Yorkers had been reluctant to buy because of the feeling of an impending crash. ''Last summer, a lot of information was being dumped on the consumer: stories about the glut of condos in Miami, Washington, D.C., and Las Vegas, exacerbated by the constant debate on the blogosphere about housing bubbles, mixed together with a barrage of negative predictions,'' he said in a telephone interview.
 Although no one can pinpoint the moment when New Yorkers started feverishly buying again, Kirk Henckels, the director of the private brokerage division of Stribling & Associates, said he thought the luxury market picked up after Labor Day. 
 He and others said the resurgence was partly fueled by the fall's record-setting (and well-publicized) sales of a few multimillion-dollar apartments and town houses, like the Stanford White limestone palazzo at 25 East 78th Street bought by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg for $45 million and the Harkness mansion at 4 East 75th Street sold in October for $53 million. 
 Then came this year's stratospheric Wall Street bonuses, and the market exploded, real estate executives said.
 ''The plunger that freed up all the hesitation at all price levels was those bonuses,'' said Diane Ramirez, the president of Halstead Property. ''It cleaned the pipes and gave confidence to even small apartment buyers.'' 
 Within the last month, the Corcoran Group, Halstead and Prudential Douglas Elliman, three of New York City's largest real estate sales firms, say they have recorded double-digit increases in contract prices and in the number of transactions.
 In a real estate market where 18 and 22 percent price increases were recorded in 2004 and 2005, last year's 6 percent increase was depressing, Mr. Miller said. 
 Pamela Liebman, the president of the Corcoran Group, reported that the company's contracts for this January totaled $1.3 billion, an increase of 53 percent from January 2006. 
 Prices in many areas of Brooklyn are going up, too. According to Marc Garstein, the president of Warren Lewis Realty in Park Slope, prices in what he called the downtown neighborhoods -- including Brooklyn Heights, Park Slope, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Prospect Heights and Windsor Terrace -- are now approaching 2004 highs, after being off about 10 percent in the last two years. 
 A town house at 171 Garfield Place in Park Slope, priced at $2,475,000, sold for the asking price one day after it was put on the market. Fifty people had shown up at the open house, Mr. Garstein said. 
 Customers said they had expected a buyer's market in which they could call the shots, but found a race track, instead.
 Jane LaFarge Hamill, a 25-year-old painter who lives in a ''small, kind of stinky'' studio in Chinatown, said she had looked at 60 apartments over three months, trying to take advantage of the lull she had noticed. ''We decided to look while sellers were still worried that the market was crashing,'' she said. 
 When she started looking last fall, there was still ''wiggle room,'' she said. But now, there is frenzy, said her mother, Leita Hamill, who, with her husband, Bill, is helping her daughter search for and buy a new home. The Hamills had gotten into a bidding war, one of many reported by brokers these days, for a two-bedroom co-op in Gramercy Park. They had started bidding above the asking price, but it wasn't enough. 
 ''There were people bidding on the apartment sight-unseen,'' Mrs. Hamill said. The victors got the co-op through a sealed bid, she said. ''It was like a pair of shoes that you absolutely had to have,'' she said.
 Real estate executives say they do not know how long the market's heat will be turned up, although they say the regional economy looks strong. 
 They also say that the first two quarters of the year -- the spring market -- are traditionally stronger than the last two. Thus, the average for the whole of 2007 may or may not show the double-digit growth that the first part of the year is showing. ''It'sall about price now,'' Ms. Ramirez said. ''The market is not in a spike mode, when anything, for any price, will sell.''
 Ms. Ramirez, who has sold real estate for more than 30 years, said she expected that the current rocketing growth would be followed by a period of slower yet steady increases. ''I don't want to hear, 'Oh my gosh, the market is slowing up again,' '' she said. ''With the number of deals we had last week, it has to calm down. But I feel much more confident than at any time in the last five years when the market had fits and starts and there was always a certain underlying nervousness.'' 
 Toward the end of 2004, the real estate market in the city was booming. But then, brokers started seeing ''great concern among clients that mortgage rates were about to jump and that house prices would suffer a sharp correction,'' Mr. Miller said. 
 Since then, there has been change of leadership in Congress, Mr. Miller noted. In the region, unemployment has dropped. Mortgage rates didn't soar. ''Two years ago, we were predicting they'd be up to 8 percent now,'' he said. (Rates for a 30-year fixed loan on a New York City co-op hover around 6.25 percent, according to the Manhattan Mortgage Company.)
 After months of trying to push shoppers over the edge of indecision, brokers now say they spend time warning house hunters not to rush in heedlessly -- advice the would-be buyers don't always listen to. 
 ''When my wife and I got into the market in mid-December, people told me there was a glut of one-bedroom apartments and I could take my time,'' said Shelly Cohen, 51, an empty-nester. ''When we actually got into the market, I found it was just the opposite.'' He just found a newly created condominium in a beige brick high-rise at 1438 Third Avenue at 81st Street and quickly signed the contract. He said he felt he had to.
 Mrs. Hamill, the mother of the young artist in Chinatown, offers her own advice to friends. 
 ''Now I tell everybody: Be ready to write the check the minute you see something you love,'' she said. ''If it's any good, it'll be gone by the next day.'' She paused. ''Or, even by that same day.''

HEADLINE: From Clipouts to the Web, Coupons Transition Slowly

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
ONLINE coupons have always been a bargain-hunter's diversion, which may be precisely why the market has grown so slowly. Who wants to take time out of the day to track down sites that give away 50-cent discounts, then search for eligible products that they might need?
 Right now, the practice appeals only to about 12 percent of the 175 million Internet users in the United States, according to ComScore Media Metrix. The rest are apparently happy getting coupons in their Sunday paper, where they can flip through them in seconds.
Purveyors of Internet coupons, like Coupons.com and CoolSavings.com, run sites where visitors can click on an offer and print out a slip to take to a store -- for, say, a dollar off a roll of toilet paper or 75 cents off a box of fruit bars. But executives at Coupons Inc., which runs Coupons.com, and elsewhere say that consumers may be more receptive to online coupons if they stumble upon them while seeking out other content -- for instance, if a recipe they are viewing contains an offer for an ingredient, or if a news article links to a coupon for a product or service it mentions. 
 Coupons Inc. began offering such a service last year, and its chief executive, Steven R. Boal, says the initiative is about to get a significant boost. In the coming weeks, he said, a number of online publishers will adopt it, thereby putting online coupons directly in the paths of millions of consumers who might not otherwise see them.
 ''Online coupons will be significantly more visible in the coming months,'' predicted Mr. Boal, who would not name his new client.
 Lisa Bradner, an analyst with Forrester Research, says that putting online coupons in the consumer's path, rather than posting them to a coupons-only Web site, may prompt more people to use them. 
 ''Consumers are getting inundated with spam, and they're seeing more ads than ever,'' Ms. Bradner said. ''This makes it much more relevant to consumers, so if you're looking up a recipe and see coupons for an ingredient, you're more likely to say 'Yeah, I want that.' ''
 Not everyone subscribes to that logic. Matt Wise, the chief executive of Q Interactive, which operates CoolSavings.com, said that his company tried a similar approach but saw a lukewarm response from consumers.
 ''It's a bit counterintuitive, but you want to bring a broad selection of things that people didn't intend to pick out,'' Mr. Wise said. ''It's like when you look through the Sunday paper. One of the joys is seeing things you didn't expect to see.''
 CoolSavings distributes most of the coupons it offers through its Web site, but a growing number of its clients choose to deliver offers by e-mail, Mr. Wise said. ''We see more retailers wanting to create ongoing dialogue,'' he said, ''not just pass out the coupons anonymously.''
 While Coupons.com and CoolSavings cater mostly to national retailers and brands, Valpak, the local advertising division of Cox Enterprises, has moved aggressively in recent months to introduce local retailers to online coupons.
 Last summer the company introduced a service with Google in which users of Google Maps are shown Valpak coupons for merchants in areas where they search. Todd Leiser, general manager for Valpak.com, Valpak's online division, said that his company had seen a ''big spike in traffic'' from the Google partnership. It plans in coming months to announce other partnerships aimed at increasing the online exposure of its advertisers' coupons, Mr. Leiser said.
 Marc Saban, who owns Straight From the Crate, a chain of seven Manhattan furniture stores, is one of Valpak.com's recent Internet converts. In December, Mr. Saban said he tested the company's online coupons for the first time, with a 10 percent discount. ''We saw a noticeable spike in business from it, so we'll obviously want to run with that,'' he said.
 Mr. Saban says that online coupons have many advantages over their offline counterparts. ''It's a lot easier for people to go and bookmark a page, instead of trying to hold on to a coupon,'' he said. ''And online, someone from Brooklyn might see the coupon, whereas they wouldn't see it offline because I don't send my fliers there. It's almost like a bonus.''
 Despite such promising signs, analysts and other industry executives said the online coupon category over all is moving slowly. The number of visitors to leading coupon sites grew by only 6 percent last year, according to ComScore, and traffic actually declined at the most popular site, CoolSavings.com.
 According to CMS Inc., a promotions company, consumers printed roughly 697 million Internet coupons in 2006, a 3.4 percent increase over 2005. Of those, 6.2 million were redeemed, a decrease of 4.4 percent from the previous year. 
 Internet coupon distribution and redemption are only a small part of the overall coupon picture. In 2006, marketers distributed 286 billion coupons worth $331.8 billion, but consumers redeemed only 2.6 billion coupons worth just over $2.6 billion, CMS said.
 Retailers and consumer goods manufacturers are, however, growing more interested in online coupons. A recent survey of 100 large retailers by the E-tailing Group, a consultancy, revealed that 20 now offer online coupons, compared with just five a year ago. 
 While the typical Sunday paper may have about 35 coupon offers, according to Mr. Boal of Coupons.com, his company has 60 to 100 coupons on its Web site at any time. Since last year, about 3,000 sites have distributed some of them, he said. 
 Sites like WNBC.com, operated by the NBC television affiliate in New York, for instance, will highlight certain words in articles and display a pop-up message for related coupons whenever users roll their cursor over that word. When users click, they go to another part of the site to select and print the coupon.
 Last week, the service -- which does not work on Apple computers -- offered coupons for Cheerios when users rolled their cursor over the word ''waffle'' in a WNBC article about Ben & Jerry's new ice cream flavor. The article referred to ''waffle cones,'' not the breakfast food, but it was enough to induce the offer anyway.
 Mr. Boal said that Coupons Inc., a private company founded in 1998 and based in Mountain View, Calif., had seen strong growth both in the number of Web sites distributing its offers and in the number of coupons printed. As for its own Web site, ''We're now seeing customers visit habitually before they shop, which is something we'd never seen,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Hollywood Gets Tough on Movie Copying in Canada

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: OTTAWA, Feb. 18 

 BODY:
Canada heavily promotes itself as a place to make films. But now it has a more dubious distinction: an analysis by the Motion Picture Association of America has found that 30 to 40 percent of the bootleg DVDs sold in the United States were made by camcorders smuggled into Canadian theaters.
 In response, 20th Century Fox Film is considering holding back film releases for the Canadian market, and the film industry in general is calling for stricter Canadian laws. One theater chain has even equipped some its staff with night-vision goggles to better ferret out copiers. 
The apparent rise of Canada's illegal film industry stems from several factors. Tighter federal and state laws in the United States covering film piracy have not been matched by similar legislation in Canada. And because most film releases are simultaneous in Canada and the United States, Canadian pirates get a head start relative to their counterparts abroad. 
 And, finally, even industry officials acknowledge that Canadian pirates offer technically superior work.
 ''There are professional Canadian camcord rings and they are very, very good at what they do,'' said John G. Malcolm, the director of worldwide antipiracy operations for the Motion Picture Association of America in Los Angeles. ''There is a premium placed on getting early copies and high-quality copies. Everyone in the industry knows that camcording in Canada is a major, major problem.''
 The film industry's estimate of how many black market DVDs originate from Canadian multiplexes is not simply a guess. In many release prints, almost unnoticeable identification marks are scattered throughout random frames. 
 On the studios' behalf, Technicolor and Deluxe Laboratories, the leading producers of those prints, regularly analyze illicit DVDs as well as online film postings, uncover the identification codes and then use them to trace the copies back to the theater where they were videotaped.
 In Canada, that trail usually leads to theaters in the Montreal area, which is estimated to be the source of three-quarters of the illicit copies that come from the country.
 In the United States, federal law as well as 40 state laws can impose harsh penalties for videotaping movies from theater screens, a process known as camming. In Canada, however, it violates copyright laws only if the police can show in court that the camera operator intended to commercially distribute copies of the recording.
 ''It's very hard for us to prove that a person is actually doing that,'' said Ellis Jacob, the president and chief executive of Cineplex Entertainment, Canada's dominant theater chain, speaking from Toronto. ''All we can do is get rid of the patron and ask them not to come back.''
 Like everyone in the Canadian theater business, Mr. Jacob has received two letters from Bruce Snyder, the president of domestic distribution for Fox. (All studios treat Canada as part of the United States market.) The messages were blunt. Describing the situation in Canada as ''an out of control epidemic,'' Mr. Snyder warned the theater owners that Fox may delay Canadian releases by several weeks.
 In an interview, Mr. Snyder said he has no complaints about companies like Cineplex, which are, after all, his customers.
 ''I am not mad at the exhibition community,'' Mr. Snyder said. ''The exhibitors are doing everything they can to help us.'' Like Mr. Jacob, his concerns are with Canadian law and law enforcement.
 Canada accounts for about 7 to 10 percent of a film's total North American revenue. The spillover effect of movie coverage by American television and publications would be diminished if Mr. Snyder delayed Canadian releases.
 ''It's a drastic step,'' Mr. Snyder said. ''But you've got to plug that hole somehow. It could be short-term damage for long-term benefit.''
 In the interim, Cineplex has supplied several theater managers with night-vision goggles and increased the surveillance of theaters, particularly during afternoon screenings. After an extensive investigation, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested one Montreal man in September for taping movies. Working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Canadian police has traced his handiwork to black-market DVDs sold in New York.
 Because prosecutors are still working out formal charges, the man cannot be identified. Sgt. Jean-Yves Ducharme of the Mounted Police in Montreal said the man is less than 30 years old and ''a person who did not make a lot of money out of it.'' 
 The suspect, he added, was a computer enthusiast who appeared to be motivated by producing high-quality copies and distributing them as close to a film's release as possible.
 Canada's theater owners and other film industry groups are pressing the Canadian government to make the simple act of recording from a theater screen a crime. Mr. Jacob said they have received little response to date.
 Christian Girouard, a spokesman for Canada's justice department, said officials were discussing the situation with the industry and other government departments. He said he was unable to describe what, if any, measures might be taken.

HEADLINE: Saving North Korea's Refugees

BYLINE: By Nicholas Eberstadt and Christopher Griffin. 
Nicholas Eberstadt is on the board of the United States Committee for Human Rights in North Korea. Christopher Griffin is a research associate at the American Enterprise Institute.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE Bush administration can point to precious few successes in its efforts to curb North Korea's mounting menace -- even last week's celebrated nuclear deal with Kim Jong-il's government is, for the moment, little more than a written promise from a highly unreliable negotiating partner. 
 Yet inexplicably, the Bush team continues to overlook a spectacular opportunity to deliver freedom to tens of thousands of North Koreans, to pressure the country from within for fundamental change and to lay the groundwork for a peaceful, reunified Korean Peninsula. By fostering an underground railroad to rescue North Korean refugees living in China, the United States could do all these things at once. 
On humanitarian grounds alone, the case for action on behalf of the wretched North Koreans in hiding north of their country's border along the Yalu River is compelling. While the exact numbers are unknown, this refugee emergency may be second only to Darfur: the International Crisis Group speaks of scores of thousands of refugees, and recently uncovered Chinese official documents indicate hundreds of thousands. 
 As illegal immigrants in China (Beijing insists North Korean border-crossers are economic migrants, or worse), they live in constant fear and at terrible risk. Women are forced into the sex trade or coerced marriages; men and children on the run have less obvious utility and thus, by some accounts, correspondingly higher mortality. 
 Yet the North Korean refugees who end up as victims of exploitation, violence or crime in China may be the lucky ones. A far worse fate awaits those whom China ''refouls,'' or deports to North Korea in violation of Beijing's commitments under the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. North Korea regards fleeing Kim Jong-il's paradise as an act of disloyalty close to treason. Captives forcibly returned to North Korea face prison, torture and death, attesting to the refugee status that official Chinese wordplay denies. 
 Despite a gradually hardening Chinese posture toward this humanitarian crisis (now entering its second decade), over the years a few private groups have been bravely spiriting refugees out of China and into third countries. Intrepid souls like Steve Kim of New York (jailed in China since 2003), Phillip Buck from Seattle (jailed for 15 months in 2005-2006), Adrian Hong (deported last December) and others from America, South Korea and elsewhere have rescued thousands of North Koreans from China, often by way of an arduous 6,000-mile overland journey into Southeast Asia, where North Korean refugees can seek resettlement in states that accept them. 
 The desperation of North Korean refugees has also attracted unscrupulous entrepreneurs who guide refugees out of China for a profit. This latter-day flesh trade has been criticized by the governments of China and South Korea -- each eager, for its own reasons, to discredit any efforts at exodus from North Korea. But whether created by noble motives or mercenary ones, this continuing trickle of escapees proves that a path to freedom already exists. And that trickle would grow if these North Koreans knew they could count on official protection along the way. 
 Some will worry loudly about international resettlement for tens (never mind hundreds) of thousands of North Korean refugees, but the logistical issues are basically solved in advance: as a matter of national law, South Korea is obliged to welcome them all. Under Articles 2 and 3 of the Republic of Korea's Constitution, as reaffirmed by the country's Supreme Court in 1996, every North Korean refugee has the right to resettle in South Korea. Commitments by Washington and other free governments to take in North Korean refugees are desirable and commendable (the United States is already committed to doing so under the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004), but it is natural and fitting that South Korea should be the destination for the overwhelming majority of North Korea's freedom-seekers. 
 The critical missing piece for getting this underground railroad up and running is safe passage through China. But because the South Korean government fears antagonizing the North and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is too timid to face down Beijing, China's opposition to this rescue mission has gone unchallenged. Only the United States is in a position to help overcome Beijing's recalcitrance. 
 The Chinese government's cost-benefit calculus regarding these refugees would change drastically if Washington weighed in as their advocate. If the United States (along with other governments) provided informal assurances that China is merely a way station for North Koreans -- assuaging any official fears about a permanent foreign refugee population -- it may well be possible to convince Beijing to cooperate in the relocation mission (or at least to look the other way as it takes place). 
 Should it do so, many of the problems that Beijing seems to fear will vanish of themselves: if those refugees can be quickly processed by the United Nations refugee commission or similar offices, for example, Beijing need no longer worry about the risks imposed by a large, illegal population along its border with North Korea. 
 Additionally, with United States leadership, Seoul and the United Nations lose their cover for ignoring the North Korean refugee crisis. The governments and organizations that have responded to the calamity in Darfur could also be rallied to the front lines for North Korean refugees. And, under the international spotlight, Seoul would be forced to observe its constitutional pledge of citizenship for all Koreans despite the current South Korean government's obvious reluctance to displease Kim Jong-il on any issue. 
 Humanitarian rescue of North Korean refugees will also materially advance United States security interests. Mass defections from North Korea strike at the heart of the Kim regime, giving the lie to the myths upon which North Korean rule is based. This would further undercut the regime's authority and legitimacy, and force it for the first time to respond to the concerns of its subjects. A North Korean underground railroad is only a first step toward an entirely free Korean Peninsula, but a terribly important one. 
 Bringing North Korean refugees to freedom will redound only to America's strategic advantage and will give tangible proof to the seriousness of this country's freedom agenda. America -- and any American president -- could take pride in such a legacy.

HEADLINE: Spitzer's Stem Cell Plan May Not Steamroll Through the Assembly

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Gov. Eliot Spitzer's $2 billion stem cell initiative is getting a cool reception in the Assembly.
 Specifically, Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, below, raised a number of red flags about the proposal in an address this month to fellow Assembly Democrats and in a memo he sent to the Spitzer administration. 
''Much of this is garden-variety economic development pork that's hiding behind stem cells,'' Mr. Brodsky said. As chairman of the Assembly's Committee on Corporations, Authorities and Commissions, Mr. Brodsky would have oversight over the new public benefit corporation that would be created under the proposal.
 Mr. Brodsky's teenage daughter, Willie, recently had a liver transplant operation and he said that ''no one knows better than me the values of stem cell research as we try to develop things like organ replacement.'' But he added that ''we need to focus more on stem cell research and less on creating a general economic development pot.''
 He was referring to the proposal's fine print, which states that the money could be used for any number of purposes, from ''new agribusiness'' to ''security technologies'' and nanotechnology. Mr. Brodsky said the open-ended nature of the proposal violated a requirement in the New York Constitution that bonds be issued for only one purpose. He also questioned whether it was worth borrowing $1.5 billion for the initiative instead of paying in cash, estimating that interest alone would cost the state $1.8 billion over 30 years. 
 ''You burden future generations with $1.8 billion of interest only when it's necessary, and those are, I would argue, for major capital projects,'' he said. 
 Mr. Brodsky said he had had constructive discussions with Lt. Gov. David A. Paterson, who is leading the project, and looked ''forward to working with them constructively.''
 In a statement, the Spitzer administration said it would ''carefully review Chairman Brodsky's constructive review for ways the administration's newly created Stem Cell and Innovation Fund can be improved.''

CORRECTION-DATE: February 23, 2007

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Empire Zone column on Monday about the objections of Richard L. Brodsky, a New York State assemblyman, to Gov. Eliot Spitzer's stem cell initiative referred incorrectly to the operation that Mr. Brodsky's teenage daughter, Willie, recently underwent, which Mr. Brodsky cited as evidence that he understood the values of stem cell research. She had a kidney transplant, not a liver transplant.

HEADLINE: With New Pipeline Plan, Alaska's Governor Enters Precarious Territory

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: JUNEAU, Alaska, Feb. 15 

 BODY:
The new administration of Gov. Sarah Palin has been full of firsts. Ms. Palin, a Republican, is Alaska's first female governor and, at 42, its youngest. 
 She held her inauguration in frosty Fairbanks, a first that suited her conservative supporters but slighted the traditional host, this rainy, remote and less Republican state capital. She also appears to be the only governor in history whose spouse is a champion snowmobile racer and a former Arctic oil worker, and is widely referred to as First Dude.
Now, two months after taking office, Ms. Palin wants to become the first Alaska governor to deliver what many others have sought without success: construction of a $30 billion pipeline to transport natural gas from the state's North Slope to markets in the lower 48 states. 
 It is an enormous project that could strengthen Alaska's energy-based economy for decades to come, while also, according to some estimates, supplying 7 percent of the nation's natural gas annually.
 But pulling off this first is shaping up to be more complicated.
 Elected by a wide margin after promising to bring ''new energy'' and ''transparency'' to the pipeline project, Ms. Palin took office in December and immediately backed away from the negotiations that her predecessor, Frank H. Murkowski, had been pursuing with the three major energy companies that control much of the land where gas would be developed. 
 Ms. Palin has long criticized those negotiations as back-room dealings whose extensive incentives and tax breaks would have benefited the energy companies, BP, Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, far more than they would have Alaska. 
 ''Don't get me started,'' she said in an interview in her Capitol office on Thursday.
 So next month, Ms. Palin intends to introduce the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act, a bill that would open the bidding to new players, as well as the old ones. She says her plan would ensure new jobs and access to gas for state residents. She also says that whoever gets to control the pipeline must allow for its potential expansion so that other gas developers can use it at reasonable prices, thus encouraging more development. 
 The new plan, however, would delay a formal agreement until next year at the earliest, and it would be another decade, until 2018, before the pipeline was in operation. 
 Ms. Palin won votes last fall for vowing to take just such steps, but in taking them, she has stirred concern beyond Alaska at a time when the Bush administration says it wants to develop new sources of energy.
 In a report to Congress last month, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said ''the schedule for an Alaska gas pipeline has slipped considerably.'' The state's senior senator, Ted Stevens, a Republican famous for bringing big projects home, has openly expressed worry. 
 And on Tuesday, Rex W. Tillerson, the chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil, one of the companies that hopes to build the pipeline, said: ''I don't really know where we are. I don't think it looks like Alaska knows where it wants to go, either.''
 Ms. Palin dismissed that talk. But next week, when she attends a National Governors Association meeting in Washington, she plans to visit Alaska's Congressional delegation and meet with officials at Exxon Mobil and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, among others. Besides putting minds at ease, she said, she wants to broaden the appeal of the project with the goal of gaining leverage in negotiations.
 ''This project is so much bigger than Alaska and Alaska's interests,'' Ms. Palin said. ''This is for the nation. This is to supply domestically safe sources of fuel. We're going to be able to do that. We should be leading in a national energy plan.''
 The report by the energy commission suggested just such thinking, although it had a more urgent tone than in earlier assessments and sprinkled in some skepticism. 
 ''The main obstacle to progress on an Alaskan gas pipeline is the failure to resolve state issues necessary before a project sponsor will commit to go forward,'' the report said. ''The fresh competitive approach announced by the new governor must be successful if Alaska gas is to be part of the nation's energy supply solution in the coming years.''
 Steve Rinehart, a spokesman for BP Exploration Alaska, which controls the most land in the area expected to be developed first, said that with natural gas prices projected to stay relatively high and oil production on the North Slope declining, ''the time has come to bring that gas to market.''
 ''It makes sense economically,'' Mr. Rinehart said. ''It makes sense for the life of this oil field.'' 
 But in the past, aides to Ms. Palin said, the big energy companies refused to commit to expanding the pipeline or to allow outside companies to use it for reasonable fees. 
 Mr. Rinehart disagreed. ''We were ready to address those issues,'' he said, ''but the process stopped.''
 Critical to pushing a plan through is the state's 60-member, Republican-controlled Legislature. Mr. Murkowski, a former United States senator, clashed with state lawmakers over his pipeline plan through his final days in office. Ms. Palin, by contrast, has echoed their concerns about giving away too much in tax breaks to the energy companies.
 ''What the governor has is a lot of credibility with the public,'' said State Representative John Harris, the speaker of the House. ''She's been a breath of fresh air, in my opinion.''
 Lyda Green, president of the Senate, said Ms. Palin came to office without the intimate knowledge of the energy and financial industries that Mr. Murkowski had. But ''she's a very quick study,'' Ms. Green said. ''She has good people around her.''
 Ms. Palin has brought back some top staff members who left in protest over how Mr. Murkowski had been conducting the pipeline negotiations. Now she wants them to help her complete the deal that Mr. Murkowski never could.
 ''We are crafting this whole process with our arms open, even for Exxon,'' Ms. Palin said. ''Come on in and let us know what you have in terms of a proposal to commercialize Alaska's natural gas.''

HEADLINE: With Money in Their Pockets

BYLINE: By ROY FURCHGOTT

 BODY:
KDMA doesn't look like the kind of company that attracts venture investors. It's not in Silicon Valley, nor is it involved in biotechnology. It doesn't even have a fully working Web site.
 The company, which has its headquarters near Grand Rapids, Minn. (population 7,764), makes fishing tackle. It has two owners, three employees and annual revenue well under a million dollars.
But that didn't stop the North Star Fund in Grand Rapids from putting money into the company. In fact, KDMA was exactly what North Star was looking for -- a start-up it could nurture in its own backyard. 
 North Star, an angel investment group, has two bankers, a real estate broker and two grocery-store owners among its 14 members. They all live in Grand Rapids, and their fund is dedicated to financing new businesses in or near town. 
 ''That's a higher priority than actually making money on the deal,'' said Keith Anderson, a lawyer and a member of the group. 
 Angel investors, historically a private lot, usually work quietly by themselves or with a few other individuals, investing their own money in early-stage or start-up businesses. 
 When angel investors band together, they share their research, money and expertise, and they increase their clout. This allows them to spread their investment more efficiently to local businesses. 
 Individual angels tend to focus more on profits, not community growth. And since most angels are in their 50s and 60s and retired, they are not necessarily suited to overseeing long-term investment projects. 
 Banding together, angel groups ''create an entity that is longer lived than any single angel can be,'' said Ian Sobieski, a founder of the $50 million Band of Angels Fund in Menlo Park, Calif.
 So far, it may sound a little like ''It's a Wonderful Life,'' but as in the movie, the story takes an unexpected twist. Some of these groups -- North Star included -- cannot find enough worthwhile local businesses to put their money into.
 To stay afloat, they have had to invest in companies farther afield. ''As much as we want to help the small entrepreneur out, we don't want to lose our shirts, either,'' said Mr. Anderson of North Star.
 With no road map, these angel groups are striking out in many directions, looking for a formula that will work.
 Some try to preserve each angel's independence. One group, the Investors Circle of York in York, Pa., was formed to ''fund local companies, or companies that might move to our area, or that support a business in our area,'' said Michael March, a co-chairman of the Investors Circle. It holds regular dinners where entrepreneurs present ideas; each member independently decides whether to invest. 
 But groups of individuals are hard to corral. Working around members' schedules makes meeting difficult and limits the number of deals. As a result, like many angel groups, the York circle is considering a central fund that a committee would invest. It would mean a steadier flow of cash to community businesses, as well as benefiting the group, Mr. March said, because more investments ''level out risk.'' 
 Some angel groups find a greater economy of scale through a larger network. A Pennsylvania Department of Economic Development grant created the Pennsylvania Angels Network, which advises 18 angel groups, helping them to network and share deals, some too large for the groups to handle individually.
 Similarly, a regional angel network founded by a grant from the state of Minnesota became RAIN Source Capital, which advises 20 groups in five states, and has a $16 million central fund that it can invest alongside its angel groups.
 When the economic development agency in Orange County, N.Y., hired Robert Hannon, a self-described ''recovering banker,'' to draw in new business, he created an angel fund that invests only in companies that agree to move to the county, about 50 miles north of New York City. ''There was the perception that one of the things keeping companies from locating in Orange County was a lack of capital,'' he said.
 The fund, started in January 2005, now has $500,000 in county money to extend the investors' coffers. So far, it has put money into just one company, which makes a motorcycle lock.
 It's easy to see why communities like this brand of investing -- it could help the economy. But because angel investing is involved in early-stage companies, it is risky and takes longer to cash out than later-stage investing. But smaller investors have little competition for off-the-beaten-track companies. ''You can invent some pretty important things in a pole barn in Minnesota,'' said John Reid, the chairman and a founder of Abbey Moor Medical, which developed a urinary tract stent from just such a barn in Parkers Prairie, Minn., 150 miles northwest of Minneapolis.
 With initial venture financing from RAIN Source Angels, the company has 30 employees, government approval of its device and about $13 million to take its stent to market. ''We would never had have serious venture capitalists look at us,'' Mr. Reid said. ''The venture cap guys won't even come to Minneapolis -- it's a flyover.''
 Another attraction for angels is personal satisfaction. ''They get a type of psychic income,'' said Dr. Sohl. ''They don't want to be the ones doing payroll checks,'' he added.

HEADLINE: The Price of Flowers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Local Color,'' by Amy Stewart (Op-Ed, Feb. 14): 
 As someone who worked for an independent florist (until it went out of business), I understand the challenges imposed by supermarket sellers and online delivery services.
But let's not forget the dynamics of the industry: much like the diamond trade, cut flowers are certified or uncertified to inform retailers and consumers of the conditions in which they were grown, cut and shipped (often from countries with inexcusable enforcement of workers' rights). 
 This addresses the author's observation that the retail value of flowers has plummeted in the last century. Just like every other sweatshop good.
 The global economy creates hardships for everyone except consumers and the mega-rich. 
 Let's reserve our moral outrage for the plight of the exploited, not the exploiters.David StreimCambridge, Mass., Feb. 14, 2007To the Editor: 
 In 1968, my family and I were living in Moscow, where my husband worked for the United States Embassy. 
 After a gray winter, in a gray city, we went to Munich. As we walked through town, the opulence rather put me off. 
 But then I saw a flower shop and I stopped dead in my tracks. I literally couldn't get past the shop until I went in and -- yes -- smelled the flowers, and at that moment the quality of my life changed.Peggy BarryWashington, Feb. 14, 2007

HEADLINE: NASA Goes Deep

BYLINE: By Carolyn Porco. 
Carolyn Porco is a planetary scientist, the leader of the Imaging Science Team on the Cassini mission and director of the Cassini Imaging Central Laboratory for Operations.

DATELINE: Boulder, Colo. 

 BODY:
AFTER years of spending our nation's space budget building an orbiting space station of questionable utility, serviced by an operationally expensive space shuttle of unsafe design, NASA has set a new direction for the future of human spaceflight. Once again, we have our sights on the Moon and beyond. We are finally, bodily, going to make our way into space, this time to stay.
 It is an opinion long and widely held within the space-exploration community that the Nixon administration's termination of the program that built the Saturn V Moon rocket was a gargantuan mistake.
One of the biggest challenges in exploring space is propulsion -- that is, getting from point A to B efficiently, safely and quickly. And when the cargo is human, the challenges are even greater. One of our crowning technological achievements during the 1960s was the Apollo program and, in particular, the development of the Saturn V rocket. The Saturn V was the largest, most powerful vehicle the United States had ever built. It had a launching capacity more than five times greater, a developmental cost 25 percent lower and a build-and-operate cost less than half of that of today's space shuttle. 
 In those early days, the possibilities for human space travel were intoxicating. Back then, NASA plans called for an aggressive integrated human flight program that would expand on the developments of Apollo: the establishment of a 50-person lunar base, a 100-person Earth-orbiting space station and human landfall on Mars, all by the mid-1980s. Those plans also included a 50-person semi-permanent Martian base by the end of the 20th century. Instead, we went nowhere. 
 Why? Because, largely for political reasons, we renounced the Moon, abandoned Apollo and the Saturn V and retreated to low Earth orbit, where we've spent the last 25 years going around in circles. 
 The cost to the nation of this misstep was enormous. For starters, we lost an investment, adjusted for inflation to 2007 dollars, of $160 billion. That was the cost to get to, land on, walk on, drive on and otherwise explore the Moon. (Of that amount, $29 billion, in inflation-adjusted dollars, was the approximate cost of the Saturn V.) 
 What's more, the production facilities for the Saturn V and the other lunar exploration components, like the command and lunar modules, were all closed. At that point, we lost both the technological means for human deep space exploration and the collective knowledge of tens of thousands of engineers and scientists trained in human spaceflight. 
 Equally troubling is what we put in place of Apollo. The $38 billion developmental cost of the shuttle has gotten us nowhere in the solar system fast. And the International Space Station could have been built with only half a dozen Saturn V launchings instead of the more than two dozen shuttle trips that will be required to finish it. The bottom line: a colossal misuse of funds and a disheartening lack of progress and loss of time.
 The termination of the Saturn V program also had a stifling effect on the robotic exploration of other planets. In essence, we lost the ability to deliver larger, and in some cases faster, payloads elsewhere in the solar system. 
 Take, as an example, the 5,600-kilogram Cassini spacecraft, which was launched in 1997 and is now in orbit around Saturn. Its launching was timed so that after spending two years looping around the inner solar system to pick up speed, it could rendezvous with massive Jupiter for an additional boost that would send it to Saturn. All told, its flight time took seven years.
 Had the Saturn V, modified with an appropriate fourth upper stage, been used to launch Cassini directly to Jupiter first, its flight time to Saturn could have been cut by more than half. In space, as on Earth, time is money, and the money saved could have been spent elsewhere.
 Alternatively, for the same flight time, a vehicle of greater launching capacity can deliver a heavier payload. Take as an example the 480-kilogram New Horizons spacecraft, launched over a year ago to fly by Pluto in 2015 and eventually to explore the Kuiper Belt of icy debris that lies beyond it. Had it been launched on a modified Saturn V rocket, New Horizons could have carried a payload that was 15 times heavier and far more scientifically capable.
 In the end, instead of having a ubiquitous presence throughout the solar system, humans haven't set foot on the Moon in 35 years, and even our robotic explorations in that time have been throttled because we deliberately reduced our access to deep space. 
 Today, however, NASA is again looking up and out. Vigorous efforts are under way to complete the space station in order to fulfill international commitments that would be unwise to violate. When that is done, the plan is to retire the space shuttle in 2010 in favor of a new program to return to the Moon, with a party of humans, by 2020. A mainstay of this program is the Ares launching system, capable of sending 65 metric tons to the Moon -- exceeding the capacity of the Saturn V by more than 40 percent. 
 The official plans call not for flag-planting and grab-a-few-rocks-and-go but, by 2025, a solar-powered, human-tended, continuously inhabited research outpost rising from either the north or south pole of the Moon, where sunlight is persistent and water ice may be present. Sustainability, made possible in part by the use of lunar resources, is one goal. Another is on-site preparations for a push to the next outpost, Mars.
 And human spaceflight is not the only enterprise to benefit. Robotic reconnaissance, which by necessity must precede the dispatch of humans, has been ongoing for nearly 50 years. In that time, all the simple things have been done. Future missions to the planets and their moons will be more ambitious than anything yet tried. 
 As one example, imagine what our future robotic travels around Saturn might be like. The Saturn planetary system includes Titan, a cold Mercury-sized moon with a dense, organic-laden, hazy atmosphere and a strangely Earth-like, variegated surface sculptured by winds and hydrocarbon rains. It also includes Enceladus, a moon one-tenth the size of Titan, whose jets of water vapor and fine icy particles extend thousands of miles into space and may very likely erupt from organic-rich liquid water reservoirs just below its surface -- making this satellite arguably the most promising target we have available to us for astrobiological investigation. 
 A scientifically comprehensive mission to this part of the solar system, using Ares and a Cassini-like trajectory to Saturn, could easily include several exploratory vehicles. One would be a Saturn orbiter far more capable than Cassini. This vehicle, in turn, would be large enough to carry and deliver a fully equipped balloon-borne scientific payload to float through the atmosphere of Titan and study its surface up close, and an Enceladus lander with equipment that could determine the moon's physical properties and ascertain whether or not pre-biotic chemistry, and perhaps life, has arisen there. 
 In other words, robotic exploration, and the insights that will be gained from it into the character, development and evolution of planetary bodies and even life itself, will be taken to new heights and, in turn, pave the way for the eventual arrival of humans throughout the solar system. Anyone up for an extreme excursion to the Enceladus Interplanetary Geyser Park? 
 All told, the subtext is invigorating and unmistakable: Humanity's future need not be confined to mere survival on our home planet. Other worlds beckon, we know how to reach them and we will once more be outward bound.
 And we will not be alone. China, India and Russia, all eager to be or remain prominent players on the world stage, have independent plans to stride the lunar surface. And Australia, Canada, Japan and the member nations of the European Space Agency will be pooling their resources with us in the return to the Moon -- a circumstance that will bring the cost of the effort to any one nation within reason. 
 THIS won't be a space race so much as a global exodus undertaken by an international community. And peaceful cooperation among nations, as a tangible means to build strong lasting international partnerships and defuse tensions and conflicts in the future, will be a welcome result.
 In hindsight, maybe the pace of progress was predictable. Humans first explored Antarctica in the early 20th century. Decades passed before we had the technology that would allow us to establish a permanent presence. History will indicate the same for our interplanetary forays. Our initial ''small step for a man'' on the Moon took place in 1969. A half-century later, we will be there anew, to live and work.
 To reach that future will require two critical ingredients: adequate financing and a long-term cross-administration commitment that supports steady, uninterrupted progress. Our first reach for the Moon took us from President Kennedy's spoken words to the lunar surface in little over eight years under a budget profile that saw peaks in annual NASA budget of more than $30 billion in current dollars -- a shocking number by today's standards and a good measure of how important we then considered the endeavor. 
 While sustained budgets of that magnitude are out of the question today, what is not out of the question is our ability to pay to keep the goal front and center. We are now spending in Iraq, in a single month, $9 billion -- more than half the annual budget NASA needs to stay on course.
 Forty-five years ago today, John Glenn Jr. became the first American to venture into orbit around the Earth. Just 9 years old, I knew at that moment that the future would be big and wide, and that I might go places no one had ever been before. 
 There could be no better way today to encourage an equally optimistic belief in the future than to embark on an odyssey that presents tremendous challenges, demands discipline and rigor, requires decades-long focus, inspires international cooperation, promotes lasting peace, improves life for all and paints a stirring vision of an expanded human presence beyond the Earth. There could be no better way to say: the future is boundless, and it belongs to us.

HEADLINE: Job Corps Plans Makeover For a Changed Economy

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: LAUREL, Md. 

 BODY:
Over the last four decades, even as failed experiments and partisan disputes took the luster off the war on poverty, the Job Corps, the government's main effort to give poorly educated youths a second chance at a diploma and a trade, was widely seen as one of the few success stories. 
 But now, as the economy has turned against those with low skills and researchers have questioned the long-term impact of the Job Corps on the lives of its graduates, this remnant of the Great Society is facing an urgent need to reinvent itself.
''Once you could go into the Job Corps and get a G.E.D. and go out and make a living,'' said Esther R. Johnson, a career executive in the Labor Department with a doctorate in education who took over the corps last March. ''You can't do that anymore.'' 
 Dr. Johnson wants the Job Corps to aim higher, helping graduates into careers with a bigger paycheck. 
 To do that she plans to lengthen the average stay for many graduates beyond the current 11.4 months, improving their reading, math and vocational skills. She also wants trade courses to connect more closely with college programs and emerging industries, and she thinks the corps must double the number of graduates, now just 10 percent, who go on to higher education. All this can be done, Dr. Johnson said in an interview, within a budget flat-lined at $1.5 billion in recent years, mainly by increasing the rigor of courses while cutting other costs. 
 Bridgette Hunter, 18, illustrates the potential benefits of a program that, if it can fulfill its goals, is needed more than ever. She dropped out of school in Baltimore last March, in 12th grade but many credits short of a diploma. ''I was with the wrong people,'' Ms. Hunter explained. 
 She quickly realized that her ambitions and behavior were out of sync. By October she had entered the Woodland Job Corps Center here, brushing up on reading and math as she took courses in health care while sharing a dorm room and rising at 6:30 a.m. with a 10 p.m. curfew. 
 ''I want to be wealthy,'' Ms. Hunter said. ''My ambition is to become an R.N.,'' she added, admitting with a shrug that her notion of wealth was a relative one. ''And I knew that sitting around doing nothing wouldn't get me there.'' 
 At the center, where 300 students live and work in a sprawl of brick dormitories, classrooms and workshops, Ms. Hunter has already earned her G.E.D. and will soon be certified as a nursing assistant. In newly added services, she has the help of a volunteer mentor, a scientist from Washington who is helping her scout colleges, while outside tutors are helping her prepare for the SATs. Grant money is available for nursing, and she could qualify as a registered nurse after two years in a community college. 
 Since President Lyndon B. Johnson created the Job Corps as part of his ''unconditional war on poverty,'' two million Americans have passed through its residential centers, which number 122 nationwide, with three more planned. 
 Despite the corps's high cost to the government -- now $26,000 an entrant -- evidence suggests it has paid off, increasing earnings and reducing crime. 
 With prospects for the less-educated getting worse and millions of young people, especially black men, unemployed or stuck in dead-end minimum-wage jobs, salvaging ''disconnected youth'' has become a prime antipoverty target.
 In 2005, 4.4 million youths ages 16 to 24 were neither in school nor working, according to an analysis by Andrew Sum, director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University, who calls this an ominous portent. ''How much time you're out of school and out of work in the late teens and early 20s is a strong predictor of future joblessness, poverty and dependence in your late 20s,'' Dr. Sum said.
 Both the government and private groups are looking for answers. 
 ''What to do for very disadvantaged youth is the most perplexing social problem we face, in part because so few of the things we have tried have worked,'' said Gordon L. Berlin, president of M.D.R.C., a group in New York that evaluates antipoverty efforts. 
 Along with the Job Corps, the federal government supports a program run by the National Guard for about 10,000 16- to 18-year-old dropouts per year, combining five months of schooling in a military-style camp with another year of mentoring. The Labor Department also contributes $50 million a year to Youthbuild, which with an additional $130 million in private financing runs 226 nonresidential programs for 8,000 students a year. Participants renovate low-income housing as they study.
 With better training, high school diplomas or, better, degrees from community colleges, many graduates of such programs, it is hoped, will become chefs instead of hamburger flippers; plumbers, electricians or carpenters instead of pickup laborers; nurses instead of health aides. A newer course at the Laurel center trains students to install cable and other electronic systems. 
 A study published in 2001 that surveyed Job Corps graduates and a control group, conducted by Mathematica Policy Research for the Labor Department, found that the program led to significant increases in self-reported earnings over four years and to lower arrest rates. 
 But a second analysis, released by the Labor Department in 2006, was dismaying: only the older participants, those in their 20s when they entered the centers, showed any gains in earnings, and they were slight.
 Debate about the studies continues, but the findings helped drive the new effort to rejuvenate the corps. 
 Of roughly 60,000 low-income youths who enter the Job Corps each year, all voluntarily, three-fourths have not graduated from high school. 
 In Laurel, students live in college-style dorms. The days are divided between academic study and hands-on work: carpentry students practice building walls and roofs; electrical students wire a mock house. 
 Nationally, 30 percent of entrants leave within the first two months, either because they break the rules or they do not like the regimented life. Among the rest, 60 percent leave with a G.E.D., a regular high school diploma, certification in a trade or a combination of these. 
 Michael Whitfield of Washington said he had a change of heart after quitting school in the 11th grade. 
 ''I got to thinking, is this all I'm going to do for the rest of my life?'' Mr. Whitfield recalled as he prepared to leave the Laurel center after nine months, having earned his high school diploma and completed courses in electrical contracting and carpentry. 
 Now 19, he has been accepted by a two-year college where he will study criminal justice to become a police or parole officer. He credited the Job Corps with helping him straighten up and discover his goals. ''I really can't see people making it these days without a diploma,'' he said. ''I was lucky; I had a second chance.''

HEADLINE: When Big Ideas Lead to Big Wars and Big Problems

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
The Silence of the Rational CenterWhy American Foreign Policy Is FailingBy Stefan Halper and Jonathan Clarke 312 pages. Basic Books. $26.95.
 As more and more books, articles and government reports on the Iraq war appear, the role that certain idees fixes and ideological preconceptions played in the Bush administration's decision to go to war becomes increasingly clear. Not only was intelligence cherry-picked to support noisily argued but fallacious theories about weapons of mass destruction and Iraq-Al Qaeda ties, but the war itself seems to have been regarded by some members of the White House and the Pentagon as a kind of demonstration model of their ideas about pre-emptive war, unilateral action and the export of democracy. 
In the useful if messy new book, ''The Silence of the Rational Center,'' the international affairs scholars Stefan Halper and Jonathan Clarke argue that the Iraq war represents the third time in post-World War II American history that ''Big Ideas have seized the political discourse and driven policy experts to the sidelines,'' foreshortening debate, oversimplifying complex issues and replacing reasoned analysis with crude emotional appeals. The other two times this happened, they say, were during the early years of the cold war, when Joseph McCarthy and his Red-scare tactics were riding high, and during the Vietnam War, when the domino theory was invoked as a reason for keeping South Vietnam from falling into the hands of the Communists. 
 In some respects, this volume is a continuation of arguments set out in ''America Alone,'' the authors' estimable 2004 book, which examined the role neoconservatives played in shaping the administration's post-9/11 policy and its decision to invade Iraq. That book laid out a detailed, rigorously reasoned critique of the neoconservative ideological agenda from the point of view of more traditional conservatives: Mr. Halper served in the Nixon, Ford and Reagan administrations; Mr. Clarke, now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Council on Ethics and International Affairs, was at the time affiliated with the libertarian Cato Institute. ''The Silence of the Rational Center'' is an altogether looser, more improvisatory performance. 
 Astute assessments of the consequences of the either/or thinking and Manichaean language favored by the Bush administration jostle for space with fuzzy generalizations about problems of intelligence gathering; illuminating analogies between Vietnam and Iraq coexist with glib comparisons of Vice President Dick Cheney and former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. The last quarter of the book -- devoted to an assessment of potential conflicts with China over trade policy, resources and energy -- is often fascinating but has curiously little to do with the main narrative. 
 As the authors point out, America has always been drawn to the Big Idea, in part because the nation was not established, like many European countries, around a shared culture or history, but was founded on an idea: the idea of exceptionalism, which held that ''Americans were a chosen people delivered from corruption and evil to a New World'' and destined to serve as ''an example to the world.'' 
 Over the years, this animating idea would surface in a variety of guises. In the country's early years, Mr. Halper and Mr. Clarke write: ''Manifest Destiny was the bumper sticker sentiment that asserted the civilizing impulse of Anglo-European culture and the innate supremacy of its practices. The treatment of indigenous populations and the practical necessity for expansion was explained by the notion that America stood in a pivotal position in human history. Manifest Destiny turned an unstoppable popular migration into an affirmation of American identity.'' 
 Later, at the end of the 19th century, with the start of the Spanish-American War, the idea of what the authors call ''the Imperialism of Righteousness'' emerged: ''the notion that Americans were a chosen people destined to transform and reform other civilizations and peoples.'' It's a doctrine that would be echoed by the economist Walt Rostow's ''stages of growth'' theory, which would become a template for Washington's support of South Vietnam as a free-enterprise democracy in the making, and echoed as well by the Iraq war architects' talk of turning a post-Saddam-Hussein Iraq into a model democracy that would somehow remake the political dynamics of the entire Middle East.
 Times of crisis, Mr. Clarke and Mr. Halper point out, tend to make America more susceptible to the lure of the Big Idea and the reductive thinking that often accompanies it. At such times, the nuanced and expert advice of what they call the rational center -- career professionals, scholars, analysts and others working in government and at universities and think tanks -- is sidelined or ignored, while emotional sloganeering is amplified by 24/7 cable news and Internet chatter that prize raucous confrontations between fervent avatars of the right and the left. Reasoned analysis is shoved to the sidelines, and critics of the party or faction in power are often accused of being unpatriotic or disloyal. 
 As Mr. Halper and Mr. Clarke see it, the lack of a more vociferous debate over the wisdom of going to war against Iraq reflects the failure of individual scholars and larger institutions to bring their expertise to bear during the ''golden hour,'' that crucial time when their views might have made a difference. The authors remind us that think tanks with a distinct ideological outlook (like the American Enterprise Institute and the Washington Institute for Near East Policy) are less research institutions than ''well-funded lobbies with a support staff of scholars,'' and they point to the silence of more nonpartisan organizations in this case as well. 
 Of the Carnegie Endowment's record in 2002, they write that Iraq ''got onto the agenda only once -- in November 2002 when the die was already cast.'' They also contend that the prestigious Council on Foreign Relations ''stood mute on the matter of opposition.''
 ''Search the articles of Foreign Affairs from the fall of 2001 to the spring of 2003, the period in which the Iraq debate was conducted,'' they write, ''and you will look in vain for a single article that raises moderate skepticism, let alone fundamental questions, about the looming decisions.'' 
 From time to time the authors themselves are guilty of oversimplifying or distorting the matters under discussion. For instance, they write that ''a large majority of Americans -- elite and ordinary, conservatives and liberals -- embraced the Big Idea that they were conferring freedom on the Iraqi people, that this was a noble and quintessentially American duty, and that by bearing the gift of liberty they would be welcomed with open arms,'' when, in fact, the war was sold to the American public not as a democracy-building project, but on the basis (false, it turned out) that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction and posed a grave and gathering threat to the United States. 
 The authors' prescription for dealing with the country's intelligence problems is highly reductive -- ''Don't pivot policy or the nation's security around intelligence'' -- and their discussion of asymmetrical warfare is full of recycled platitudes. 
 Such lapses distract attention from the many persuasive and valuable observations Mr. Halper and Mr. Clarke make in this book, showing their own occasional susceptibility to Big Ideas in their efforts to identify the danger of Big Ideas.

HEADLINE: Contract Clause Isn't Worth the Distraction

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
The last thing Alex Rodriguez needs right now is the opt-out clause in his contract. If he were smart, he would ask the Yankees to amend the contract and delete the clause from it. 
 Yes, he could simply not exercise the clause at the end of the season -- the seventh in a 10-year deal -- but the clause would still be there, looming.
No, A-Rod has to get rid of the clause; otherwise it will plague him for the entire season, and he doesn't need that distraction. He has enough potential problems that he can't do anything about. 
 His agent, Scott Boras, of course, would not allow him to opt out of the opt-out. That's Boras's baby. He used it this winter to get J. D. Drew out of the three years he had remaining on his contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers and to gain a contract with Boston for $70 million, more than twice the $33 million the Dodgers would have owed him.
 Baseball officials and executives of other clubs have suspected that the Red Sox tampered with Drew, letting Boras know that if Drew walked away from the Dodgers, more money was awaiting him. 
 When I reported these suspicions earlier this winter, Boras was irate, feeling that the accusation belittled his ability to analyze the free-agent market and figure out that Drew would be better off financially by becoming a free agent. 
 The Dodgers ultimately chose not to file a tampering charge with the commissioner's office. 
 One general manager joked that the Dodgers didn't want to file a complaint because they were afraid they'd get Drew back. But a Major League Baseball official who talked about the possible tampering last week was not joking, saying the Dodgers were furious, spoke to the commissioner's office and discussed filing a complaint. The official didn't want his name used because no complaint was filed. 
 All right, that was Drew, this is Rodriguez. Would some club get word to Boras that if Rodriguez left the Yankees at the end of the season, it would guarantee more than $81 million for the next three years? 
 Rodriguez's salary for the last three years of his $252 million contract is $27 million a year. It's highly unlikely that anyone would pay Rodriguez a higher salary than that no matter how lush the market is and how scarce productive power hitters are. 
 Maybe Tom Hicks, the Texas Rangers owner who foolishly gave A-Rod his record contract six years ago, would like another shot at him. On second thought, not even Hicks could be that economically irresponsible.
 Unfortunately for Rodriguez, he's in a difficult position. He doesn't want to leave the Yankees, but he can't state flatly that he's not going anywhere eight months from now. That's not the way Boras plays the game. 
 When Boras asked Hicks for the opt-out clause, it was intended for use as a bargaining tool to get an extension to Rodriguez's lavish 10-year deal. Before Boras had Drew bid adieu to the Dodgers, he offered them an opportunity to keep Drew with an extension. The Dodgers laughed, which if not for the circumstances might have been an impolite way of saying no.
 The Yankees know Boras's game, and they may actually be amenable to an extension, though not at $27 million a year. The closest any player has come to that figure since Rodriguez signed his contract is $20 million a year. 
 At a session with reporters at the Yankees' spring training camp in Tampa, Fla., yesterday, Rodriguez said repeatedly, ''I want to be a Yankee my whole career.'' But he declined to say that he wouldn't use the opt-out clause. 
 ''The option is there for a reason,'' he said, without saying what the reason was. ''I'm not going to rewrite the contract today.''
 But it would be in his best interests to rewrite it and take out the opt-out clause. As long as it's there, Rodriguez will be asked about it continuously. He can say today he won't decide about the clause until after the season, and, guaranteed, he will be asked about it again tomorrow. He doesn't need that, and neither do the Yankees.
 Rodriguez has enough distractions without those daily questions. He said yesterday that he liked his contract and liked being the highest-paid player, but he has paid a huge price for his special status.
 A player who earns his kind of salary is not supposed to make outs and is not supposed to make errors, as far as fans are concerned. Each time he does make an out or an error, he is a target of the fans' displeasure. Last year became brutal for him. He struck out more often and committed errors more often than in any previous season, eliciting more boos than his 35 home runs and 121 runs batted in produced in cheers.
 His dismal postseason performance was injury enough, then his manager added insult by dropping him to eighth in the batting order in the final playoff game.
 Rodriguez will have a difficult enough time getting off to a strong start this year to keep the target on his back from growing larger. He doesn't have to hear Yankee Stadium fans chant, ''Opt out, opt out, opt out.''

HEADLINE: North Africa Feared as Staging Ground for Terror

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH

DATELINE: TUNIS 

 BODY:
The plan, hatched for months in the arid mountains of North Africa, was to attack the American and British Embassies here. It ended in a series of gun battles in January that killed a dozen militants and left two Tunisian security officers dead. 
 But the most disturbing aspect of the violence in this normally placid, tourist-friendly nation is that it came from across the border in Algeria, where an Islamic terrorist organization has vowed to unite radical Islamic groups across North Africa.
Counterterrorism officials on three continents say the trouble in Tunisia is the latest evidence that a brutal Algerian group with a long history of violence is acting on its promise: to organize extremists across North Africa and join the remnants of Al Qaeda into a new international force for jihad.
 [Last week, the group claimed responsibility for seven nearly simultaneous bombings that destroyed police stations in towns east of Algiers, the Algerian capital, killing six people.] 
 This article was prepared from interviews with American government and military officials, French counterterrorism officials, Italian counterterrorism prosecutors, Algerian terrorism experts, Tunisian government officials and a Tunisian attorney working with Islamists charged with terrorist activities. 
 They say North Africa, with its vast, thinly governed stretches of mountain and desert, could become an Afghanistan-like terrorist hinterland within easy striking distance of Europe. That is all the more alarming because of the deep roots that North African communities have in Europe and the ease of travel between the regions. For the United States, the threat is also real because of visa-free travel to American cities for most European passport holders.
 The violent Algerian group the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat, known by its French initials G.S.P.C., has for several years been under American watch. 
 ''The G.S.P.C. has become a regional terrorist organization, recruiting and operating in all of your countries -- and beyond,'' Henry A. Crumpton, then the United States ambassador at large for counterterrorism, said at a counterterrorism conference in Algiers last year. ''It is forging links with terrorist groups in Morocco, Nigeria, Mauritania, Tunisia and elsewhere.''
 Officials say the group is funneling North African fighters to Iraq, but is also turning militants back toward their home countries.
 The ambitions of the group are particularly troubling to counterterrorism officials on the watch for the re-emergence of networks that were largely interrupted in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. While most estimates put the current membership of the group in the hundreds, it has survived more than a decade of Algerian government attempts to eradicate it. It is now the best-organized and -financed terrorist group in the region.
 Last year, on the fifth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, Al Qaeda chose the G.S.P.C. as its representative in North Africa. In January, the group reciprocated by switching its name to Al Qaeda of the Islamic Maghreb, claiming that the Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, had ordered the change.
 ''Al Qaeda's aim is for the G.S.P.C. to become a regional force, not solely an Algerian one,'' said the French counterterrorism magistrate, Jean-Louis Bruguiere, in Paris. He calls the Algerian group the biggest terrorist threat facing France today. 
 ''We know from cases that we're working on that the G.S.P.C.'s mission is now to recruit people in Morocco and Tunisia, train them and send them back to their countries of origin or Europe to mount attacks,'' he said. 
 The G.S.P.C. was created in 1998 as an offshoot of the Armed Islamic Group, which along with other Islamist guerrilla forces fought a brutal decade-long civil war after the Algerian military canceled elections in early 1992 because an Islamist party was poised to win.
 In 2003, a G.S.P.C. leader in southern Algeria kidnapped 32 European tourists, some of whom were released for a ransom of 5 million euros (about $6.5 million at current exchange rates), paid by Germany.
 Officials say the leader, Amari Saifi, bought weapons and recruited fighters before the United States military helped corner and catch him in 2004. He is now serving a life sentence in Algeria.Change of Leadership
 Since then, an even more radical leader, Abdelmalek Droukdel, has taken over the group. The Algerian military says he cut his teeth in the 1990s as a member of the Armed Islamic Group's feared Ahoual or ''horror'' company, blamed for some of the most gruesome massacres of Algeria's civil war.
 He announced his arrival with a truck bomb at the country's most important electrical production facility in June 2004, and focused on associating the group with Al Qaeda.
 Links to the G.S.P.C. soon began appearing in terrorism cases elsewhere in North Africa and in Europe.
 In 2005, Moroccan authorities arrested a man named Anour Majrar, and told Italy and France that he and two other militants had visited G.S.P.C. leaders in Algeria earlier that year. 
 His interrogation led to arrests in Algeria, Italy and France, where Mr. Majrar's associates were quickly linked to an attempted robbery of 5 million euros at an armored car depot in Beauvais, north of Paris. A hole had been blown in a wall at the depot with military-grade C4 plastic explosives, but it was not big enough for the men to get through.
 A later investigation turned up Kalashnikov assault rifles, French Famas military assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, TNT and two more pounds of C4. French counterterrorism officials say the group was planning attacks on the Paris Metro, the city's Orly Airport, and the headquarters of the Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire, France's domestic intelligence agency.
 Italian prosecutors say a related cell in Milan was planning attacks on the city's police headquarters and on the Basilica of San Petronio in Bologna, whose 15th-century fresco depicts the Prophet Muhammad in hell.
 The G.S.P.C. or its members in Algeria appear to have become a touchstone for groups suspected of being terror cells across the region, in much the way that Qaeda representatives in London were a decade ago. 
 Wiretaps, interrogation of terrorism suspects and recovered documents suggest that the network has associates in France, Italy, Turkey and even Greece, which is favored as an entry point to Europe because of its relatively lax immigration controls, counterterrorism officials say.
 There had been hints that the North African groups were planning more formal cooperation as far back as 2005, when Moroccan intelligence authorities found messages sent by Islamic militants to Osama bin Laden, according to European counterintelligence officials.Evidence of an Alliance
 Indications that a cross-border alliance was under way came in June 2005, when the G.S.P.C. attacked a military outpost in Mauritania, killing 15 soldiers. The attackers fled into Mali, according to the United States military.
 Moroccan police officers raiding suspected Islamic militant cells last summer also found documents discussing a union between the G.S.P.C. and the Islamic Combatant Group in Morocco, the Islamic Fighting Group in Libya and several smaller Tunisian groups, intelligence officials say.
 In September, Al Qaeda's second in command, Ayman al-Zawahri, released a videotape in which he said that his global terrorist network had joined forces with the G.S.P.C. 
 The video was followed by an unsettling increase in terrorist attacks across the region, including one against Halliburton employees in Algeria in December that left one Algerian dead and nine people wounded.
 But the strongest evidence yet of the G.S.P.C.'s North African cross-border cooperation came in January when Tunisia announced that it had killed 12 Islamic extremists and captured 15 of them. Officials said that six of the extremists had crossed into the country from Algeria.
 Their 36-year-old leader, Lassad Sassi, was a former Tunisian policeman who ran a terrorist cell in Milan until May 2001 before fleeing to Algeria, according to an Italian prosecutor, Armando Spataro.
 Mr. Sassi, now dead, is still listed as a defendant in a current terrorism trial in Milan, which began before he died. He was charged in absentia with providing military clothing and money to the G.S.P.C. while financing and planning suicide bomb attacks in Italy.
 Tunisian officials say that Mr. Sassi and five other men -- four Tunisians and one Mauritanian -- crossed the rugged border from Algeria into Tunisia months ago.
 They set up a base in the mountains of Djebel Terif, where Mr. Sassi trained 20 other Tunisian men in the use of automatic weapons and explosives.A Trail of Violence
 The decision to move against the group began when the police in the Tunis suburb of Hammam Lif detained a young woman in December who led them to a house where a gun battle left two suspected terrorists dead, two officers wounded and two other men in custody, a police officer involved said. His account of the events could not be independently verified.
 Another arrest led the police into the hills toward the training camp.
 Three of the militants and a Tunisian Army captain were killed during a chase through the mountains. Tunisian security forces mounted a search in which 13 more men were arrested and Mr. Sassi was killed.
 The remnants of the group fled and members were later tracked down and killed in another gun battle.
 Tunisian officials have sought to play down the G.S.P.C. link, and have said the recently dismantled group's target was the West.
 In fact, according to Samir Ben Amor, a Tunisian attorney who defends many young Tunisian Islamists, more than 600 young Tunisian Islamists have been arrested in the past two years -- more than 100 in the past two months -- trying to make their way to Iraq to fight the United States.
 ''It's the same thing that we saw in Bosnia, Kosovo and above all Afghanistan,'' said Mr. Bruguiere, the French magistrate. ''Al Qaeda's objective is to create an operational link between the groups in Iraq and the G.S.P.C.''
 Tunisia is among the most vulnerable of the North African countries, because its rigid repression of Islam has created a well of resentment among religious youth, and its popularity as a tourist destination for Europeans makes it a target.
 Tunisian security forces found Google Earth satellite images of the American and British Embassies as well as the names of diplomats who worked in both buildings. But according to the police officer involved in the case and journalists in Tunisia, the targets also included hotels and nightclubs.
 An attack on those sites would have dealt a heavy blow to Tunisia's tourist industry, one of the country's most important sources of foreign exchange. An April 2002 bombing of a synagogue on the Tunisian tourist island of Djerba, for which the G.S.P.C. claimed responsibility, helped sink the country's economic growth that year to its slowest rate in a decade.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about evidence that an Algerian group is trying to organize extremists across North Africa incorrectly described a stance by the Tunisian government that has caused resentment among religious youth. The government has carried out a rigid suppression of Islamism, or the spread of fundamentalist Islamic values across the society; it has not suppressed Islam itself.

HEADLINE: Mr. Spitzer's Chance on Warming

 BODY:
Given the concerns of the new Democratic Congress, as well as persuasive new scientific evidence of the dangers of climate change, Washington may finally be ready to address the problem of global warming. The chances of that would be better still if New York's new governor, Eliot Spitzer, would commit himself and the state to a cause that needs all the friends it can get. 
 Mr. Spitzer should quickly commit himself to establishing ambitious goals for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide from cars, power plants and other industrial sources in New York State, and to writing regulations to achieve those goals. That will mean butting heads with powerful constituencies like the utilities, but Mr. Spitzer has always enjoyed a good fight. And with California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, already committed, Mr. Spitzer's intervention could tip the national debate and compel Washington to move more quickly than it might have to endorse meaningful federal legislation.
 California has pointed the way. Last fall it became the first state to mandate reductions of greenhouse gas emissions from every sector of the economy. The plan calls for reducing such emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, with a longer-range goal of an 80 percent reduction by 2050. A state law already requires automobile companies to begin producing more fuel-efficient cars. And in January, Mr. Schwarzenegger ordered refineries and other fuel producers to reduce emissions by 10 percent, largely through the development of alternative fuels. California has also warned that it will stop buying electricity from power producers outside the state that produce heavy carbon dioxide emissions. 
 This would be a hard act to follow for any governor, but to some extent Mr. Spitzer's path has already been smoothed by his predecessor, George Pataki. Mr. Pataki joined with California in demanding more fuel-efficient cars and increased funds for energy-efficiency programs, and he directed that by 2013 one-quarter of New York's power must be produced by renewable fuels. And -- perhaps most important -- Mr. Pataki enrolled New York in an effort to reduce regional greenhouse gas emissions involving seven Northeastern states. 
 Mr. Spitzer, who built a formidable environmental record of his own as attorney general, has endorsed all of these programs. But he will have to go further if he intends to match Mr. Schwarzenegger. Among other things, he must help get the regional greenhouse initiative up and running, and make sure that any new power plants built to meet the state's energy needs use the most modern technologies and add as little as possible to the atmosphere's already heavy carbon burden. 
 This is a tall order even for an aggressive new governor. But the good news is that most of what Mr. Spitzer must do can be accomplished by executive order, thus skirting an unadventurous Legislature that tends to prefer business as usual.

HEADLINE: Pentagon Agrees to Help Fill State Department's Iraq Reconstruction Jobs on Temporary Basis

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
The Pentagon and State Department have worked out a deal to send a small number of military personnel and Defense Department civilians to Iraq for several months until Foreign Service officers and State Department contract workers with specialized skills can fill those jobs, senior officials said Monday.
 The internal administration discussions over filling the posts had exposed tensions between the military and civilian agencies over how to share responsibilities in carrying out President Bush's new strategy for stabilizing and rebuilding Iraq -- in particular, how to fill hazardous positions in new provincial reconstruction teams. 
The State Department had asked the Pentagon to come up with military personnel or civilians to fill about one-third of the 350 new State Department jobs in Iraq. While the numbers involved are relatively small, the debate raised larger issues of whether the government was properly organized to carry out a long-term occupation of a country like Iraq.
 The State Department's written request for military personnel to fill some of the positions temporarily, received in late January, was met with frustration by a number of senior Pentagon officials and military officers. 
 But last week, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates agreed to the State Department request. About 120 military personnel or Pentagon civilians will fill the jobs for up to four months, according to three senior officials who were briefed on the discussions.
 The officials said the stopgap measure would give the State Department time to identify Foreign Service officers to serve in political and economic development jobs in Iraq and to use new Congressional financing to hire people with technical skills that are not routinely part of diplomatic missions overseas.
 The officials said the jobs included industrial development specialists, public health advisers, engineers, veterinarians, agricultural experts and lawyers who specialize in creating or enhancing judicial institutions.
 While those skills are not a standard part of the diplomatic corps, they are found among active duty military and reserve personnel. It is those people who will be asked to step in temporarily.
 ''We are moving forward to try and fill many if not all of those positions, and can certainly manage it for 60, 90 or 120 days,'' a senior Defense Department official said. 
 Another senior Pentagon official said, ''Rather than waiting for the funding and contracting process, we want to push the envelope to get the provincial reconstruction teams running as rapidly as we can.''
 Mr. Gates and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice have not publicly discussed the specifics of the agreement. But they met at the State Department last week, and Ms. Rice spoke in positive terms of cooperation between the departments.
 ''This is one of several meetings that the secretary and I have been holding and will continue to hold on major issues that Defense and State are confronting together in the global war on terror,'' Ms. Rice said at the time. ''It gives us a chance to get the people who are really responsible for managing these issues on a day-to-day basis together with us to solve the problems that we face and to take advantage of the opportunity.''
 The president's new strategy calls for the State Department to step up its efforts in Iraq, by doubling to 20 the number of provincial reconstruction teams. That increase would be in tandem with the deployment of 21,500 more troops to Baghdad and Anbar Province to the west.
 ''We need to put more energy into government at lower levels, at the provincial level and, in some cases, at the municipal level,'' a senior Defense Department official said. 
 Another official said the additional provincial reconstruction teams, to be managed by State Department personnel, would not focus on ''brick and mortar'' construction, but on ''trying to reconstruct governmental capacity -- the ability for the Iraqi government at all levels to effectively deliver services.''
 The State Department-run reconstruction teams will rely on military personnel for security and to escort convoys, Pentagon and State Department officials said. Striking a balance between assigning troops to day-to-day combat missions versus providing security for nonmilitary efforts has caused some tensions in the past.
 At the core of the debate is a clash of cultures, civilian and military, and assessments of the mission. Many in the military have said that while administration officials routinely speak of the United States as ''a nation at war,'' by far the bulk of the mission is being carried by those in uniform, while the rest of the government is not on a similar war footing.
 But across the civilian agencies, which have only a fraction of the Pentagon's personnel and budget, government workers say the question is whether a few hundred unarmed civilians spread across Iraq can make a significant difference in promoting democracy and reconstruction in the middle of a war zone, when more than 130,000 troops are not succeeding in that task.

HEADLINE: JetBlue to Begin Paying Penalties to Its Stranded Passengers

BYLINE: By JEFF BAILEY; Ann Farmer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
JetBlue Airways said yesterday that it would immediately begin paying penalties, ranging from $25 toward a future flight to a round-trip ticket, to passengers kept waiting by the airline's own misstakes.
 The program, developed over the weekend by JetBlue's founder and chief executive, David G. Neeleman, is intended to atone for a breakdown last week in the airline's operations that stranded hundreds of passengers for six hours or more on a tarmac at John F. Kennedy International Airport and delayed thousands of others.
On Sunday, Mr. Neeleman said he was ''humiliated and mortified'' by the problems. Will the measures be enough to keep JetBlue, until last week an industry leader in customer satisfaction surveys by J. D. Power & Associates, from losing a significant number of customers? Industry officials said more crucial than any payback program will be the airline's ability to avoid a repetition of the fiasco.
 And Mr. Neeleman sees the penalties mostly as additional incentive to perform better. He has promised to beef up management, train many more staff members to perform crucial functions, and buy equipment needed to avoid stranding passengers or needlessly delaying them. 
 ''This is still a work in progress,'' Mr. Neeleman said of the program, which he plans to formally announce today. 
 But certain elements have been agreed to. The compensation applies to delays and other problems defined as within JetBlue's control. That excludes weather and air traffic control problems. It includes crew shortages, maintenance problems and also, importantly, the airline's failing to recover from weather and air traffic problems by the second day, assuming that the airport is open to flights.
 The future-flight vouchers would increase in value according to the length of delay. In the case of departures that are delayed one to two hours, for example, passengers would get $25 off a future flight.For a delay of two to four hours, the passenger would receive $50 off a future flight. With delays of more than six hours, passengers would be entitled toa free round-trip flight equal in value to the one bought for the delayed flight.
 The payments are retroactive to last Thursday and the stranded passengers from the day before, an icy Wednesday, would also qualify for the flight credits. Similar flight vouchers would be given for delays in getting passengers off arriving flights. Arriving passengers on a flight stranded on an airport tarmac more than 30 minutes would get $25 off a future flight. Again, the discounts would increase as the delays lengthened, up to a round-trip ticket for a delay of more than three hours.
 For departing flights that are stranded on the tarmac away from a terminal, passengers would be given $100 off a future ticket for a delay of more than three hours. If the delay is more than five hours, passengers would get round-trip tickets, and, unless takeoff is imminent, the plane will return to the terminal to let passengers off.
 The penalties for stranding passengers on departure go into effect later because of the long lines that develop for takeoff at some airports, Mr. Neeleman said.
 ''There's other things we're working on with luggage," he said in an interview, taking a break from a meeting in which he was hammering out the plan with executives and lawyers.
 "It's retroactive and it's effective," Mr. Neeleman said.
 "You can imagine if we cancel a second day of flights how much it would cost," he said, though he did not quantify that cost. JetBlue canceled more than 1,000 flights during the last week, the bulk after Wednesday, when the ice storm hit the East Coast.
 He had spent part of the day apologizing to JetBlue employees. ''Our crew members didn't fail us, we failed them and it caused a tremendous hardship on them,'' he said. He aims to win back the confidence of customers and workers.
 By today, he said, JetBlue's computers will be tracking crew on every canceled flight so that they can be easily redirected to another flight. The airline's inability to locate and assign new flights to a huge number of pilots and flight attendants last week led to its days of problems.
 At the height of the breakdown on Wednesday, nine JetBlue planes each sat on the tarmac at JFK for six hours or more. Similar strandings occurred to an American Airlines plane in Austin, Tex., last December and to a Northwest Airlines plane in Detroit in January 1999.
 But last week JetBlue was not alone in long delays at JFK. According to data compiled by FlightStats, a Portland, Ore., travel information company, for Tuesday through Thursday, departing American flights were delayed an average of 202 minutes at JFK, JetBlue departures an average of 230 minutes and Delta Air Lines departures an average of 205 minutes.
 The longest wait on those three days before a flight that eventually took off was 572 minutes at American, 694 at JetBlue and 577 at Delta, according to FlightStats. Most delayed planes were not stuck out on the tarmac, however, and in many cases passengers could get off the plane if they chose. 
 The problems is likely to cost JetBlue some customers.
 Cheryl Horkovich and her husband and three children, from Westport, Conn., endured a nearly daylong wait for a JetBlue flight from JFK to Orlando, Fla., over the weekend, barely made it with her 2-year-old daughter Jessica to a Disney World breakfast with fictional princesses, and has now sworn off JetBlue.
 The family, booked on an 8:20 a.m. flight to Orlando Friday, was rebooked onto a charter plane hired by JetBlue -- it lacked crew to operate all its own flights -- that didn't take off until after 2 a.m. Saturday, Ms. Horkovich said. ''We had other reservations with JetBlue to fly to Florida in March and we canceled them,'' she said.
 JetBlue's declining on-time performance over the last two years had already scared off Peter McCardle, a technical writer who lives in the Bronx. He commutes to see a daughter every other weekend in Rochester, and found in recent months that JetBlue flights were often late. ''The lost me as a customer,'' he said. ''I don't care about TVs and leather seats. I care about getting there on schedule.''
 He switched to either driving or taking a US Airways flight on a turbo-prop plane. ''It's nerve-wracking, but it was on time,'' he said.
 Joel Marx, who owns a San Diego-area sales and marketing company, said he did not mind so much that a JetBlue flight Saturday to JFK was delayed by about four hours. He and his wife were visiting New York to celebrate his 50th birthday. 
 But when their bags did not make the flight, and searching for the luggage chewed up a good part of his birthday weekend, he had had enough, he said, furious that he could not get through on JetBlue's phone lines. He would refuse a voucher for a free flight,'' he said. ''They're arrogant. They hung up on me.''
 Others, however, either saw something to like even in a temporarily dysfunctional airline -- or had the good fortune to travel at the end of the fiasco.
 Robert Bertelloti, who runs a Stamford, Conn., investment company, said he had traveled frequently and widely for 25 years, and that flying home to JFK from Nassau, Bahamas, on JetBlue Thursday with his wife and 3-year-old son was the worst experience he has ever had.
 They waited 10 hours in the Nassau airport, a bare-bones facility, received false assurances from JetBlue that a plane was on the way to get them, and then finally arrived to ''a scene of utter chaos and despair'' at JetBlue's baggage claim area, he said.
 But, Mr. Bertelloti said, he found something to like about JetBlue during the experience. ''Every one of their employees was ashamed, embarrassed. I'll give them credit. The pilot who picked us up was humiliated.'' He compares that to older airlines, with more jaded workers. ''American Airlines -- their employees are just indifferent,'' he said.
 Mr. Bertelloti said he would fly JetBlue ''in due time, yes. Immediately? No.''
 Robert Atkins, 54, a writer who lives near Palm Springs, Calif., values JetBlue for its nonstop flights from nearby Ontario to JFK. ''They bring me direct out of a small town,'' he said. So, he was in a forgiving mood yesterday at JFK, having had to spend $100 for an American Airlines flight from Washington to JFK after that leg of his JetBlue travel was canceled. He ended up with an eight-hour layover at JFK.

HEADLINE: Spitzer Backs Indian Casino In the Catskills

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Gov. Eliot Spitzer has approved plans for a $600 million Las Vegas-style casino in the Catskill Mountains for the St. Regis Mohawk tribe and agreed to lead the effort to gain federal approval. His decision is the biggest leap yet in a 30-year struggle to bring gambling to the faded resort area.
 The governor signed a letter on Sunday concurring with an initial federal determination made in 2000 that the proposed casino at the Monticello Raceway would benefit the Mohawks and the residents of Sullivan County. He and the three governing chiefs of the Mohawks also signed a gambling compact that would provide the New York State government with up to 25 percent of the annual revenues from 3,500 slot machines at the casino, an amount estimated at more than $100 million a year.
Proponents contend that the casino would revive the economy of the old borscht belt, attracting six million visitors a year and generating 3,000 jobs and tens of millions of dollars in revenue. In a series of concessions by the tribe, the Mohawks have agreed to provide $20 million a year to the county and to Monticello to offset the impact of the casino and to collect and remit taxes from sales of liquor, cigarettes and other retail items at the casino. 
 But the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sullivan County Farm Bureau and several other groups filed a suit in federal court in Manhattan last week challenging the casino on environmental grounds. And the project still needs final approval by Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne, the former governor of Idaho, who opposes Indian casinos on nonreservation land. The Mohawk casino would be built more than 400 miles from the tribe's Akwesasne reservation, which straddles the Canadian border near Messena, N.Y.
 Still, the Mohawks were optimistic about the project yesterday, and Governor Spitzer said he would lobby Mr. Kempthorne in person when he is in Washington next week for the national governors meeting. 
 Mr. Spitzer said he would urge the Interior Department to move quickly to take the land into trust on behalf of the Mohawks under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, as it has for three other tribes since then.
 ''I will do everything I can to encourage expeditious review and approval,'' Mr. Spitzer said yesterday. ''The objective here is economic development. One casino, at a minimum, is good for the economy, good for the region.''
 The casino, first proposed in 1994, would be built on a 29-acre parcel next to the harness racing track, which already has 1,500 electronic gambling machines, including video poker. Governor Spitzer's predecessor, George E. Pataki, long supported Indian casinos for the Catskills, but had not completed negotiations for the gambling compact when he left office.
 Chief Lorraine M. White, one of three governing chiefs for the Mohawks, said she was elated by Mr. Spitzer's decision. ''It's a strong indication of the governor's commitment toward not only developing a relationship with the tribe, but in terms of rebuilding the upstate economy,'' she said.
 Anthony P. Cellini, supervisor of the Town of Thompson, which includes Monticello, was in New York City yesterday for the State Association of Towns annual meeting when he heard the news. ''That's great,'' Mr. Cellini said. ''This is the furthest anyone's ever gotten. I think we'll see an explosion of growth.''
 The owners of the longtime harness track, Empire Resorts, plan to put the land into federal trust for the tribe. Empire Resorts, in turn, would build and manage the casino for the Mohawks for up to seven years, with 70 percent of the net revenues going to the tribe. ''While casino gaming and entertainment has expanded and prospered in Atlantic City, Connecticut and now Pennsylvania, the Catskills was left behind,'' said Charles Degliomini, a spokesman for Empire Resorts. ''Now, thanks to Governor Spitzer, New York State finally gets a chance to put a shovel into the ground.''
 Hotel owners and state officials have looked to gambling as the salvation of the Catskills, ever since the area's tourist economy and 500 hotels and bungalow colonies began a slow, inexorable decline in the late 1960s. Governor Pataki touched off a land rush in and around Monticello in 1999 when he said he favored Indian casinos in former resort areas. Suddenly, well-connected developers sought out tribal partners and bought large swaths of land and shuttered hotels like the Concord. But little headway was made.
 Progress at the track is a personal triumph for Robert Berman, a Sullivan County resident who first conceived of building an Indian casino at the raceway in 1994. He lost his partners, the Mohawks, in 2000 after they were lured away by a major gambling company. Six years later, Mr. Berman, who is a shareholder in Empire Resorts but no longer a company executive, lured the tribal leaders back to the raceway for what may be the last off-reservation casino.
 ''After 12 long years, the project conceived to revitalize a dying community will finally move forward at its rightful home, Monticello Raceway,'' Mr. Berman said. 
 It remains to be seen whether other casinos would be built in the Catskills. The State Legislature authorized three Indian casinos there after the attack on the World Trade Center damaged the state's and New York City's economy. At one point, the Pataki administration supported five. But only the Mohawks had obtained preliminary federal approval.
 There are now four Indian casinos in New York State, including the Oneida tribe's Turning Stone casino in Verona and the Mohawks' casino on the Akwesasne reservation. In the first 10 months of last year, the Seneca tribe's two upstate casinos generated about $75 million in revenues for the state, according to the Racing and Wagering Board.
 But the Catskills was always seen as the gambling prize, because it is closer to New York City than either Atlantic City or the two Connecticut casinos. Analysts have said that a major Catskill casino could generate $1 billion a year and put a significant dent in Atlantic City revenues.
 Rosa Lee, a leader of Casino-Free Sullivan County, said yesterday that she remained unimpressed by Governor Spitzer's actions. She said she was more concerned about traffic congestion, increased crime and the pressure of development. 
 ''We don't think casinos are the answer to our economic and development problems up here,'' she said.
 Richard Schrader, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which has filed a suit against the project, also expressed disappointment with the governor's decision and the federal government's environmental review, which he said was insufficient.
 ''We simply don't know the likely impacts in increased traffic congestion, air quality deterioration and dangerous sprawl that a major development like this would have on the Catskills,'' he said.
 The Interior Department sent a letter to the Mohawks in December saying that it had approved the existing environmental review of the project. But the letter spent more time highlighting Mr. Kempthorne's negative views of off-reservation casinos. Though they are permitted under the 1988 law, he contends that it was never meant to allow casinos so far from reservations.
 It is not clear whether the secretary would have a legal justification for blocking the project, but he could at least delay a final decision.
 The agreements reached over the weekend were delayed for weeks when state officials insisted on discussing the collection of cigarette taxes on the Mohawk reservation, a prickly issue for the tribe, which is regarded as a sovereign nation. The tribe has agreed to collect and remit taxes in Monticello. But on the reservation, it says the state should collect taxes from wholesalers who sell tobacco products to distributors there. 
 The two sides agreed to try to work out the issue.
 ''We are committed to entering good-faith negotiations toward a formal cigarette trade agreement,'' Chief White said.

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about Gov. Eliot Spitzer's approval of plans for a casino for the St. Regis Mohawk tribe in the Catskill Mountains of New York misspelled the name of the upstate New York town that is near the tribe's Akwesasne reservation. It is Massena, not Messena.

HEADLINE: Cleaner Coal Is Attracting Some Doubts

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 

 BODY:
Within the next few years, power companies are planning to build about 150 coal plants to meet growing electricity demands. Despite expectations that global warming rules are coming, almost none of the plants will be built to capture the thousands of tons of carbon dioxide that burning coal spews into the atmosphere.
 Environmentalists are worried, but they put their faith in a technology that gasifies the coal before burning. Such plants are designed, they say, to be more adaptable to separating the carbon and storing it underground.
Most utility officials counter that the gasification approach is more expensive and less reliable, but they say there is no need to worry because their tried-and-true method, known as pulverized coal, can also be equipped later with hardware to capture the global warming gas. 
 But now, influential technical experts are casting doubts on both approaches.
 ''The phrases 'capture ready' and 'capture capable' are somewhat controversial,'' said Revis James, the director of the energy technology assessment center at the Electric Power Research Institute. ''It's not like you just leave a footprint for some new equipment.''
 Many experts outside the industry share his concerns.
 A major new study by faculty members at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, scheduled for release soon, concludes in a draft version that it is not clear which technology -- the so-called integrated gasification combined cycle or pulverized coal -- will allow for the easiest carbon capture, because so much engineering work remains to be done.
 ''Other than recommending that new coal combustion units should be built with the highest efficiency that is economically justifiable, we do not believe that a clear preference for one technology or the other can be justified,'' the draft concludes. The M.I.T. study said it was critical that the government ''not fall into the trap of picking a technology 'winner.' ''
 The study leader, Ernest J. Moniz, a former assistant secretary of energy in the Clinton administration, was more blunt. ''Clearly in a lot of discussions, I.G.C.C. has been anointed as the solution,'' he said referring to integrated gasification combined cycle. He made his comments at a symposium organized by the Aspen Institute in Washington last fall. ''We certainly don't agree with that.''
 Retrofitting either a gasification or pulverized coal power plant is not just a matter of adding new equipment and it might be impractical, the experts say. Temperatures and pressures would be designed to be in one range for a plant that captured its carbon, and another if it merely produced electricity with minimum use of fuel. Less fuel means less carbon dioxide production. 
 Adding carbon capture later also has implications for power supply. Early estimates are that carbon capture will require so much energy that it could reduce plant output by 10 to 30 percent.
 Some experts say that the best choice may vary according to the type of coal used. Coal with high moisture content may be less suitable for gasification. 
 The technical assessment is certainly at odds with the hopes expressed by environmentalists. The TXU Corporation of Dallas is planning a fleet of huge new coal plants of the pulverized variety. In Austin, Tex., Tom Smith, a researcher at Public Citizen, who is helping lead the opposition, said, ''It's clear that coal gasification is by far preferable to building traditional pulverized coal plants.'' On Tuesday a Texas District court judge blocked a plan by the governor to ''fast track'' TXU's application.
 Getting carbon out of the gas stream before combustion must be easier, Mr. Smith said, because the post-combustion gases in a pulverized coal plant are 160 times as great.
 Some utility executives agree. David Crane, the chief executive of NRG Energy, said that at some point engineers might work out an economical way to capture carbon after combustion in a pulverized coal plant, but that does not exist now.
 Because carbon regulation is coming, he said, gasification plants will be needed.
 ''For the next generation, it's clear to me that rather than build a bunch of pulverized coal plants, with their 50-year life, the country is much better off if we go to I.G.C.C.,'' he said. The company is planning such a plant in Tonawanda, N.Y. 
 Others point out that carbon capture from gas made from coal has proved workable, at least at a relatively small nonpower plant that manufactures methane, but that it is still unproved at a large power plant. They say the only way to prove its feasibility is to go ahead now, rather than simply build plants to be modified later.
 ''There is no reason to wait,'' Robert H. Socolow, a professor at Princeton who is an expert on carbon capture, said in an e-mail message. ''We are going to learn on the job.'' 
 Some environmentalists dispute the need for new coal plants, but unless there is very rapid progress soon in realizing energy efficiencies or developing the ability to extract and store huge amounts of wind and solar power at reasonable cost, more coal plants seem certain. Compared with cleaner fossil fuels, like natural gas and oil, coal is cheaper and more widely available. So finding a way to capture the greenhouse gases from these plants is critical. 
 At American Electric Power, which plans to build two gasification plants and add carbon separation later, Bruce H. Braine, the vice president for strategic policy analysis, acknowledged that there was a ''retrofit factor'' that would raise the price of such a plant above the cost of waiting a few years and building in the separation technology from the start. But because there is demonstrable evidence that separating carbon from gasified coal would work better than at a pulverized coal plant, he said, ''we think it's the right thing to do to move the I.G.C.C. technology forward.'' 
 Engineers agree that it is easier to remove sulfur, mercury, particles and other conventional pollutants from plants that use gasification. But they are more expensive to build, and the industry has little experience with their reliability. Even the manufacturers concede this. 
 ''It will work,'' Randy Zwirn, the chief executive of Siemens Power Generation, said of the ability to separate carbon from a gasified coal plant. ''The question is, Can it be done economically?''
 Power companies need to start getting experience in this field, he said, but they will need subsidies or agreements with state regulators to avoid being unfairly penalized for testing designs that turned out not to run very well, at least not at first. Otherwise, he said, they would stick with tried-and-true methods and the early steps to a truly revolutionary technology might never be taken. 
 John Thompson, director of the Coal Transition Program at the Clean Air Task Force, an environmental group, argued that coal gasification was superior because it allowed far better control of conventional pollutants, like mercury, and because it offered new ways of making money from coal-fired plants. For example, he said, they might use a gasifier that made fuel for a power generator during peak hours, and in off-peak hours made gas that could be turned into liquid fuel for vehicles or other valuable chemicals. 
 But at the Electric Power Research Institute, which surveys the technologies for low-carbon generation, Steve Specker, the president, refers to a ''horse race'' between pulverized coal and combined cycle.
 For all the questions about the coal technologies, any new plant should at least be an improvement on what is operating now. The reason is that many plants now running require about 10,000 B.T.U.'s of heat to make a kilowatt-hour. But newer designs, called ''supercritical,'' use hotter steam, with no moisture, and get more work out of it.
 The newest designs, which the industry calls ''ultra supercritical,'' push down the amount of heat needed to make a kilowatt-hour; engineers expect to reach the range of 7,500 B.T.U.
 This will be small consolation, however, if the total number of kilowatt-hours rises sharply at the same time that reducing carbon emissions becomes a national goal.The Energy ChallengeArticles in this series are examining the ways in which the world is, and is not, moving toward a more energy-efficient, environmentally benign future.

HEADLINE: Europeans Agree to Cut Emissions Sharply if U.S. and Others Follow Suit

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 20 

 BODY:
Seeking to persuade other nations to curb greenhouse gas emissions, European Union ministers pledged Tuesday to raise their own targets if industrialized countries like the United States made similar efforts. 
 European governments would be ready to cut emissions 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020, from a current pledge of 20 percent, but only if other heavy polluters joined in, said Sigmar Gabriel, the German environment minister, who led a meeting in Brussels that formally endorsed the European targets.
Germany, the biggest European economy, was already prepared to cut its emissions even further if there was a broader agreement, Mr. Gabriel said, noting that the German Parliament had supported a 40 percent target.
 The pledges, which match a proposal made by the European Commission last month, are signs that nations are gearing up for new negotiations on a global climate accord after 2012, when the first period covered by the Kyoto Protocol expires.
 The issue is expected to be on the agenda when Germany serves as host of a meeting in June of the Group of 8 nations. European countries are hoping to win pledges from big developing countries as well, including China and India.
 ''You get a deadlock in international negotiations when there's the attitude that, 'We're not going to do anything until someone goes first,' so it's good that the ministers committed to 20 percent,'' said Kirsty Hamilton, a policy consultant for the UK Business Council for Sustainable Energy, a group representing British utilities.
 But environmentalists were disappointed that governments postponed a more ambitious goal of 30 percent, unless other countries adopted similar policies.
 Choosing a lower target ''will send the wrong signal to the international community, casting a dubious light on how serious the European Union is about fighting climate change,'' said Jan Kowalzig, a climate and energy campaigner for Friends of the Earth in Brussels.
 European officials want other parts of the world, including the United States, to adopt European-style restrictions on emissions to fight climate change, thus helping European businesses compete globally at a time when the European Union is toughening regulation in sectors like air travel, car manufacturing and construction.
 But splits among member states over how much more Europe can afford to cut back on pollutants have emerged as obstacles to reaching firm targets. 
 Last week, European Union energy ministers backed away from approving a binding proposal that 20 percent of all energy must come from renewable sources, like wind and solar power, by 2020.
 According to Friends of the Earth, Finland, Poland and Hungary resisted the 20 percent target, and only Sweden and Denmark supported a unilateral 30 percent target.
 A European diplomat said Finland, Poland and Hungary had expressed reservations about how the burden would be shared so that poorer and more energy-intensive parts of Europe could develop their economies.
 Such differences could foreshadow a showdown in March, when political leaders are to meet in Brussels and reach a final position.

HEADLINE: Amid the Ivy, A Battle About The Climate

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
There is an unofficial code of conduct that dictates how intellectuals should behave when they're jousting with each other, a sort of Geneva Convention for the ivory tower.
 Before they attack somebody else's work, they first need to praise their opponent. A typical way to do so is to describe another professor as a distinguished scholar who has made an important contribution to the research literature. When you hear that, you can be pretty sure things are about to get nasty.
The rest of us can usually ignore these spats, but once in a while there is an academic fight that really matters. The economics profession is engaged in one of those right now and, as luck would have it, it's even more entertaining than most.
 Last week, Sir Nicholas Stern, a top adviser to the British government, came to the United States to talk about climate change. In October, a commission he led released a 700-page report calling for ''urgent action'' against global warming to prevent economic damage that could rival that of the world wars and the Great Depression. Given its source and its tone, the Stern Review has nudged people to talk more seriously about climate change. 
 In the minds of a lot of American economists, however, the review is a badly flawed piece of work. These economists don't doubt that earth is getting hotter, that human activity is the cause and that the results could be bad. But they think that Sir Nicholas may have exaggerated the likely speed of warming, among other things, and overstated the case for big, quick action. 
 The epicenter of the opposition has been here at Yale, and so last week, after stopping in Washington to testify before Congress, Sir Nicholas came to New Haven for a public debate with his critics. With a couple of hundred students and professors in the audience -- and a sculpture of an angry Zeus-like figure looming above the stage -- the two sides went at it in the dignified, vicious way that academics do.
 Sir Nicholas spoke during the morning, and his case is really quite simple. The carbon dioxide that has already been pumped into the atmosphere guarantees that the planet will keep getting warmer. But the decisions that people make over the next couple of decades will determine how much warmer -- and, in all likelihood, how many floods, droughts, hurricanes, crop failures and species extinctions occur. The surest way to reduce emissions is a big economic deterrent, like a carbon tax.
 ''The later we leave it, the more difficult it will be,'' he said, ''and the more risks you run.''
 The Stern Review's most influential critic has probably been William Nordhaus, a 65-year-old Yale professor who is as mainstream as economists come. Jeffrey D. Sachs, the anti-poverty advocate, calls Mr. Nordhaus ''about the most reasonable man I know.'' 
 He was the first speaker after lunch, and, of course, he had some very nice things to say about Sir Nicholas. The report ''was presented here very eloquently by a distinguished scholar,'' Mr. Nordhaus said. But then came the juicy stuff: the Stern Review ''commits cruel and unusual punishment on the English language,'' Mr. Nordhaus said, and the British government's opinion on climate change is no more infallible than was its prewar view about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. 
 This was fairly tame compared with the comments of another Yale economist, Robert O. Mendelsohn. ''I was awestruck,'' he said, comparing Sir Nicholas to ''The Wizard of Oz.'' But ''my job is to be Toto,'' he added, in the same good-humored tone Mr. Nordhaus used. ''Is it in fact The Wizard of Oz, or is it nothing at all?''
 The two professors raised some questions about the science in the Stern Review. Mr. Nordhaus wondered if carbon emissions and temperatures would rise as quickly as the report suggests, and Mr. Mendelsohn predicted that people would learn to adapt to climate change, reducing its ultimate cost. 
 But their main objection revolved around something called the discount rate. The Stern Review assumed that a dollar of economic damage prevented a century from now (adjusted for inflation) is roughly as valuable as a dollar spent reducing emissions today. In effect, the report argues for spending the money to cut emissions because future generations have as much claim on resources as current generations. ''I've still not heard a decent ethical argument'' for believing otherwise, Sir Nicholas said at the debate.
 I'm guessing that your instinct is to agree with him. Mine certainly was. The problem is that none of us actually behave this way. If we really thought that our great-grandchild deserved our money as much as we do, we would never go out to dinner again. Instead, we would invest the $50 we would have spent on dinner, confident that it would grow over time and become perhaps $1,000 for our great-grandchild to put toward health care, education or a supercomputer. Any of that is preferable to our measly dinner.
 But a dollar today truly is more valuable than a dollar a century from now. For one thing, your great-grandchild will almost certainly be richer than you are and won't need your money as much as you do. So spending a dollar on carbon reduction today to avoid a dollar's worth of economic damage in 2107 doesn't make sense. We would be better off putting the money toward something likely to have a higher return than alternative energy, like education.
 Technically, then, Sir Nicholas's opponents win the debate. But in practical terms, their argument has a weak link. They are assuming that the economic gains from, say, education will make future generations rich enough to make up for any damage caused by climate change. Sea walls will be able to protect cities; technology can allow crops to grow in new ways; better medicines can stop the spread of disease.
 No one knows whether this is true, let alone desirable, because no one knows what life will be like on a planet that is five degrees hotter. ''If ever there was an example where there was uncertainty, this is it,'' said Martin L. Weitzman, a Harvard economist who attended the debate.
 While sitting there, I was reminded of the speeches that Alan Greenspan gave a few years ago about the risks of deflation. It wasn't the most likely outcome, he said, but the consequences of it could be so bad that policy makers had to take steps to prevent it. Focusing attention on this point -- the catastrophic risks of climate change -- is Sir Nicholas's biggest accomplishment, whatever you think of his math.
 As Mr. Weitzman puts it, the Stern Review is ''right for the wrong reasons.'' 
 Even its critics seem open to this idea. When Mr. Nordhaus and Sir Nicholas were exchanging e-mail messages before the debate -- to their credit, some academics keep their arguments from becoming personal -- Mr. Nordhaus sent a note that summed up his view. ''I think it's a great study, but it's 50 years ahead of its time,'' he recalled writing. ''Since everybody else is 50 years behind the times, if you average the two, you might come out just right.''
 In other words, it's time for a tax on carbon emissions.

HEADLINE: Tougher Tactics Deter Migrants At U.S. Border

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: SAN LUIS RIO COLORADO, Mexico 

 BODY:
For 10 years, Eduardo Valenzuela has been crossing the border illegally near Yuma, Ariz., trekking over desert scrub and hopping a freight train to get back to his job with a construction company in Phoenix. The clandestine trip has become an annual ritual for him, as he goes home each winter to see his children. 
 But on a recent afternoon he and four travel companions from his hometown, Los Mochis, plopped down on a bench in a park in the border town of San Luis Rio Colorado, exhausted and dispirited. They were beat. Border Patrol agents had caught them twice over three days, hounding them with helicopters and four-wheel-drive trucks.
''It's become much more difficult,'' Mr. Valenzuela said, echoing the comments of dozens of other migrants. ''Before, you just arrived here and then you walked a little and got the train. You used to see a border patrol agent every 10 kilometers. Now you see four of them where there was one. Think of it.'' 
 All along the border, there are signs that the measures the Border Patrol and other federal agencies have taken over the last year, from erecting new barriers to posting 6,000 National Guardsmen as armed sentinels, are beginning to slow the flow of illegal immigrants. 
 The only available barometer of the decline is how many migrants are caught. In the last four months, the number has dropped 27 percent compared with the same period last year, the biggest drop since a crackdown immediately after 9/11. In two sections around Yuma and near Del Rio, Tex., the numbers have fallen by nearly two-thirds, Homeland Security officials say.
 ''We are comfortable that this actually reflects a change in momentum,'' Michael Chertoff, the secretary of Homeland Security, said in an interview last week during his first official visit to Mexico City. ''I'm always quick to say it doesn't mean we can declare victory. To some degree, I expect the criminal organizations or smugglers are pulling back a little, watching to see if we lose interest.'' 
 Some immigration experts said it was too early to tell if the enforcement efforts had caused a permanent downturn. In the past, tougher enforcement has only caused smugglers to seek new routes. 
 ''It's the squeeze the balloon phenomenon,'' said Roberto Suro, the director of the Pew Hispanic Center in Washington. ''Sometimes you can't tell where the bubble will come when you squeeze until later.''
 Nor can they rule out other factors, like a relatively cold winter on the border and Mexico's solid economic growth last year. 
 Border Patrol commanders say they see no explanation for the drop-off across the entire 2,000-mile border other than stiffer enforcement deterring migrants. The slackening flow, they argue, belies the conventional wisdom that it is impossible to stem illegal migration. Many veteran officers in the force are now beginning to believe it can be controlled with enough resources.
 The new measures range from simply putting more officers out on patrol to erecting stadium lights, secondary fences and barriers of thick steel poles to stop smugglers from racing across the desert in all-wheel-drive trucks. The Border Patrol has deployed hundreds of new guards to watch rivers, monitor surveillance cameras and guard fences. 
 In the Yuma headquarters of the Border Patrol, for instance, Chief Ronald Colburn said that with the help of the National Guard the patrol had doubled the agents in his sector to about 900, extended the primary steel wall eight miles past the end of the Mexican town of San Luis Rio Colorado, and constructed a vehicle barrier six miles beyond that. ''It's the right mix, the right recipe,'' he said.
 The federal government has also begun punishing migrants with prison time from the first time they enter illegally in some areas. For instance, along the 210 miles of border covered by the Del Rio office of the Border Patrol, everyone caught crossing illegally is charged in federal court and, if convicted, sentenced to at least two weeks in prison. 
 That is an enormous break with past practice, when most Mexican migrants were simply taken back to the border and let go. People from Central American countries were given a court date and released on their own recognizance. Few ever showed up.
 In San Luis Rio Colorado, the effects of the stepped-up patrols are apparent. A year ago, migrants thronged the town park and cheap motels, where guides, known as ''coyotes'' or ''polleros'' offered their services. Now the park is nearly empty. The smugglers are telling their charges to take a bus to a spot called El Sahuaro about 50 miles east of town. From there the migrants make a dangerous two-day walk through rocky canyons and barren desert to reach Interstate 8.
 On the other side, Border Patrol agents say they are picking up about 100 people a day, rather than the 500 a day they handled a year ago. A year ago, the processing center in Yuma, where migrants are fingerprinted then shipped to the border, was mobbed. Now it is nearly empty most of the time.
 Several migrants waiting their chance in San Luis cursed under their breath in Spanish when asked about the soldiers and beefed-up patrols. Some are indignant that the United States would treat them like enemies or criminals.
 ''It's harder and harder, and that's the reason why people are dying in the desert,'' said Miguel Perez, a 24-year-old migrant from Guerrero State. ''It makes no sense.''
 A year ago, a flood of immigrants from Central America was also overwhelming the border patrol in Del Rio and Eagle Pass, two small Texas towns on the Rio Grande. The migrants were taking advantage of a lack of detention space, which had led to the policy of giving them a hearing date and letting them remain in the country.
 The result was bizarre: Central Americans would cross the river in droves in broad daylight, run up to Border Patrol agents and line up to be arrested, knowing they would be released and could then continue on their journey. More than 200 a day were arrested in Eagle Pass alone.
 Agents at the processing center, never intended as a jail, were so busy feeding and fingerprinting migrants they had little time for patrolling, said Randy Clark, the agent in charge of Eagle Pass Border Patrol office. 
 ''It was a madhouse, literally a madhouse,'' he said, as he walked through the processing center, its empty cells covered in graffiti. ''It's like night and day. Night and day.'' 
 Agent Clark and his colleagues attribute the reversal to two changes. First, the Justice Department gave Border Patrol agents the ability to deport most of the Central Americans more quickly, without a hearing before a judge. 
 Then, in December 2005, the federal government started prosecuting everyone the Border Patrol picked up for illegal entry, a misdemeanor that carries a penalty of up to six months in county, state and federal jails for a first offense.
 On a recent morning, 78 immigrants shuffled into the federal courtroom of Judge Victor Roberto Garcia. The migrants were shackled around the feet and hands as if they were dangerous criminals. 
 Once in court, the judge conducted an unusual mass hearing in which all the migrants -- represented by a single lawyer -- agreed to waive their right to a trial and pleaded guilty to illegal entry. The judge gave the first-timers 15 days in jail, but he handed out sentences of 120 or 180 days to those who had been deported in the past.
 One Honduran woman, Gloria Machado-Lara, had been deported just a month before, but tried to slip in again with her husband, Freddy Rosales Diaz, in early February. The judge looked dumbfounded. 
 ''Just last month they sent you back?'' he said. ''You understand that's why you have to go to jail.'' 
 Head lowered, she said, ''Forgive me.'' He gave her and her husband 120 days.
 Though it seems cruel to many migrants, the zero-tolerance policy appears to be working, Border Patrol commanders say. Along the river the Del Rio sector patrols, arrests are a third of what they were a year ago, only about 35 a day. In the meantime, drug seizures have doubled, as more agents have been freed up to patrol.
 ''Word is getting around out there that if you cross in this area and get apprehended you are probably going to go to jail, and that is a deterrent,'' Sector Chief Randy Hill said. 
 Yet across the river in Ciudad Acuna, where migrants arrive bewildered and penniless every afternoon after serving their prison sentences, several said they had no idea they ran the risk of jail. The smugglers they hired never told them.
 One of the migrants was a 51-year-old plumber from Acambaro, Guanajuato, who asked that his name not be used because he was ashamed of the criminal conviction. He said he was trying to get to San Antonio, where a friend had promised to get him a job at a water park. 
 He needed more money, he said, to pay his son's college tuition. He had never set foot in a jail before.
 But he acknowledged that the stint in jail had persuaded him not to try again, even if his son must drop out. ''No way,'' he said, shaking his head.

HEADLINE: That Sinking Feeling

 BODY:
How do you know when it's time to improve the country's roads and bridges, and the water systems and power grids that the United States relies upon? There have been plenty of warning signs: spiking traffic congestion and spectacular blackouts. But at what point does the issue move from the province of anxious engineers to an outright national priority? 
 When sinkholes start swallowing repair trucks, it's a pretty good bet that it's time to pay attention. As William Yardley reported recently in The Times, the country's water and sewer lines, many of them a century old, are in terrible shape, leading to those collapsing roads. And the Army Corps of Engineers reported earlier this month that more than 120 levees around the country could fail in a major flood. New Orleans needs to remain an exception, rather than a sad model for the future.
According to the federal Environmental Protection Agency, just fixing the nation's aging wastewater infrastructure will cost as much as $390 billion. A report to be released next month by the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton notes that a successful business environment also demands more reliable energy, water and transportation systems. The report cites a Transportation Department finding that freight bottlenecks -- with planes circling at overcrowded airports and cargo stacked up at overcapacity ports -- are costing the United States economy $200 billion annually. 
 That means that America's ability to compete isn't just a matter of being inventive and having a good work ethic, but also depends on the ability to deliver products reliably and on time. The first president with a master's degree in business administration -- hint, he's the current Oval Office occupant -- should convene a task force of federal, state and local officials to address the growing problem. 
 If a company kept its factories in the condition that America keeps its infrastructure, you'd expect it to lose business.

HEADLINE: Las Vegas Adapts to Reap Chinese New Year Bounty

BYLINE: By STEVE FRIESS

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Feb. 20 

 BODY:
Zhu Yu was not the least perturbed that faux Italian frescoes -- rather than Asian silk screens -- decorated the ceiling of the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino hallway where he and his family watched on Saturday as a 25-foot-long red-and-yellow dragon shimmied through a traditional Chinese New Year dance.
 ''Oh, it's nothing like what we did when I was a boy in Taipei, but it's still very exciting,'' Mr. Zhu, 49, said over the din of drumbeats as the dragon paused to send good luck in the direction of those inside the high-limit baccarat room. His three daughters, all younger than 10, stood mesmerized in front of his wife.
It was the Zhu family's fourth straight year ushering in Chinese New Year in Las Vegas instead of in their home city, San Francisco. Their stop at the Venetian's dragon dance was followed by a visit to a similar one in the pirate's cove outside the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino on Sunday, the first day of the Year of the Pig, and another dragon dance Monday, this one at the Roman-themed Caesars Palace. 
 ''This is a Las Vegas version of Chinese New Year,'' Mr. Zhu said. ''It's its own thing, but we love it.''
 So do casino executives. Chinese New Year, a 15-day celebration that is set by a lunar calendar and that usually falls in late January or early February, has become one of the city's most profitable events, drawing thousands of Asian and Asian-American visitors and hundreds of millions of their dollars each year.
 The city's tourism board does not keep statistics on the event's economic impact, but executives with Las Vegas Sands Inc., which owns the Venetian, say more money is bet during the two-week period than at any other time during the year. ''The Chinese New Year is longer than anything,'' said the company's president and chief operating officer, William P. Weidner, ''and we see much higher per-player action.''
 J. Terrence Lanni, chief executive of MGM Mirage, the city's largest gambling company with nine properties on the Strip, including the Bellagio and Mirage resorts, said that for his company, the first weekend of Chinese New Year was the second-biggest betting weekend of the year, ahead of the Super Bowl and behind only the conventional New Year's holiday. (Gamblers in Las Vegas wagered $93 million on last month's Super Bowl, the Nevada Gaming Control Board reported.)
 Casinos drape enormous banners with New Year's greetings in Chinese across their porte-cocheres and add tables for baccarat and pai gow poker, two games favored by Asian gamblers. They hold parties where managers hand invited guests red envelopes stuffed with money or special gambling chips adorned with the animal symbol of the year. At Caesars Palace, Celine Dion and Elton John are given a few days off so that Jacky Cheung, the Canto-pop sensation, can hold forth in the 4,100-seat Colosseum.
 Most Chinese restaurants on the Strip stay open longer and add traditional New Year's dishes or rename some regular ones with lucky or upbeat words. It is not unusual for a family to spend more than $20,000 for a Chinese New Year dinner, said Richard Chen, the executive chef at the Wing Lei restaurant in the Wynn Las Vegas resort, which has imported abalone at $2,226 a pound and bird's nest at $1,600 a pound for this year's festivities.
 At the Bellagio, the theme of the 14,000-square-foot Conservatory is changed only five times a year, and Chinese New Year is one of those times. The current display features live tangerine trees, a 45-foot-tall pagoda, and a mechanical pig with a moving eyes, tail and snout.
 ''You'll see a lot of Chinese lanterns hanging in groups of six because multiples of six are lucky numbers,'' said the Conservatory manager, Sharon Hatcher. ''Everything here are multiples of six or eight, because those are the lucky numbers. Even the number of koi we have in our pond are multiples of eight. We want to maintain as much positive energy for luck.''
 Such nods to Asian culture came as hard-learned lessons for Las Vegas properties, which now employ feng shui masters to advise on design and building plans. When the MGM Grand Hotel-Casino opened in 1993, patrons walked through a main entrance built to resemble the mouth of a mammoth lion, MGM's longtime corporate symbol. This incensed Asian gamblers, who complained -- and stayed away -- because the notion of walking into the mouth of a beast is considered unlucky. The company spent millions removing the lion and reconfiguring the entrance, said Alan Feldman, a spokesman for MGM Mirage.
 ''Everyone has stories about things like that,'' Mr. Feldman said. ''Over at the Mirage we built a high-limit gaming area that looked like a library. The Chinese word for book sounds like death so books have an unlucky connotation. Those books were gone within the hour.''
 While the notion of traveling to Las Vegas for a major cultural event historically known as a time for family gatherings may seem sacrilegious, David Huang, whose tour company, Chinese Hosts, is based here, said the trend reflected a newfound desire among younger, upwardly mobile Asians and Asian-Americans to travel while maintaining an important tradition of the holiday: gambling.
 ''The Chinese New Year has always been a time for people to get together and play games, to celebrate good luck and good fortune,'' Mr. Huang said. ''People like to get together and spend substantial amounts of money. Vegas helps keep up the tradition.''
 Las Vegas's ties to Asia have grown more extensive over the last decade with MGM Mirage, Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts all spending billions on lavish hotel-casinos in the Chinese province of Macau. In 2004, Nevada opened a tourism office in Beijing. And both the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and the Community College of Southern Nevada have or are building satellite campuses in China and Singapore.
 ''Growing up in Las Vegas, we never heard about Chinese New Year,'' said Bo J. Bernhard, a sociology professor at U.N.L.V. and director of gambling research at the university's International Gaming Institute. ''There might've been a nod here or there and a casino host who focused on high rollers 10 years ago. But now the casino industry is being exposed to Asia in a big way, and Asia has been exposed to our casino industry, too.''
 The importance of Chinese New Year to the casino industry is clear by the lengths to which properties go to court Asian gamblers during the holiday. This year's Chinese New Year began on the Presidents' Day weekend, typically a busy time for the city, which was also the site of the NBA All-Star Game and one of the year's biggest conventions, the men's apparel trade show. But Mr. Weidner said his company's top priority was its clients, some of whom the company ferried here from Asia on its fleet of private jets.
 ''This is a merit system here,'' Mr. Weidner said. ''The highest quality players will get whatever they want. The Chinese are the highest and best quality players in the world, so they'll have preference. We don't care how tall you are, how short you are, how fat you are, what color you are. Green is the most important color.''

CORRECTION-DATE: February 26, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about the popularity of Las Vegas for Asians and Asian-Americans' celebrating the Chinese New Year referred incorrectly to Macau, where several Las Vegas casinos have built lavish hotel-casinos in the last decade. It is a special administrative region of China, not a province.

HEADLINE: Even With Change, an Affordable Capital

BYLINE: By GARETH HARDING

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- Apartments here don't get much more central than Gregg Svingen's one-bedroom place just off Boulevard Emile Jacqmain, a busy thoroughfare that snakes through the Belgian capital. 
 Directly in front of his building is Rue Neuve, the city's main shopping street. On the left is the shimmering glass home of the National Theater; on the right, central Brussels's oldest hotel and biggest movie complex. And the Grand Place, considered to be one of the most beautiful squares in the world, is a five-minute stroll away, as are most of the city's finest bars and restaurants.
 ''It's amazing to live downtown,'' said Mr. Svingen, a 34-year-old American from Seattle, who works as a consultant for a lobbying firm called the Centre. ''Before Brussels, I never thought it would be possible to live slap-bang in the center.'' 
 Until the mid-1990s, few urban professionals would have been tempted to live in the neighborhood, which was better known for sex shops than hip restaurants. But the area is rapidly changing, altered mainly by young Flemish professionals and expatriates like Mr. Svingen -- although he recently decided to take advantage of the growing property market and buy a place in the city suburbs. ''Downtown is definitely changing for the better,'' he said, surveying the sidewalk-widening work going on below his balcony. ''But I don't know how long the prices will remain democratic.''
 The cost of renting and buying property has risen in the eight years that Mr. Svingen has lived in Brussels, where both NATO and the 27-member European Union have their headquarters. But despite the increases, Brussels remains one of the cheapest places to buy or to rent among all the European Union capitals. 
 ''The politicians in Belgium think it's horribly expensive here, but only because they don't compare it to anywhere else,'' said Iain Cook, chief executive of the local branch of ERA Real Estate, which has offices in 40 countries. 
 The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment of 60 square meters, or almost 650 square feet, in an upscale district of Brussels is $1,280 a month. That is half the average price in Paris and less than a third the cost of renting in London and New York, according to Mercer Human Resources Consulting, which helps clients around the world find housing for expatriate employees. 
 Tenants like Mr. Svingen, who signed a nine-year lease in 2003, are also protected by Belgian laws that make it difficult for rent increases to exceed the rate of inflation.
 He pays 723 euros, or $950, a month for his 88-square-meter, or 947-square-foot apartment. The amount includes services charges but no utilities; he also pays an additional 60 euros, or $79, a month to rent a garage on his street. 
 It certainly is possible to find cheaper apartments in Brussels, but not with the same kind of parquet flooring, stucco moldings, high ceilings, wraparound balconies and French windows that flood the apartment with natural light. 
 ''The great thing about Brussels is you can rent without feeling guilty about throwing your money away,'' said Mr. Svingen, who lived in England and France before settling in Belgium. ''In London and Paris they scrimp on the space but certainly not on the price.''
 Despite the cheap rent and the buzz of living downtown, Mr. Svingen and his Dutch partner, Sophie Jacobs, are about to buy an apartment in Ixelles, a trendy suburb favored by expats. ''I'm buying because the property market in Belgium is growing at a healthy rate,'' he said, but is not as expensive as London, Dublin or New York.
 In fact, house prices in Brussels over the last two years have grown at a faster rate than in any of those three cities. In 2006, the value of town houses rose by 13 percent, and apartments by almost 10 percent, according to the Belgium Economics Ministry. This followed a 17.1 percent jump in house prices in 2005, the largest increase in the 12-nation Eurozone.
 But residential property in the Belgian capital is still cheap compared with other major European cities, partly because the purchase tax is just 17 percent. According to the ERA Europe Market Survey 2006, the average price of a dwelling of 100 square meters, or slightly more than 1,075 square feet, was 217,462 euros in Brussels, 297,462 euros in Paris, 360,427 euros in London and 368,000 euros in Dublin. (In dollars, the figures would be approximately $286,000 in Brussels, $391,000 in Paris, $474,000 in London and $484,000 in Dublin.)
 ''If you are looking for a good return on your investment, property in Brussels is still a good buy,'' said Mr. Cook, the ERA real estate agent, who added that house prices are expected to continue to rise by 5 to 10 percent this year in spite of higher interest rates.
 It is clear from the way Mr. Svingen greets waiters at a local Flemish restaurant, enthuses about the new Ukrainian supermarket that has just opened around the corner and proudly proclaims that work is a 12-minute door-to-door hop by public transport that cheap housing is not the main reason he decided to live in Brussels. 
 He acknowledged that there is a downside that includes bureaucracy, the squally weather -- surely nothing new for someone raised in Seattle -- and indifferent customer service, which, he said, ''takes nonchalance to a new level.''
 But ''between Paris, London and Brussels, I'd choose here anytime,'' he said. ''We're very spoiled in this city. ''Apartments are cheap and of high quality, the restaurants are great and getting around the city is easy.''

HEADLINE: DESTINATION GUIDE GREAT LAKES: In Lake Country, the Secret Is Out

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
Anyone who has found a piece of paradise on a lake in the Midwest has just one request when talking about that sacred spot: don't tell anyone else. But the appeal of lakeshore living is not much of a secret anymore, judging by the scarcity of vacant lots along the prime shoreline of the Great Lakes and the nearby inland lakes, not to mention the high prices even for cottages described as teardowns -- typically, at least half a million dollars and sometimes a lot more.
 Despite the bleak economy in Michigan, agents say prices for homes on the water have remained fairly stable, partly because second-home owners are usually not under the gun to sell, but also because the Great Lakes attract people from all over the Midwest, so resort areas are somewhat insulated from Detroit's automotive woes.
In fact, real estate agents in Michigan and Wisconsin say they are seeing more second-home buyers from as far away as Arizona, California, Florida and New York -- often, people who have family ties to a particular lake, or retirees who split their time between a temperate winter climate and summer ''up north.'' 
 But perhaps the most important factor buoying the market for lake frontage is the fact that receding glaciers left behind a finite number of freshwater lakes thousands of years ago. 
 ''Waterfront property is going to continue to go up just because of supply and demand for the lakes,'' said Chris Gorgas, an agent with Lighthouse Realty (lighthouserealtyco.com) in Saugatuck, Mich. ''They're not going to make any more of them.''
 There is also a certain appeal to the slower-paced communities surrounding many lakes in the Midwest, with their Fourth of July parades, cherry festivals and fudge shops. (''Fudgie'' was a term once used by locals to refer to summer visitors who frequented the area's fudge stores and ice cream parlors.) 
 That small-town vibe is precisely why Jessica Porter and her husband, who live outside Boston, recently bought a vacation home near the Sleeping Bear Dunes in northern Michigan, choosing the relatively deserted beaches of Lake Michigan over the crowds of Cape Cod. 
 Their three-bedroom house is a couple of blocks from the water and a short bike ride to Empire, a sleepy town compared with other resort communities in northern Michigan and downright comatose compared with beach towns on the East Coast. ''There's an ice cream shop, a pizza place, a craft store and a restaurant -- and that's about it,'' Ms. Porter said. ''I can send my daughter to town on her bike to buy doughnuts, whereas here I can't imagine doing that.''
 Which is not to say that Midwestern lake communities are untouched by crowds, excess or the perils of development. Pine-paneled cottages are routinely knocked down to make way for much bigger Arts and Crafts-style homes, formerly quiet lakes have been invaded by jet skis and jet boats, and environmental concerns like the recent zebra mussel invasion of the Great Lakes have all had an impact on the region that Ernest Hemingway once visited every summer. (These days, famous part-time residents include Michael Moore and Mario Batali.)
 But even with these changes, there is something special about owning a home on a lake where you can walk out your front door in your bathing suit and stroll down to the dock for a swim -- in some cases, in water that is so clean you can drink it. Here is an overview of some of the prime lake destinations in Michigan and Wisconsin, which overshadow other states bordering the Great Lakes because of their superior coastlines and abundance of inland lakes, which are even more desirable to some buyers. 
 Northern Michigan
 To help place yourself on a Michigan map, hold out your left hand, palm facing down. The nails of your pinky and ring fingers are about where you will find some of the most sought-after vacation destinations in the state. To the north, Charlevoix, Petoskey and Harbor Springs are known as old-money resort communities along Lake Michigan's eastern shore, with stately Victorian homes, quaint downtowns and marinas that attract ever-larger boats.
 While there are still homes on nearby stretches of Lake Michigan priced at $500,000 to $750,000, waterfront properties closer to fashionable towns or on prime inland lakes typically sell for $1 million or more, said Mitts Lee (mittslee.com), an agent with Prudential Preferred Properties (pprmi.com) in Charlevoix. For instance, homes on Lake Charlevoix start at $1 million, and Mr. Lee said his agency sold four houses on Round Lake, another sought-after spot, late last year for $1.7 million to $3.5 million. (The premium is attributed to the fact that downtown Charlevoix and its marina are on Round Lake, which connects Lake Michigan to Lake Charlevoix.)
 In general, prices for lakefront property can vary widely based on the quality of the water (Caribbean blue versus brown with a mucky bottom), whether the shoreline is rocky or sandy, whether the lake is calm enough to keep a boat docked out front and whether the house faces the sunset or the sunrise (sunset views are preferred).
 Although the real estate market has cooled in the past year, Mr. Lee said some homes were taking a year or longer to sell simply because they were priced too high. ''Sellers are going to have to wake up to the fact that they aren't going to get the top dollar people paid a few years ago,'' he said. ''When buyers and sellers get to prices that meet, that's when things are going to take off again.''
 Vicki Oltersdorf, a broker with Oltersdorf Realty (oltersdorf.com) in Suttons Bay, about an hour and a half south of Charlevoix, also said prices had flattened in the area, with more homes available and longer selling times. ''It's definitely a buyer's market,'' Ms. Oltersdorf said. ''But if you have a property that's very desirable and it's in good condition and it's priced properly, you can get full price -- or close to it.''
 Ms. Oltersdorf concentrates on the area near Traverse City, northern Michigan's commercial hub, including the towns of Suttons Bay, Leland and Glen Arbor, which are somewhat more casual than Harbor Springs or Charlevoix. Besides Lake Michigan, two prime inland lakes are Glen Lake and Lake Leelanau, and the nearby Sleeping Bear Dunes offer some of the most spectacular views on Lake Michigan, with white sand contrasting against sapphire blue water.
 She said prices for waterfront homes typically ranged from $650,000 to $2 million, although prices on the lower end might mean a house in need of an update or a problematic shoreline. Another factor affecting prices for homes on Lake Michigan is water level; it has been near record lows in recent years, and vegetation poking up from the exposed lake bottom has marred the sandy beaches most people desire.
 But at least buyers can take their time finding the right house. ''Up until this last year, you could say to somebody, 'You'd better make a decision because when you come back, it'll be gone,' '' Ms. Oltersdorf said. ''And this year you can't say that.''
 Southwestern Michigan
 The stretch of coastline along Michigan's southwestern border attracts a steady stream of traffic from Chicago, as well as from Indiana, southern Michigan, Missouri and Ohio, though agents say they are also seeing more buyers from outside the Midwest.
 The southern part of the state has fewer inland lakes, and they tend to be smaller and less pristine than their northern counterparts, so the most desirable second homes in the region are typically along the Lake Michigan shore -- the opposite of the situation up north. But with less waterfront to go around and more populated areas nearby, there are not many bargains to be found.
 ''In 1985, you could buy a lakefront lot 100 by 300 feet for $120,000, and today you're probably talking in the $2 million range,'' said Judie Farley, owner of Farley Real Estate (farleyrealestate.com) in New Buffalo, Mich., about an hour and a half from Chicago. Property values are influenced partly by that driving distance, Ms. Farley said, with prices declining a bit the farther you get from Chicago. For that reason, Michigan City, actually located in the small triangle of Indiana that touches Lake Michigan, is a popular destination, since it is closer to Chicago.
 Lake Michigan's low water level has created bigger sandy beaches in the southwestern part of the state, but not all of the shoreline is level with the water, so homes on bluffs overlooking the lake are generally priced lower. While Chicago buyers have protected second-home prices from Michigan's economic troubles, agents say the market has slackened somewhat.
 ''I think we have seen a price correction in the past year, but nowhere has there been a dive down,'' Ms. Farley said. ''I anticipate prices will resume, or take a strong hold, in 2007.''
 Mr. Gorgas, the agent with Lighthouse Realty in Saugatuck, a quaint, artsy town farther north, cited a couple of sales of vacant lots with 100 feet of lakefront near New Buffalo and Holland for $2 million to $2.5 million. ''It's really a seller's market,'' he said. ''People will price things and just sit on them and wait.'' 
 Michigan's Upper Peninsula
 If there are still deals to be had in Michigan, they are in the Upper Peninsula, or the ''U.P.,'' as Michiganders refer to the part of the state that is actually more connected to Wisconsin (at least by land). 
 The Mackinac Bridge links Michigan's two halves, where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron meet. The northern coast of the U.P. abuts Lake Superior, known for its rough water, shipwrecks and rocky shores, not to mention the black flies that visit in June and early July.
 In general, the towns and the pace of life in the U.P. are much simpler than in the lower peninsula, and driving distances can be daunting. That is partly why the Upper Peninsula is beloved by snowmobilers, who are attracted by the sparse development and the hundreds of miles of trails. But plenty of places draw summer residents, too, particularly the stretch of Lake Michigan coastline between Manistique and St. Ignace (at the foot of the Mackinac Bridge and not far from Mackinac Island, a popular tourist destination a short ferry ride away).
 David Muxlow, owner of Coldwell Banker Grover Real Estate (groverrealestate.com) in Manistique, said property values took off around 1995 and recently leveled off, but prime waterfront properties still sell for $300,000 to $500,000. ''If you go below $300,000, something is wrong, either with the beach or the structure,'' Mr. Muxlow said, noting that there was more new construction relative to the lower peninsula. ''I had a client who wanted an older period home, and they just don't exist here.''
 Lake Geneva, Wis.
 Another popular destination for Chicagoans is Lake Geneva (lakegenevawi.com), an hour and a half north of the city. About eight miles long and between half a mile and three miles wide, the lake is actually named Geneva Lake, and it borders the town of Lake Geneva, a resort community that has long drawn wealthy families from Chicago and is especially admired by sailors and boaters.
 Steve Beers, president of Keefe Real Estate (lakegenevaproperty.com) in Lake Geneva, said homes on the lake cost at least $1.5 million and typically $2 million or more for a house in good condition, citing a 2,000-square-foot teardown with just 36 feet of lake frontage that sold late last year for $1.7 million. The few vacant lots available on the water cost about $2.5 million for 100 feet of lakefront and about an acre of land, Mr. Beers said, adding that Lake Geneva had fewer small cottages than other lakes in the area.
 ''Lake Geneva has always been more upscale,'' he said. ''The homes built were larger, so it doesn't have what you might think of as 'up north' cabins.'' He added that even the larger period homes were being extensively remodeled, if not torn down. But for buyers who cannot afford these prices, Mr. Beers said, homes with 100 feet of frontage on nearby lakes like Delavan, Beulah and Whitewater start at $1 million, fueled by hefty increases in the late 1990s.
 ''It seemed like in one year prices went up 50 percent, and that was already on top of increases that were going up 10 to 15 percent a year,'' he said. Although the market leveled off in 2006, Mr. Beers said he expected that prices would not drop and might actually increase slightly in 2007. 
 ''People come up here looking for these great deals, and it just doesn't happen,'' he said. ''Buyers have said, 'Let me know when this is a good value,' and you have to say, 'This is a good value now.' Two years from now people will be kicking themselves.''
 Door County, Wis.
 The Door County Peninsula (www.doorcounty.com), sometimes referred to as the Cape Cod of the Midwest, juts out into Lake Michigan and forms the southern flank of Green Bay. With about 300 miles of shoreline, much of the peninsula has high limestone bluffs with harbor towns along the shore. Inland, there is a mix of golf courses, wineries, and apple and cherry orchards.
 Corky Hellyer, an agent with Coldwell Banker Door County Horizons (searchdoorcountylistings.com), said prices for waterfront properties had increased steadily since the early 1980s but seemed to have leveled off last year. ''The market has slowed down a little bit,'' Mr. Hellyer said, adding that the price for a nice home with 100 feet of waterfront was typically ''no less than $500,000.''
 He described Door County as more laid-back than Lake Geneva, drawing weekend residents from Green Bay, Madison, Milwaukee and Chicago, which is about a five-hour drive from Fish Creek, a prime destination on the peninsula's northern shore. Nearby is Ephraim, another popular harbor and the peninsula's only dry town.
 In general, the Door County Peninsula is less woodsy than areas in northern Wisconsin and offers more in the way of culture and the arts, including a summer theater and a symphony that plays in August. As for picking a side of the peninsula with more desirable towns or a better shoreline, Mr. Hellyer demurred, saying that each area had its own appeal -- and that the wind dictated the mood of the water. ''If it's rough on one side,'' he said, ''it's usually calm on the other.''
 Northwoods of Wisconsin
 The area along Wisconsin's northern border is called the Northwoods region, known for its abundance of lakes and more affordable property, at least compared with places like Lake Geneva or Door County. Offering boating and fishing in the summer and snowmobiling and skiing in the winter, it is a popular destination for Midwesterners looking for an outdoorsy retreat they can use year-round.
 ''This is the heaviest concentration of freshwater lakes in the world, so lakefront property is very prevalent,'' said Mike Mulleady (mikemulleady.com), an agent with Coldwell Banker Mulleady Realtors (northwoodsrealty.com) in Minocqua, Wis. ''Normally what sets the price apart is the size of the lake: the bigger the lake, the higher the price.''
 For instance, Minocqua Lake is more of a tourist destination, similar to the Wisconsin Dells area farther south. The town of Minocqua sits on an island in the middle of the lake, and summer visitors can go out for cocktails, catch a waterskiing show and have dinner, all by boat. Prices for waterfront homes on Minocqua Lake typically start at $500,000 but can approach $1 million depending on the size and condition of the house, Mr. Mulleady said, adding that buyers looking for a deal in a quieter setting could still find vacant property on smaller lakes for less than $100,000.
 As with other inland lakes throughout the Midwest, the size of the lake correlates with the quality of the water. Smaller lakes are more likely to be weedy or mucky, while larger bodies of water can be so clean, as Mr. Mulleady said, that ''at 35 feet, you can drop a quarter on a sunny day and see it on the bottom of the lake.''
 Like other agents who specialize in lakefront homes, he said he believed that prices for waterfront property had not taken much of a hit in the past year, despite a softening real estate market overall. ''The market was down last year, but it was still the second greatest in real estate we've ever experienced,'' he said. ''We feel next year is going to be even stronger.''

HEADLINE: Nissan Is Offering Buyouts At 2 Tennessee Factories

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
As stagnant sales in the United States end a six-year streak of record profits, the Japanese automaker Nissan is offering buyouts to workers at two plants in Tennessee.
 The company said it expected about 300 of the 6,200 workers at the plants to take buyouts, although it did not say specifically how many jobs it wanted to eliminate.
Nissan is believed to be the second foreign carmaker to offer buyouts, and the first with a nonunion work force to do so. Mitsubishi, which operates a unionized plant in Illinois, has used buyouts to cut jobs three times, most recently last summer. 
 Nissan's cuts come as Detroit's automakers -- including Ford Motor, which an automotive economist described yesterday as having a ''meltdown'' -- have cut tens of thousands of jobs through buyout and early-retirement offers to overcome billions of dollars in losses.
 Nissan is offering the buyouts to 1,000 workers at an engine plant in Decherd, Tenn., and to 5,200 at a plant in Smyrna that builds sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and sedans. The deals include a $45,000 lump-sum payment and $500 for every year of service with Nissan, meaning anyone hired in 1981, when construction of the Smyrna plant began, could receive $58,000.
 In contrast, the buyouts that General Motors and Ford offered to unionized workers included a $35,000 lump sum, although workers could get as much as $140,000 if they agreed to give up future health care coverage and other benefits.
 Gary N. Chaison, a professor of labor relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass., said that Nissan was sending a message to its nonunionized work force by softening the job losses with buyouts and by offering more money than G.M. and Ford.
 ''They're signaling to their work force that they can receive the same protections without a union that others get with a union,'' Professor Chaison said. ''Whenever you have a downsizing, it creates the stirrings of unionization, so they're heading that off.''
 The union has twice failed in campaigns to organize Nissan's Smyrna plant, in 1989 and 2001, with workers opposing the union by a 2-to-1 ratio both times.
 Two weeks ago, Nissan reduced its earnings target for the fiscal year ending in March by 12 percent after third-quarter earnings declined 23 percent. It will be the first time full-year profits have fallen under the chief executive, Carlos Ghosn.
 A Nissan spokeswoman, Vicki Smith, said that the buyout offers, which the company calls a ''voluntary transition program,'' were not a result of a financial crisis.
 ''Nissan is a very healthy company,'' Ms. Smith said. ''We just have an imbalance between our headcount number and our production requirements at present.''
 In contrast, the Chrysler Group, which announced last week that it would cut 13,000 jobs by 2009, lost nearly $1.5 billion last year. Ford lost $12.7 billion in 2006, when it offered buyouts to its entire unionized workforce.
 Sean P. McAlinden, an economist with the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich., gave a harsh assessment of Ford at a labor seminar yesterday. He said the automaker, whose share of the United States market fell to 14 percent in January from nearly 17 percent a year earlier, was going through a ''meltdown'' and might ask for sharp wage and benefit cuts this year during negotiations for a new labor agreement with the United Automobile Workers.
 A Ford spokeswoman, Marcey Evans, said it was too soon to discuss Ford's goals for the contract talks.

HEADLINE: Bringing Laboratory Space Back to New York

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
When Eric Kandel, a Nobel laureate at Columbia University, formed a life sciences company, Memory Pharmaceuticals, in 1998, a lack of lab space options in New York City eventually forced the business to Montvale, N.J.
 In March, the same real estate developer that built those Montvale laboratories, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, will break ground on New York City's first substantial campus for the life sciences, called the East River Science Park. The first tenants are expected in 2009.
Upon completion, the $400 million complex will have three buildings encompassing 1.1 million square feet of specialized laboratories and office space. It will occupy 3.5 acres in Manhattan between East 28th and 29th Streets and First Avenue and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive. 
 Proponents of the East River Science Park said they hoped it would induce start-up life sciences companies like Memory Pharmaceuticals, which now has 65 employees, to set up operations in the city. 
 ''There is huge investment in basic research in the life sciences through our medical research institutions, but we have failed to commercialize our science in New York City,'' said Kathryn Wylde, president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a nonprofit group composed of 200 chief executives from companies in the city.
 ''There are about 30 bioscience companies a year coming out of New York institutions, and essentially, they're all going elsewhere.''
 To change that, the partnership's economic arm contributed $10 million toward creating East River Science Park. The group also worked to enlist the cooperation of an array of top scientific institutions, including Columbia University, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Mount Sinai Hospital, Rockefeller University, New York University School of Medicine, the Hospital for Special Surgery and Weill Medical College of Cornell University.
 Some of the institutions are within a 50-block corridor on the East Side of Manhattan, creating a natural cluster around the planned East River Science Park campus.
 ''The reason we think New York City is going to be particularly competitive is most other clusters have one or two institutions,'' Ms. Wylde said. ''Here, we have seven or eight major institutions, so the critical mass of science and of talent is greater here.''
 In the life sciences, private businesses often collaborate with research institutes, medical centers and government agencies. The efforts tend to be clustered in a handful of cities, including Boston and Cambridge, Mass., and San Diego.
 Laboratories used by life sciences businesses tend to have special features, like higher ceilings, heavier floor-load capacities and advanced mechanical, electrical, ventilation and plumbing systems.
 Alexandria Real Estate Equities, a real estate investment trust based in Pasadena, Calif., specializes in this type of development. The company, which is publicly traded, owns 159 properties, encompassing about 11.2 million square feet; six million more square feet are planned.
 It is building the East River Science Park as a speculative development, said Joel S. Marcus, the chief executive of Alexandria. The company's tenants are mainly biotechnology and pharmaceutical businesses, but also include biodefense companies that might, for example, produce a vaccine for anthrax; concerns that develop medical devices; nonprofit organizations; and branches of government agencies and universities.
 ''We've got quite a few clients that we're going to recruit there, and we're in discussions with a number of people,'' he said. ''We've got a pretty good handle on the market.'' Mr. Marcus said the new center would have dozens of tenants.
 Property development in New York City is notoriously expensive, and life sciences space can cost two to four times that of conventional office space to develop.
 Alexandria did not have to purchase the land, however. It negotiated a land lease with the city for 49 years with two 25-year options. The parcel holds a parking lot and an old laundry building that is part of the Bellevue Medical Center campus.
 Once construction is complete, Alexandria will pay the city $2 million a year, a figure that will escalate over time, said the New York City Economic Development Corporation.
 Alexandria will also receive subsidies. Infrastructure work, like relocating a sewer and other utilities and cleaning up the site, will be paid for with $13.9 million from the city, $27 million from the state and possibly $2 million in federal money. There will also be property tax abatement over 25 years worth $251 million, and breaks on city and state sales tax and recording taxes worth about $22.7 million.
 That should enable the developer to keep rents at a reasonable level, helping attract start-up companies, said Bill Fair, the managing director of health care and bioscience at the city's Economic Development Corporation. ''What we strongly encouraged Alexandria to do, since it's on city-owned land, is to make sure the rents are appropriate to allow some percentage of early-stage companies to come into the East River Science Park,'' he said.
 Lab space that has been fully built out at the Audubon Business and Technology Center, affiliated with Columbia University, is running at $55 a foot; the 100,000-square-foot center is full, with about 16 life sciences companies, said Carol Shuchman, director of commercial leasing and development at Columbia.
 The only other complex offering life sciences space in the city is in Brooklyn at the Advanced Biotechnology Park of the State University of New York's Downstate Medical Center. It currently has about 24,000 square feet of ''incubator'' space for start-up companies.
 Mr. Marcus, Alexandria's chief, said his company was designing the buildings to attract both start-up and midstage companies, as well as biotech venture capital companies. Besides trying to keep new bioscience companies in the city, Alexandria will also try to recruit companies from the region, as well as pharmaceutical and biotech companies based worldwide.
 But even if Alexandria is able to hold down rents to recruit early-stage companies, there is no guarantee that the life sciences will flourish in New York City, said Sheridan Snyder, entrepreneur in residence at Rockefeller University.
 Those institutions turn only a tiny percentage of that research into applied science, products and clinical solutions each year, said Mr. Snyder, who founded the biotech company Genzyme in 1981 and has since founded other bioscience businesses.
 The East River Science Park ''is akin to when the football coach says, 'I need a new stadium to recruit players,' '' Mr. Snyder said. ''It's a great step, but there's so much more than just putting up that building.''

HEADLINE: To Save Later, Employers Offer Free Drugs Now

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
For years, employers have been pushing their workers to pay more for health care, raising premiums and out-of-pocket medical expenses in an effort to save money for the company and force workers to seek only the most necessary care.
 Now some employers are reversing course, convinced that their pennywise approach does not always reduce long-term costs. In the most radical of various moves, a number of employers are now giving away drugs to help workers manage chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma and depression.
Major employers like Marriott International, Pitney Bowes, the carpet maker Mohawk Industries and Maine's state government have introduced free drug programs to avoid paying for more expensive treatments down the road.
 Companies now recognize that ''if you get people's obesity down, cholesterol down, asthma down, you save a lot of money,'' said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University. 
 Despite the Bush administration's efforts to promote ''consumer directed'' health care, many companies are recognizing the limits to shifting too much of the cost of medical care to employees. Experience, Professor Reinhardt said, is contradicting the theory that ''patients will be more prudent shoppers for health care if they ache financially when they ache physically.'' 
 Another motive for the business world could be to stave off a greater government involvement in health insurance, now that most presidential candidates and other politicians are promoting health care reform. 
 Big drug makers like Pfizer and Merck, which could benefit politically and financially from the employer drug programs, are also supporting the effort. 
 Richard T. Clark, the chief executive of Merck, made the political connection in a recent trade journal article. ''If we all don't do a better job, the private employer-based market will continue to weaken and the country will move forward toward rationing of care and greater government control, with greater pressure for a single-payer model with price controls,'' Mr. Clark wrote in the American Journal of Managed Care. 
 One clear motive is to help workers stay well, averting expensive emergency room care and hospital stays. As health coverage has grown more costly, many people have been skimping on care, and millions of Americans are going without health insurance altogether.
 Employers are reacting to a disturbing trend. As most employer-sponsored health plans have raised co-payments sharply for drugs in recent years, employer drug spending has slowed. But total health care spending by employers has nonetheless continued to rise: 7.7 percent last year, or more than double the general inflation rate, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The free drug programs are being adopted in hopes of countering the rising costs, taking their place alongside other steps by some employers that have included opening or expanding health clinics in their factories and offices, and offering checkups and medicines at no cost or for a modest co-payment. 
 Given the millions of Americans who suffer from heart disease, depression, asthma or diabetes -- about one in four working-age adults -- the movement toward free drugs and preventive care has the potential to help many people, said Craig Dolezal, a health care specialist at Hewitt Associates, a consulting firm. 
 Co-payments of $10 to $20 a prescription have become typical, while the co-pay for some expensive drugs can be $50 or more for a month's supply. The new employer programs are waiving those fees. 
 For people with serious health problems, free medicine is an incentive not only to stay with their prescribed regimens, but also to keep in touch with nurses and pharmacists who monitor changes in their weight, blood pressure and other vital signs. 
 At the Mohawk Industries carpet factory in Dublin, Ga., about 200 of the 750 employees signed up for free blood pressure and heart drugs last summer after the company held meetings to describe the benefits of lowering blood pressure and cholesterol. 
 Alan Christianson, Mohawk's benefits administrator, said that the company recognized a few years ago that it could eventually face health costs so high that employees could not afford insurance. ''We felt we had to do something about it,'' he said. 
 Peggy Cauley, 36, who supervises a customer service unit at Mohawk's factory, said she was 30 pounds overweight and had spent $40 a month on blood pressure and heart drugs before she started the program.
 Now the drugs are free, and Charles Posey, an independent pharmacist stationed at the plant, monitors her blood pressure and gives advice on ''how to maintain my weight,'' Ms. Cauley said. She has lost 20 pounds, she said, but is ''still 10 pounds over my goal.''
 Eastman Chemical, which is based in Kingsport, Tenn., and has offered free mammograms for its workers and free vaccines for employees' children, now also provides free drugs and supplies for diabetics under its health plan. 
 The company is trying ''to drive value and to target where care is most needed,'' said David H. Sensibaugh, the director of integrated health.
 The state of Maine found that it was spending more than $20 million a year on treatment for about 2,000 diabetes patients in the state's health plan, which covers 40,000 employees, retirees and dependents. 
 About half the diabetics had at least one additional serious problem like heart disease, said Frank Johnson, the Maine plan's administrator.
 Working with Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, a unit of Wellpoint, the state has started offering free drugs and supplies to employees with diabetes who take part in a face-to-face interview with nurse educators and agree to a year of follow-up telephone sessions, Mr. Johnson said.
 Benefits executives at dozens of large companies are weighing the initial costs and potential savings of free co-pay programs and other health-plan incentives at seminars, including one last week at the Midwest Business Group on Health in Chicago and another scheduled for next month at the National Business Group on Health in Washington. 
 There can be perceived drawbacks for employers, according to a recent academic article that was generally favorable toward the programs. 
 Companies with high rates of worker turnover may believe that they will not get their share of the eventual savings from a free drug program, while smaller employers may fear attracting too many workers with chronic illnesses, according to the article by Michael E. Chernew, a health care policy professor at Harvard, and Dr. Allison B. Rosen and Dr. A. Mark Fendrick, both of the University of Michigan.
 Their report was published last month in the online edition of the journal Health Affairs. 
 Later this year, a Marriott executive is to make a presentation at the University of Michigan, where researchers are analyzing Marriott's move to waive co-payments for generic drugs related to heart disease, diabetes and asthma.
 ''We can see in the preliminary numbers that employees taking part have improved their compliance,'' said Jill Berger, the vice president for health and welfare at Marriott, which covers 160,000 hotel and resort workers and dependents. 
 Active Health Management, a health data technology unit of the Aetna insurance company, has been helping to identify Marriott workers who are eligible to volunteer for the heart, diabetes or asthma programs.
 Protecting the privacy of employees is an ''enormously important and sensitive issue'' in these programs, said Dr. Lonnie Reisman, Active Health's chief executive. 
 ''We don't share the health plan members' data with physiciansor anyone else, unless a member explicitly gives permission,'' Dr. Reisman said. Only ''if we see something that is a real health issue, we will call the doctor without getting permission,'' he said. 
 Dr. Reisman said his company scans records of millions of drug purchases and refills and other medical claims in search of high-risk patients who are candidates for free drugs and other incentives to get their health priorities in order.
 Perhaps the oldest free drug program was started 10 years ago with diabetes drugs for city workers in Ashville, N.C. Since then the city has added free drugs for asthma, blood pressure, cholesterol problems and depression.
 Patients in the Asheville program agree to meet regularly with pharmacists who advise and encourage them to take their medicine and adopt healthy habits. The program has been emulated by more than 30 employers nationwide.
 Frank Street, 63, a retired employee of the tax collectors office of Polk County in Georgia, said he had been getting six free drugs from the county for diabetes and blood pressure for about two years. 
 ''At one point, my blood pressure was so out of whack that they started monitoring it on a daily basis,'' Mr. Street said. The program's records are managed by Thomson Medstat, a health care information firm.
 Now his blood pressure is ''down to target level,'' and he reports once a month to his doctor and Liz Berndt, the program's pharmacist. 
 Without the county program, his drug co-payments would total $110 a month, Mr. Street said.
 As employers grapple with rising health costs ''and we become more aggressive about cost-shifting to patients,'' said Dr. Reisman, the Active Health executive, ''it will be important to have this kind of safety net.''

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article in some copies yesterday about employer efforts to provide free drugs to workers with chronic medical conditions misidentified the state in which one of the employers, Polk County, is located. It is in Florida, not Georgia.

HEADLINE: In the Land of Flamenco, Civil War's Buried Bones

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Ghosts of SpainTravels Through Spain and Its Silent PastBy Giles TremlettWalker & Company. 386 pages. $26.95.
 Californians learn not to think about the San Andreas fault. Otherwise, who could summon the nerve to walk out the front door? In Spain, an entire nation has learned how not to address a historical fault line that shifted just 70 years ago, setting one half of the country against the other in a murderous furor that paved the way for 30 years of military dictatorship. Spain, the 19th-century writer Angel Ganivet wrote, ''is a cage full of madmen all suffering from the same mania: their inability to put up with one another.'' The Spanish Civil War and Franco's regime seemed to confirm the thesis.
Today, a little more than 30 years after Franco's death, Spain might well be the happiest country in Europe, with a robust democracy, a booming economy, dazzling new architectural trophies and a health-care system that can take credit for Europe's longest-lived citizens. The uneasy secret behind the miraculous shifting of gears known as la Transicion (''the Transition'') is an unspoken pact to let the past alone, what one member of Parliament has called ''forgetting by everyone for everyone.'' 
 Giles Tremlett, Madrid correspondent for The Guardian of London, begins ''Ghosts of Spain,'' his affectionate, deeply informed tour of the country that has been his home for 20 years, by disturbing the dead. The appalling atrocities committed by both sides during the Civil War keep coming to light, for those willing to look, or speak. Bones of the thousands of victims on both sides, hastily buried along roadsides, still turn up, a national shame that few Spaniards wish to address for fear of disturbing a successful consensus. 
 ''One of Europe's most verbose and argumentative peoples has simply chosen to look away from a vital part of its history whose ghastly, ghostly presence is to be found under a few feet of soil,'' Mr. Tremlett writes. 
 Mr. Tremlett's searching examination of the Franco years and their legacy make a somber backdrop for an otherwise cheery tale. Having summoned the ghosts, he moves along to offer a guided tour of modern Spain, making stops at the usual journalistic destinations. The educational system, politics, health care, child rearing and the national character are dealt with in well-organized chapters that move the reader briskly along from the Basque country to Catalonia, from flamenco bars to neon-lighted roadside whorehouses, from the ghastly tourist traps of the Costa del Sol to the Galician clothing factories of Amancio Ortega, Spain's richest and most reclusive tycoon.
 Mr. Tremlett tends to repeat himself, and at times his low-key approach, measured and judicious, threatens to become soporific. Then, without warning, he will succumb to Spanish fever. 
 ''I wanted to find the raw, unadulterated soul of modern flamenco,'' he reports breathlessly. ''I needed to find Seville's live, beating, musical heart.'' 
 These moments are mercifully few. On balance, despite the glaring absence of a map, ''Ghosts of Spain'' provides a highly informative, well-written introduction to post-Franco Spain. Mr. Tremlett's taut recounting of the 2004 train bombings in Madrid makes especially timely reading, with the suspects now on trial.
 The Spanish tendency to mute the past leads Mr. Tremlett to the big mouths and the troublemakers. He paints an admiring portrait of Baltasar Garzon, a crusading if self-infatuated judge who has shined an uncomfortably bright light on government corruption, state-sponsored terrorism aimed at Basque separatists, international drug trafficking and, in a celebrated instance, the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, whom he tried to put on trial for torture and genocide. 
 Another of Mr. Tremlett's heroes is Gotzone Mora, a university lecturer in Bilbao who has spoken out fearlessly against ETA, the violent Basque separatist organization. She travels in a steel-plated car and cannot go out in public without bodyguards. Her position, and that of her hunters, is an anomaly. Mr. Tremlett points out that the Basques have Spain's highest level of disposable household income. The Basque language is commonly spoken by about 15 percent of the population. Meanwhile, in Galicia, 80 percent of the people speak the region's tongue, Galego, yet polls show that only one in 30 favor a separate state. 
 Spain provides Mr. Tremlett with all sorts of paradoxes and quirks to ponder. As an Englishman, he is astounded at the national tendency to cohere, at the drop of a hat, into large groups, especially for mass protests. At school, his children are encouraged first and foremost to integrate into the group. Solitary occupations are considered suspicious. 
 Disease, in Spain, is macabre entertainment. ''The long, complex words of medicine are magical to Spaniards,'' Mr. Tremlett writes. ''Their ability to discuss illness, in a combination of detailed medical jargon and vivid, no-holds-barred descriptions of symptoms -- pustules, bowel movements and genital itches included -- is prodigious.'' 
 Even death has its charms. Mr. Tremlett pays a visit to Madrid's official morgue, where lively crowds pay condolence visits in a setting that resembles an airport, with video monitors directing visitors to the right corpse, and a restaurant-bar on hand for refreshment.
 ''I even have friends who, because of its extended opening hours, have used it for the last drink on an evening out,'' Mr. Tremlett writes. 
 This is a country where 96 percent of young people say they are happy with their families, where pickpockets make it a point to leave family pictures and ID cards untouched when discarding wallets, and where the elderly women in Pedro Almodovar's one-horse hometown lighted votive candles on Oscar night in 2003. 
 Spain has a sunny, go-ahead mood these days that can seem almost American, perhaps because the past has been so dark. The future looks good, as long as the ghosts stay put.

HEADLINE: Japan's Central Bank Votes To Raise Key Lending Rate

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, Feb. 21 

 BODY:
The Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, raised its key benchmark overnight borrowing rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 0.5 percent, on Wednesday, citing signs of an expanding economy. 
 The bank said in a statement that only one of its nine-member policy board opposed the increase. It was the first increase since July when the bank voted to end more than five years of virtually free credit.
The decision followed growth figures last week that showed the economy grew at its fastest pace in three years, though economists said the most important engine of expansion, consumer spending, remains weak. 
 But the bank called the weakness temporary, saying that keeping rates low could actually hamper growth. 
 Central bank officials have been expressing concern that easy money could be fueling twin asset bubbles in the real estate and stock markets, where leading indexes are near seven-year highs.
 After Wednesday's announcement, the yen edged up to 119.72 yen against the dollar, from about 120 yen early in the day.
 The central bank's rate decisions have been under intense scrutiny as a sign of whether the bank will follow the government's line in economic policy, or assert its independence.
 Members of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's administration have at times publicly pressured the bank to adhere to the government's view that higher growth and employment, and thus low interest rates, should be the top priority. 
 While figures released last week showed the strongest growth in three years in the October-December quarter, economists say the benefits are not reaching average Japanese, leading to weak private consumption.
 Japan's $5 trillion economy, the world's second-largest after the United States, has also shown no signs of rising consumer prices, or inflation, which central bankers normally see as an indication for raising rates. In December, a leading consumer price index rose 0.1 percent, in what economists have called another sign that the Japanese are not spending.
 The central bank's governor, Toshihiko Fukui, has repeatedly said that he wants to raise rates, eventually to as high as 1 or 2 percent, to ''normalize'' Japan's monetary policy. The nation's current rock-bottom rates are a product of emergency stimulus measures taken during the stagnant 1990s, which most here now feel Japan has safely put behind it.
 While the low rates have so far failed to kick-start consumer spending, they have led to other worries for the central bank and policy makers. 
 Property prices in Tokyo and some other large cities have risen rapidly in recent years, and the stock market is at an almost seven-year high, leading some to worry that the easy money is fueling twin asset bubbles.

HEADLINE: A History Department Bans Citing Wikipedia As a Research Source

BYLINE: By NOAM COHEN

 BODY:
When half a dozen students in Neil Waters's Japanese history class at Middlebury College asserted on exams that the Jesuits supported the Shimabara Rebellion in 17th-century Japan, he knew something was wrong. The Jesuits were in ''no position to aid a revolution,'' he said; the few of them in Japan were in hiding. 
 He figured out the problem soon enough. The obscure, though incorrect, information was from Wikipedia, the collaborative online encyclopedia, and the students had picked it up cramming for his exam. 
Dr. Waters and other professors in the history department had begun noticing about a year ago that students were citing Wikipedia as a source in their papers. When confronted, many would say that their high school teachers had allowed the practice. 
 But the errors on the Japanese history test last semester were the last straw. At Dr. Waters's urging, the Middlebury history department notified its students this month that Wikipedia could not be cited in papers or exams, and that students could not ''point to Wikipedia or any similar source that may appear in the future to escape the consequences of errors.'' 
 With the move, Middlebury, in Vermont, jumped into a growing debate within journalism, the law and academia over what respect, if any, to give Wikipedia articles, written by hundreds of volunteers and subject to mistakes and sometimes deliberate falsehoods. Wikipedia itself has restricted the editing of some subjects, mostly because of repeated vandalism or disputes over what should be said. 
 Although Middlebury's history department has banned Wikipedia in citations, it has not banned its use. Don Wyatt, the chairman of the department, said a total ban on Wikipedia would have been impractical, not to mention close-minded, because Wikipedia is simply too handy to expect students never to consult it.
 At Middlebury, a discussion about the new policy is scheduled on campus on Monday, with speakers poised to defend and criticize using the site in research.
 Jimmy Wales, the co-founder of Wikipedia and chairman emeritus of its foundation, said of the Middlebury policy, ''I don't consider it as a negative thing at all.'' 
 He continued: ''Basically, they are recommending exactly what we suggested -- students shouldn't be citing encyclopedias. I would hope they wouldn't be citing Encyclopaedia Britannica, either.
 ''If they had put out a statement not to read Wikipedia at all, I would be laughing. They might as well say don't listen to rock 'n' roll either.''
 Indeed, the English-language version of the site had an estimated 38 million users in the United States in December, and can be hard to avoid while on the Internet. Google searches on such diverse subjects as historical figures like Confucius and concepts like torture give the Wikipedia entry the first listing.
 In some colleges, it has become common for professors to assign students to create work that appears on Wikipedia. According to Wikipedia's list of school and university projects, this spring the University of East Anglia in England and Oberlin College in Ohio will have students edit articles on topics being taught in courses on the Middle East and ancient Rome.
 In December 2005, a Columbia professor, Henry Smith, had the graduate students in his seminar create a Japanese bibliography project, posted on Wikipedia, to describe and analyze resources like libraries, reference books and newspapers. With 16 contributors, including the professor, the project comprises dozens of articles, including 13 on different Japanese dictionaries and encyclopedias.
 In evaluations after the class, the students said that creating an encyclopedia taught them discipline in writing and put them in contact with experts who improved their work and whom, in some cases, they were later able to interview.
 ''Most were positive about the experience, especially the training in writing encyclopedia articles, which all of them came to realize is not an easy matter,'' Professor Smith wrote in an e-mail message. ''Many also retained their initial ambivalence about Wikipedia itself.'' 
 The discussion raised by the Middlebury policy has been covered by student newspapers at the University of Pennsylvania and Tufts, among others. The Middlebury Campus, the student weekly, included an opinion article last week by Chandler Koglmeier that accused the history department of introducing ''the beginnings of censorship.'' 
 Other students call the move unnecessary. Keith Williams, a senior majoring in economics, said students ''understand that Wikipedia is not a responsible source, that it hasn't been thoroughly vetted.'' Yet he said, ''I personally use it all the time.''
 Jason Mittell, an assistant professor of American studies and film and media culture at Middlebury, said he planned to take the pro-Wikipedia side in the campus debate. ''The message that is being sent is that ultimately they see it as a threat to traditional knowledge,'' he said. ''I see it as an opportunity. What does that mean for traditional scholarship? Does traditional scholarship lose value?'' 
 For his course ''Media Technology and Cultural Change,'' which began this month, Professor Mittell said he would require his students to create a Wikipedia entry as well as post a video on YouTube, create a podcast and produce a blog for the course. 
 Another Middlebury professor, Thomas Beyer, of the Russian department, said, ''I guess I am not terribly impressed by anyone citing an encyclopedia as a reference point, but I am not against using it as a starting point.'' 
 And yes, back at Wikipedia, the Jesuits are still credited as supporting the Shimabara Rebellion.

If anyone should be excited about the turn of events this week in the long-running struggle for a casino, it is Alan Barrish, a gambling enthusiast and a product of the once-thriving hospitality industry in the Catskills (his father was a headwaiter at Kutsher's Country Club, his mother a waitress).
 But after learning that Gov. Eliot Spitzer had given his support to a $600 million Las Vegas-style casino at Monticello Raceway -- making prospects for gaming in the moribund resort area brighter than they've ever been -- Mr. Barrish, director of a public library here, seemed more skeptical than celebratory. 
''You know how many times we've gone through this?'' he asked. ''Every year they say it's going to happen, and then it doesn't happen. There are mystical forces keeping it away.''
 Indeed, Sullivan County residents have been on an emotional roller coaster for years as plans and the political momentum for casinos have coalesced, then evaporated. The latest letdown came in 2005, when court rulings and disagreements among state lawmakers led to the unraveling of a plan for as many as five casinos. In the end, even a compromise plan for a single casino fell apart.
 While there are still hurdles to overcome, Mr. Spitzer's recent move was a significant step forward for casino gambling in a region that earned its Borscht Belt nickname for the predominantly Jewish clientele that frequented hundreds of hotels that once flourished throughout the Catskill Mountains.
 On Sunday, Governor Spitzer signed a letter agreeing with a federal determination from 2000 that the proposed casino would be positive both for the St. Regis Mohawk tribe that would run it and the residents of surrounding Sullivan County. But the casino still needs final federal approval, and it faces a lawsuit from a number of groups concerned about effects on the environment.
 Many here are eager for the potential jobs that a casino would bring, pointing to the empty storefronts and crumbling hotels that dot these snow-dusted hills 80 miles northwest of New York City.
 ''Maybe people will have some work up here,'' said Karen Petruzzi, who was eating lunch with her husband, Joseph, at the Blue Horizon Diner in downtown Monticello. ''There really isn't anything for the young people if they don't go to college. That's why they leave.''
 David Gordin, 42, a retired Air Force flight engineer, agreed. ''When the hotels went under 25 years ago, it left a vacuum,'' he said. ''There is no industry, no business. So any kind of employment opportunity is welcome.''
 But Mr. Gordin, too, seemed mostly skeptical about the latest development, as if he had listened to the boy who cried wolf a few too many times. ''I've been hearing about casinos since I was a kid,'' he said. ''It's too little too late.''
 Local officials seemed decidedly less jaundiced than many of their constituents. Ray Nargizian, Monticello's village manager, said a new casino would bring as many as 3,000 new jobs and would be a windfall for local governments. Calling it the ''shot in the arm'' that the area needs, he said, ''I happen to think this is going to pass and is going to pass swiftly.'' But more typical was the reaction of Gary Waldman, 56, a lawyer with offices in Monticello who recently returned from visiting a casino in Aruba and will leave on Friday for a casino resort in Biloxi, Miss. ''There always seems to be barriers to progress up here,'' he said. ''While I'd like to see it, I'm not optimistic that it's going to happen.''
 Even if a casino does eventually get built, there is no guarantee that it will be a cure-all for the bedraggled economy, Mr. Waldman said. He cited Atlantic City, where glittering hotels tower near downtrodden neighborhoods. ''If people think that the village of Monticello will be revived because a casino is here, I think they're sadly mistaken,'' he said. ''The casinos are self-contained. They feed you and entertain you. They don't want you out and about.''
 As the wait for casino gambling has stretched from years to decades, the opposition movement in Sullivan County and beyond has strengthened. The lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan last week was brought by the Sullivan County Farm Bureau and the Natural Resources Defense Council, a Washington-based environmental group.
 But even some residents who historically supported casinos say that they have slowly joined the opposition, less out of concern for the environment than for their own personal convenience.
 ''My whole world growing up was the hotel industry, so I was very for it,'' said Mr. Barrish, once a busboy and waiter at Kutsher's, referring to his position in the casino debate. ''But it's not going to make my life any better. It'll make the roads more crowded. I like to play golf, and it'll make the golf courses more crowded. And what's it going to do for the library? Nothing.''
 And although Mr. Barrish and his friends make periodic gambling forays to Turning Stone in Verona, N.Y., and Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, he said he did not particularly relish the idea of a casino in his backyard. ''I like to gamble,'' he said, ''but I like to go away and gamble.''

HEADLINE: Pushing the Industry to Learn How to Count

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
IF the 20th century was known in marketing circles as the advertising century, the 21st may be the advertising measurement century.
 Marketers are increasingly focused on the effectiveness of their pitches, trying to figure out the return on investment for ad spending. That is spurring most of the major media -- along with many large research companies like Arbitron, Nielsen and Taylor Nelson Sofres -- to improve the methods by which they measure audiences.
The ability of newer digital media to provide more precise data has also led traditional media like television, radio, magazines and newspapers to try upgrading the ways they count consumers.
 ''There's a little something called the Internet, something that all other media are trying to get as accountable as,'' said Jon Mandel, chief executive at the NielsenConnect unit of the Nielsen Company in New York, which brings together data from various Nielsen divisions. 
 Take, for instance, the outdoor advertising industry, which has for years been trying to better quantify not only the number of people who pass by posters, billboards and other signs but also the number who notice and remember them. 
 Now, the industry's official auditing organization, the Traffic Audit Bureau, is accelerating plans to deliver improved information to advertisers and agencies. The bureau has set a target date of October 2008 to introduce a comprehensive measurement system for more than 200 markets nationwide.
 ''Sooner is better than later,'' said Joseph C. Philport, president and chief executive at the bureau in New York.
 ''The absence of better numbers has always been a barrier to entry,'' Mr. Philport added, referring to the reluctance of many marketers to increase spending for ads that appear outside the home.
 A recent report from Wachovia Capital Markets about outdoor advertising estimated that introducing the improved measurement system would cost the industry $25 million over the next five years.
 But it has the potential to double, to 4.4 percent, the share of American ad spending devoted to signs, posters and billboards, the report estimated. The Universal McCann media agency said marketers would spend $7.2 billion on outdoor ads this year, compared with $6.7 billion in 2006.
 That growth rate is the second fastest among all media, after the Internet. That reflects the increasing appeal of outdoor advertising -- one of the oldest of the old media -- as advertisers explore tactics that consumers cannot avoid by changing the channel or turning the page.
 ''The out-of-home medium provides a broad-reach platform to showcase our products in a cost-effective way,'' said Mark A. Kaline, global media manager at the Ford Motor Company in Dearborn, Mich.
 The medium should become more attractive as more digital signs become available, Mr. Kaline added. The digital signs, which can be changed continuously, offer ''the ability for marketers to tailor copy to a given market, at a given time of day, to specific market conditions,'' he said.
 Such improvements, however, would require more accurate methods to measure audiences. The current system is based on traffic -- estimating the number of passers-by, with no idea of whether they actually look at a sign or recall the product being peddled.
 It is ''somewhat admittedly a crude system, counting the people who pass our signs,'' said Paul J. Meyer, president and chief operating officer at Clear Channel Outdoor in Phoenix, one of the three largest outdoor-media companies, with CBS and Lamar Advertising.
 ''The industry has been perceived to be slow and overly methodical'' in considering changes, Mr. Meyer added. ''If we could provide good rich demographic data, in a form compatible with what advertisers are accustomed to seeing from other media, they will start spending dollars in our medium or spend more.''
 The Traffic Audit Bureau has hired three research companies -- the GfK Group, the Telmar Group and Transearch -- to compile various kinds of data including traffic counts and travel patterns, and even to track eye movements of people as they pass outdoor signs.
 ''What the research measures is 'eye-dwell,' '' said Erwin Ephron, a principal at Ephron Papazian & Ephron in New York, who is working with the bureau on the project. ''If the eye fixes on it, you've noticed it.''
 ''Like newspapers saying all sales are local, what outdoor has been saying is that you can't avoid that kind of advertising,'' Mr. Ephron added. After someone notices a sign, he said, the rest is a question of how creative the ad is and how relevant the product.
 The growing popularity of digital signs brings a new urgency to the bureau's efforts, Mr. Ephron said, because a sign that can be shared by several advertisers ''lowers the price of entry.'' Advertisers would no longer have to commit to a sign for 30 days, and the effect, he said, would be like the upheaval decades ago when the standard TV commercial ''went from the 60-second spot to the 30.''
 This month, the Mediamark Research unit of GfK began conducting 4,200 traffic surveys for the bureau in five major markets: Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Philadelphia and San Francisco. Plans call for Mediamark to conduct 45,000 additional surveys in a total of 15 large cities, Mr. Philport said.
 The bureau intends to brief media and agency executives about its progress at a meeting in New York scheduled for March 27, he added. 
 As the bureau moves forward, so, too, does Nielsen, which in 2005 announced that Nielsen Outdoor intended to improve the data it reported about outdoor ads. The Nielsen efforts are centered on a global positioning system it calls Npod, while the bureau is using various methods that include diaries.
 Nielsen released data from its first market, Chicago, in December 2005. Information from the second market, Los Angeles, is to come out in late spring, said Lorraine V. Hadfield, managing director for international audience measurement at Nielsen, and the company is ''targeting a roll-out to the top 10 markets in the U.S., where the most interest is from potential subscribers.''
 Ms. Hadfield added that Nielsen intended to brief agencies and advertisers about its plans at the 2007 media conference and trade show of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, scheduled for next week in Las Vegas. 
 There is some elbows-out competition, reminiscent of the cola wars, between Nielsen and the bureau over their dueling measurement systems. 
 As Mr. Mandel of Nielsen put it, laughing, ''Let the games begin.''
 Nielsen plans to sell its data; the bureau's would be free to members. Nielsen was considered -- but not hired -- by the bureau to help produce its new measurement system. And Mr. Philport, the bureau's chief, formerly worked for Nielsen.
 As for competing sets of figures, ''it depends on how cost-effective each application is,'' Mr. Kaline of Ford Motor said. ''The industry will address that issue.''

HEADLINE: Doubling of Japan's Benchmark Interest Rate Isn't Expected to Stem Outflow of Yen

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 21 

 BODY:
Wednesday's rate increase by the Japanese central bank doubled short-term borrowing costs, but it hardly seems enough to interrupt the huge flow of cheap yen out of Japan that now helps prop up global markets, economists said.
 The flow, known as the yen carry trade, is the product of the yawning gap between Japan's rock-bottom interest rates -- at 0.5 percent with Wednesday's rise in the benchmark overnight funds rate -- and the much higher rates in other countries.
The gap has driven Japanese to pour money overseas in search of higher returns. Some of the money also comes from foreign investors, who borrow cheaply in Japan to invest in real estate and other markets abroad. Even home buyers around the world are borrowing yen. 
 As this flow of money -- potentially uncertain and volatile -- out of Japan has grown, so has the fear that something could disrupt it. For now, though, economists said that Wednesday's rate increase by the Bank of Japan is a baby step toward closing the gap with Europe and the United States, where the benchmark rate is 5.25 percent. 
 ''This isn't much different from 0.25 percent,'' the bank's previous benchmark rate, said Masaaki Kanno, an economist for JPMorgan Securities. ''The Bank of Japan must raise rates much higher to trigger an unwinding of the carry trade.''
 Economists say this trade has made Japan a source of low-cost capital, pumping money into everything from Wall Street stocks to real estate in South Korea, India and even Eastern Europe. Economists say the risk is that global markets could suffer steep sell-offs, hurting home buyers in Seoul and Bucharest, as well as 401(k) holders in New York, if the trade suddenly dried up -- or worse, if Japanese investors started pulling back their money. 
 This has led some economists to begin calling the carry trade a bubble, financed by cheap Japanese credit, that is just waiting to burst. 
 The huge outflows have also driven down the yen as carry-trade investors sell it to buy dollars and euros to invest overseas. This has helped make the yen one of the weakest major currencies, sending it last month to a four-year low of 122.19 yen to the dollar.
 In a sign that the rate increase would not slow the carry trade, the yen dropped after the bank's decision, going to 120.62 yen Wednesday in Tokyo from 120.22 yen in New York on Tuesday. The yen later closed at 120.88 in New York on Wednesday. Mr. Kanno and other economists estimated that the value would keep falling to as low as 125 yen by year's end.
 Yet, despite the carry trade's importance, no one knows for sure how large it really is. Mr. Kanno estimates that about 7 trillion yen, or about $58.39 billion, flowed overseas last year alone. 
 Another way to measure the trade is by the amount of assets now held overseas by all those involved in the trade since it began in 1999, when the Bank of Japan first cut rates to near zero. Mr. Kanno estimates those holdings are worth about 40 trillion yen, or around $330 billion. 
 However, economists say, the Bank of Japan is unlikely to prick the trade bubble anytime soon. To do that, it would have to raise rates enough to make the trade no longer profitable. Economists say that would require ratcheting the benchmark rate to more than 1 percent or even 2 percent. 
 Economists say additional rate increases are unlikely, at least in the near future. Japan's economy is showing no signs of inflation, which would normally prompt a tightening. Moreover, most economists forecast sluggish growth rates this year of no more than 2 percent or so in Japan's overall economy. Japan's economy grew by 2.2 percent in 2006. 
 ''It would be difficult for the Bank of Japan to justify any follow-up rate hikes,'' said Hiromichi Shirakawa, a Tokyo-based economist for Credit Suisse Securities. ''I think their hands are tied in this regard until at least the end of this year.''
 The bank's governor, Toshihiko Fukui, has said that he wants to raise rates, eventually to at least 1 percent, to take the bank out of the super-loose monetary policy adopted during Japan's stagnant 1990s. Mr. Fukui faces a delicate balancing act: he aims to temper the risks from an expanding carry trade bubble against choking fragile economic growth. In addition, he needs to manage the possibility of inflation. 
 He is also under intense political pressure from the administration of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Though the central bank is aware of the economic risks of its interest rate policy decisions, the Abe administration has sent a clear message that it wants the bank to keep borrowing costs low to avoid snuffing out growth altogether. 
 Speaking to reporters after the rate increase, Mr. Abe called the decision ''appropriate'' but also warned that the bank should take responsibility for any consequences. 
 At a news conference, Mr. Fukui played down concerns that the bank was tightening too quickly, saying ''adjustments will be made slowly.'' He said that the bank decided to act because it expected Japan's $5 trillion economy to ''continue expanding moderately'' and consumer prices to stay flat only temporarily.
 Mr. Fukui also said the carry trade was not a factor in Wednesday's decision, though he said it could eventually have a negative effect on the economy and prices. He did not elaborate.
 So far, Japanese central bankers and lawmakers have taken a hands-off attitude toward the carry trade. This may partly be because the weaker yen has proved politically popular here. 
 A declining yen adds to the earnings of exporters, increases the value of overseas investments by individual Japanese and even enriches the Ministry of Finance, which holds some $800 billion worth of foreign bonds as part of the nation's foreign currency reserve.
 Policy makers also seem aware that the carry trade is mostly driven by Japanese individuals trying to improve the return on their savings. Mr. Kanno of JPMorgan estimates that these individuals' holdings overseas have grown to about 30 trillion yen since 1999, making up about three-quarters of all carry-trade-related investments. Most of the rest is held by foreign investors, he said.
 This makes it hard for the bank to move against the trade, economists said. Rather, they say, the biggest risk is a shock from abroad.
 ''My sense is that the B.O.J. won't pull the trigger on the yen-carry trade,'' said Mr. Shirakawa of Credit Suisse, referring to the Bank of Japan. ''The trigger will come from outside Japan.''

HEADLINE: For Some Developing Countries, America's Popular Culture Is Resistible

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University and co-author of a blog at www.marginalrevolution.com.

 BODY:
American movies and music have done very well in some countries like Sweden and less well in others like India. This may sound like a simple difference in human tastes, but decisions to consume culture have an economic aspect. 
 Loyalties to cultural goods and services -- be it heavy metal music or the opera -- are about social networking and choosing an identity and an aspiration. That is, we use culture to connect with other people and to define ourselves; both are, to some extent, economic decisions. The continuing and indeed growing relevance of local economic connections suggests that cultural imperialism will not prove to be the dominant trend.
Local culture commands loyalty when people are involved in networks of status and caste, and they pursue religious and communal markers of identity. Those individuals use local cultural products to signal their place in hierarchies. 
 An Indian Muslim might listen to religious Qawwali music to set himself apart from local Hindus, or a native of Calcutta might favor songs from Bengali cinema. The Indian music market is 96 percent domestic in origin, in part because India is such a large and multifaceted society. Omar Lizardo, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Notre Dame, explains this logic in his recent paper ''Globalization and Culture: A Sociological Perspective.'' 
 Today, economic growth is booming in countries where American popular culture does not dominate, namely India and China. Population growth is strong in many Islamic countries, which typically prefer local music and get their news from sources like the satellite broadcaster Al Jazeera.
 The combination of these trends means that American entertainment, for largely economic reasons, will lose relative standing in the global marketplace. In fact, Western culture often creates its own rivals by bringing creative technologies like the recording studio or the printing press to foreign lands.
 American popular culture tends to be popular when people interact with others from around the world and seek markers of global identity. My stepdaughter spent last summer studying French in Nice, with students from many other countries. They ate and hung out at McDonald's, a name and symbol they all share, even though it was not everyone's favorite meal. 
 Globalization is most likely to damage local culture in regions like Scandinavia that are lightly populated, not very hierarchical and looking for new global cultural symbols. But the rest of the world's population is in countries -- China and India, of course, but also Brazil, Mexico, Egypt and Indonesia -- that do not fit that description. 
 ''American'' cultural products rely increasing on non-American talent and international symbols and settings. ''Babel,'' which won this year's Golden Globe for best drama, has a Mexican director, and is set in Morocco, Japan and Mexico, mostly with non-English dialogue.
 Hollywood movies are popular in Europe in part because of the successes of European welfare states and of European economic integration. Western Europe has become more equal in its treatment of citizens, it has moved away from an aristocratic class society, and it has strong global connections. All those factors favor an interest in American and global popular culture; Hollywood movies often capture 70 percent or more of a typical European cinematic market. Social democracy, which the Europeans often hold up in opposition to the American model, in fact aided this cultural invasion by making Europe more egalitarian. 
 Many smaller countries have been less welcoming of cultural imports. It is common in Central America for domestically produced music to command up to 70 percent of market share. In Ghana, domestic music has captured 71 percent of the market, according to Unesco figures. Critics of cultural imperialism charge that rich cultures dominate poor ones. But the data supplied by Professor Lizardo show that the poorer a country, the more likely it will buy and listen to its own domestic music. This makes sense given that music is a form of social networking and the relevant networks are primarily local. 
 That said, the poorest countries don't produce many of the films they watch. Making a movie costs much more than cutting an album. So as the world becomes richer, the relative market share of Hollywood movies will probably fall more than the relative market share of American popular music. Furthermore, moviegoers are starting to look to Bollywood films, or other Asian productions, rather than Hollywood, for their markers of global identity. 
 The complaint of ''cultural imperialism'' is looking increasingly implausible. As I argued in ''Creative Destruction: How Globalization Is Changing the World's Cultures,'' the funk of James Brown helped shape the music of West Africa; Indian authors draw upon Charles Dickens; and Arabic pop is centered in France and Belgium. Western cultural exports are as likely to refresh foreign art forms as to destroy them. Western technologies -- from the metal carving knife to acrylic paint to digital filmmaking -- have spurred creativity worldwide. 
 Culture is not a zero-sum game, so the greater reach of one culture does not necessarily mean diminished stature for others. In the broad sweep of history, many different traditions have grown together and flourished. American popular culture will continue to make money, but the 21st century will bring a broad melange of influences, with no clear world cultural leader.

HEADLINE: Plans to Make Quick Profits on Modest Homes Falter

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY and VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
It was a simple pitch: Investors would put little to no money down and take out construction loans that a developer would use to build modest homes in a fast-growing stretch of Southwest Florida. When finished, the homes would be flipped for tidy profits of $30,000 to $40,000 apiece.
 Too simple, perhaps.
Nearly two years since the developer started marketing the investment plan nationwide, work on the homes has come to a halt, leaving 482 investors with half-built houses and thousands of dollars in construction liens. Coast Financial Holdings, which owns the bank that made the loans, has disclosed that $110 million, or a fifth of its total loan portfolio, could be troubled. Its shares have fallen 46.5 percent so far this year, and banking regulators are investigating. 
 ''It was strictly a passive investment,'' said Paul Matera, a retired contractor from West Islip, N.Y., who signed up for two houses and introduced dozens of others to the plan.
 ''You didn't pick out the model of the house. You didn't pick out the exact location. Everybody signed papers without reading what they were signing.''
 During the housing boom that ended in 2005, money poured into real estate from investors ranging from the ultrarich to middle-class professionals like doctors, teachers and midlevel managers. Places like Florida, the Southwest and the West Coast were the biggest recipients of the investment wave because housing there was often deemed a sure bet.
 The case of a relatively small development in Southwest Florida illustrates the important role that real estate investors played. Like the day traders who drove up Internet stocks in the late 1990s, these investors, aided by cheap mortgages, helped drive a housing boom over the edge.
 ''It was a groundswell,'' said Jerry Manning, who runs J. J. Manning Auctioneers, which sells homes in the Northeast and in South Florida. ''Everybody thought that they were going to be a real estate mogul.''
 Last year, however, a number of such plans started failing, causing pain to a large food-chain of investors, builders and lenders. Beyond their inherently speculative nature, many of the investments were never fully investigated and were poorly monitored. And now some lenders and investors are starting to wake up to a harsh day-after reality. 
 ''You will have a correction, and the correction will make regional homeowners unhappy'' as property prices fall, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Investors Service. ''Regional mortgage bankers will find their livelihoods threatened.''
 So far, the slumping housing market has not claimed a major casualty, though lenders to people with weak credit have started shutting down and regional builders in formerly hot markets are hurting.
 Transeastern Homes, which builds homes in Florida, is in settlement talks with lenders who contend it is in default on debt totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. WCI Communities, which builds condominiums in Florida and in other areas, recently hired Goldman Sachs to advise it on strategic options, including a possible sale of the company.
 ''We're going to see much bigger builders and much bigger lenders facing bankruptcy because so much of the building has been on a speculative basis,'' said Jack McCabe, a real estate consultant in Deerfield Beach, Fla. 
 Mr. Matera, the retired contractor, learned about the chance to invest after a limousine driver, taking him to the airport for a Caribbean vacation, mentioned that his boss owned a part of a real estate company, Seashore Resorts in South Carolina, that helped people buy investment properties.
 Mr. Matera did not blindly jump in. He said he visited Seashore and even hired a private investigator to look into the company. Later, he visited lots where the homes were to be built in the Florida towns of North Port and Rotonda.
 The paved roads and empty lots reminded him of the affordable homes of Levittown that decades ago transformed Long Island into the suburban expanse it is today. Mr. Matera invested $12,000 in two homes. And his pitch to others persuaded 40 members of the Long Island Real Estate Investors Association and a half-dozen relatives and neighbors to invest similar amounts.
 Mr. Matera acknowledges receiving a $500 fee for each client he referred to Seashore, but insists he did not pressure anyone. ''I solicited no one,'' he said. ''People came to me. I'm not a salesman.''
 Now, Mr. Matera is paying $4,800 a month on four properties near Sarasota that he cannot sell and that do not collect enough in rent to cover their costs. Two properties, which are complete, are under his name and have tenants. His mother-in-law and his sister each own one of the two incomplete homes that cannot be finished because they have liens.
 All together, about 100 of the nearly 500 investors are from the New York area, according to lawyers who are representing many buyers. Seashore recruited most of them through marketing materials it circulated through networks of friends and family members. 
 Seashore steered borrowers toward loans that start out as construction debt and convert into traditional mortgages when the house is built. ''I've got my father stuck, my brother stuck, an ex-wife stuck,'' said Carl Cirinelli, a partner at Seashore who previously lived in New Jersey. He says that he recruited 25 relatives and friends and has a $200,000 loan under his name.
 Few had to be convinced. Several investors said they saw little downside to investing in Florida real estate, especially with an experienced builder. The area south of St. Petersburg where they were investing was promising because prices were relatively affordable and rising.
 Residential building permits issued in Charlotte, Sarasota and Pinellas Counties, where all of the homes are located, doubled from 2000 to 2005 before falling significantly in 2006, according to data from the Census Bureau. 
 Jesse Battle III, who heads the developer, Construction Compliance of St. Petersburg, was a charismatic figure with experience in single-family homes. One contractor who worked for the company noted it had moved aggressively and had paid its bills on time, at least for a while. 
 ''I had a great relationship with them, and I got paid well,'' Fernando Cacoilo, the contractor, said. He recently fired 23 of his 32 workers because of the souring real estate market and because he has been unable to collect $1 million from Construction Compliance.
 Mr. Cacoilo, whose firm Jodfer Land Services is based in Sarasota, acknowledged that he had missed some obvious red flags, including the fact that none of the people having homes built ever checked on the progress.
 The problems with the projects did not become apparent until the end of 2006, when contractors who had not been paid for months started imposing liens against the homes, and when Coast Bank of Florida, the bank owned by Coast Financial, started asking the borrowers to make interest payments that had previously been paid from the loan balances. 
 On Jan. 24, Mr. Battle sent a letter to investors saying his company was facing ''great financial challenges'' because of a falling real estate market and lenders were no longer willing to provide financing. The letter held out hope that the company would be able to pull through.
 In an interview earlier this month with The St. Petersburg Times, he said Coast Bank prevented him from withdrawing the cash to finish work on 70 homes. 
 Mr. Battle did not return calls seeking comment for this article.
 An adviser, Tramm Hudson, hired by the board of Coast Financial to speak on its behalf, saidthe bank had never lent directly to Mr. Battle, who was allowed to withdraw money from the investors' accounts in accordance with schedules they had signed. He said a law firm hired by the bank is conducting an investigation. 
 Tension between the bank and the borrowers has been running high, with the two sides accusing each other of lax oversight. Some investors contend that Coast did not honor its fiduciary duty to verify that Construction Compliance was finishing work and paying contractors when it withdrew money from their accounts. Mr. Hudson denies that allegation and said the bank had used an independent inspector.
 Mr. Hudson said the bank would hold investors responsible for the loans and has asked them to declare whether they intend to complete construction, leave their properties undeveloped or sell them.
 But Alan Tannenbaum, a lawyer based in Sarasota who represents about 100 investors, said it was wrong to blame the investors because they did not fully understand loan documents and other paperwork they signed.
 Coast, which was founded in 2000 and went public in 2003, has had financial problems almost since its inception. It has lost money in all but one of the five years from 2001 to 2005. Brian Peters, who was the bank's chief executive when it started making the 482 loans, resigned in July after two years in that job because of what he and board members described as ''personality differences.''
 Mr. Hudson said the bank has dismissed two employees, a married couple, Philip W. Coon and Melissa Coon, who were closely involved in making the 482 loans. The Coons did not return a phone call.
 Investors who signed on to buy the homes say the experience has been a painful reminder that real estate can be risky, but they insisted that the rewards can be great, too.
 Alan and Linda Ellman, who live in Plainview, N.Y., put a $12,000 deposit on a $300,000 home in the spring of 2005 after hearing about the offer from Mr. Matera at the investment club. Given their previous successful experience with investment properties, Mr. Ellman estimated that he would be able to sell the home for a $40,000 profit. ''Nobody twisted our arms,'' he said.
 Instead, the home now has liens totaling $17,000 from landscapers, painters, insulation companies and cabinet makers. They still have not seen the house, but a real estate broker there reports that the driveway is unpaved and the swimming pool is an empty shell.
 In spite of the problems, Mr. Matera, for one, believes that real estate is a safer investment than stocks. ''I would rather have a house that I can't sell at the moment than a stock certificate,'' he said. ''I still have a house. It's not what an owner of Enron stock can say.''

HEADLINE: The Magic Is in the Tweaking

BYLINE: By ANNE FIELD

 BODY:
About five years ago, Sarah Lurie, a personal trainer in La Jolla, Calif., learned about a demanding form of exercise she had never tried before. A longtime staple of the Russian military, the workout used something called kettlebells, cast-iron weights which Ms. Lurie describes as ''cannon balls with a handle.''
 In short order, Ms. Lurie said, she became much stronger, without building up muscles that were too bulky. That is when it occurred to her, ''Why not start my own gym, focused on teaching customers how to use the equipment?'' She decided to call it Iron Core Kettlebell Strength and Conditioning, which she opened for business in October 2004. 
The response, according to Ms. Lurie, was exceedingly underwhelming. Clients trickled in to try out the new workout, but seldom returned. After six months, with sales at a standstill, Ms. Lurie knew she had to try something else -- and fast. 
 Ms. Lurie's experience is far from unusual. Entrepreneurs are stubborn souls, not easily discouraged by something like initial failure. And, while there are no exact figures, according to small-business specialists, it is quite common for a founder to stumble at first, only to find a way to bounce back soon after.
 ''Many entrepreneurs learn as they go along,'' said Phyllis Ezop, president of Ezop & Associates, a strategy consulting firm in La Grange Park, Ill. ''With each lesson, they find out a little more about what new direction to take.''
 In Ms. Lurie's case, she started calling patrons when they failed to return, to find out what was turning them off.
 The problem wasn't the kettlebells, it was how she was approaching the public. Her brochures, her Web site, even the instructions used in class, all relied on what Ms. Lurie calls ''brutal strength-type language,'' and were simply too intimidating for most customers. 
 So, she revamped everything: the promotional material and the Web site to emphasize the workout's fat-burning effectiveness and other more conventional benefits. Business picked up. 
 Sales have not only tripled, but there is a waiting list of people for most of her classes. She has also sold 5,000 instructional DVDs, is moving into a 4,000-square-foot gym, three times the size of her original one, and is in the process of franchising the business. 
 While Ms. Lurie found the answer in marketing, other companies reach success by discovering different uses for their original technology, changing their sales philosophy or repositioning a product, among other tacks. ''There are many different types of reinvention,'' Ms. Ezop said.
 Consider AdvancedMD in Salt Lake City, which opened in 1999 to sell Web-based practice-management software for doctor's offices. After three years of flat sales, the company's investors brought in a new chief executive, Jim Pack, to turn things around. After studying the situation, Mr. Pack pinpointed what seemed to be the culprit, the sales system. 
 ''The philosophy was, all we have to do is let doctors see our product and they're going to want to switch,'' he said. As a result, sales representatives spent most of their time cold-calling and making door-to-door sales visits, with little success.
 What was needed, Mr. Pack determined, was a complete sales overhaul. As long as doctors were satisfied with their software, they weren't likely to change. The only way to make a sale, then, was to find offices that were looking for something else. Mr. Pack pulled the plug on cold-calling and started putting more effort into search optimization and Web-based advertising. Leads soon jumped to 600 a month from 40.
 What's more, with fewer face-to-face sales calls, he was able to cut costs in half. Three years later, the company has 120 employees and revenue has soared. 
 For StillSecure, the solution came from taking one element of the company's original technology and turning that into the main product. The company in Superior, Colo., was formed in 2002 to provide customers with a way to manage software applications distributed via the Internet. But, when the Internet bubble burst, many potential clients pulled away. It only became worse in the economic downturn after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
 ''We realized that it didn't make any sense going forward with our old business model,'' said Alan Shimel, co-founder and chief strategy officer. After further research, however, they discovered that clients were especially interested in the security applications -- systems for intrusion prevention and analyzing areas of potential vulnerability -- that were part of the initial product. 
 So they decided to focus entirely on those applications, transforming the company into an Internet security business. The firm introduced the first product in April 2002. With a total of three products on the market and around 100 employees, sales are now ''more than $5 million,'' Mr. Shimel said, and, from 2002 to 2004, grew about 2,000 percent.
 How do small businesses figure out just what their next steps should be? Some companies, like StillSecure that have considerable venture backing, can take advantage of help from their backers. The company's two investors, Mobius Venture Capital in Palo Alto, Calif., and the 3i Group in London, which had put in about $21 million, introduced executives to specialists in the security market. Also, the firms allowed StillSecure to interview other businesses in their portfolio, for further research. 
 Even so, StillSecure, as Ms. Lurie did, also turned to existing customers for inspiration. Indeed, it was during talks with a few clients that Mr. Shimel learned that their primary attraction was the security elements in the original technology. 
 Other people tapped the insights of distributors and other important players in their market. When Michael Sands helped found LesserEvil Brand Snack Company in March 2004, at the top of the low-carb fad, he expected his specially designed popcorn to be an instant hit. 
 Unfortunately, by the time he was ready to introduce the product on the market, the fad had fizzled. But, after discussions with distributors, brokers and retailers, he learned that a similar product promoted as ''all natural'' would probably have a better reception. So, he redid the product using a new sweetener, revamped the packaging and introduced a new popcorn called All Natural Kettle Corn in 2005. 
 Last year, his company introduced a second product, a reduced-fat potato stick. 
 ''Like any good entrepreneur, we knew how to admit when we'd made a mistake and how to adapt quickly to the market,'' Mr. Sands said. ''And we never thought about closing up shop.''

HEADLINE: Home Lenders Hit by Higher Default Rates

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
The toll is mounting for lenders that operate in the riskiest, and until recently, the fastest-growing, segment of the mortgage business.
 Shares of NovaStar Financial, which makes loans to people with weak credit, fell almost 43 percent yesterday after the company announced a surprise loss of $14.4 million for the fourth quarter and told investors that it might not make enough money to pay dividends for the next four years.
The announcement, which highlighted the fact that more home loans made last year were delinquent than mortgages from 2005 and earlier, echoed reports issued earlier this month by New Century Financial and HSBC Finance, the American mortgage division of the global banking giant.
 Though each lender is suffering from a variety of individual ills, rising default rates among loans made to people with spotty, or subprime, credit appear to be the central problem for the industry. 
 A major indicator of the trouble in the subprime market is the early-payment default rate, which measures the portion of borrowers who fall behind on their house payments within the first few months of taking a loan.
 Rising default rates and the related financial troubles of mortgage companies could hurt a broad segment of the American housing market. Among them will be the largely poor and minority home buyers who will see interest rates on adjustable mortgages rise, as well as investors in mortgage-backed securities who poured billions of dollars into these loans.
 The default rate jumped for loans made in 2006, as lenders allowed more borrowers to take out loans without documenting their incomes or making a down payment. Also, analysts note, homeowners who encountered financial problems had a tougher time refinancing or selling their properties because home prices were no longer rising in many parts of the country.
 ''When there is good home price appreciation, you can get away with a lot of mistakes,'' said Zach Gast, an analyst with the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, a forensics accounting firm in Washington that has been studying the subprime market. ''But home price appreciation has stopped.''
 Subprime lenders were particularly susceptible to the change in the housing market, because they dealt with borrowers who often stretched financially to buy homes; more than half, for instance, took out adjustable mortgages. Many subprime lenders were not obligated to follow the tougher regulations that apply to commercial banks. 
 In a conference call after the market close on Tuesday, executives at NovaStar attributed the company's problems to a swiftly deteriorating housing market. The company, which is based in Kansas City, Mo., promised to tighten its guidelines and limit the number of exceptions to those rules.
 The company also said it would most likely not earn any taxable income for the next four years, though it did expect to have a positive net income. That is significant, because to maintain a favorable tax status as a real estate investment trust, NovaStar has to distribute at least 90 percent of its taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends.
 Still, executives tried to focus on the positive and said NovaStar had enough cash on hand to weather its current problems. They also noted that as more mortgage companies encountered problems, NovaStar could face less competition. 
 ''The question that management is looking at right now is, is it in shareholders' best interest to remain a REIT?'' asked Scott Hartman, the company's chief executive.
 Some of its investors were a bit less sanguine than that.
 The company's biggest shareholder, Dreman Value Management of Jersey City, has been trying to liquidate its 5.8 percent stake in NovaStar, portfolio managers at the investment company said yesterday. 
 Mark J. Roach, a portfolio manager at Dreman, said his fund made a good return on shares of NovaStar in 2005 but has been cutting back its exposure since. He said it now made up only 0.3 percent of the small-cap fund he manages, down from 2.5 percent in 2005.
 David N. Dreman, the chairman and chief investment officer of the fund company, said he has grown increasingly worried about subprime lenders, but was surprised by the extent of NovaStar's problems. ''There was no indication prior to this that they were going to have a problem,'' he said.
 Some analysts and investors say the problems at NovaStar and other subprime lenders have been evident for some weeks and months. 
 In late January, NovaStar posted the performance of the mortgages it securitized and sold to investors on its Web site. Investors who had been paying attention would have noted that the delinquency rate for loans made in 2006 had jumped to 7 percent from 2 percent in 2005, Mr. Gast of the Center for Financial Research and Analysis said.
 ''They securitize nearly all their loans, so their performance shouldn't have surprised anybody,'' Mr. Gast said. He attributes the rise in delinquencies to the stall in home prices in 2006.
 NovaStar has also been a favorite among short sellers, investors who make money by betting that a price of a stock will fall. Short interest in the company's shares made up about a third of its total shares outstanding last month.
 ''When we initially shorted the stock, it was obvious that there was going to be some distress here,'' said Whitney Tilson, who heads the hedge fund firm T2 Partners and who took a small short position in the stock in the last couple of weeks. ''But when a company announces that they're not going to have taxable income for four years, that's amazing.'' 
 NovaStar Financial was founded in 1996 by Mr. Hartman, the chief executive, and Lance Anderson, the president, who had worked together at a mortgage banking REIT now known as Dynex Capital, in Richmond, Va.
 NovaStar's obituary was nearly written in the late 1990s, when the ripple effect from the Russian debt crisis and the bailout of hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management crushed all assets that were viewed as risky from a credit standpoint. Facing margin calls from Wall Street broker-dealers as the value of its collateral fell, NovaStar stopped paying investors dividends in late 1998 and struggled with losses and liquidity for months afterward.
 Yet as the subprime market heated up during a long housing boom and the company resumed -- and then increased -- its dividend payouts, NovaStar found itself at the center of a battle between investors who owned its stock and loved its huge dividend payments and hedge funds who sold its stock short.
 Over the years, the funds challenged everything from NovaStar's complicated accounting practices to its use of complex derivatives and whether it had the regulatory licenses to operate in various states.
 In a conference call in early 2005, NovaStar's management, who thought the call was over and were unaware there were still listeners on the line, praised the head of investor relations for screening callers who might have asked unwelcome questions. One executive overheard on the phone used an obscenity to ridicule a questioner who asked whether the company's dividend guidance was inflated.
 Still, the company had a strong following among investors who were drawn to its high dividend yield, which at $5.60 a share in 2006 was among the highest of real estate investment trusts. One passionate supporter of NovaStar who has acknowledged using a fake name, ''Bob O'Brien,'' went so far as to start a Web site, www.nfi-info.net, to rebut negative reports on the company.
 Yesterday, in what he described as ''probably my last writing here,'' the investor had this to say on the site: ''I am shell shocked after the conference that took place yesterday, and quite annoyed that I participated in the collective hallucination that led so many into such a disaster.''

HEADLINE: Hospital Group Offers Plan on Health Coverage for All

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Joining the national debate over the 47 million people without health insurance, a group of the largest commercial hospital chains plans to propose today that individuals be required to have basic health coverage. 
 The proposal, which the hospital group hopes might eventually find its way into federal legislation, would require individuals to take coverage through employers, when health benefits are offered; purchase it on their own; or if they are eligible, to receive it through existing government programs.
The group, the Federation of American Hospitals, said that the plan would add $115.2 billion a year to the $900 billion that federal and state agencies currently spend on health care. It does not indicate where the additional money would come from, raising immediate questions about the political viability of the plan. 
 The proposal for addressing the uninsured takes its place alongside others made in recent weeks by California's Republican governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger; former Senator John Edwards, the Democratic presidential aspirant; various business groups; and members of Congress. 
 But hospitals have a particularly big stake in the issue. Together, the nation's commercial and nonprofit hospitals strain under the burden of $40 billion a year in unpaid bills, most of them generated by people without insurance.
 ''We, in essence, have become the insurers of the uninsured,'' said Victor L. Campbell, the association's chairman and a senior vice president of HCA, the nation's largest hospital chain.
 The plan calls for expanding eligibility for the current Medicaid and state children's health insurance programs for lower-income people. Subsidies based on income would be available to uninsured workers who have access to an employer plan but have not signed up because of the cost. 
 Individuals purchasing coverage on their own would also be subsidized, according to income, and they could deduct insurance costs from income taxes as employers do now. 
 Expanding the children's programs, which are up for renewal by Congress later this year, has wide bipartisan support, health policy experts say. 
 But the potential price tags vary, ranging from President Bush's relatively modest proposal to spend $5 billion more over five years, to a $60 billion proposal last week by a bipartisan group of senior House members, including Rahm Emanuel, Democrat of Illinois, and two Republicans, Jim Ramstad of Minnesota and Ray LaHood of Illinois.
 Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Federation of American Hospitals, said his group's proposal was meant to influence the growing national debate on changing the insurance system. The hope is to enact legislation, he said, but not until after the 2008 election.
 The proposal is intended to build on the existing employer-based plans that cover 160 million people; on Medicare, which covers 36 million older or disabled people; and on Medicaid and children's programs, which cover an additional 35.9 million. 
 Mr. Kahn, who goes by the nickname Chip, is a longtime strategist in Washington health care debates. During the first Clinton administration he was the head of the insurance lobbying group that sponsored the provocative ''Harry and Louise'' television advertisements that helped derail Hillary Rodham Clinton's plan to overhaul the health insurance system. 
 ''The main lesson of 1993 and 1994,'' Mr. Kahn said, ''is don't disturb what people already have.'' 
 The hospital group recently surveyed 1,200 registered voters with 86 percent ''demanding action by the president and Congress to address coverage for the uninsured'' before the next election, according to Mr. Kahn.
 Linda A. DiVall, a Republican pollster who supervised the survey, said that politicians could face ''consequences'' at election time if they ignored the poll results. 
 Mr. Campbell of HCA said the company's chain of 173 hospitals treated more than one million uninsured people in its emergency rooms last year at an estimated cost of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. One in five emergency room patients was uninsured.
 ''Unless this issue is addressed, hospitals won't be able to provide the services and care they need to provide,'' he said. 
 Under state laws, hospitals are required to treat patients in emergencies. 
 People without insurance often delay seeking care until an illness becomes unbearable and expensive to treat. 
 Although the association represents only about 17 percent of all American hospitals, its influence is ''much larger because of Chip's Washington savvy and sophistication,'' said Len Nichols, a health economist at the New America Foundation, a policy research group in Washington.
 Mr. Nichols was a senior adviser on the losing side in the 1990s Clinton battle. More recently, he helped draft a health reform proposal by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, which would end most employer-based coverage and replace it with a government-regulated system. 
 Mr. Kahn ''is trying to cover everyone without rocking any boats,'' Mr. Nichols said. ''He's not going so far as to get into a fight'' with the insurance industry.
 Mr. Nichols pointed to an outpouring of recent health reform proposals, some of them involving unlikely partners, like the big nonunion retailer Wal-Mart and the Service Workers International Union. 
 ''In the last six weeks, there has been more movement on the cover-everyone front than any time since Mrs. Clinton's 1990s proposal,'' Mr. Nichols said.
 Joseph Antos, a pro-market health policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, agreed that there was ''a consensus building that we need to do something about health insurance in this country.''
 But, he said, ''the consensus tends to break down when you get down to the who pays for it and what do we have to rearrange in the system and how feasible it is.'' 
 ''The one thing that has to be done without fail,'' he said, ''is to resolve the debate over how big an expansion'' should be made in the state children's health program. On that issue, he said, ''you can see a deal coming.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Price Gauges Rise More Than Expected

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve may expect more subdued inflation this year, but a small jump in consumer prices last month served as a reminder that those expectations are still far from being fulfilled. 
 As a result, analysts said, the Fed may yet find itself raising interest rates. Any cuts, it seems, will have to wait.
Prices accelerated last month on a wide variety of goods and services, from fresh fruit to hotel rooms to the cost of a hospital stay, the Labor Department reported yesterday. The overall rate of inflation climbed 0.2 percent in January after a rise of 0.4 percent in December. 
 Though inflation growth, as represented by the Consumer Price Index, slowed from December, it advanced faster than economists and Wall Street investors had expected. The rate of core inflation, a gauge that does not include food and energy and is closely monitored by the Fed, also surpassed economists' forecasts. It jumped 0.3 percent in January, compared with 0.1 percent in December.
 The numbers stung Wall Street, and investors pushed many stocks lower yesterday. Bond traders, betting that the Fed would not lower interest rates anytime soon, nudged down the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note. 
 Before the Fed can act on interest rates in either direction, analysts said, it needs to have a clear indication that inflation is settling into a pattern, either higher or lower. But since the summer, consumer prices have been fickle, falling, flattening and then rising again. 
 ''You can make a reasonable case that maybe inflation goes a little lower, or you can make a reasonable case that maybe it goes a little higher,'' the chief economist of MFR, Joshua Shapiro, said. ''I think they're sitting there waiting to see if it breaks. If it breaks decisively one way or the other, then they'll act.''
 Minutes from the January meeting of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, released yesterday after the customary three-week delay, indicated that the Fed was not on the verge of any significant shift in tone. ''All members agreed that the predominant concern remained the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as desired,'' the minutes said. 
 They also showed that Fed officials discussed whether their tough tone on inflation was still appropriate and unanimously concluded that it was. All 11 Fed bankers who voted at the meeting agreed that ''a change was not warranted at this time.'' 
 The Fed still has a lot to be concerned about, as the data released yesterday showed.
 One factor officials pointed to during the January meeting as a potential obstacle to lower inflation was rising wages. 
 Yesterday, the Labor Department reported that the average earnings for workers in nonmanagement positions continued to advance at a brisk pace. After inflation, average earnings on both a weekly and hourly basis rose 2.1 percent in January. As recently as July, inflation was swallowing wage gains, leaving workers with negative real earnings.
 The core inflation rate increased 2.7 percent from a year earlier, well above the 1 percent to 2 percent the Fed typically prefers. That reversed a four-month trend when the year-over-year core inflation rate fell or remained flat. After climbing as high as 2.9 percent in September, year-over-year core inflation fell to 2.6 percent in November and December.
 ''Inflation is still sticky, and higher than the Fed wants it to be,'' said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist with Bank of America. ''And as long as it stays above 2 percent, the Fed is going to continue to express concern about it.''
 Overall inflation in January was 2.1 percent compared with a year earlier, down from 2.5 percent in December.
 The Fed meets next on March 21. Most analysts expect it to keep the benchmark short-term interest rate at 5.25 percent, where it has been since August. But, as prices of contracts that allow traders to bet on future interest rates show, traders expect a rate cut before 2008. 
 Sharp rises in the costs of medical care (the most in more than 15 years) and tobacco (the most in almost 5 years) helped elevate core inflation in January, leading some economists to argue that temporary factors were causing an exaggeration of the figures. 
 ''At first sight, the jump in January core consumer price inflation seems to signal renewed inflationary vigor,'' Kenneth Beauchemin of Global Insight wrote in a research note. But Mr. Beauchemin noted that the price increase for medical care in January was the fastest since 1991.
 Food prices also rose the fastest in almost two years. 
 On the bright side, there were hints that the outlook for inflation in the long term was improving. Energy prices dropped 1.5 percent in January, after a 4.2 percent increase in December. Housing prices, including rent, rose at a slower pace. 
 When he addressed Congress two weeks ago, the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said two major factors in the forecast for lower inflation this year were lower housing and energy costs. And many economists said yesterday that January's figures alone were not a reason to expect inflation to start rising at a troubling pace. ''That's not going to cause them to run out and panic,'' Mr. Shapiro said.
 But, as Mr. Bernanke has said, there is a degree of uncertainty to the Fed's forecast.
 Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook, argued that the January consumer price data should alarm the Fed because it is probably a sign of things to come. A combination of rebounding economic growth, low unemployment and slowing worker productivity will push inflation higher, he said.
 ''Clearly this is not what the Fed wants to see,'' he wrote in a research note. ''Bernanke has recently testified that core prices had been retreating, but January's numbers suggest we may have seen the lows for inflation in this cycle.''

HEADLINE: History vs. Homogeneity in New Orleans Housing Fight

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
In this hard-pressed city a proposal by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development to demolish four public housing complexes has touched a raw nerve. The demolition, which would affect more than 4,500 housing units, represents for some the plight of a poor, black underclass displaced by Hurricane Katrina and struggling to return. It also represents the problems that faced the city even before the hurricane: poverty, crime and racial divisions.
 The bluntness of HUD's solution reflects a degree of historical amnesia that this wounded city cannot afford. In its rush to demolish the apartment complexes -- and replace them with the kind of generic mixed-income suburban community so favored by Washington bureaucrats -- the agency demonstrates great insensitivity to both the displaced tenants and the urban fabric of this city. 
Offering perhaps a last chance to bring some sanity to this process, a congressional subcommittee is scheduled to open hearings here on Feb. 22 about the future of the city's affordable housing. It is an opportunity to rethink HUD's questionable vision and reappraise the role that architecture plays in society.
 The hearings should help open up a process that so far has seemed anything but democratic. HUD took control of the four complexes from the Housing Authority of New Orleans in 2002 because of accusations of financial mismanagement. In order to implement the demolition plan, both agencies must comply with a section of the National Historic Preservation Act that requires an appraisal of the historic significance of any building more than 50 years old. But they have largely ignored testimony from of a long list of preservationists, including the Louisiana Landmarks Society and a local representative of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. 
 In arguing to save the buildings, preservationists point to the human scale of the apartment complexes, whose pitched slate roofs, elegant brickwork and low-rise construction reflect a subtle understanding of the city's historical context without slavishly mimicking it. 
 Tellingly, neither housing agency has closely examined alternatives to demolition, like renovating some buildings in the complexes and replacing others. Although the Housing Authority of New Orleans says that modernizing existing developments would cost more than building new housing, it has yet to release cost breakdowns or the source of the figures. John Fernandez, an architecture professor at M.I.T. who examined all four of the complexes, has suggested that the extent of the storm's damage has been overstated.
 The housing agencies' tabula rasa planning mentality recalls the worst aspects of the postwar Modernist agenda, which substituted a suburban model of homogeneity for an urban one of diversity. The proposal for ''traditional-style'' pastel houses, set in neat little rows on uniform lots, is a model of conformity that attacks the idea of the city as a place where competing values coexist. 
 This is reinforced by the plan's tendency to isolate the new housing from the rest of the city. Often arranged along dead-end cul-de-sacs, the proposed developments lack the mix of big and small buildings, residential apartments and retail shops that could weave them into the surrounding urban fabric. 
 The point is not to return people to the same housing conditions that existed before Hurricane Katrina, but to distinguish between failures of social policy and design policy. Architects can't determine the economic mix of residents in public housing developments nor provide education and health services. Their job is to give physical form to social and cultural values.
 In this city that should begin with a fair appraisal of existing housing. With its low scale, narrow footprint and high-quality construction, for example, the 1940s Lafitte development, one of the four complexes slated for demolition, cannot be compared to Desire, a generic, shoddily constructed housing block, built more than a decade later. Some have suggested carving new roads through existing developments to anchor them more firmly into the surrounding neighborhoods. 
 Solutions like this might preclude the violent bulldozing of neighborhoods in a city so short of housing. A willingness to make case by case historical distinctions would result in a more historically layered urban composition, one that could, eventually, include contemporary architectural ideas as well.
 For that to happen, however, HUD needs to listen to the preservationists who have taken the time to examine the value of the city's public housing stock. It might also consider tapping into a higher level of creative intelligence. Architects like Enrique Norten and Thom Mayne, for instance, are working on major projects for commercial developers in the city's business district. Enlisting a similar level of imaginative talent to rethink the city's public housing could help alleviate trenchant social divisions here.
 If some feel nostalgia for places like Lafitte, it is partly because it embodies a time when America still seemed capable of a more hopeful vision, one in which architecture, planning and social policy collaborated to create a more decent society.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Insecurities

 BODY:
If the bankers, investors and regulators who populate the global financial markets are not already anxious, they should be. The easy money that has buoyed the global economy for much of this decade is getting harder to come by. 
 At a similar point a decade ago, Russia defaulted on its foreign debt and Asia came unglued, weakening global growth. This time, the trigger could be the rapid erosion in the quality of American home mortgages -- reflected in surging delinquencies and rising defaults.
Two economists, Mark Zandi and Juan Manuel Licari of Moody's Economy.com, detailed the dangers recently. In 2005 and 2006, lenders wrote an estimated $3.2 trillion in new home mortgages, which was a record -- and lowered their credit standards considerably to do it. In 2005 alone, 20 percent of the mortgages taken out were ''subprime'' -- made to borrowers with poor credit -- and many more had worrisome features like interest-only payments. 
 Not surprisingly, as interest rates rose last year, mortgage delinquencies soared. Delinquency rates are expected to peak in 2008 at over 3 percent, well above the level of the last recession. Many of these risky mortgages were sold to investment banks, who carved them up into complex i.o.u.'s that they sold to investors worldwide. More than 20 percent of global private debt securities is now tied to housing in the United States. That works out to $7.5 trillion -- far larger than the market for United States Treasuries. So if America's mortgage market heads south, the losses could be widespread.
 The odds of a global financial crisis are still low, according to Mr. Zandi and Mr. Licari, but they are rising. There is not a lot now that can be done about the risks in the mortgage market. But the growing possibility of hard times ahead is another argument for rolling back many of the recent excessive tax cuts, so the government will have more resources available to respond if a crisis comes.

HEADLINE: Betrothed at First Sight: A Korean-Vietnamese Courtship

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI; Su-hyun Lee contributed reporting.

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam 

 BODY:
It was midnight here in Hanoi, or already 2 a.m. back in Seoul, South Korea. But after a five-hour flight on a recent Sunday, Kim Wan-su was driven straight from the airport to the Lucky Star karaoke bar here, where 23 young Vietnamese women seeking Korean husbands sat waiting in two dimly lighted rooms.
 ''Do I have to look at them and decide now?'' Mr. Kim asked, as the marriage brokers gave a brief description of each of the women sitting around a U-shaped sofa.
Thus, Mr. Kim, a 39-year-old auto parts worker from a suburb of Seoul, began the mildly chaotic, two-hour process of choosing a spouse. In a day or two, if his five-day marriage tour went according to plan, he would be wed and enjoying his honeymoon at the famed Perfume Pagoda on the Huong Tich Mountain southwest of here. 
 More and more South Korean men are finding wives outside of South Korea, where a surplus of bachelors, a lack of marriageable Korean partners and the rising social status of women have combined to shrink the domestic market for the marriage-minded male. Bachelors in China, India and other Asian nations, where the traditional preference for sons has created a disproportionate number of men now fighting over a smaller pool of women, are facing the same problem.
 The rising status of women in the United States sent American men who were searching for more traditional wives to Russia in the 1990s. But the United States' more balanced population has not led to the shortage of potential brides and the thriving international marriage industry found in South Korea.
 Now, that industry is seizing on an increasingly globalized marriage market and sending comparatively affluent Korean bachelors searching for brides in the poorer corners of China and Southeast and Central Asia. The marriage tours are fueling an explosive growth in marriages to foreigners in South Korea, a country whose ethnic homogeneity lies at the core of its self-identity.
 In 2005, marriages to foreigners accounted for 14 percent of all marriages in South Korea, up from 4 percent in 2000.
 South Korean news organizations have reported that many of the foreign brides were initially lied to by their husbands, and suffered isolation and sometimes abuse in South Korea. Partly in response, the Ministry of Health and Welfare is now moving to regulate the international marriage industry, which emerged so suddenly that the Consumer Protection Board can only estimate that there are 2,000 to 3,000 such agencies nationwide.
 After an initial setback -- his first three choices found various reasons to decline his offer -- Mr. Kim narrowed his field to a 22-year-old college student and an 18-year-old high school graduate.
 ''What's your personality like?'' Mr. Kim asked the college student.
 ''I'm an extrovert,'' she said.
 The 18-year-old asked why he wanted to marry a Vietnamese woman.
 ''I have two colleagues who married Vietnamese women,'' he said, adding, ''The women seem devoted and family-oriented.''
 One Korean broker said the 22-year-old, who seemed bright and assertive, would adapt well to South Korea. Another suggested flipping a coin.
 ''Well, since I'm quiet, I'll choose the extrovert,'' Mr. Kim said finally, adding quickly, ''Is it O.K. if I hold her hand now?''
 She went over to sit next to him, though neither dared to hold hands. She spelled out her name in her left palm: Vien. Her name was To Thi Vien. 
 In South Korea, billboards advertising marriages to foreigners dot the countryside, and fliers are scattered on the Seoul subway. Many rural governments, faced with declining populations, subsidize the marriage tours, which typically cost $10,000. 
 The business began in the late 1990s by matching South Korean farmers or the physically disabled mostly to ethnic Koreans in China, according to brokers and the Consumer Protection Board. But by 2003, the majority of customers were urban bachelors, and the foreign brides came from a host of countries. 
 The widespread availability of sex-screening technology for pregnant women since the 1980s has resulted in the birth of a disproportionate number of South Korean males. What is more, South Korea's growing wealth has increased women's educational and employment opportunities, even as it has led to rising divorce rates and plummeting birthrates.
 ''Nowadays, Korean women have higher standards,'' said Lee Eun-tae, the owner of Interwedding, an agency that last year matched 400 Korean bachelors with brides from Vietnam, China, the Philippines, Mongolia, Thailand, Cambodia, Uzbekistan and Indonesia. ''If a man has only a high school degree, or lives with his mother, or works only at a small- or medium-size company, or is short or older, or lives in the countryside, he'll find it very difficult to marry in Korea.''
 Critics say the business demeans and takes advantage of poor women. But brokers say they are merely matching the needs of Korean men and foreign women seeking better lives.
 ''But this business will get more difficult as those countries get richer,'' said Won Hyun-jae, the owner of i-Bombit, another agency. ''Now, even a disabled Korean man can find a Vietnamese bride. But eventually Vietnamese women will ask why they have to go marry a Korean man when life in Vietnam is good.''
 For now, Vietnam remains a popular source of brides, second only to China. Marriages with Vietnamese women are considered so successful that the local government of at least one city, Yeongcheon, in South Korea's rural southeast, subsidizes marriage tours only to Vietnam.
 At Incheon International Airport to the west of Seoul, an increasingly familiar scene unfolds in front of the arrival gates in the mornings. Korean men, holding telltale bouquets and often accompanied by relatives, greet their Vietnamese brides as they arrive on overnight flights from Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City.On the Marriage Tour
 It was also at the airport that a tense-looking Mr. Kim and another client began their marriage tours. Three brokers for Interwedding and i-Bombit arrived.
 Mr. Kim, urged on by an older sister, decided to go to Vietnam after a last-ditch effort to meet a Korean woman in December failed. A high school graduate, he lives with his mother and his sister, and he works on the assembly line of a small manufacturer of car keys. Though he lives in one of the world's most wired societies, Mr. Kim does not use the Internet.
 The other client was Kim Tae-goo, 51, who grows ginseng and apples on the 2.5 acres of land he owns in Yeongju, a town southeast of Seoul. Mr. Kim had recently divorced a Chinese woman he married after the death of his first wife, a Korean woman. He lives with his 16-year-old daughter and his elderly mother. His 21-year-old has left home.
 Ahn Jae-won, a Korean broker who has long been based in Hanoi and is married to a Vietnamese woman, began: ''The women have come out looking their best for you. But don't expect them to look as pretty as Korean women. There is a big gap in our G.D.P.'s. Don't be condescending. Don't lie. If you lie, they'll find out eventually and feel betrayed and run away.
 ''The parents know that their daughters will marry a Korean man. The authorities know this is happening, but there'll be trouble if we do it in front of them. So I seek your understanding. Once we land in Hanoi, even though it'll be very late, we'll go meet the women right away. It's safer to do this at night.
 ''One last thing. Other companies allow you to sleep with the women on the first night. We don't. Only on the bridal night. We must, after all, keep our decorum as Koreanmen. Is that O.K. with you?''
 The two nodded.Introductions and a Choice
 And so, at the Lucky Star karaoke bar here, the older Mr. Kim addressed the Vietnamese women, most in their early 20s.
 ''My 16-year-old daughter lives with me, and I'm a farmer,'' he said, after informing the women through the brokers that he would also send $100 a month to their parents in Vietnam. ''Is that O.K. with you?''
 ''I know how to farm,'' said Bui Thi Thuy, 22, one of the two women Mr. Kim eventually focused on.
 Asked whether she had any questions, Ms. Thuy said she had none. But the other woman, an earnest 28-year-old in a light-green jacket, asked, ''If I marry you, will you love me and take care of me forever?''
 ''Of course,'' Mr. Kim answered, then quickly settled on Ms. Thuy.
 After a few hours' sleep, the new couples and the brokers squeezed into a small van for the four-hour ride to the women's home province, Quang Ninh, about four hours east of Hanoi. There, the couples would be interviewed by the local authorities before registering for their marriages.
 The road out of Hanoi, a wide highway flanked by new factories owned by multinationals like Canon, eventually narrowed to two lanes crisscrossed frequently by cows. Farther out, farmers could be seen working the soil by hand, and signs of Vietnam's booming economy grew fewer.
 Most of the Vietnamese women marrying Korean men came from the rural areas around Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. 
 Both Ms. Vien and Ms. Thuy had friends who had married Korean men and lived, happily it seemed, in South Korea. Like many Vietnamese, they were also avid fans of Korean television shows and movies, the so-called Korean Wave of pop culture that has swept all of Asia since the late 1990s. The Korean WaveThe Korean Wave has transformed South Korea's image in the region, presenting the country as having successfully balanced tradition and modernity, a place that produces coveted Samsung cellphones and cherishes family ties. 
 The week the two women met their future husbands, Vietnamese television was showing in prime time a South Korean television series called ''Successful Story of a Bright Girl'' -- the story of a simple country girl who goes to Seoul and captures the heart of a tycoon.
 ''To be honest, I don't know much about Korea except what I've seen on television,'' Ms. Vien said. ''But the Korean landscape is beautiful. Korean men look sophisticated and affectionate. They seem responsible, and they live in harmony with their family members and their colleagues.''
 A soccer fan able to rattle off the jersey numbers of David Beckham and Zinedine Zidane, she had registered two years earlier with a broker for marriages with Koreans. Her father, a construction worker for a local firm, was able to send his two children -- Ms. Vien and her older brother -- to college.
 By contrast, Ms. Thuy was one of five children of rice farmers. She had registered with the agency soon after graduating from high school.
 ''A friend of mine married a Korean man and now lives in Seoul,'' Ms. Thuy said. ''We talk on the phone sometimes. She's very happy. She says there are so many people and tall buildings in Seoul.''
 At age 22, she said, half of her peers had already married. As she waited to marry, she helped with household chores, forbidden by her parents to engage in the farm work that might blemish her looks.
 The couples registered for their marriages and underwent medical checkups, running into other Vietnamese-Korean couples along the way. 
 The younger Mr. Kim wrote a letter in Korean to his bride -- trying to allay the anxieties he saw on her face, promising to protect her and surmount the inevitable problems -- but found no way to relay its meaning. The couples bought Korean and Vietnamese dictionaries, pointing to words or using broken English.The In-Laws
 About 40 hours after landing here in Hanoi, the Korean men married their Vietnamese brides in a double ceremony. The brides' relatives waited at a large restaurant here with expectant looks. 
 ''Today is the union not only of two people, but of two countries,'' said Ms. Vien's father, To Minh Seu, 55. ''Vietnam and Korea share many similarities. We are both Confucian societies.''
 Standing next to her daughter and her new son-in-law, Ms. Thuy's mother, Nguyen Thi Nguyet, 56, said: ''This is a poor country, but conditions are much better in Korea. I hope my daughter will have a better life there.''
 But Ms. Thuy's father, Bui Van Vui, 52, was displeased that his daughter was marrying a man just one year younger than he was. The night before, he had telephoned Mr. Ahn to complain about the age gap between his daughter and Mr. Kim. 
 ''I'm still very worried because of the age gap,'' he said as his son-in-law listened to Mr. Ahn's interpretation. ''I'm slightly relieved now that I see my son-in-law for the first time. But I can't stop worrying.''
 ''Don't worry, don't worry about a thing,'' Mr. Kim said.
 Still, the father looked grim throughout the ceremony.
 ''Let's tell him about the compensation,'' Mr. Kim told Mr. Ahn, referring to the $100 he would send every month.
 ''Later, later,'' Mr. Ahn said.
 As he left the restaurant after the ceremony, the father turned around at the entrance to take a final look at his daughter. He pressed two fingers against his lips and kissed her goodbye.
 Later, Ms. Thuy said: ''I was my father's favorite. He really adores me and is worried.''
 She, too, was worried. ''I know Korea only from television, but it must be very, very different from reality. I don't know whether my new family will like me, and I don't know how I'll adapt. I'm overwhelmed with worries.''A New Chapter Begins
 Two days later, it was time for the Korean men to return home, with their wives staying behind to complete the paperwork to join them.
 At the airport here, Ms. Thuy announced that she had something to tell her husband and asked Mr. Ahn to interpret.
 ''Please extend my greetings to your mother and children,'' she said. 
 Mr. Kim reached out for a handshake, but the brokers pressed him to give his wife a hug.
 ''Don't worry about me,'' she said. ''I'll study Korean very hard, and by the time you see me I'll be good at it. We had only a short time together. But I felt affection between us and started to feel love for you. When you're in Korea, please call me.''
 ''I'll call you in two days,'' he said.
 The two women would leave Hanoi in three months, the same way half a dozen other Vietnamese brides, visas in hand, did on a recent night. The extended families of these brides had come from the countryside to bid them farewell, some still wearing car sickness patches behind their ears for the long drive here.
 Many, it seemed, were visiting the airport for the first time. Some kept riding an escalator up and down, their faces showing the thrill of a new experience. 
 Then, with the boarding time approaching, they clustered in front of a window looking into the immigration office, noses pressed against the glass, and waved at the brides as they were stamped out of Vietnam and went off to catch the red-eye to South Korea.

HEADLINE: As Big-City Tax Burdens Go, New York's Is the Heaviest, an Analysis Finds

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
New York City has long had a notorious reputation for high taxes, but an official analysis released yesterday shows just how much the city stands out in this regard: State and local taxes swallow $9.02 out of every $100 in household and business income, putting New York's tax burden far above those of the eight other American cities with populations over one million.
 The city's Independent Budget Office, which prepared the report, is widely seen as the authoritative source of nonpartisan fiscal and economic analysis for New York. The office tackled the same issue in a 2000 report, with similar findings, but this time, it factored in state taxes in comparing the nation's largest cities.
The new analysis attributed much of the disparity between New York and the other cities to the exceptionally high costs New Yorkers bear for Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor that is run by the federal and state governments but partly financed by the city. 
 The average state and local tax burden for the other eight cities in the analysis was $6.16 of every $100 in gross taxable resources. Philadelphia ($7.16) came in a distant second to New York, and Los Angeles ($6.88) came in third, according to the report.
 The analysis considered total tax burdens -- not the way they are distributed -- so it cannot be used to calculate whether a family would pay less in taxes outside of the city. Nonetheless, the findings were seized on by politicians and others who have raised alarms about the tax burdens New Yorkers face, through a city income tax that tops out at 3.65 percent and a state income tax with a ceiling of 6.95 percent, along with property and sales taxes. 
 Representative Anthony D. Weiner, a Democrat who represents parts of Queens and Brooklyn and ran for mayor in 2005, called the report ''a surprise to no one.'' He called for imposing hefty surcharges on incomes over $1 million and lessening the tax burden on the poor and the middle class.
 Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, the city's leading business group, warned that the report signaled that the city was overly reliant on high taxes to finance its expansive government, and that any cooling of the real estate market could magnify that problem. 
 ''As the economy flattens out or stabilizes, there is no way to sustain the current tax rates and still meet the expenses we've established,'' she said. ''This is a long-term problem, and any business looking down the pike sees that New York is in a position where it will have to raise taxes on businesses or high-income individuals.''
 David R. Belkin, a senior economist at the Independent Budget Office and the lead author of the report, cautioned that taxes were only one factor in deciding where to live, work and invest.
 ''This report compares how much state and local governments are taxing in the largest U.S. cities -- not what services these governments are providing their taxpayers,'' he said. ''Households and businesses look at both sides of the ledger in deciding whether a given tax level is too much.'' 
 On the expense side, according to the analysis, New York is exceptional because of the city's high share of costs associated with Medicaid and, to a lesser extent, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families and other welfare programs. 
 ''In no other big city did the municipal or county government face a remotely comparable mandate to fund transfer programs,'' the report found.
 Without the cost of those two programs, the report said, the city's tax burden would be much closer to the average of the largest cities. 
 Although property taxes often dominate the local political discussion, the report found that property and sales taxes in New York City were roughly comparable relative to the other eight cities: ''It is in the area of income taxation -- personal and business -- that New York City really stands out.''
 However, Rae Rosen, a senior economist and assistant vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, warned that it was simplistic to compare New York with other large American cities. Unlike the largest cities in California and Texas, New York City is the pre-eminent economic engine of the state, she said, so it will inevitably bear a large proportion of the state's tax burden.
 She also noted that businesses stayed in New York even though labor and rent were their biggest expenses, not taxes. ''If businesses are willing to locate here and pay some of the highest wages and rents in the nation, that's by choice,'' she said.
 The earlier report, in February 2000, found that in 1997, local government taxes alone absorbed $7.99 of every $100 in taxable resources, 79 percent more than the average in the next nine largest cities, $4.47. (The comparable figure for local taxes alone, according to the new study, is 90 percent greater than the average in the next eight largest cities.)
 However, the office said those figures could not be directly compared to the figures in the new report, because of several adjustments in methodology, including the addition of state tax burdens to the new report. The new analysis is based on data for 2003-4 from the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, both parts of the United States Department of Commerce.
 New York, despite its high concentrations of wealth, is hardly the richest big city per capita. New York's gross taxable resources -- resident personal incomes and gross business operating surpluses, or income minus employee compensation -- averaged $61,622 per resident, trailing Dallas ($74,383), Houston ($72,835) and San Diego ($63,814). 
 The analysis then calculated each city's tax burden, or tax effort: tax collections per $100 of gross taxable resources, not counting taxes on hotel occupancy and nonresident personal incomes. Virtually all taxes were considered: income, property, sales, real estate transfers, gasoline and utilities.
 In general, the cities with weaker tax bases -- San Antonio, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Los Angeles -- tended to have higher overall tax burdens than the wealthier cities: Dallas, Houston and San Diego. (Of the nine cities, Chicago was slightly below average in both per capita taxable resources and tax burden.) 
 ''New York City sits far outside the trend line,'' the analysis found, with a stronger tax base than most large cities, but also a much higher tax burden.
 New York also led the nine cities in the ratio between local and state taxes. Of the total state and local tax burden in New York, 62.3 percent went to the city or the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and only 37.7 percent went to the state. In San Diego, Los Angeles, Houston, Phoenix and Dallas, the state's share of the tax burden was more than half.
 Even with a smaller share of the total burden, New York's state taxes are still, on average, higher than the other cities'. ''The supposition that high New York City municipal taxes are offset by relatively low state taxes is not sustained,'' the report found.

HEADLINE: FROM THE DESK OF DAVID POGUE: An Experiment in Virtual Living

BYLINE: By DAVID POGUE

 BODY:
This past Sunday, my report on the Second Life phenomenon aired on "CBS News Sunday Morning." (You can watch it here.)
 Second Life, as about 2 million people have already discovered, is a virtual world on the Internet. You're represented by a computer-generated character (an avatar) that can walk around, fly, teleport, or exchange typed comments with other people's characters. You can make yourself young and beautiful, equip yourself with fancy clothes, build a dream house by the water, or make the sun set on command. The average member spends four hours a day in Second Life.
 One thing that makes Second Life different from other online 3-D games is its economy. People make stuff and sell it to each other: clothes, rockets, cars, new hairstyles. Second Life itself is free, but members nonetheless pay real money--$220 million a year--to buy these imaginary accessories.
 As usual, we had a lot more interesting stuff than we had time to broadcast. So here, so they won't go to waste, are further excerpts of my interview with Phillip Rosedale, the CEO of Linden Lab, the company behind Second Life. 
 DP: The first time I tried Second Life, I must admit I was a little bewildered. I was a little bored, because I couldn't find anyplace to go to find people. Do you have any advice for newcomers?
 PR: Second Life is a little bit like being dropped from a helicopter into New York City, and all you have is sort of a tattered bus map. You have to ask other people.
 The biggest piece of advice is to find friends. Go and say hi and ask someone for help. And what you'll find is that because the environment is a little tricky to get around in, people are eager to help teach newcomers those skills.
 DP: You think? Because if you tried that in a newsgroup or a chat room, they'd say, "Get out of my face!"
 PR: There's something very different about the sense of presence in Second Life. Communicating, say, with comments in a blog, or even in a chat room is very, very different than communicating in Second Life. You know, if I walk forward, I will bump into you and move your avatar back. And that feeling creates a kind of connection between us that's much more similar to real life.
 DP: What would you say are the dangers online? There was a hacking attempt, I guess, and--
 PR: For any digital world to be reasonably interesting, it always has to be hackable in some sense. And what I mean by that is that people are always going to be able to come up with a sort of a virus, or a way of making each other angry, if the environment is open enough for it to be interesting. And Second Life is a great example of that.
 So a lot of the technology work that we do is looking for problems and creating practice and policies that look for that stuff and try to deal with it.
 DP: Have you ever had to punish a member?
 PR: We have banned people for repeatedly violating the sort of high-level rules of just basic tolerance and non-harassment, yes.
 DP: And you banished them to The Cornfield?
 PR: (LAUGHS) We're always doing experiments. And there was a period of time where we would give people suspensions rather than kicking them out of Second Life altogether. And one of the funny things that somebody here at the office came up with was the idea that you'd be incarcerated. You could log in, so you could use Second Life, but you'd always be placed in this strange cornfield that had this old tractor. There was nothing in it-- it was a corn field, and then this old tractor. And then a television that sat there incessantly and played these 1950s "Be a Good Citizen" kind of movies. Great stuff.
 DP: It's not there anymore?
 PR: I do not believe that we are currently sending people to the Cornfield.
 DP: Darn.
 PR: But I think it does still exist somewhere.
 DP: Now, on Second Life, you can design yourself to look like anything at all. Seems like what most people want is to look beautiful and skinny. So what percent of Second Life's success is based on this wish-fulfillment thing?
 PR: When you watch people in Second Life, there's initially a desire to just have everything that you've ever wanted: to be very beautiful, to be very sociable, and to be very engaged in a kind of fast-forward version of consumption as we know it in the real world.
 But that's the first couple of months. And then after that you've almost reached a Zen-like state where you can say, "Well, I've done everything, but what more is there? Then you start to ask questions like, "Well, maybe I just want to build a temple on a hill and meditate. Or I want to contribute to a community in a way that's not something that was obvious when I came in."
 DP: Now, we interviewed a number of people, and we watched a lot of people using Second Life. And there's a good deal of crashing, and sometimes the "grid is down." What's going on there?
 PR: Well, Second Life is a very, very complicated piece of software built, bravely, by a fairly small team of engineers. And we're expanding. It stretches the limits of 3D technology. Even the hardware that does that work is relatively new, and so there are a lot of bugs in these systems. We're trying to fix that as quickly as we can.
 Again, you know, to me being-- a member of the community that was the growing Internet and Web, it feels like 1994.
 DP: Is there any worry about the whole isolation thing? First iPod earbuds, and now people substituting virtual interactions for real ones?
 PR: Well I'll tell ya, the history of technology has, in the past 50 years, been to increasingly isolate us. We've gone from watching movies in a movie theater, to watching them as a family at home, to watching them alone on our iPod.
 But actually I think there's a next wave of technology, of which Second Life is certainly a great example, where we are bringing people back together again into the same place to have these experiences.
 The thing about Second Life that is so fascinating and different is not just that it's 3-D. There are always people to share that experience with, or to ask for help. Or to laugh at something with. And that experience is an innately human one that technology has deprived us of. I think many people use Second Life to have more friends, and more human contact, than they do in the real world.
 DP: What's the hard part for the next phase?
 PR: Well, we need to grow Second Life as fast as people want it to grow. And right now, that seems to be awfully fast. If you look at the number of people online at one time, that number has doubled in the last 90 days. Right now, the challenge is just scaling up the services, and the computers, and even the policies, and customer support.
 Looking farther out, we have to really open it up so that a lot of people can work on it with us. [Linden Lab recently "open-sourced" the code of the Second Life program, in hopes that volunteers worldwide will comb through it for improvements.]
 When you look at Second Life today, you may say, "I don't like the graphics." Or, you know, "It's clunky. It runs too slow." But you have to bear in mind that in just a few years, this is gonna look like walking into a movie screen. And that's just gonna be such an amazing thing.

HEADLINE: Splits Emerge Between U.S. and Europe Over Aid for Palestinians

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER; Greg Myre contributed reporting from Jerusalem, and Thom Shanker from Washington.

DATELINE: BERLIN, Feb. 21 

 BODY:
Fractures between the United States and Europe began to appear Wednesday over whether the new Palestinian unity government was likely to receive international economic support even as the Middle East peace negotiators officially continued their wait-and-see approach. 
 After the meeting here of representatives of the so-called quartet of Middle East peace negotiators -- the United States, Russia, the United Nations and the European Union -- the group released a statement that ''reaffirmed'' its support for a Palestinian government that would recognize Israel and renounce violence.
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has said repeatedly that unless the new unity government meets those conditions, the United States will continue its economic boycott of the Palestinian government. So far, the Saudi-brokered government, which included the moderate president, Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah, and the militant Islamic movement Hamas, does not.
 But European officials appeared more willing to hold out the possibility of finding members of a new unity government with whom to work. ''There are ways that we can be flexible,'' one European official said. 
 The Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, who has said that the United States and Europe should look for ways to engage Hamas, was pointed during a news conference about not threatening to continue the boycott if the new government did not recognize Israel.
 The quartet communique said, ''Clearly in this statement we support the formation of a new Palestinian government,'' Mr. Lavrov said. ''It was also underscored that further steps must be taken to support the Palestinians. One certainly shouldn't speak of a boycott in this regard.''
 In the United States Congress, Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York, is blocking $86 million that the Bush administration wants to strengthen Mr. Abbas's security forces. An aide to Ms. Lowey said she would lift the hold when the State Department provided guarantees that the money would be used only for nonlethal security assistance, like uniforms and communications equipment. 
 The United States and other Western countries cut off close to $1 billion in direct aid to the Palestinian government after Hamas won last year's parliamentary elections.
 The United States will have a tough balancing act as it tries to keep the quartet united in an economic boycott of the Palestinian government while trying to bolster Mr. Abbas in peace talks with Israel. Those talks, which began Monday with a summit meeting between Mr. Abbas and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel, ended a few hours later with little sign of progress.
 Mr. Abbas has maintained that he agreed to the pact to end the violence between Hamas and Fatah, which has left more than 100 Palestinians dead.
 Meanwhile, in Jerusalem, Mr. Olmert said Wednesday that he was willing to meet ''again and again'' with Mr. Abbas. But he also made clear that serious peace negotiations were unlikely unless the Palestinian government was willing to recognize Israel.
 ''The agreement signed between Fatah and Hamas does not promise any change in the basic policy toward Israel,'' Mr. Olmert said at a news conference.
 Hamas says it has no objections to Mr. Abbas's negotiating with Israel, but Mr. Abbas has limited authority, and Mr. Olmert indicated that would limit the scope of their discussions.

HEADLINE: Wimbledon to Pay Women and Men Equal Prize Money

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY

 BODY:
It has been a long time coming -- 39 years, to be exact -- but women's tennis players will receive equal prize money to the men at Wimbledon this year.
 Under increasing pressure from women's stars like Venus Williams and Maria Sharapova and from society at large, the club announced on Thursday that it would put an end to a practice that had proved ever more divisive.
 In truth, the gap in prize money had become more symbolic than substantive. Last year's women's singles champion, Amelie Mauresmo, earned $1.117 million, 95 percent of the $1.17 million men's champion Roger Federer. 
 ''As in every other year, the Committee has again analyzed all the relevant information and then made a judgment,'' said Tim Phillips, the chairman of the All England Club, in a statement. ''This year, taking into account both the overall progression and the fact that broader social factors are also relevant to the decision, they have decided that the time is right to bring this subject to a logical conclusion and eliminate the difference.
 ''We believe this positive step will be widely welcomed.''
 Wimbledon, the oldest major tennis tournament, has long been a pioneer in the sport and was the first of the four Grand Slam events to accept professionalism when the Open era began in 1968. But the club, the only private entity to stage a Grand Slam event, has been a laggard on this issue. The United States Open offered equal prize money to men and women in 1968; the Australian Open followed. Even the French Open, where women's tennis has traditionally been viewed as an inferior product, agreed to offer equal prize money to the men's and women's singles champions in 2006.
 Wimbledon officials stuck to their market principles in the face of repeated appeals by icons of the women's game like Billie Jean King. But there was increased pressure in 2006, with Prime Minister Tony Blair among those publicly calling on the club to embrace equality in prize money. Venus Williams, the 2005 singles champion wrote an eloquent opinion piece in a British newspaper in defense of the women's cause.
 In 2005, Williams made her point in person on the eve of her final against Lindsay Davenport when she accompanied Larry Scott, the head of the WTA Tour, to a Grand Slam committee meeting that included top Wimbledon officials.
 ''Venus made her point in very articulate fashion,'' Scott said in a telephone interview. ''It had to leave a very meaningful impression on anyone there. You couldn't just write it off as suits arguing on the players' behalf. There was no doubt that it was a heartfelt position.
 ''Wimbledon has always prided itself on its relations with players. They celebrate the players and want them to treat the tournament as a Holy Grail, which it is to many people. I think it was disturbing to the players and Wimbledon that this issue created bad will.''
 It also generated negative publicity for a club that, despite its conservative reputation, has been progressive in many areas under the leadership of Phillips, a former British Airways executive.
 ''I think there was a bit of a tipping point over the last couple years,'' Scott said. ''Between politicians and the public and the media who were not supportive becoming supportive of equality. I think things just added up, and it got to the point where they said, 'Let's get on with it and do it.'''
 ''Wimbledon should be commended for making a very definitive step in going all the way to equality in one swoop. It's great for Wimbledon, and I think it really reinforces their leadership role in the game.''
 In a statement released by the WTA, Williams, who is playing a tournament in Memphis, said: ''The greatest tennis tournament in the world has reached an even greater height today. I applaud today's decision by Wimbledon, which recognizes the value of women's tennis. The 2007 championships will have even greater meaning and significance to me and my fellow players.''
 In an interview with the International Herald Tribune after last year's tournament, Phillips reiterated the club's view that the economic imperatives for unequal prize money outweighed the cultural imperatives for equality.
 ''There are two ways of looking at it,'' Phillips said then. ''One is that it is an equal right and entitlement and the other is that in the sports and entertainment business, remuneration is driven by the market and not by your gender, and we happen to take that view. We don't believe that what Julia Roberts gets paid per film is significant in terms of deciding what her male costar gets paid.''
 Phillips also pointed out that unlike the leading men, many of the top women still play doubles at Wimbledon, which actually allows them to earn more money than the men. But all those established arguments fell away in the last eight months as dialogue continued. In November, Scott made a discreet visit to London at Phillips's invitation to make a presentation to Wimbledon's committee of management.
 ''He invited me to present the business case,'' Scott said. ''He always said that business people are running Wimbledon, so he wanted me to present that view. I showed them data and metric and also pursued the moral and principled arguments.''
 On Thursday, one of those with whom Scott was exchanging congratulatory messages was King, the trailblazer who was instrumental in giving women's tennis credibility in the early professional years. ''She's been fighting for this over 30 years,'' Scott said. ''No one fought harder than Billie Jean, and she left me a very nice message saying that she now will look at 2007 as lucky and will always remember this year.''

HEADLINE: Bush, in Talk-Show Manner, Promotes His Health Plan

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: CHATTANOOGA, Tenn., Feb. 21 

 BODY:
President Bush's plan to expand health coverage by revamping the tax code has been pronounced dead by leading Democrats on Capitol Hill. But Mr. Bush, ever the optimist, forged ahead Wednesday, conducting a chat session here in Oprah Winfrey style with people who are uninsured.
 Mr. Bush held forth for nearly an hour, cracking jokes about everything from the age of one of the participants -- ''You don't look a day over 34,'' he said after learning that she was 35 -- to ''the hair follicle benefit,'' a wry reference to what he views as luxury health plans. The participants had been carefully selected, the tone was confessional, and the president, describing himself as the ''educator in chief,'' sounded more like talk-show host in chief. 
Marty Ginn, an office manager from nearby McMinnville, told Mr. Bush, ''I have a pre-existing condition, I have trouble with my left knee, and the quotes were just outrageous and I'm just kind of stuck.''
 ''That's patently unfair,'' the president replied after telling Ms. Ginn that under his plan, she would get a tax deduction of $7,500 to help defray the cost of coverage.
 ''I think it'll work for you, Danny, I really do,'' Mr. Bush told another participant, a nursery manager named Danny Jennings, after encouraging Mr. Jennings to make a sales pitch of his own, for some nice spring rhododendrons.
 The round-table discussion, which followed a similar if less lively event with health insurance executives in Washington on Tuesday, was aimed at pitching the president's proposal to provide tax breaks for low- and moderate-income workers to buy insurance while imposing tax increases on some Americans covered by generous employer-sponsored plans. Single people would receive a $7,500 tax deduction, and families a deduction of $15,000, but anyone whose insurance cost more would pay taxes on the difference.
 Despite Mr. Bush's cheery demeanor, the idea seems to be a nonstarter on Capitol Hill, where Democrats have set universal coverage as their goal and the two parties remain miles apart in their visions for helping the nation's 47 million uninsured.
 Leading Democrats, including Senator Max Baucus of Montana, chairman of the Finance Committee, and Representative Pete Stark of California, chairman of a subcommittee overseeing health policy, said in interviews that Mr. Bush's plan was far too dependent on the private sector and that they did not envision anything like it becoming law.
 Mr. Stark called it ''a farcical move'' that was ''primarily designed to encourage employers to drop group coverage.'' Mr. Baucus said the plan was ''too much focused on the individual market,'' though he did give the president credit for ''stirring up the debate'' with his tax idea.
 ''It's an out-of-the-box thought,'' Mr. Baucus said. 
 Mr. Bush, undaunted, sees morsels of encouragement in a recent letter from a bipartisan group of five Democratic and five Republican senators who said they wanted to work with him on health care legislation. The Republicans, who included Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the party whip, said they agreed in principle that universal coverage was the goal, maintaining that ''the health care system cannot be fixed without providing solutions for everyone.'' 
 The Democrats, led by Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, who had initially been critical of the tax plan, said economists had convinced them that the tax rules needed to be modernized and that ''current rules disproportionately favor the most affluent.'' Mr. Wyden said in an interview that the two sides had spent weeks parsing the language in the letter.
 The White House, for its part, is signaling that Mr. Bush is flexible. A chief architect of the tax plan, Al Hubbard, director of the National Economic Council, said, ''We realize that the ultimate legislation is not going to look exactly as the president proposed and that there's going to be compromise on both sides.'' 
 Whether that spells legislative possibilities for 2007 is hard to say. Democrats in Congress say they are most focused this year on reauthorizing Schip, a program that provides coverage to low-income children. As for tackling universal coverage, Mr. Stark said each of the two parties would most likely coalesce around whatever plan its 2008 presidential nominee embraces.
 Some states, though, are moving ahead on their own. Tennessee, with the prodding of Gov. Phil Bredesen, who also participated in Wednesday's round table, has committed $100 million to a new program, Cover Tennessee, intended to help employers provide basic insurance to workers willing to pay a modest amount, roughly $50 a month. 
 After returning to Nashville later Wednesday, Mr. Bredesen, a Democrat, said in a phone interview that he was skeptical of the president's tax proposal and had been a bit leery of participating in the event here. He did so after assurances from Mr. Bush's health and human services secretary, Michael O. Leavitt, that he would get a chance to make his own pitch, for Cover Tennessee.
 ''I didn't particularly want to fly down there and be a set piece in a play for something I didn't really believe in,'' he said, ''but he assured me that they really were there to highlight the kinds of things we were doing.''

HEADLINE: Twin Cities Where Water Defines Borders and Views

BYLINE: By KIT KIEFER

 BODY:
THE view from the crest of the narrow International Bridge that connects the cities of Sault Ste. Marie in Michigan and in Ontario takes in one of the greatest collections of affordable big-water shoreline in North America, local real estate agents say. Forested hills climb northwest from the waterline, and rolling woodlands spread south.
 Whether in a blizzard or on a clear summer day, when the sky and water are complementary shades of Santa Fe turquoise, the Soo, as the region is called on both sides of the border, seems rendered in high-def when all around it is unremittingly low-res.
In the Soo, everything begins and ends with the water, including borders. Roughly one-third of the region consists of where the eastern tip of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan dips its finger into the Great Lakes of Superior, Michigan and Huron. The remaining two-thirds are across the St. Marys River, where Ontario hits the same roadblocks. The river is more than a line of demarcation. The channel was carved into locks in the 1800s, giving the region its most recognizable feature. 
 Soo water, though it defines the region, comes in many flavors: the locked-and-dredged St. Marys, lined with parks and full of boats; the North Channel, whose islands and shores have the placid elegance of old money, right down to a Frank Lloyd Wright-designed cottage; Lake Superior, vast and stormy, with a shoreline that can flip from rocky cliffs to sand beach within half a mile; Lake Huron, which strikes a happy medium between Lake Superior and the North Channel; inland pothole lakes, cold and clear and full of fish; and wild coffee-colored rivers that cut jagged canyons into the Canadian hills. 
 Jim Carrick and his wife, Linda Stoetzer-Carrick, were lured by the water. They bought property on the St. Marys River south of Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., 10 years ago, built a home, then retired there from Port Huron after spending their careers in education. 
 ''We love to watch the water, and we love to watch the boats,'' Mr. Carrick said. ''Anywhere we are in the house we can watch the boats. We even did our kitchen so we can watch the boats while we're doing dishes.''
 Linda Hoath, a resident of Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., is building a second home at the southern edge of the Michigan Soo, near Drummond Island. And, she too has heard the water's siren call. ''It's not just the way it looks,'' she said. ''It's the way it sounds.'' The Scene
 Given the Soo's emphasis on water, it's perhaps best to think of the two Sault Ste. Maries as the region's anchors.
 The Ontario city, with 75,000 residents, is the metropolis, a beacon in winter for those in the backcountry when they tire of skiing, snowmobiling and ice-fishing. It has the region's largest employer (Algoma Steel), the most impressive building (the brand-new Steelback Center, which is a hockey arena and convention site) and the best dining. Good family-run Italian restaurants like A Thymely Manner and the New Marconi dot tight-knit neighborhoods that have only recently shed their corner groceries. 
 Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., would be indistinguishable from Sioux City, Iowa, save for the locks that allow three-story-tall floating warehouses to trundle eerily along the edge of downtown. A succession of cottages, barnlike casinos, lighthouses and oddments like auto-repair shops follow the Lake Superior shoreline out of town heading west. 
 Inland, Tahquamenon Falls is even more spectacular than its name would imply. And farther inland is the mouth of the Two-Hearted River -- Hemingway (and Nick Adams) country. A sharp right takes you to Whitefish Bay, where the lake freighter Edmund Fitzgerald foundered. 
 The Ontario side is rougher, wilder. When cross-country and alpine skiers head for the hills, this is where they go. Searchmont Resort, half an hour northeast of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, has the steepest runs in the North Central area. Also nearby is the Stokely Creek Ski Touring Center, which has 72 miles of cross-country ski trails. Pros
 If you like snow, this is the place. A forecasted dusting of snow can become a 17-inch dumping. The region is on the edge of the lake-effect snow belt, so when places to the south are glazed a global-warmed brown, the Soo can be a refreshing white. 
 That whiteness has advantages. ''You can load your snowmobile on the train, ride it as far back as you want and be dropped off wherever there's a trail,'' said Ian McMillan, referring to the Algoma Central Railroad. He is executive director for tourism of the Sault Ste. Marie Economic Development Corporation in Canada. 
 ''It is the perfect place to snowmobile, hunt and fish, plus it has all the amenities of a big city and a border city,'' said Gayle Rowse of Windsor, Ontario, who persuaded three cousins and a close friend from the Detroit/Windsor region to buy land near her cottage on the inland Prince Lake just by inviting them up now and then. Cons
 ''It's not an easy, quick retreat,'' said Ken Coulter, who works for a nonprofit organization in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, and built a log-cabin getaway back in the Algoma Highlands of Ontario, which became his permanent home last September. ''It's not as accessible as other options. We have black flies. The wilderness has a strong foothold here. Winters are harsh. It was minus-50 the other day.''
 Mr. Carrick said: ''We're at the end of the highway, so we get the last produce off the truck. The farther south you go, the better the lettuce looks.'' That combination helps explain why the Soo still sometimes feels like a pair of Sorel boots, a Canadian trading-post town with a Gordon Lightfoot soundtrack. The Real Estate Market
 The lettuce gap doesn't seem to bother the hunters, anglers, snowmobilers and what Pat Egan, a former newspaper publisher in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., calls the ''yuppies who want a place to cross-country ski and sip wine'' and who are nudging land prices up. ''The housing market is booming for second homes by lakes and rivers,'' said Robert J. Dumanski, a lawyer from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, who handles real estate deals. His transactions for smaller second homes -- ''We call them cottages,'' Mr. Dumanski said -- on the Canadian side average 90,000 Canadian dollars, about $77,500, at 1.16 Canadian dollars to the U.S. dollar. 
 On the American side, the average price for a second home is $225,000, said Garth MacMaster Sr., owner of MacMaster Realty in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich, but the price range is narrow. For example, a 1,500-square-foot home with 100 feet of prime Whitefish Bay sand beach recently sold for $223,500. Mr. Egan said he paid $120,000 last year for 100 feet of lake frontage and roughly half an acre in Brimley, on the Lake Superior shore 20 miles west of Sault Ste. Marie. 
 That modest price gets real estate agents reminiscing. ''When I started selling real estate, you were lucky to get $50 to $100 a foot for really nice frontage,'' Mr. MacMaster said. ''Now it's $1,600 to $1,800 a foot.''
 In hard-to-reach areas, the price can drop to below $1,000 a foot. Islands, developed and otherwise, start at $200,000. On the Ontario side, the four-acre Hatti Island and its two cottages recently sold for $299,000
 ''People around here think, 'Oh, it's so expensive,' but it's really not,'' said Bill Lynn, a former mayor of Sault Ste. Marie, Mich. ''Not compared to other places, and not for people from places like Chicago.''
 Increases in property values have been checked by the depressed Michigan economy. What's hot, real estate agents say, are small lakefront cottages that can be bought in the $75,000 to $100,000 range, torn down, then replaced with new second homes. 
 But people drawn to the Soo tend to be more interested in spiritual value than investment value. Explaining why he and his wife, Joanie, settled there after two years paddling across Canada from the Atlantic Ocean to the Beaufort Sea, Gary McGuffin, a writer and photographer who lives in Algoma Highlands near Stokely Creek, said: ''The beauty of this place is beyond description. When the sun sets over the water, it's like the west coast of British Columbia. When the sun comes up over the hills, it's like another place entirely.''LAY OF THE LANDPOPULATION -- About 16,500 on the Michigan side, according to the Census Bureau; about 75,000 on the Canadian side, the city's tourism agency says.SIZE -- The Michigan Soo is in Chippewa County, which encompasses 1,561 square miles. The Algoma country, which makes up the Canadian Soo, is 22,000 square miles.LOCATION -- The Soo starts at the northeast tip of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, 350 miles from Detroit, 475 from Chicago and 525 from Toronto.WHO'S BUYING -- Auto-industry retirees from Detroit, Chicago executives and solitude seekers from the Upper Midwest and southern Ontario.GETTING THERE -- Most people drive up Interstate 75 from points south like Chicago and Detroit. Chippewa County International Airport in Kincheloe, Mich., is the closest, but those looking to fly are best served by flying into Chicago and Detroit, then driving.WHILE YOU'RE LOOKING -- For lodging, on the Michigan side, there's the Ramada Plaza Hotel Ojibway (240 West Portage Avenue, 906-632-4100; www.waterviewhotels.com). Rooms start around $120 a night. On the Ontario side, there's Algoma's Water Tower Inn (360 Great Northern Road, 800-461-0800; www.watertowerinn.com), with rooms from 125 Canadian dollars, or about $108.
 For dining, there's Freighters Restaurant in the Hotel Ojibway, where a meal of seafood or steak is $20 to $40. In Ontario, A Thymely Manner (531 Albert Street East, 705-759-3262) offers steaks and pasta in the 25-to-35 Canadian-dollar range.

HEADLINE: Working in France, in Style of Silicon Valley

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France 

 BODY:
Jacques Souquet had gone through several start-ups in Seattle, but he still was not entirely prepared for beginning a high-tech company in his native France.
 Failure is still a no-no here, creating a challenge for any start-up. Not to mention the idea that difficulty here seems a contradiction in terms for, after all, the word ''entrepreneur'' is French.
And Mr. Souquet, 58, a compact man with a gentle manner, has a lot of rules to learn. When he once had to meet a deadline, he asked his colleagues to come in on a Sunday, which they did; but Mr. Souquet got a scolding from his lawyer, who lectured about the legal limits on the French workweek.
 Now, Mr. Souquet's company is up and running smoothly, and that is a testimony to recent changes in France and greater Europe: start-ups are no longer rare. Moreover, Europe's new entrepreneurs are turning West to learn the start-up culture bred in Silicon Valley before coming back here to apply their learning. 
 After the Internet bust, the number of European start-ups in the computer and telecommunications sectors began growing again in 2003, according to the Center for European Economic Research, in Mannheim, Germany. And venture capital is pouring into start-ups, which last year attracted about $970 million, the highest level in a decade since the Internet boom ended in 2000. 
 Overall venture capital fund-raising in Europe is more than twice the levels of 2002. In France, the number of new businesses set up last year rose 4 percent, to 233,052, over 2005, according to the Agency for the Creation of Businesses, a government body. The number of small American businesses also grew that much, at 4.5 percent, but at 671,800, there are nearly three times as many such American companies, according to the Small Business Administration.
 Mr. Souquet's experience illustrates how far the Continent has to go if it hopes to match the United States. He was able to lure eight of his 27 employees back from the United States. And after two years, he is preparing to offer his product in 2008, a device that measures the elasticity of living tissue, to assist doctors in diagnosing and treating cancer.
 Still, Aix is not Seattle. French attitudes are a bit rigid, compared with the American approach of if-at-first-you-don't-succeed. And French law, which mandates a 35-hour week, still crimps entrepreneurial flair. 
 ''In a start-up environment, you cannot work a 35-hour week,'' Mr. Souquet said, referring to the time he asked his colleagues to work on a Sunday. ''My lawyer was furious,'' he said, fearing the company could be penalized.
 Mr. Souquet also recounted that at Stanford University, where he got his Ph.D. in applied physics, one of his teachers, William Shockley, a pioneer in transistors who shared the 1956 Nobel Prize in physics, taught by discussing failed experiments. 
 ''Then he would turn to another page, showing why the experiment failed,'' Mr. Souquet said, recalling images of his professor's Bell Labs notebooks. ''He called them constructive failures.''
 Mr. Souquet's company began with a colleague's fear that France was failing to retain its scientists. Georges Charpak, the winner of the 1992 Nobel Prize in physics, came to him. 
 ''He told me, 'It's dramatic,' '' Mr. Souquet said, describing how his French colleague begged him to help stanch a drain of French talent to the United States by promoting start-ups here. ''He said his best laboratory talent was going to the United States, that he was about to lose 15 people who were being offered grants by U.C., San Diego.''
 So two years ago, Mr. Souquet began gathering patents, including several from a Russian emigre, Armen Sarvazyan, whose own start-up, Artann Laboratories, in West Trenton, N.J., held key patents for working with shear waves crucial to Mr. Souquet's device. A shear wave is so named because it moves through the body of an object, unlike a surface wave.
 At his previous start-up, SonoSite, which is based in Seattle, Mr. Souquet helped develop hand-held ultrasound devices that were essentially conventional technology, drastically miniaturized. 
 Mr. Souquet's latest device is ''a new concept,'' Mr. Sarvazyan said. ''It opens an era, not only for elasticity, but for imitating the sense of touch, the feeling of a doctor,'' which is now often crucial in diagnosing cancer.
 Mr. Souquet had broad experience in ultrasound, having worked in the United States for Varian Semiconductor, before moving to ATL Ultrasound in Seattle. Together with a small group of ATL researchers, he founded SonoSite. When Mr. Charpak approached him, Mr. Souquet was the head of research in the medical division of Philips, the Dutch electrical giant.
 Weary of the constant travel and the bureaucracy of a global giant like Philips, Mr. Souquet heeded Mr. Charpak's cry for help. His idea, as outlined on the company's Web site, is to develop a device that would use ultrasound to measure the elasticity of human tissue. 
 Since cancerous tissue loses much of its elasticity, such a device would be useful in helping diagnose and treat cancer in the breast, he said, but also the prostate gland, the thyroid and the liver.
 SuperSonic Imagine, with headquarters in a glass-and-steel corporate park outside this southern French resort city, was floated with Mr. Souquet's own savings, plus money from French government sources. Last March, a group of venture capital funds led by Credit Agricole Private Equity pumped 10 million euros ($13 million), into the company.
 Amounts of capital like this are still only a fraction of the money flowing into start-ups in the United States, but in Europe, their impact is widening. The European Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, set up in 2001, has seen its membership grow to almost 950 members. 
 Representatives of the association tell of many technology success stories, like that of Xavier Niel, 39, a entrepreneur based in Paris who in 2002 started Free, now the No. 2 Internet access engine in France, after Orange, the France Telecom unit.
 Vectrix began in Italy about a decade ago, but came into its own only in 2003 when Carlo Di Biagio, the former Ducati Motorcycle chief executive, became its boss. It is about to bring to market a novel electric-engine scooter, with a top speed of about 62 miles an hour, developed with help from about $50 million in venture capital.
 ''From the point of view of technology, this was a real innovation,'' said Alexia Perouse, director of life science investments at Credit Agricole, explaining why they gave the money to Mr. Souquet. Later this year, the venture capital funds will consider a second grant of 20 million euros, Mr. Souquet said. 
 In April, Mr. Souquet plans to talk with the Food and Drug Administration to have the devices certified. By next year, he hopes to begin delivering them.
 SuperSonic is focusing primarily on breast cancer, and its device employs different types of ultrasound waves that produce better images than existing diagnostic methods -- X-ray, ultrasound echography and magnetic resonance imaging.
 Conventional ultrasound, said Dr. Stephen B. Corn, who teaches at Harvard Medical School and is director of clinical innovation at Children's Hospital Boston, ''is not always sensitive and specific enough, particularly in cases of dense breast tissue.''
 ''It looks very intriguing,'' he said of the company's work, ''very exciting.''
 Mr. Souquet has hired a marketing director, opened an office in Seattle, and has chosen the tentative design for the first product. And his company has some of the Silicon Valley feel. People sit in open carrels, rather than closed offices; dress is casual. At lunch, employees sit around an open counter in the center of the building.
 ''It's easy in the States,'' Mr. Souquet said, still bemoaning the French hardships. ''You know what to do; you go to Barnes & Noble, you buy a book, 20 tips to create a start-up.''

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Fall for the Week, But Not as Sharply as Expected

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22 

 BODY:
The number of workers filing for first-time jobless benefits fell sharply last week, government data showed on Thursday, but the decline was smaller than expected, and economists say layoffs remained elevated because of winter storms. 
 The Labor Department said that initial jobless claims dropped 27,000, to 332,000, for the week ended Feb. 17, partially reversing a 46,000 jump in the previous week that the department had said was partly storm-induced.
 ''The labor market is still healthy, and it is consistent with the view of the Federal Reserve being on hold,'' an economist for Lehman Brothers, Michelle Meyer, said. Economists nevertheless said that the claims data was worth watching to see if the relatively high number of filings reflected a weakening labor market, and not just the effect of winter storms.
 ''It is still too soon to argue that claims are now trending higher -- data for just a two-week period, part of which was affected by severe weather, does not prove anything,'' Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., said in a research note.
 The claims figures for the week ended Feb. 10, revised up to 359,000, had been affected by winter storms that shut down areas of the Midwest and Northeast, and economists polled ahead of the report were expecting claims to fall to 325,000 in the latest week.
 The four-week moving average of new claims, a more reliable measure of employment conditions because it irons out weekly volatility, rose to 328,000 from 326,750 in the previous week.
 It was the third consecutive weekly increase and took the average to its highest level in more than two months.
 The number of workers continuing on unemployment benefits after drawing an initial week of aid fell 45,000 to a seasonally adjusted 2.51 million in the week ended Feb. 10, the most recent week the figures were available.

HEADLINE: Use of Air-Conditioning Refrigerant Is Widening the Hole in the Ozone Layer

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: MUMBAI, India 

 BODY:
Until recently, it looked like the depleted ozone layer protecting the earth from harmful solar rays was on its way to being healed.
 But thanks in part to an explosion of demand for air-conditioners in hot places like India and southern China -- mostly relying on refrigerants already banned in Europe and in the process of being phased out in the United States -- the ozone layer is proving very hard to repair.
Four months ago, scientists discovered that the ''hole'' created by the world's use of ozone-depleting gases -- in aerosol spray cans, aging refrigerators and old air-conditioners -- had expanded again, stretching once more to the record size of 2001. An unusually cold Antarctic winter, rather than the rise in the use of refrigerants, may have caused the sudden expansion, which covered an area larger than North America. 
 But it has refocused attention on the ozone layer, which protects people and other animals as well as vegetation from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. Now, the world's atmospheric scientists are concerned that the air-conditioning boom sweeping across Asia could lead to more serious problems in the future. 
 As it turns out, the fastest-growing threat to the ozone layer can be traced to people like Geeta Vittal, a resident of this hot, thriving metropolis of 18 million, who simply wants to be cooler and can now afford to make that dream a reality. 
 When her husband first proposed buying an air-conditioner eight years ago, Mrs. Vittal opposed it as a wasteful luxury. But he bought it anyway, and she liked it so much that when the Vittals moved last year to a new apartment, Mrs. Vittal insisted that five air-conditioners be installed before they moved in. 
 ''All my friends have air-conditioners now,'' she said. ''Ten years ago, no one did.''
 Rising living standards throughout India and China, the world's two most populous countries and the fastest-growing major economies, have given a lot more people the wherewithal to make their homes more comfortable. The problem is that Mrs. Vittal's air-conditioners -- along with most window units currently sold in the United States -- use a refrigerant called HCFC-22, which damages the ozone. 
 ''The emissions of things like HCFC-22: we had thought they were sufficiently in control, that we didn't have to worry about them,'' said Joe Farman, the British geophysicist who discovered the ozone hole. 
 A recent technical study by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Program found that the so-called ozone ''hole'' over Antarctica -- actually an area of unusually low ozone concentrations -- was mending more slowly than expected. 
 Scientists mostly blame chlorofluorocarbons, a chemical used in an early form of refrigerant that they now realize was released into the atmosphere in larger quantities than forecast. As a result, the international agencies now say that injury to the Earth's ozone layer could take a quarter of a century longer to heal than predicted. 
 The fastest-growing offending gas that scientists say can be better managed is HCFC-22. Nearly 200 diplomats will gather in September in Montreal to determine how to speed the timetable for the elimination of certain gases that threaten the ozone layer, in particular how to manage HCFC-22. A deadline for proposals is March 15. 
 At a meeting in Washington on Feb. 16, Bush administration officials said for the first time that they are considering four possible proposals for a faster phaseout. 
 Industrial countries currently must phase out production of HCFC-22 by 2020 and are ahead of schedule, with the United States banning domestic production in 2010. The Environmental Protection Agency is studying whether to ban imports of the gas and sales of new products using the gas by then as well. 
 By contrast, the Montreal Protocol, which governs the phaseout of ozone-depleting chemicals, allows developing countries to continue using HCFC-22 through 2040.
 China in particular is stepping up exports to the United States of air-conditioners using the chemical, often labeled as R22, especially after the European Union finished phasing out the production and import of such air-conditioners in 2004. 
 Pound for pound, HCFC-22 is only 5 percent as harmful to the ozone layer as the chlorofluorocarbons it replaced. But it still inflicts damage, especially when emitted in enormous quantities by China, now the world's dominant producer of window air-conditioners, and by India, a fast-growing market and manufacturer.
 The latest estimate from technical experts is that the chemical's output in developing countries is rising 20 percent to 35 percent each year and could continue at that pace for years: slightly over 2 percent of Indian households currently have air-conditioners, according to LG Electronics of South Korea, a giant maker of air-conditioners. 
 HCFC-22 is cheaper to install than the latest ozone-safe chemicals, which are harder and more expensive to manufacture. Lambert Kuijpers, one of three co-chairmen of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel of the Montreal Protocol, said that production of the ozone-damaging gas in the developing world is on track to increase more than fivefold in the current decade. 
 An accelerated phaseout of HCFC-22 ''is the most important'' item on the agenda, he said.
 But the trend in the developing world is working against an early phaseout. India used to impose a 32 percent luxury tax on air-conditioners but cut the tax in half over the last three years as demand from the middle class rose. Competition has also shaved prices, making air-conditioners much more affordable.
 ''There is a lot of pent-up demand,'' said Prasanna Pahade, the senior manager for corporate planning at Voltas Limited, the biggest Indian manufacturer of air-conditioners.
 In China, ownership soared to 87.2 air-conditioners per 100 urban households in September, from 24.4 seven years earlier. The countryside, home to two-thirds of the nation's population, is poised for even greater growth. In 2005, there were 6.4 air-conditioners per 100 rural households, a 35-fold increase from a decade earlier.
 Developing countries like China and India enjoy exemptions from global environmental standards. The Kyoto Protocol, which governs emissions of global-warming gases, is also lenient toward them, on the grounds that industrialized countries have released the great bulk of the offending gases and poorer countries should be allowed to catch up economically before taking on additional environmental costs.
 Some, like the Carrier Corporation, are calling for more equal standards. But Carrier has already invested in the technology to use newer chemicals and could profit from a faster phaseout of HCFC-22, which would impose greater costs on rivals in developing countries. 
 A multilateral fund under the Montreal Protocol helps developing countries convert to newer chemicals. The United States and Europe must decide if they want to increase their contributions to that fund. 
 Indian and Chinese refrigerant companies are also eligible for hundreds of millions of dollars a year under a relatively obscure United Nations program, the Clean Development Mechanism. Manufacturers receive credits for destroying a rare waste gas, produced while making HCFC-22, that is among the most powerful global-warming gases known.
 In many cases, the payments, aimed at encouraging reduction in gases that contribute to climate change, are actually worth considerably more than the cost of the HCFC-22 being produced.
 The manufacture of moremodern refrigerants does not qualify countries for global-warming credits. So HCFC-22 producers in developing countries have little incentive to switch to making newer refrigerants.
 There is some progress in sight. The State Environmental Protection Administration of China said last September that it planned to halt all production and consumption of the more damaging chlorofluorocarbons by July this year. Haier, a big Chinese manufacturer of air-conditioners, said in a statement that it had voluntarily begun shipping to the United States only models that use more advanced refrigerants, which do not damage the ozone layer.
 But huge challenges remain. The global auto industry has moved directly from the use of chlorofluorocarbons to gases that do not hurt the ozone layer, although they are powerful global-warming gases. Here in India, car factories now install air-conditioning systems that use these modern refrigerants.
 But owners of older cars, as well as people who buy new cars without air-conditioning and then decide they need it, still go to repair shops to install air-conditioners that use the worst of the chlorofluorocarbons.
 Nilesh Bothelo, the manager of a repair shop in downtown Mumbai, said that a chlorofluorocarbon-based system was so much simpler and easier to install that he charges just $600 for it. He charges twice as much for a system using the modern refrigerant.
 Indian chemical companies are happy to ship as much chlorofluorocarbons as needed, Mr. Bothelo said. When asked what the chemical looks like, he abruptly had a mechanic pour a little out of a battered metal tank onto the oil-stained ground. The milky gas flowed toward the dirt, bounced and then faded away, vanishing into the air. 
 ''If it were something so bad,'' Mr. Bothelo said, ''they would not legally sell it.''

HEADLINE: GQ Hopes to Make the 'G' Stand for Generosity

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THE term ''very GQ'' entered the vernacular long ago, evoking sartorial splendor or stylish behavior. Now, the magazine that inspired the phrase is hoping to redefine it by declaring that you are never fully dressed without a social conscience.
 To help commemorate its 50th anniversary this year, GQ magazine is starting a charitable project called the Gentlemen's Fund. The initiative is centered on a Web site that is planned to go live today, thegentlemensfund.com. It will also involve the GQ Mobile text-messaging service and events at stores like Saks Fifth Avenue. 
The singer John Legend, who is the spokesman for the fund, will encourage visitors to the Web site to make donations, to buy merchandise from marketers like Nautica and to take part in eBay auctions. All proceeds are to benefit five organizations in areas like education, men's health and the environment.
 ''When we were kids, if someone dressed nicely, we said they were GQ,'' Mr. Legend said in a telephone interview yesterday. 
 ''It's cool using the name for more than looking good,'' he added. ''If you want to be a GQ man, you should give.'' Mr. Legend said he would represent the fund without charge.
 The project will be promoted in a print and online campaign that carries the theme ''Better men. Better world.'' The fund begins with $325,000 and has a goal of raising $2 million, said Peter King Hunsinger, vice president and publisher at GQ, part of the Conde Nast Publications unit of Advance Publications.
 Mr. Hunsinger said the seed donations came from 55 contributors, including Bloomingdale's, a division of Federated Department Stores; the Carat North America media agency, part of the Aegis Group; the Gucci Group; Moet & Chandon, owned by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton; and the YouTube unit of Google.
 The project is an example of cause-related marketing or cause marketing, which is becoming increasingly popular on Madison Avenue. The idea is to burnish the image of a brand or company by forging ties with a philanthropy or charity.
 Cause marketing has been around for more than two decades, but recently seems to be gathering steam. One reason is the ardent interest in causes among younger Americans, according to Carol Cone, the chairwoman at Cone Inc. in Boston, an agency owned by the Omnicom Group that specializes in the practice.
 Mr. Hunsinger said the idea for the fund stemmed from the response to an article that ran in the December issue of GQ, ''The New Rules of Charity,'' which suggested ''that this new generation of guys wants to be involved and find a way to make a difference.''
 Another reason for the growth of cause-related marketing is its integration with the consumer culture, particularly when people are told that purchasing products they may already intend to buy will generate revenue for charities.
 Current examples include the (Product) Red campaign, supported by marketers like Apple, Gap and Motorola, which raises money for programs to prevent and treat AIDS. Some trace this aspect of the trend to entreaties from elected officials after 9/11, asserting that Americans could fight terrorism by stimulating the American economy -- shopping, in other words.
 ''We have customers who feel they are in a position to help other people,'' said Michael Macko, vice president and men's fashion director at Saks Fifth Avenue, part of Saks Inc. ''When you can tie it into the shopping experience, our customers like that very much.''
 Saks, the national retail partner for the fund, will sponsor an eight-page section in the anniversary issue of GQ, scheduled for October, and will play host to events at stores in New York, San Francisco and the Washington area. It will also promote the fund in its fall men's catalog and devote displays in six windows in October at its flagship Midtown Manhattan store to the fund and GQ.
 ''We're approached all the time to partner on things like this,'' Mr. Macko said. ''This really stood out and captured our attention, especially when you can partner with someone you have a longstanding history with.''
 His reference was to the fact that the first issue of GQ carried an ad from Saks. It was, according to Mr. Macko's files, for a black Italian suit that cost $200.
 ''It's not that dissimilar from a suit we still sell,'' Mr. Macko said, adding dryly, ''The price has changed a bit.'' One of the six window displays in October will recreate the ad.
 Shoppers on the fund's Web site will be offered a customized version of a new product, the deck shirt, from the Nautica clothing line sold by the VF Corporation. It will bear the fund's logo of a standing man along with the Nautica brand logo of a J-class sailboat.
 The customized shirts will also be sold on the Nautica Web site (www.nautica.com ). All proceeds from the sales of the shirts, costing $49.50 each, will be donated to the fund.
 ''People want to give back,'' said Denise V. Seegal, president and chief executive at the VF sportswear coalition unit of VF, ''and we're happy to support causes that highlight important men's issues.''
 Mr. Hunsinger of GQ described the five organizations that would benefit from the fund as ''great, midsized charities that could use our help to get support and awareness.''
 The charities are A Better Chance, which helps academically talented minority youngsters to attend college-preparatory schools; Career Gear, which provides training, counseling and even interview clothes for men re-entering the work force; the Design Industries Foundation Fighting AIDS, known as Diffa; Global Green USA, which is devoted to issues like climate change and safe drinking water; and Justice for Children International, which battles child exploitation and sex-trafficking.
 ''People are going to find out about us who would not otherwise,'' said John Sanful, managing director at Career Gear.
 ''And working with GQ could lead to more corporate partnerships down the line,'' he added, ''which could help us serve more men.''

HEADLINE: Some Pitches From Mussina Should Be Private

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Mike Mussina graduated from Stanford and is supposed to be an intelligent guy, but every once in a while he doesn't act that way.
 A few years ago, when the Yankees were opening the season in Japan, Mussina resented that the team had to make that trip and let everyone know it. He didn't stop complaining, and he proceeded to have a mediocre season, arguably his worst, and there was a feeling that he got himself into a mental rut over the trip and never emerged from it.
More recently, last week, Mussina publicly expressed his views about his teammate, Carl Pavano, who missed the past season and a half with a bizarre series of injuries and gave Mussina and other members of the Yankees the feeling that he was too cavalier about his rehabilitation. 
 Mussina, the Yankees' senior starting pitcher, let Pavano have it. 
 ''It didn't look good,'' he said of Pavano's lengthy hiatus, speaking to reporters at the Yankees' camp in Tampa, Fla. ''From a player's perspective and a teammate's perspective, it didn't look good.''
 Two weeks earlier at a dinner in New York, Mussina told reporters: ''I think he has to pitch and do his job and be the guy again. He needs to earn the trust from the players, the coaches, the manager and the organization.''
 Mussina was right on every count. But he was talking to the wrong people. He should have made those comments directly to Pavano. 
 With 16 years in the major leagues, Mussina has been around long enough to know how to handle a problem like the one Pavano presented. It's the sort of thing players deal with best among themselves, certainly leaving reporters out of it.
 As a reporter, I have heard my share of criticism from players about other players. Some reporters live for the moment when they can be the recipients of such comments, and some newspapers can't wait to splash them on their pages.
 Two years ago, New York reporters visiting the Boston Red Sox camp made a daily practice of asking leading questions about Alex Rodriguez, the Yankees' lightning rod, trying to get Red Sox players to criticize him. For the most part, the players avoided making inflammatory comments, but simply by responding to the questions they gave the reporters some ammunition.
 Going back even farther, in the Yankees' clubhouse of the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was no more volatile mix than Billy Martin and Reggie Jackson. Throw in a dash of Graig Nettles, a soupcon of Sparky Lyle and a few cups of George Steinbrenner, and the mix could be instantly combustible.
 Players complained that reporters were the cause of the clubhouse conflagrations -- some even credited the New York newspaper strike of 1978 with enabling the Yankees to make their memorable comeback against the Red Sox -- but it was the players who sought out reporters to express their sentiments about this player or that manager.
 Had the players kept their thoughts to themselves or shared them only with their teammates, reporters would have had less to work with. Once player A says something about player B, reporters are compelled to give player B a chance to respond. Circumstances can quickly escalate.
 It's not likely that Mussina's comments of the past few weeks will lead to any intramural bickering among the Yankees. Too many players feel the same way about Pavano that Mussina does. But that likelihood doesn't absolve Mussina of misguided behavior.
 It would have been far more appropriate for Mussina to confront Pavano face-to-face, or for Mussina and Derek Jeter, the team captain, to take Pavano aside to tell him how everyone felt. 
 ''You always prefer to keep things in house when possible,'' General Manager Brian Cashman said. ''We talk to our players a great deal about this. We tell them you can speak your mind at all times, but be aware of how it might resonate. You have to be on your A game when talking to the press.'' 
 ''I don't know if Mike regrets it or not, but you have to recognize how powerful your words will play in the public arena, locally and nationally,'' especially, he added, ''when you're operating in a fishbowl like the Yankees.''
 Mussina's comments did lead to a meeting between the two pitchers, though it was Pavano who initiated it. Mussina said he apologized to Pavano for criticizing him to reporters instead of doing it face-to-face. 
 ''It looks like something good came from his comments,'' Cashman said. ''He and Carl got together and had a chance to talk it out. They may have got a little closer rather than the other way.''
 They could have achieved the same end had Mussina gone to Pavano in the first place and not involved reporters.
 For all of the doubts Mussina and others might have had about Pavano and his string of injuries, the one aspect of his absence that should not have raised questions was the injury he sustained to his ribs in an automobile accident last August just when he seemed ready to return.
 It's quite possible that neither Mussina nor any other Yankees pitcher in Pavano's position -- on the verge of pitching again after more than a year's absence -- would have told the Yankees that he had been injured again. If Pavano could have pitched with the ailing ribs, he was going to do it. Mussina might well have done the same.
 And that, in itself, should have told Mussina something about Pavano, that he wanted to pitch badly enough that he was going to hide an injury and pitch in spite of it. Mussina, however, ignored the sign and instead thought worse of Pavano. Oh well, his Stanford degree was in economics, not in psychology.

HEADLINE: Venezuela Rivals U.S. in Aid to Bolivia

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia 

 BODY:
To understand Venezuela's growing influence here, consider that more than two dozen ambassadors are in this capital city, including those of Bolivia's leading trading partners like Brazil, the United States and Argentina. Yet none enjoy the direct conduit that the Venezuelan ambassador, Julio Montes, has established with President Evo Morales.
 Mr. Montes often accompanies Mr. Morales on domestic and international trips on executive jets provided by Venezuela's national oil company, say officials who have seen them traveling together. On many days Mr. Montes, who arrived in La Paz a year ago, can be found at the presidential palace huddled in meetings with Mr. Morales or the president's top aides. 
Since Mr. Morales became president little more than a year ago, Venezuela has quickly come to rival the United States as Bolivia's main patron. It has provided assistance for the army, cattle ranches, soybean cultivation, microfinance projects, urban sanitation companies and the oil industry.
 Perhaps most important to Washington, despite its opposition, Venezuelan financial assistance has helped Bolivia push ahead with plans to increase exports of its industrial production of coca, the main ingredient in cocaine.
 The coca financing plan has helped Venezuela accomplish one of its foreign policy goals: limiting the regional influence of the United States, which for years has provided Bolivia with millions of dollars in aid in an effort to curb coca production. The United States recently cut its drug enforcement aid to Bolivia by about 25 percent, to $33.8 million, after Mr. Morales acknowledged that the size of the country's coca-growing areas were about double official estimates.
 A senior American official here, speaking anonymously out of concern that Bolivia's already fragile relations with the United States could erode further, said it was difficult to know the exact amount of Venezuelan aid because many of the agreements between Venezuela and Bolivia were not made public.
 Citing Mr. Morales's efforts to assert greater government control over the energy industry and to rush a military agreement with Venezuela through the Bolivian Congress, the American official said, ''It is clear that Venezuela has strongly influenced policy in Bolivia.''
 Analysts who have reviewed the various Venezuelan assistance projects say the total may surpass the $120 million in antidrug and humanitarian assistance from the United States, which made Bolivia one of the largest recipients in the world of aid from Washington per capita.
 [A report in the Venezuelan newspaper El Nacional over the weekend of Feb. 17-18 said President Hugo Chavez had approved a $100 million assistance fund for Bolivia, though it was not clear whether that included assistance for military or petroleum projects.
 [''What we are doing in Bolivia is the same that Cuba has done in Venezuela,'' Mr. Montes told El Nacional, referring to the thousands of Cuban doctors and social workers who had been sent to Venezuela. ''The difference is that the greatest resource of the Cubans is their human capital. We have the possibility to help our Bolivian brothers with economic resources.'']
 Not all are pleased with Venezuela's new role. ''We've become a client state of Venezuela, in what is a new form of imperialism,'' said Oscar Ortiz, an opposition senator with the Podemos Party who has publicly criticized Bolivia's relationship with Venezuela.
 Mr. Ortiz and other opposition legislators have been particularly critical of Venezuelan ambitions that they believe may conflict with Bolivia's interests.
 For instance, even as Venezuela advises Y.P.F.B., Bolivia's national energy company, in its efforts to assert greater control over ventures with foreign energy companies, Venezuela has moved forward with its own plans to build a pipeline that would export gas to Brazil, currently the main customer for Bolivian gas.
 Political supporters of Mr. Morales argue that the alliance with Venezuela has allowed Bolivia to avoid some of the potentially detrimental effects of United States trade and drug policies in Latin America.
 ''Our comrades in Venezuela are rescuing our way of life,'' said Jeronimo Meneces Mollo, director of coca industrialization for Bolivia's government, which is receiving $250,000 in financing from Venezuela to build two coca-processing plants that will produce coca tea for exclusive export to the Venezuelan market. ''No one but Hugo Chavez is brave enough to do this.''
 Others point to a prospective trade agreement between Colombia and the United States that could ease the entry of American soybean exports to Colombia and potentially deprive Bolivian farmers of one of their key markets.
 In a boon to Mr. Morales's government, Venezuela answered the threat by announcing that it would purchase a large portion of Bolivia's soybean crop. Venezuela also says it plans to import 300 tons of Bolivian beef to meet demand in its domestic market, along with as much as 7,500 tons of beans and poultry.
 Though much of Venezuela's aid is related to agriculture, like the donation of more than 300 tractors produced by a joint Venezuelan-Iranian venture, its military assistance has attracted the most scrutiny.
 Opposition legislators are trying to overturn a military agreement reached last year that could provide Bolivia with as much as $47 million in assistance intended, among other things, to strengthen the government's presence in the eastern lowlands, where separatist sentiment runs strong.
 The International Institute for Strategic Studies, a British research group, said in a recent report that Venezuela, which is undertaking a rapid armaments buildup, could be providing Bolivia with weapons and financing for new military bases.
 Officials from both countries minimized the report, saying any military assistance was intended to assist Mr. Morales by lending him helicopters and flight crews to travel throughout Bolivia. [Citing military officials, the Bolivian newspaper La Razon reported on Feb. 19 that Venezuela was giving Bolivia two SuperPuma helicopters in a good-will gesture.]
 ''Bolivia is a tremendously poor country,'' said Gustavo Torrico, a leading supporter of Mr. Morales in Congress. ''Any help we can get is positive.''
 Not least, the Venezuelan aid has given Bolivia a source of assistance outside the International Monetary Fund, whose policies are widely criticized in much of Latin America as not having helped the poor. It has also given Mr. Morales the breathing space to carry out popular social welfare programs.
 ''The direct relationship with Chavez hasn't been problematic for Evo Morales so far,'' said Jim Shultz, executive director of the Democracy Center, a nonprofit institute in the Bolivian city of Cochabamba. ''The I.M.F. is a banker without clients in parts of Latin America.''

HEADLINE: Arab States, Wary of Iran, Add to Their Arsenals but Still Lean on the U.S.

BYLINE: By HASSAN M. FATTAH

DATELINE: ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates, Feb. 22 

 BODY:
As fears grow over the escalating confrontation between Iran and the West, Arab states across the Persian Gulf have begun a rare show of muscle flexing, publicly advertising a shopping spree for new weapons and openly discussing their security concerns. 
 Typically secretive, the gulf nations have long planned upgrades to their armed forces, but now are speaking openly about them. American military officials say the countries, normally prone to squabbling, have also increased their military cooperation and opened lines of communication to the American military here.
Patriot missile batteries capable of striking down ballistic missiles have been readied in several gulf countries, including Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, analysts say, and increasingly, the states have sought to emphasize their unanimity against Iran's nuclear ambitions.
 ''There has always been an acknowledgment of the threat in the region, but the volume of the debate has now risen,'' said one United Arab Emirates official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the subject. ''Now the message is there's a dialogue going on with Iran, but that doesn't mean I don't intend to defend myself.'' 
 The Persian Gulf monarchies and sheikdoms, mostly small and vulnerable, have long relied on the United States to protect them. The United States Fifth Fleet is based in Bahrain; the United States Central Command is based in nearby Qatar; and the Navy has long relied on docking facilities in the United Arab Emirates, which has one of the region's deepest water ports at Jebel Ali. 
 The United States, too, has begun a significant expansion of forces in the gulf, with a second United States aircraft carrier battle group led by the John C. Stennis now in the Persian Gulf and with minesweeping ships. 
 The expansion has helped calm fears among gulf governments that the United States could pull out of the region in the future, even as it has raised concerns about a potential American confrontation with Iran, accidental or intentional. 
 As tensions with Iran rise, many gulf countries have come to see themselves as the likely first targets of an Iranian attack. Some have grown more concerned that the United States may be overstretched militarily, many analysts say, while almost all the monarchies, flush with cash as a result of high oil prices, have sought to build a military deterrent of their own. 
 ''The message is first, 'U.S., stay involved here,' and second, 'Iran, we will maintain a technological edge no matter what,' '' said Emile el-Hokayem, research fellow at the Henry L. Stimson Center, a research center based in Washington. ''They are trying to reinforce the credibility of the threat of force.''
 Military officials from throughout the region descended this week on the Idex military trade fair, a semiannual event that has become the region's largest arms market, drawing nearly 900 weapons makers from around the world. They came ready to update their military capacities and air and naval defenses. They also came armed with a veiled message of resolve. 
 ''We believe there is a need for power to protect peace, and strong people with the capability to respond are the real protectors of peace,'' said Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the president of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of the emirate of Abu Dhabi, at the exposition. ''That is why we are keen to maintain the efficiency of our armed forces.'' 
 The Persian Gulf has been a lucrative market for arms. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Oman spend up to 10 percent of their gross domestic product on the military, amounting to nearly $21 billion, $4 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, estimates John Kenkel, senior director of Jane's Strategic Advisory Services. 
 If they follow through on the deals announced recently, it is estimated that countries like the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman and Saudi Arabia will spend up to $60 billion this year. The biggest buyer in 2006, according to the defense industry journal Defense News, was Saudi Arabia, which has agreed to buy 72 Eurofighter Typhoon combat jets for $11 billion. It also has a $400 million deal to upgrade 12 Apache AH-64A helicopters to the Longbow standard. The kingdom also reportedly plans to acquire cruise missiles, attack helicopters and tanks, all for a total of $50 billion.
 Kuwait reportedly bought 24 Apache Longbow helicopters, while the United Arab Emirates has continued to take delivery of 80 F-16 Block 60 fighters, with plans to buy air tankers, missile defense batteries and airborne early warning systems. Bahrain ordered nine UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters in an estimated $252 million deal, while Oman reportedly bought 30 antitank rocket launchers in a $48 million purchase and is planning a naval overhaul. 
 ''It is a message to enemies that 'We are taking defense seriously,' '' Mr. Kenkel said, emphasizing that the new arms were for deterrence. 
 ''If the U.S. ever does pull back, these countries in the gulf have realized, they may have to fend for themselves,'' Mr. Kenkel said. ''As the Boy Scouts say, always be prepared.''
 The most marked change is in the public nature of the acquisitions, which previously would have been kept secret, many analysts here said, itself a form of deterrence. 
 ''They have been doing these kinds of purchases since the '90s,'' said Marwan Lahoud, chief executive of the European missile maker MBDA. ''What has changed is they are stating it publicly. The other side is making pronouncements so they have to as well,'' he said, speaking of Iran's recent announcements about its weapons capacity. 
 Senior United States military officials say gulf countries have become more nervous as Iran has conducted naval maneuvers, especially near the Straits of Hormuz, the main artery through which two-fifths of the world's oil reaches markets. 
 ''A year ago you could have characterized the interaction with the Iranians as professional,'' said Vice Adm. Patrick Walsh, departing commander of the Fifth Fleet. ''What's different today has been the number and amount of exercises and the proximity of those exercises to the Straits of Hormuz themselves.''
 The exercises were among the reasons for the expansion of Navy forces in the region, he said, but have also raised alarm about the potential for accidents to lead to an unintended war.
 Admiral Walsh said that American warships remained in international waters, and that Iranian and American ships kept close watch on one another. Some critics of the Bush administration have alleged that the increased military presence in the gulf risks igniting a conflict.
 Admiral Walsh said the increased American presence was aimed at o reassuring gulf states that the United States remained committed to their security, but also welcomed their efforts to build deterrence.
 ''We have found that we need to be physically present to prevent such armed behavior,'' he said of the Iranian maneuvers. ''We're mindful we're not giving up any water, but also being careful not to take a provocative stance.''

HEADLINE: Grades Rise, but Reading Skills Do Not

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22 

 BODY:
High school students nationwide are taking seemingly tougher courses and earning better grades, but their reading skills are not improving through the effort, according to two federal reports released here Thursday that cite grade inflation as a possible explanation. 
 The National Assessment of Educational Progress, an exam commonly known as the nation's report card, found that the reading skills of 12th graders tested in 2005 were significantly worse than those of students in 1992, when a comparable test was first given, and essentially flat since students previously took the exam in 2002.
The test results also showed that the overwhelming majority of high school seniors have not fully mastered high-school-level math. 
 At the same time, however, grade-point averages have risen nationwide, according to a separate survey by the National Assessment, of the transcripts of 26,000 students, which compared them with a study of students' coursework in 1990. 
 ''There's a disconnect between what we want and expect our 12th graders to know and do, and what our schools are actually delivering through instruction in the classroom,'' David W. Gordon, the superintendent of schools in Sacramento, said at a news conference announcing the results. 
 The reports offered several rationales for the disparity between rising grade-point averages and tougher coursework on the one hand and stagnant reading scores on the other, including ''grade inflation, changes in grading standards'' or the possibility that student grades were being increasingly affected by things like classroom participation or extra assignments.
 The National Assessment of Educational Progress is considered the yardstick for academic performance because it is the only test taken all across the country. The test of 12th-grade achievement was given to a representative sample of 21,000 high school seniors attending 900 public and private schools from January to March 2005. 
 It showed that the share of 12th-grade students lacking even basic high school reading skills -- meaning they could not, for example, extract data about train fares at different times of day from a brochure -- rose to 27 percent from 20 percent in 1992. 
 The share of students proficient in reading dropped to 35 percent from 40 percent in 1992. At the same time, the gap between boys and girls grew, with girls' reading skills more than a year ahead those of boys.
 In math, only 23 percent of all 12th graders were proficient, but the exam has been revamped, so the results could not be compared with those from earlier years, officials said. The new test has fewer questions requiring arithmetic and more using algebra and geometry. Some 39 percent of 12th graders lacked even basic high school math skills. 
 These results came about even though the separate study of transcripts showed that 12th graders in 2005 averaged 360 more hours of classroom instruction during their high school years than students had in 1990. 
 Their overall grade-point average was 2.98 -- just shy of a B. That was one-third of a letter grade higher than in 1990. The share of students taking a standard curriculum or better, intended to prepare them for college, jumped to 68 percent from 40 percent. 
 In math, girls had higher grades than boys, and closed the achievement gap, scoring about as well as boys did on the national assessment. Boys who had taken advanced math and science courses, however, scored higher than girls who had also taken such courses.
 The Bush administration, which has been pressing to expand testing in high school under the federal education law, No Child Left Behind, seized upon the results as proof that high schools were not measuring up.
 ''The consensus for strengthening our high schools has never been stronger,'' Margaret Spellings, the secretary of education, said in a statement released in advance of the report. ''Schools must prepare students to succeed in college and the 21st-century work force.''
 Just how students can be getting better grades in classes that are supposedly more challenging yet lag in reading may become clearer in the future. Mark Schneider, the commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics, the branch of the Education Department that administers the exams, had also collected a warehouse full of course descriptions, reading lists and textbooks to investigate the actual content of classes students are taking. 
 The Education Trust, a nonprofit group representing urban schools, attributed the disparity to a kind of academic false advertising, saying that schools may seem to offer the same courses to all students, but that the content of those courses is sometimes less demanding for poor and minority children.
 For example, the group found, a ninth-grade English teacher at one school assigned students a two- to three-page essay comparing the themes of Homer's ''Odyssey'' to those in the movie ''O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' At the same school, assignments in another class covering the same material were considerably less demanding. There, students broke up into three clusters, with one designing a brochure for ''Odyssey Cruises,'' another drawing pictures and the third making up a crossword using characters from the ''Odyssey.'' 
 ''Just slapping new names on courses with weak curriculum and ill-prepared teachers won't boost achievement,'' Kati Haycock, the Education Trust's president, said.

HEADLINE: Colorless Green Ideas

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
The factual debate about whether global warming is real is, or at least should be, over. The question now is what to do about it. 
 Aside from a few dead-enders on the political right, climate change skeptics seem to be making a seamless transition from denial to fatalism. In the past, they rejected the science. Now, with the scientific evidence pretty much irrefutable, they insist that it doesn't matter because any serious attempt to curb greenhouse gas emissions is politically and economically impossible.
Behind this claim lies the assumption, explicit or implicit, that any substantial cut in energy use would require a drastic change in the way we live. To be fair, some people in the conservation movement seem to share that assumption. 
 But the assumption is false. Let me tell you about a real-world counterexample: an advanced economy that has managed to combine rising living standards with a substantial decline in per capita energy consumption, and managed to keep total carbon dioxide emissions more or less flat for two decades, even as both its economy and its population grew rapidly. And it achieved all this without fundamentally changing a lifestyle centered on automobiles and single-family houses. 
 The name of the economy? California.
 There's nothing heroic about California's energy policy -- but that's precisely the point. Over the years the state has adopted a series of conservation measures that are anything but splashy. They're the kind of drab, colorless stuff that excites only real policy wonks. Yet the cumulative effect has been impressive, if still well short of what we really need to do.
 The energy divergence between California and the rest of the United States dates from the 1970s. Both the nation and the state initially engaged in significant energy conservation after that decade's energy crisis. But conservation in most of America soon stalled: after a decade of rapid progress, improvements in auto mileage came to an end, while electricity consumption continued to rise rapidly, driven by the growing size of houses, the increasing use of air-conditioning and the proliferation of appliances. 
 In California, by contrast, the state continued to push policies designed to encourage conservation, especially of electricity. And these policies worked.
 People in California have always used a bit less energy than other Americans because of the mild climate. But the difference has grown much larger since the 1970s. Today, the average Californian uses about a third less total energy than the average American, uses less than 60 percent as much electricity, and is responsible for emitting only about 55 percent as much carbon dioxide.
 How did the state do it? In some cases conservation was mandated directly, through energy efficiency standards for appliances and rules governing new construction. Also, regulated power companies were given new incentives to promote conservation, via rule changes that ''decoupled'' their profits from the amount of electricity they sold. 
 And yes, a variety of state actions had the effect of raising energy prices. In the early 1970s, the price of electricity in California was close to the national average. Today, it's about 50 percent higher.
 Incidentally, since someone is bound to mention it: the California energy crisis of 2000-2001 has nothing to do with this story. That crisis was caused by market manipulation -- we've got it on tape -- made possible by ill-conceived deregulation, not conservation.
 Back to California's success. As the higher price of power indicates, conservation didn't come free. Still, it's striking how invisible California's energy policy remains. It's easy to see why New York has much lower per capita energy consumption than, say, Georgia: it's a matter of high-rises versus sprawl, mass transit versus driving alone. It's less obvious that Los Angeles is a much greener city than Atlanta. But it is. 
 So is California a role model for climate policy? No and yes. Even if America as a whole had matched California's conservation efforts, we'd still be emitting about as much carbon dioxide now as we were in 1990. That's too much. 
 But California's experience shows that serious conservation is a lot less disruptive, imposes much less of a burden, than the skeptics would have it. And the fact that a state government, with far more limited powers than those at Washington's disposal, has been able to achieve so much is a good omen for our ability to do a lot to limit climate change, if and when we find the political will.

HEADLINE: Insanity vs. Malice as Motives of Rampage

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
When Steven Johnson, an unemployed barber who has AIDS, stormed an East Village bar in 2002 armed with a samurai sword, three pistols and kerosene, by most accounts he was propelled by one thought: He would die in a fusillade of police bullets, and his family would then be able to sell his prophetic words and use the proceeds to start a new life.
 Only it did not happen that way. He did not die. He did not kill anyone. His family did not sell his story. And now he is on trial -- for a second time -- on charges of hate crimes, assault and the attempted murder of a police officer. As for the fame he sought, that seems nonexistent as well: aside from an initial burst of attention, his trial has taken place in an all but empty courtroom. 
In the early hours of June 16, 2002, Mr. Johnson took the subway from his housing project in Brooklyn to the East Village, looking for ''happy people'' and seeking to avenge the oppression of black people like him, according to a statement he later gave to the police.
 He shot and wounded three people and sprayed several patrons with kerosene at Bar Veloce on Second Avenue, threatening to set them on fire. He was eventually tackled by two women in the bar, then shot and wounded by the police.
 To the prosecution, this is a case of attempted ''suicide by cop'' by a man with a record of weapons and drug arrests going back two decades. He may have been antisocial, the prosecutor said, but he was not mentally ill; he rationally, calculatingly, set out to harm others and gain fame for himself and fortune for his family. 
 To the defense, these were the acts of a madman, who is so delusional that he cannot be held legally responsible for what he did.
 Prosecutors have given the jury a copy of a long suicide note that Mr. Johnson left behind for his 10-year-old son, telling him, ''Trust me, you will be famest and a star just cause of me, and cause I follow Gods word.''
 During the closing argument yesterday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, the prosecutor, Peter Hinckley, played a tape of Mr. Johnson giving himself a kind of pep talk as he prepared to take his journey to the East Village.
 Mr. Johnson could be heard talking in a slow, quiet, hypnotic voice, telling himself that he had God on his side, and urging himself on by saying, ''Pull your guns on these crackers, son.'' In the background, the incongruous sound of a child's happy, playful voice was heard as Mr. Johnson carried on his monologue.
 Mr. Johnson's lawyer, Michelle Gelernt, of the Legal Aid Society, told the jury in her closing argument that Mr. Johnson's words in the suicide note and on the tape were clear evidence that he was delusional.
 ''Somehow, his taking those white people hostage and burning them alive and having police kill him would cause a revolution,'' she said, while anybody in his right mind, she argued, would expect no such thing.
 But to Mr. Hinckley, the prosecutor, Mr. Johnson's words were evidence not of mental illness but of a widespread phenomenon familiar to anyone who watches ''American Idol'' on television.
 Mr. Johnson was simply media-crazed, and determined to get his 15 minutes of fame, the prosecutor said.
 ''The defendant didn't have any command hallucinations,'' or orders from God telling him to kill white people, Mr. Hinckley said. Rather, ''he knew he would create media attention'' by shooting up a bar, and he wanted his family to profit from his 15 minutes of ''notoriety.''
 Mr. Hinckley rattled off a long list of other people he said were similarly obsessed by fame, perhaps criminal in some cases but not insane. The list included Mel Gibson, Osama bin Laden, Timothy McVeigh, abortion clinic bombers, Palestinian and Iraqi suicide bombers, members of the Aryan Nations, and any number of amateur singers competing on ''American Idol.''
 ''They are clearly grandiose and have strongly and passionately held beliefs,'' he said, but they were not delusional in the clinical sense.
 Mr. Hinckley was scheduled to end his closing argument today, before the case goes to a jury for the second time. Mr. Johnson's first trial ended in a mistrial in November 2004, when the jury deadlocked after two and a half weeks of deliberations.
 Yesterday, Ms. Gelernt said Mr. Johnson, who is 39, had told a psychologist that he had a ''sixth sense'' and that he believed that people were ''scheming on him.'' She urged the jury to interpret that sixth sense as something spiritual, a connection to God, while the prosecution's psychiatric expert dismissed the phrase as a synonym for ''street sense.''
 Ms. Gelernt described part of Mr. Johnson's past that could have been a chapter from ''The Fortress of Solitude,'' the acclaimed novel about a black boy and a white boy growing up in Brooklyn who fancy themselves superheroes. She said that Mr. Johnson's mother had taught him to sew when he was a teenager, and that he sewed costumes of Spider-Man and Superman for himself. It was not clear, she said, whether he actually wore those costumes on the street, but certainly he had fantasized about being a superhero.
 She quoted Mr. Johnson, who is black, telling psychologists, ''There's no war in the ghetto, but there's a war in my mind,'' and that he was ''throwing rocks of words'' as a way of educating people to the oppression of black people by white people.
 Mr. Hinckley, however, argued that if Mr. Johnson was trying to get revenge on white people, he would not have been cooperative with the white staff at the hospital and jail where he was held, or with his white defense lawyers.
 He said that while Mr. Johnson had a history of what he called ''conduct disorders,'' like fighting with other children and breaking things in childhood, he had not been hospitalized for psychiatric problems as an adult.
 Mr. Johnson's actions were criminal and antisocial, he said, but not driven by mental illness. They were, he said, ''the actions of a sane, manipulative man, fully aware of what he did.''

HEADLINE: Current Hedge Fund Rules Work, Regulators Say

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 22 -- The Bush administration and senior regulators said today that there was no need for new regulations that would make the rapidly growing hedge fund industry more transparent or subject to greater oversight, or to protect the financial system from the collapse of a large fund company.
 Market discipline and risk awareness, the regulators said, will best protect investors and the economy from any problems in the hedge fund industry. 
 To that end, the administration and the regulators proposed that investors, hedge fund companies and their lenders adopt nonbinding guidelines that they said could make the hedge fund companies more transparent and their investors and creditors more vigilant to shady operators and excessive risk-takers. 
 Today's decision, which followed months of study by a presidential working group, reflected both the strong antiregulatory philosophy of the administration and the formidable new clout and influence of the wealthy hedge fund industry. Three of the major economic policy makers in Washington -- Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Robert K. Steel, who is the under secretary of the Treasury, and Joshua Bolton, the White House chief of staff -- are all alumni of Goldman Sachs, which in the last decade has evolved into perhaps the most significant player in the private equities market.
 The explosive growth of hedge funds into an industry with more than $1 trillion in assets has made them an icon in popular culture, a huge source of philanthropy to the nation's museums and orchestras, and a major new force in political campaigns. Millions of Americans do not qualify to make investments in the funds, which are pools of largely unregulated assets, but they are unknowingly exposed to the risks associated with hedge funds through their pension and retirement accounts.
 As hedge funds have grown, and as there have been instances of large collapses shaking the markets, pressures have mounted to impose greater regulation on them. 
 But today's decision not to do so represents a different approach to that undertaken by Washington for publicly traded companies, which in the last five years have faced a battery of new governance, auditing and disclosure rules following the scandals at Enron, WorldCom and other large companies.
 A previous effort by the Securities and Exchange Commission to make the funds more transparent by requiring them to register with the government failed last June, when a federal appeals court ruled that the agency did not have the authority to regulate them. The agency decided not to appeal the decision, and instead is preparing to write a regulation that would raise the net worth requirements for investors in such funds. That proposed regulation is not affected by today's announcement.
 Today, the president's working group, led by Mr. Paulson, instead proposed a series of nonbinding principles that put the onus primarily on companies, investors and the buyers and sellers of their complex securities to impose what he and other officials called a ''market discipline'' that should be adequate to protect investors and the marketplace. 
 Among the nonbinding principles were two aimed at investors, saying they should not expose themselves to risk levels they cannot tolerate and that they should evaluate the background and experience of fund managers. At a briefing this afternoon, a senior Treasury Department official involved in drafting the principles said that no new regulations had been proposed because the administration did not want to discourage innovation and risk-taking.
 ''We want to encourage risk-taking in an organized fashion,'' said the official, who spoke only on condition of not being identified. The announcement was hailed by a major trade association for the funds and for companies involved in the derivatives markets.
 ''The agreement highlights the central role that market discipline plays in addressing the question of systemic risk and encourages regulators, investors, counterparties and investment pools alike to be proactive in assuring the healthy functioning of the markets,'' said Robert G. Pickel, the executive director of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. 
 The association said the agreement among the agencies and the administration '' represented significant progress in both understanding the challenges posed by a more dynamic and liquid market, as well as encouraging measures which will ensure that the benefits presented by the global financial markets continue well into the future.''
 But other experts said the guidelines would have limited effect. 
 ''They are regulating around the peripheries,'' said Jay G. Baris, a securities lawyer with Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel in New York. ''They are turning up the heat on disclosures, on fiduciaries to determine suitability and on risk management. But they are going to stop short of substantive regulation of hedge funds or of unregistered hedge fund advisers.''

HEADLINE: After the Fall, Italy Considers Its Options

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER; Peter Kiefer contributed reporting from Rome, and Elisabetta Povoledo from Milan.

DATELINE: ROME, Feb. 22 

 BODY:
The government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi was born weak, so its death on Wednesday was not exactly a surprise. But the day after, there was nonetheless a sense of wonder that it had all come apart at one stroke, that Italy had again inflicted upon itself a crisis with no clear outcome. 
 ''I really didn't calculate this,'' Senator Giulio Andreotti, 88, who has been prime minister of Italy seven times, and who is one of the nation's canniest politicians, told the newspaper La Repubblica. ''I didn't understand that without my vote, the government would fall.'' 
But it did fall, after a crucial vote on the nation's foreign policy failed in the Senate and Mr. Prodi resigned. On Thursday, work began to see if it could be put back together -- or if Italy should return to the polls, as the center-right opposition, led by the former prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, would like. 
 ''No one has the majority -- what else can we do?'' Umberto Bossi, leader of the Northern League, a party allied with Mr. Berlusconi, told the ANSA news agency. 
 With the stakes high, and power very much up for grabs, President Giorgio Napolitano on Thursday began two days of consultation with leaders of the nation's political parties and of key institutions. Those talks, which are expected to end Friday evening, will determine whether he will ask Mr. Prodi to try again or whether he will seek an entirely new government. 
 Mr. Prodi made it clear on Thursday that he did not want the job again unless the far-left members of his unstable, nine-party coalition backed his agenda completely. 
 Internal bickering had run high for much of the government's nine months in power. But the pressures exploded Wednesday when two Communist senators refused to back the government's policy of keeping Italian troops in Afghanistan and the expansion of an American base in Vicenza in northern Italy.
 ''In the last months, we have had a sort of opposition in-house,'' said Silvio Sircana, Mr. Prodi's spokesman. ''What he is asking is, 'Let's not go on the same way that we worked in the last few months.' It's a nightmare. We can't go on this way.''
 But even Mr. Sircana expressed skepticism that the far-left parties could guarantee their loyalty, as high as passions run on issues like Afghanistan and the United States base. Many experts argue that almost any rejiggered Prodi government would probably be even weaker than the one that just fell.
 [Reuters reported late Thursday that leaders of the center-left coalition had agreed to support Mr. Prodi staying on as prime minister, backing him on a 12-point political program. ''We have all agreed to the program so that he can continue to govern,'' Mr. Sircana said.]
 Many political experts focused on the possibility that Mr. Prodi would step aside in favor of a government of technocrats. In theory, that government would rule briefly, ushering the nation toward elections after making changes to the electoral law that is blamed for creating such a small majority in the Senate. 
 ''A technical government would be the most intelligent solution, but I don't think that intelligence has necessarily marked the decisions of our lawmakers,'' said Giovanni Sartori, a leading political columnist. ''It's certainly the only solution.''
 Despite the calls from the right, it seemed unlikely that Mr. Napolitano would immediately call elections. He has said he will not do so until the election law is changed. 
 Over all in Italy, there was a discomforting sense of business as usual, a feeling that the fall of the nation's 61st government since 1945 seemed a more normal event than its long-term survival. Many Italians reacted with only weary concern. 
 ''It's not the first time,'' lamented Franco Iacoponi, 74, a retiree, carrying his groceries in downtown Rome. ''I have seen too many of these, fallen government, early elections.'' 
 But faced with a government that fell only nine months after it took office, politicians of all stripes, business leaders and many ordinary Italians wondered why Italy, in particular, seemed trapped in instability. 
 ''Government commits suicide: Italy humiliated,'' ran a blood-red headline in Il Foglio, a conservative daily.
 ''We are a nation of madmen,'' Massimo D'Alema, the nation's foreign minister, who had urged the government to resign if the Senate did not pass the foreign policy measure, was quoted as saying in La Repubblica.
 And Luca Montezemolo, the chairman of Fiat and president of Ferrari, warned Thursday that Italian politics was being left behind by parts of the nation that actually functioned. The economy is growing, and many businesspeople are the ones showing the ''excellence'' that the nation is capable of, he said. 
 ''The risk is that that there may be Italians, but there may not be an Italy,'' he told reporters in Bologna.

HEADLINE: Officials Reject More Oversight Of Hedge Funds

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said Thursday that there was no need for greater government oversight of the rapidly growing hedge fund industry and other private investment groups to protect the nation's financial system.
 Instead, the administration, in an agreement it reached with the independent regulatory agencies, announced that investors, hedge fund companies and their lenders could adequately take care of themselves by adhering to a set of nonbinding principles.
The principles, many already being followed by the sharpest investors and best-run companies, say that investors should not take risks they cannot tolerate and should carefully evaluate the strategies and management skills of hedge funds. They also call for funds to make clear and meaningful disclosures to investors. 
 The decision came after months of study by a presidential working group of top officials and regulators. They looked at both the hedge fund industry, which has more than $1 trillion in assets, and the management of private equity firms, which take direct control and ownership of companies rather than relying on large numbers of outside stockholders. 
 The group's conclusions reflected both the strong antiregulatory ideology of the administration and the formidable influence of Wall Street and the increasingly wealthy hedge fund industry among both Democrats and Republicans in Washington.
 Three of the administration's most senior economic policy makers -- Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., his top deputy, Robert K. Steel, and White House chief of staff Joshua Bolten -- are alumni of Goldman Sachs, which in the last decade has evolved into one of the most important players in the private equity market. 
 As hedge funds have grown both in the United States and globally, and as periodic collapses have shaken the markets and caused investors to lose money, pressures have increased to impose greater regulation on them. But supporters say that the hedge fund industry had grown more sophisticated in recent years, is well equipped to manage risks, and that none of the failures have harmed the nation's financial system.
 The explosive growth in recent years of private equity investment and hedge funds has made their managers symbols of new wealth, a huge source of philanthropy to the nation's museums, hospitals and orchestras, and a major new force in political campaigns.
 Millions of Americans do not qualify to make investments in hedge funds, which are pools of largely unregulated assets, but they are exposed to the risks associated with hedge funds through their pensions and personal retirement accounts.
 The decision to avoid demanding more openness from private funds represents a starkly different approach to that undertaken by Washington for publicly traded companies, which in the last five years have faced a battery of new governance, auditing and disclosure rules following the scandals at Enron and other large companies.
 The working group rejected any proposal that would give the government the ability to inspect the books and records of hedge funds or force the funds to make regular reports about their activities. Both banks and brokerage firms must adhere to stringent rules that give regulators great leeway in supervising them.
 While the working group never considered anything as strict, many hedge funds oppose even minimal oversight because they say it could slow their ability to make lightning-fast investment decisions or reveal trading strategies to rivals. 
 A previous effort by the Securities and Exchange Commission to protect investors by requiring hedge funds to register with the government failed last summer. In June, a federal appeals court ruled that the agency did not have the authority to regulate them.
 In leading a deeply divided commission to adopt those rules in the first place, its then chairman, William H. Donaldson, said that hedge funds had been central figures in a variety of market trading abuses and that registration was a modest and essential way for regulators to begin to understand them. Although he had the support of two of the four other commissioners for his efforts on hedge funds, Mr. Donaldson came under heavy criticism from Republican lawmakers and top administration officials for suggesting that regulators shine a light on what he called ''a dark corner'' of the market.
 Under its new chairman, Christopher Cox, the commission decided not to appeal the court decision that struck down the rules. Instead the agency is preparing to write a new regulation that would require investors in such funds to have greater personal wealth. That proposed regulation is not affected by today's announcement.
 On Thursday, the president's working group, led by Mr. Paulson, proposed a series of nonbinding principles that put the onus primarily on companies, investors and the buyers and sellers of their complex securities to impose a ''market discipline'' that should be adequate to protect investors and the marketplace. Officials said those principles would make the hedge fund companies more transparent and their investors and creditors more vigilant to shady operators and excessive risk-takers.
 At a briefing Thursday, a senior Treasury Department official involved in drafting the principles suggested that any new regulations would discourage innovation and risk-taking. The official said he would only speak on condition that he not be identified because the new guidelines were the product of a group of agencies. 
 Officials acknowledged that many of the principles that were advanced by the administration and the regulators would seem obvious to smart investors and properly managed hedge funds. 
 ''Private pools of capital can be an appropriate investment vehicle for more sophisticated investors,'' read one of the main principles that the officials and agencies agreed upon. ''Because these pools can involve complex, illiquid or opaque investments and investment strategies that are not fully disclosed, the risk associated with direct investment in these pools are most appropriately borne by investors with the sophistication to identify, analyze and bear these risks.''
 The report said that the concerns of less sophisticated investors in pension and retirement vehicles could best be addressed ''through sound practices on the part of the fiduciaries that manage such vehicles.'' 
 The announcement was hailed by several trade groups for the hedge funds and other companies involved in trading complex financial instruments.
 ''The President's Working Group has taken a thoughtful and judicious approach to many of the investor protection and systemic risk issues which surround hedge funds,'' said Micah S. Green, co-chief executive of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, which represents hundreds of Wall Street firms.
 ''Too often, regulators reach immediately for new laws or rules which can have the unintended consequence of stifling innovation or smothering markets,'' Mr. Green said. ''By instead providing principles and guidelines, the President's Working Group has recognized the importance of flexibility and efficiency in a healthy marketplace.''
 But other experts said the guidelines would have limited effect. 
 ''They are regulating around the peripheries,'' said Jay G. Baris, a securities lawyer with Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel in New York. ''They are turning up the heat on disclosures, on fiduciaries to determine suitability, and on risk management. But they are going to stop short of substantive regulation of hedge funds or of unregistered hedge fund advisers.''
 The reaction in Congress, which is in recess this week, was largely muted.
 Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrats who heads the House Financial Services Committee, called the announcement ''a first step in addressing questions presented by the significant growth of hedge funds.''
 ''Steps are being taken to increase investor protection,'' Mr. Frank added, ''and I believe the appropriate committee in the House and the Senate should be working with the Presidential Working Group and others for the further study and monitoring of both issues.'' 
 A similar statement was issued by Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who heads the Senate Banking Committee.
 There is no expectation that Congress will adopt legislation on the subject any time soon.

HEADLINE: South Korean Gets 5 Years For Dealings With Iraqis

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Tongsun Park, a once flamboyant South Korean businessman convicted of illegally representing Saddam Hussein in trying to influence the United Nations oil-for-food program, was sentenced yesterday to five years in prison. 
 Judge Denny Chin of Federal District Court in Manhattan said Mr. Park had ''blatantly disregarded the law'' by taking more than $2 million for trying to lobby United Nations officials to ease sanctions against Iraq.
''You acted out of greed, acted to profit from what was supposed to be a humanitarian program,'' Judge Chin told Mr. Park. He also fined him $15,000 and ordered him to forfeit $1.2 million. 
 The judge called the sentence ''harsh'' for a 71-year-old man with health problems. But he also said it was ''appropriate.''
 Mr. Park was found guilty last July. He was the first defendant to go to trial in connection with a scandal that involved cash from Iraq in diplomatic pouches, ''back-channel communications'' to the United Nations secretary general at the time, and even a scheme to bribe him.
 The oil-for-food program was intended to ease some aspects of the sanctions imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990. Under it, Mr. Hussein's government could use the money from limited oil sales to buy aid supplies -- food, medicine and other nonmilitary staples. 
 Federal prosecutors said Mr. Park had even had a hand in influencing the negotiations that gave birth to the aid program in 1995. But they said he never registered as an agent for Mr. Hussein's government, as required under federal law.
 Judge Chin focused on the money that passed through Mr. Park's hands, and on the money that he pocketed. The judge said Mr. Park had accepted ''manila folders filled with $100 bills'' and had once gone to Iraq to pick up $700,000 in cash.
 Mr. Park's lawyer, Michael S. Kim, said Mr. Park had decided not to say anything in court because of ''advanced age, frail health and his desire to get his life back on track.'' Mr. Park said at the time of his arrest that he had diabetes and high blood pressure and had just had a kidney transplant. 
 The sentencing came hours after Judge Chin refused a request from four other defendants to dismiss separate fraud and conspiracy charges. They have pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial.
 Mr. Park, who was also a central figure in a Congressional bribery scandal in the 1970s that became known as Koreagate, was arrested 13 months ago. Mexican immigration officials took him into custody at the Mexico City airport.
 As prosecutors prepared their case against Mr. Park, an independent panel led by Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, concluded that at the time of his activities for Iraq, Mr. Park was something of an informal adviser to the United Nations secretary general at the time, Boutros Boutros-Ghali. 
 The report said Mr. Park and a business partner, Samir A. Vincent, had worked out an arrangement with officials of Mr. Hussein's government and would receive millions of dollars in cash.

HEADLINE: Running on a Resume Both Local and National

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL and DAN FROSCH

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M. 

 BODY:
When a governor runs for president, local issues can suddenly loom large. Take cockfighting. Gov. Bill Richardson has come out against it after ignoring the question for years.
 Concerned that New Mexico suffers for being the sole state other than Louisiana to permit wagering contests pitting weaponed birds in fights to the death, Mr. Richardson has taken sides in the emotional debate, speaking out for a ban, to be debated on Saturday in the Legislature.
''I believe the people of the state want to abolish it,'' the governor, a Democrat, said in his art-bedecked office. ''It's a bad image nationally. I'm putting my weight on it. It's going to make it pass, and it's the right thing to do.''
 With portfolios as a congressman, global troubleshooter and energy czar, Mr. Richardson, 59, may rightly claim the broadest resume of the declared presidential candidates. 
 He served seven terms in the House until joining the Clinton administration as ambassador to the United Nations and then energy secretary before being elected governor in 2002.
 But as he makes his case for the Democratic nomination, he is likely to be judged in large measure by his four years as governor, a record that has won him friends and foes.
 He acknowledged being far back in the polls and unlikely to match leading rivals' fund-raising.
 ''I'm not going to be competitive in that area with the top-tier candidates,'' Mr. Richardson said. ''But I'm going to have enough to win.''
 He said he would wage ''an old-fashioned grass-roots campaign'' based on his resume.
 ''Who's the best person to get us out of Iraq?'' he asked. ''Who's the best person to restore America's international standing? The best person to create jobs? I believe I have the experience. I've done all these things everyone's talked about.''
 Hispanic -- his mother was born in Mexico -- in one of only three states where Anglos are no longer a majority (California and Texas are the others), Mr. Richardson won re-election as governor in November with a record 69 percent of the vote.
 An imposing, exuberant figure with a relish for attention, he enjoys near-celebrity status in New Mexico, where his comings and goings -- like being driven around in a speeding S.U.V. and holding court at a popular capital watering hole -- routinely dominate the news.
 Under Mr. Richardson, New Mexico, long ranked near the bottom of almost every social index, has made advances. With his pressing for higher wages for educators, teachers' salaries have moved from 46th in the nation in 2000 to 39th in 2006, the highest since the mid-'80s, the National Education Association says.
 Since Mr. Richardson took office, unemployment is down, to 3.8 percent from 5.8 percent, according to the federal Labor Department. New Mexico is 10th in economic growth, according to a report by the Federal Funds Information Service for States, affiliated with the National Governors Association and the National Conference of State Legislators.
 Mr. Richardson has also pushed hard to make New Mexico, with its dust-swept mesas and high-desert peaks, a choice location for Hollywood. According to the New Mexico Film Office, more than 60 movies and television programs have been shot here since he became governor.
 And he positioned New Mexico for the private space age by carving a spaceport out of the desert alongside the White Sands Missile Range.
 He persuaded Mexican authorities to bulldoze a human-smuggling base across from Columbus and declared the first governor's state of emergency on the border, freeing $1 million a year for extra patrols. But the state is also broadly tolerant of immigrants, issuing driver's licenses without regard to legal residency.
 ''Richardson has positioned himself as hard to cubbyhole,'' Brian Sanderoff, a leading pollster, said. ''The minute you think he's liberal, he does something conservative.''
 Critics say Mr. Richardson can be vindictive, penalizing opponents by holding up their projects or grants.
 ''He rules the roost,'' Lonna Atkeson, a professor of political science at the University of New Mexico, said. ''He takes things away when people are not so nice.''
 Told that some people called his politics rough, Mr. Richardson blurted, ''Who's saying that?''
 Then he said: ''No, no. Look, I'm aggressive. I get things done. I believe I'm a good manager.''
 The governor has also been lucky. State coffers are overflowing, with much of the revenue generated by oil and gas resources. His proposed budget calls for $123 million in tax cuts, a 9 percent increase in spending for primary and secondary schools and a 7.4 percent increase in teachers' salaries.
 But national studies show New Mexico continuing to lag in categories where the state has historically underachieved, although some of the figures predate Mr. Richardson's efforts.
 The Annie E. Casey Foundation ranked the state 48th in its 2003-4 Kids Count index of problem indicators. The foundation said more than a quarter of New Mexico children lived in poverty, among the highest rates in the nation.
 A Census Bureau study shows that from 2003 to 2005, an average of 21 percent of New Mexicans went without health insurance. Just Texas had a greater average rate in that period.
 ''It's a failure of a systematic way of looking at the problem,'' said Kay Monaco, former executive director of New Mexico Voices for Children, an advocacy group.
 Although not laid at Mr. Richardson's door, corruption scandals have also tarnished the state -- ''pay to play,'' in the words of critics. Some of Mr. Richardson's embarrassing appointees stepped down, including a former state police officer named to a magistrate judgeship who resigned after being caught ordering the release of a friend jailed on a drunken-driving charge.
 ''One bad judge out of 56,'' Mr. Richardson said, acknowledging ''our vetting procedures are not the most extensive.''
 His ethics package, pending before the Legislature, includes limits on campaign contributions.
 Mr. Richardson's physicality and roughhousing have also drawn rebukes. In his autobiography from 2005, ''Between Worlds,'' Mr. Richardson recalled negotiating with Saddam Hussein in 1995 and, in a gesture of good will, touching President Hussein's arm.
 ''Saddam started,'' he recalled, ''and along the wall eight hands suddenly touched sidearms.''
 In late 2005, Lt. Gov. Diane Denish told The Albuquerque Journal that Mr. Richardson ''pokes me'' when they sit together, calling that more annoying and likely to be misconstrued than improper.
 ''He pinches my neck,'' Ms. Denish said. ''He touches my hip, my thigh, sort of the side of my leg.''
 The governor waved that off, telling The Journal: ''I tease Diane. I touch guys. It's my way of lessening tension.'' 
 In the interview, Mr. Richardson ridiculed blogs' suggesting he acted improperly around women.
 ''Rumors are always in a politician's life by your opposition,'' he said. ''I've run seven times for Congress. I've been vetted by the F.B.I. for cabinet posts. I've been confirmed by the Senate. I've run two statewide races. Top security clearance. Kerry vetted me for vice president. Was clean.''
 He said that he welcomed scrutiny and that he had told his wife of 33 years, Barbara: ''You ought to expect this. She said: 'I know. I'm ready for it.' ''
 Locally, no issue in recent years seems as volatile as cockfighting. State Senator Mary Jane Garcia, a Democrat who is sponsoring the bill, has tried to pass similar bills for nearly 20 years. But Ms. Garcia could never muster enough votes, largely because lawmakers were reluctant to provoke constituents, many of whom say the sport is rooted in the state's Hispanic culture.
 But this time is different. Mr. Richardson is running for president.
 ''I asked him, 'Are you serious?' '' Ms. Garcia recalled. ''And he told me that he was ready to help, that it was the right thing to do, that it was the right thing for New Mexico.''

HEADLINE: Stepping to the Plate, Giuliani Is Seeing Only Softballs

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

DATELINE: SPARTANBURG, S.C., Feb. 21 

 BODY:
In a swing through South Carolina this week, Rudolph W. Giuliani chose to campaign at a fire house, which is a little like Derek Jeter meeting with Yankees fans -- a most unlikely forum for hostility, or even much skepticism.
 Instead of the sometimes barbed give-and-take endured by the other candidates, Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, fielded a few questions from the firefighters and police officers who gathered to hear him here. The questions, which began with comments like, ''Being in your presence here is just unbelievable,'' stuck almost entirely to issues on which Mr. Giuliani is most comfortable, like airport security and border control. 
More than the other major presidential candidates, Mr. Giuliani has limited himself to events with narrowly defined, friendly audiences, avoiding the kind of uncomfortable interrogations his rivals have occasionally faced. Aside from a couple of brief swings through diners, including one yesterday in Delray Beach, Fla., he has done little of the politicking that exposes candidates to random sets of people -- at shopping malls or train stations -- who might be of any political stripe, and can raise any issue.
 Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton, John McCain and Barack Obama and others have held forums in Iowa and New Hampshire that were open to anyone and were widely advertised in advance -- Mr. McCain did three on Saturday alone. People who were clearly skeptical pressed the candidates -- Mrs. Clinton and Mr. McCain on their Iraq war positions, and Mr. Obama on his relative inexperience.
 Mr. Giuliani has had no such events so far. He has yet to be questioned by voters about his support for abortion rights, same-sex civil unions and gun control, or about his marital history. 
 Party officials say Mr. Giuliani will have to face greater scrutiny from voters in primary states.
 ''For now it's O.K., but he can't follow that strategy indefinitely,'' said Fergus Cullen, the Republican chairman in New Hampshire. ''People in New Hampshire, Iowa and a couple of other places really demand a chance to hit you between the eyes, and to ask a pointed follow-up if you don't give a straight answer. And there's a curveball in every group.'' 
 A spokeswoman, Maria Comella, said Mr. Giuliani was not avoiding difficult questions, noting that it was still early in the campaign and that ''the mayor's travel has just started to pick up.''
 ''The mayor will be at a wide variety of events that will put him in front of voters where he will answer their questions,'' Ms. Comella said. 
 She would not say whether there were plans for an open forum in the near future.
 Difficult issues have come up, raised by journalists if not by others, and all candidates like to go before sympathetic groups and take agreeable questions. President Bush made a habit of it in 2004. Conversely, Mr. Giuliani was known for his frequent sparring with combative New York City reporters during his years as mayor.
 The traditions of states with early presidential contests call for taking a few risks in front of voters. Dick Bennett, an independent pollster based in New Hampshire, said after Mr. Giuliani's last trip to that state that he was surprised at how little unscripted exposure to voters there was and wondered if they would hold it against him.
 ''People here expect to be able to see you, up close, more than once,'' Mr. Bennett said.
 Mr. Giuliani recently spoke to state Republican conventions in New Hampshire and California, but he did not take questions, so there was little opportunity to address his views on social issues that set him apart from many in his party.
 In the last month, Mr. Giuliani has had three brief public exchanges with groups of business people who were more interested in economic issues than social ones. At an agricultural fair in Central California he was asked about farm policy, and at a Chamber of Commerce dinner in New Hampshire, he was asked about budget deficits.
 The Giuliani campaign billed the stop Wednesday in South Carolina, an early primary state, as a town-hall meeting. But only ''first responders'' had been invited, and Mr. Giuliani's speech was devoted to the heroism of police officers and firefighters on Sept. 11 and the threat of terrorism.
 Many of those present described themselves as religious and more conservative than Mr. Giuliani, but they also said they attended because they were fans -- and after hearing him praise them as the nation's heroes, they were in no mood to challenge him.
 As much as the audiences he chooses, it is Mr. Giuliani's reputation as the icon of Sept. 11 that has shielded him during his early campaigning. At every stop, he is greeted more like a celebrity than a candidate and is asked in reverential tones about his handling of the attacks on the World Trade Center.
 The social issues ''carry some weight, but you have to look at the big picture,'' said Brian Lawson, the assistant fire chief in Chesnee, S.C., who attended Wednesday's event. ''9/11, everybody knows what a job he did there, that he showed some great leadership. That's why we're here.''
 And of all the presidential candidates who have visited upstate South Carolina, Mr. Lawson said, ''he's the first one to ask to speak with this group.''

HEADLINE: What Scares Iran's Mullahs?

BYLINE: By Abbas Milani. 
Abbas Milani is the director of Iranian studies at Stanford and a research fellow at the Hoover Institution.

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif. 

 BODY:
IRAN has once again defied the United Nations by proceeding with enrichment activities, the International Atomic Energy Agency reported yesterday. And yet, simultaneously, Iranian officials have been sending a very different message -- one that has gone largely unremarked but merits close attention. 
 After a meeting with the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the leader's chief foreign policy adviser, Ali Akbar Velayati, declared last week that suspending uranium enrichment is not a red line for the regime -- in other words, the mullahs might be ready to agree to some kind of a suspension. Another powerful insider, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, said much the same thing in a different setting, while a third high-ranking official acknowledged that the Islamic Republic is seriously considering a proposal by President Vladimir Putin of Russia to suspend enrichment at least long enough to start serious negotiations with the United Nations. 
There have also been indications that the Iranians are willing to accept a compromise plan presented by Mohamed ElBaradei, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency. That plan calls for the suspension of all major enrichment activities but allows the regime to save face by keeping a handful of centrifuges in operation.
 The mullahs are keen on damage control on another front as well. After his meeting with Ayatollah Khamenei, Mr. Velayati announced that the Holocaust is a fact of history and chastised those who question its reality. Ali Larijani, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, also declared the Holocaust a ''historical matter'' to be discussed by scholars (and not, he implied, by ignorant politicians). In short, there is a new willingness among the Iranian political elite to avoid the rhetoric of confrontation and to negotiate. 
 There are three ways to analyze this turn. Advocates of an American invasion of Iran say that last month's strengthening of the American armada in the Persian Gulf has frightened the Iranian regime. What diplomacy could not do for years, a few destroyers did in less than a month. These advocates encourage more of the same, hoping either that the mullahs will accept defeat in the face of an imminent attack, or that a Gulf of Tonkin incident will lead to a full attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. 
 A second camp attacks the build-up of the armada as dangerous saber-rattling at best, and at worst as camouflage for already settled plans to attack Iran's nuclear sites. Such an attack, they say, might provide a much-needed feather for President Bush's empty cap at a time when his Middle East policy has manifestly failed. According to this camp, what changed the minds of Iranian officials was only the United Nations resolution threatening economic sanctions, and the possibility of other resolutions and more serious sanctions. 
 Both camps are partly right and yet dangerously wrong. There is a third way of looking at the facts.
 The mullahs have historically shown an unfailing ability to smell out and, when pragmatic, succumb to credible power in their foes. Indeed, the presence of the American ships has helped encourage them to negotiate. But no less clear is the fact that the mullahs' attitude change began in late December, when the United Nations Security Council finally passed a resolution against the regime in Tehran. 
 The passage of the resolution hastened the demise of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's confrontational approach to the West. And the falling price of oil, leading to declining revenues for the regime, magnified the resolution's economic impact. Top leaders of the Islamic Republic, from Ayatollah Khamenei to Mr. Rafsanjani, have made it clear that they consider sanctions a serious threat -- more serious, according to Mr. Rafsanjani, than the possibility of an invasion. 
 In other words, what the unilateral and increasingly quixotic American embargo could not do in more than a decade, a limited United Nations resolution has accomplished in less than a month. And the resolution succeeded because few things frighten the mullahs more than the prospect of confronting a united front made up of the European Union, Russia, China and the United States. The resolution was a manifestation of just such a united front.
 While the combination of credible force, reduced oil prices and a United Nations resolution has worked to create the most favorable conditions yet for a negotiated solution to the nuclear crisis, any unilateral American attack on Iran is sure to backfire. It will break the international coalition against the Islamic Republic's nuclear adventurism; it will allow China, Russia and even some countries in Europe to legitimately side with the mullahs; it will lead to higher oil prices and an increase in Iranian government revenues; and finally, it will help revive the waning power of the warmongers in Tehran. 
 Those convinced that only the combination of credible might and diplomatic pressure will work worry rightly that the Bush administration, frustrated by its failures in Iraq and goaded by hawks in Washington, will do to Iran what it did to Iraq. In confronting Saddam Hussein and the threat of his weapons of mass destruction, the Bush administration insisted that amassing an armada in the Persian Gulf was necessary to frighten Mr. Hussein into submission. But once the armada was in place, they used it to carry out a long-ago planned invasion of Iraq. 
 Today, many worry that the plans for an invasion of Iran, too, were made long ago, and that the armada is there to make possible either another Gulf of Tonkin resolution or an Iranian act of provocation against American forces, which could then serve as an excuse for an attack on Iran. 
 War and peace with Iran are both possible today. With prudence, backed by power but guided by the wisdom to recognize the new signals coming from Tehran, the United States can today achieve a principled solution to the nuclear crisis. Congress, vigilant American citizens and a resolute policy from America's European allies can ensure that this principled peace is given a chance.

HEADLINE: A Foreign Policy Built on Do-Overs

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Watching the Bush team wrestle with Iran, North Korea and Iraq reminds me of something that used to be said of the Reagan administration: The right hand never knew what the far right hand was doing.
 In fact, my bet is that when the inside history of the Bush team is written, we will discover that, contrary to its carefully managed image of a disciplined core operating from consistent, conservative principles, it has actually been one of the most internally divided administrations -- ever.
The only thing the Bush folks all agreed on was that they would never do anything Bill Clinton did. Beyond that, it's been a food fight. The trial of Scooter Libby, with its testimony about wars between the V.P.'s office and the White House, the White House and the C.I.A., and everyone against the State Department, proves that beyond a reasonable doubt. 
 When the former Bush U.N. ambassador John Bolton trashed the president's recent deal with North Korea as a ''charade,'' though, he highlighted the biggest internal division of all within the Bush team: how to deal with rogue regimes like Iran, North Korea and Saddam's Iraq -- whether to go for regime change or behavior change.
 On Iran and North Korea, ''this administration does not have clear policies, it has competing impulses,'' said Robert Litwak of the Wilson Center, who just published a smart book on this theme: ''Regime Change: U.S. Strategy Through the Prism of 9/11.'' ''The administration's mantra is 'all options are on the table.' But the dilemma is that too many objectives are on the table as well.''
 Because this administration was divided for so long on Iran and North Korea, over regime change or behavior change, it got neither. All it got was that Iran and North Korea both went out and bought Bush insurance: a nuclear weapons program.
 President Bush obviously recognizes that and is now trying to remedy it. Bill Clinton was criticized for taking more golf mulligans -- do-overs -- than any other president. Mr. Bush will be remembered for taking more foreign policy mulligans than any other president.
 On North Korea, the president has finally decided to focus purely on changing behavior. He struck a very sensible deal last week with Kim Jong Il to take his country off our terrorism list and normalize relations, provided Mr. Kim gives up his nukes.
 But we could have had a similar deal years ago -- when North Korea had only two nukes -- had the Bush team not been wrangling with itself over regime change or behavior change. While it wrangled, Mr. Kim built up his nuclear arsenal, adding six to 12 more bombs. If this deal is carried out, which is still uncertain, the wasted years will not have been a disaster. If it isn't carried out, they will have been very costly.
 Why do you think that a year after Mr. Bush told us we were ''addicted to oil'' we still have no serious plan to end that addiction? Because the market fundamentalists in his White House -- led by Dick Cheney, who opposes any government effort to impose carbon caps or taxes to promote alternative energies, a la California -- keep blocking the market pragmatists who do. And Mr. Bush won't intervene.
 The irony of Iraq is that it's the one place where Mr. Bush decisively chose regime change, but he then executed it so poorly, with insufficient troops, that Iraq never stood a chance. If Don Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney had spent as much time plotting the toppling of Saddam Hussein as they did the toppling of Colin Powell, Iraq today would be Switzerland. Today's Bush troop surge in Iraq is just another mulligan -- the president's trying to do in 2007 what he should have done in 2003. In between, we've paid a huge price.
 How about we avoid a mulligan on Iran? Let's put a clear deal on the table: full diplomatic relations, security guarantees and thousands of student visas if Iran puts its nuclear program under U.N. inspection and stops supporting terrorism. If not: more sanctions and isolation. Such an offer would at least get us some leverage, unite us more with our allies outside Iran, energize our allies inside Iran and force some excruciating choices on Iran's leaders.
 ''Resolving the contradiction in Washington will sharpen the contradiction in Tehran,'' Mr. Litwak argued. ''Taking regime change off the table in America will put behavior change on the table in Iran.''
 I guess we should be thankful that Mr. Bush is trying to fix some of his mistakes, but we have paid a huge, unnecessary price for his learning curve. Which is why it's always best to get it right the first time. The best golfers never take mulligans, and the best presidents never need them.

HEADLINE: The D-Day Heroes Who Weren't White

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA HEFFERNAN

 BODY:
With his garrison cap, steady gaze and square jaw, Allen Price of the 3275th Quartermaster Service Company, Omaha Beach, looks like another avatar of the Greatest Generation. He even complains as those superhumans do: levelly, economically, without anger or sadness. 
 ''You see these movies,'' he says. ''Like 'The Longest Day' -- you don't see no African-Americans. 'Private Ryan' -- no African-Americans.'' 
''Where was the balloon barrage outfit?'' he continues. ''Service company? Fort battalion? They didn't show you any of that.''
 Sixty-three years after he and nearly 2,000 other African-Americans participated in the American invasion of Normandy, he allows himself a trace only of irony. The significant contributions of African-American soldiers to D-Day -- little known, even to the buffs to end all buffs who manage the minutiae of Second World War history -- are the starting point for ''A Distant Shore: African Americans of D-Day,'' which has its premiere tonight on the History Channel. 
 With this enlightening program, the History Channel continues to home-school viewers on a complex national history of its own devising, complete with a thoroughgoing aesthetic and ideology. This time, the channel's idiosyncrasies mean that black octogenarian servicemen appear on screen: a rare sight indeed during Black History Month, which is known more frequently for featuring civil rights advocates, artists, musicians and academics -- men and women with leftist or pacifist aspects who, let's just say, leave their garrison caps at home.
 What we hear tonight are not Toni Morrison-style home-front lamentations, but war stories from a foreign land: slain buddies and precision equipment that was blown to smithereens its first time out. The armed forces were entirely segregated until 1948, and the black companies at D-Day were typically kept from combat. But, as another veteran, Carl Watson, says: ''We did anything that the combat soldiers needed. Set up gas dumps. Set up ammunition dumps. Processed some of the soldiers that were killed.''
 That ''processing,'' as we all know, was some of the grimmest and most necessary work on and after D-Day, and the African-American soldiers who were there, like all soldiers at the beachhead, remember the trauma of the gore above all else. But some also recall the bruising prejudice of basic training in Texas, where they were forced to ride in the back of the bus when they went to town, as well as the way white officers interfered with the heroes' welcome they received in England while they waited to ship out across the channel. 
 Having served valiantly, the seven who are interviewed here -- and who returned from the war to face contemptuous discrimination in the very country they had defended -- appear to be living well, in bright and well-loved houses that the documentary permits viewers to examine discreetly. That's where the channel's aesthetic comes in: in a style that matches the reserve of its subjects, the film refrains from spending time -- any time at all -- on their wounded bodies. 
 Instead, they're all shot in dignified light, many in uniform. One man, whose leg was lost in the war, describes the injury; while he's talking, the camera leaves him to his privacy, showing instead a ship from the period, its hull torn open by enemy fire.
 For anyone who believes that the documentary form is exhausted -- and certainly that there are no more documentaries to be made about World War II -- this is a stunning counterexample. For American schoolchildren, it ought to be required viewing, during Black History Month or any month.A Distant ShoreAfrican Americans of D-DayThe History Channel, tonight at 7, Eastern and Pacific times; 6, Central time.Dolores Gavin, executive producer for the History Channel.

HEADLINE: Fantasies Of Women, When They Were New

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
As the stage version of ''My Secret Garden'' at the 45th Street Theater makes evident, in 1970 Nancy Friday applied herself to exploring the carnal longings of the modern American woman with the gusto of Coronado setting out for the Seven Cities of Gold. At the time, Ms. Friday, who was living in London, had been writing magazine articles instructing women in the ways of attracting wealthy and debonair men, and while she considered that a worthy pursuit, the fiery air of the sexual revolution along with her own distaste for anonymity compelled her to mark the shifting terrain more spectacularly. 
 ''I've never come across a book of female sexual fantasies, so why not write one?'' Ms. Friday, portrayed by Mimi Quillin, exclaims. ''When I was 11 years old I was voted the most original girl at Canooga Camp. So why not a book on sexual fantasies?'' 
The result of that exuberant ambition, ''My Secret Garden,'' Ms. Friday's first book, published in 1973, became an immediate best seller and has sold millions of copies since, establishing the author along with sex positivists like Shere Hite and Erica Jong as part of the great lobbying effort for the unbridled expression of female appetite. Of the feminists writing in the 1970s, Ms. Friday was not among the polemicists. ''My Secret Garden'' amounts to a wish, not an argument, the articulation of its author's hope that a better world would be built through better sex. If the arrival of the play Off Broadway reminds us that such ideas have long lost their currency, it serves just as significantly as an occasion to understand how powerfully her book influenced and informed the style, if not necessarily the content, of popular feminism for decades to come.
 Adapted for the stage by Ms. Friday and Christopher Scott, the play itself is a tedious affair, an endless litany of fantasies (of group sex at football games, of chance happenings on the New Jersey Turnpike) that, taken together, leave you thinking about gathering your tax receipts. But it captures the loony enthusiasm of Ms. Friday's approach to her work, her random methodology: she solicited fantasies from hundreds of women young and old and seemed to interview whoever turned up. But above all the show highlights the exoticism of '70s sexual psychology. ''I'm afraid my fantasies are just the usual ones,'' a woman named Francesca recounts in one of the book's snapshots the play borrows. ''This is my favorite. I am brought at the age of 13 or 14, as a pubescent girl, by my mother to be sold to an Oriental potentate.'' 
 Francesca is identified as a pretty young mother of three, and if Ms. Friday approached someone like her today it is easy to envision her eliciting an entirely different sort of response. (''My fantasies are rather ordinary. I come home from a long day of trading municipal bonds and my husband is wearing only an apron and making a low-fat veal Milanese.'') 
 However anachronistic the mood and language of Ms. Friday's book (Heather: ''I'm 22 and very shy, and group gropes aren't my scene at all''), it is difficult to imagine feminist enterprises like ''The Vagina Monologues'' and the phenomenon of the annual ''V-Day'' benefits to which it has given rise, without the precedent Ms. Friday helped set. For that matter, it is difficult to conceive of ''Oprah'' in absence of the precedent Ms. Friday set. For better or worse, Ms. Friday helped to create a confessional feminism, reliant on the assemblage of personal anecdote, that held women's self-therapy as its overriding goal. It is the model invoked by Naomi Wolf in her 1997 book ''Promiscuities'' and an idea paid inadvertent homage in ''Revolution From Within,'' Gloria Steinem's 1992 best seller on the global implications of better self-esteem.
 But Ms. Friday can be considered a feminist only retroactively. Leaders of the women's movement did not embrace her efforts in the 1970s, as she has always been eager to point out. The opening to a review of the book in Ms. magazine included the line ''this woman is not a feminist.'' What pitted her against her adversaries was her idea that women's erotic freedom and the shedding of shame would establish the bedrock of equality between the sexes professionally, economically, politically. 
 Also at issue among critics was Ms. Friday's frank delivery of rape and incest fantasies. While the play reveals that she grew disgusted with hearing daughters' dreams of their fathers, the book doesn't levy judgment on its subjects, pointing out that fantasies of forced submission freed women to imagine sex without the guilt imposed by their own willful participation. The prevalence of rape fantasy among her interviewees, Ms. Friday presumed, was symptomatic of culturally oppressive forces that led women to believe that seeking sex was tantamount to moral felony. 
 But her logic implied a judgment of its own. Where there are symptoms, there are diseases, and where there are diseases, we find victims. However much she strained to retain her objectivity and convince readers that all sexual fantasy is healthy, the rape fantasists seem solely like sufferers of an ailment to be alleviated once the contaminant of sexism disappeared.
 Still, the staged version of ''My Secret Garden'' is infused with the awe and innocence of Ms. Friday's singular view. We have talked about sex, openly and everywhere, and we don't have world peace or gender balance. What we have been left with, alas, is Paris Hilton and ''Wife Swap.''Performances of ''My Secret Garden'' continue through March 11 at the 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton; (212) 868-4444.

HEADLINE: Borders Without Fences

BYLINE: By Ted Kerasote. 
Ted Kerasote is the author of ''Out There: In the Wild in a Wired Age'' and the forthcoming ''Merle's Door: Lessons From a Freethinking Dog.''

DATELINE: KELLY, Wyo. 

 BODY:
IN the debate over how to prevent illegal immigration from Mexico into the United States -- armed patrols, electronic surveillance, prison time for first offenders and a 700-mile-long 15-foot-high fence -- few politicians have voiced concern over the last option's profound effects on wildlife. 
 Authorized by the Secure Fence Act of 2006, this barrier (83 miles of which have already been built) will bisect a border region that has some of the most ecologically diverse landscapes in the hemisphere. It is here -- in a land of deserts, mountains, conifers and cactus -- that bird species from North and Central America share territories and cross paths during migrations. It is here that endangered wildlife, like the jaguar and gray wolf, have an opportunity to reoccupy lands from which they were extirpated during the last century. 
The list of other beautiful common or rarely seen animals that live along the border is long. A small sampling would include cougars, desert bighorn sheep, ocelots, pronghorn antelope, road runners, white-tailed deer and hundreds of species of birds and insects. The fence would physically prevent both large and small mammals as well as reptiles from traveling across the border, and the lights atop the fence would attract insects, making them easier prey for birds that feed on them. Some of these insects pollinate the plants of the region, including cactus.
 Since the secretary of homeland security will have authority to waive laws that stand in the way of building the fence -- like the Endangered Species Act -- wildlife and habitats could be destroyed on a scale not seen since the 1960s, when the nation's first wilderness and environmental laws were passed. Of course, many argue that the fence is an issue of national security and the safety of the American people trumps that of American wildlife. But that reasoning is flawed. The economic health of many people is increasingly reliant on the health of their natural surroundings. 
 In fact, studies done at the Universities of Montana and Colorado show that intact natural landscapes attract not only tourists to a region but also new residents and businesses that pump dollars into local economies. It isn't just plentiful sunshine that has made the Southwest one of the fastest-growing regions in the nation, it's also the region's diverse natural attractions, one of which is wildlife.
 The fence, however, will reduce wildlife-viewing opportunities in the many national parks, monuments, refuges, wilderness areas and forests that garland the United States-Mexico border. And its effects will be felt far to the north and south, along the mountainous backbone of the continent, where conservationists have spent decades mapping and preserving migration corridors that allow the free movement of wildlife between the two nations.
 Such ecological damage has already been seen around the world, where a variety of high, long fences have been constructed. In Botswana, for instance, the government erected fences, starting in the 1950s, to separate wildlife and livestock. As a result, at least 250,000 wildebeest, unable to reach water, perished from 1970 to 1984 and tens of thousands of antelope have died. In Asia, the migration of gazelles has been curtailed by the fence that the Chinese government built along the border with Mongolia in the 1990s. And in Australia, a 3,300-mile-long fence built in the 1950s to keep dingoes out of the southeastern part of the continent deprived kangaroos of their natural predator. Thus, the kangaroo population flourished, reducing the number of sheep the land could sustain, a result that the backers of the fence -- sheep ranchers -- neither foresaw nor intended.
 Unfortunately, since the fence along the United States-Mexico border is designed to keep people out, it can't be outfitted with features that allow wildlife to migrate over and under livestock fences and highways. Let's hope that when it comes time to appropriate the money to build the entire fence, cooler Congressional heads will prevail. There are better ways to protect our borders than building a wall that people will inevitably find ways around but wildlife won't.

HEADLINE: A Mountain of Margin Debt May Not Be Cause for Concern

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
American investors are now deeper in debt -- at least in their margin accounts -- than ever before. And that is starting to arouse concern of excessive speculation. 
 ''We wonder how much of the current rally reflects an economy that is 'just right' versus a buoyant market tenuously supported by maximum debt and minimal worries,'' wrote Joseph Quinlan, the chief market strategist of Bank of America, in a note to investors this week.
Mr. Quinlan pointed out that margin debt at brokerage firms reached $285.6 billion at the end of last month, breaking the record of $278.5 billion that had been set as the market peaked in March 2000.
 Margin debt reflects borrowing in brokerage accounts. In the United States, investors can buy stock with as little as 50 percent down, borrowing the rest from the brokerage firm. It is a strategy that magnifies profits if share prices rise, and that can do the same to losses if the reverse happens.
 In the aftermath of the stock market slide that began in the spring of 2000, investors showed a sharply reduced appetite for the risk that came with such borrowing. By the time the market hit bottom in the fall of 2002, the amount of outstanding margin debt had fallen by more than half. Now it is back.
 But today's level of margin debt is probably not an indication that speculation has returned to the old levels. For one thing, the market is a lot larger now. The second chart shows that margin debt remains well below 2000 levels when expressed as a percentage of the combined market capitalization of the two largest United States markets, the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.
 Moreover, the recent growth in margin debt has been much more gradual than it was in 2000. In early 2000, margin debt had nearly doubled from a year earlier. Now it is up about a quarter from a year ago.
 There is another statistic on margin accounts that provides some reassurance -- the amount of money that such accounts could borrow if they wished to do so. High levels of borrowing capacity show that accounts would not be forced to sell if prices began to fall, and they indicate that speculation is not as intense as it could be.
 The third chart seems to indicate a fundamental shift in that regard. Margin account holders could, if they wished, increase their borrowing by 35 percent. That is down from a peak of 44 percent, but double the low point reached in early 2000.
 There are, of course, a myriad of other ways to take on leverage. Derivative securities like options and futures have built-in leverage, as do hedge funds. Many investors can borrow against their homes, and more sophisticated ones can take on low-interest-rate debt in Japanese yen, a maneuver known as the carry trade. It is impossible to know just how much leverage is being used.
 But the rise in margin debt -- a form of leverage that is among the easiest to arrange -- does show that investors now are far more confident and willing to borrow than they were just a few years ago.

GRAPHIC: Chart: ''Borrowing to Invest''The total margin debt in the United States hit a record last month, the first since the market peak in 2000, climbing to $285.6 billion. But margin debt remains below record levels when measured as a percentage of stock market capitalization, and margin accounts have the capacity to borrow much more.Graphs track the following since 1995: Margin debt as percentage of market capitalization*Additional allowable borrowing as percentage of outstanding debtMargin debt*Market capitalization is based on total of New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.(Sources by New York Stock Exchange, via Bloomberg [margin debt]

PERSON: LAPO ELKANN 

HEADLINE: After Scandal, Italian 'Kennedy' Polishes Eyewear and Image

BYLINE: By PETER KIEFER

DATELINE: BOLOGNA, Italy 

 BODY:
HE is dressed in urban fatigues, but there will be no blending in for Lapo Elkann. There never really has been.
 Born into the all-powerful Agnelli family, the Italian version of the Kennedys in power, money and tragedy, he was one of its bright spots: a top executive at Fiat, with a flashy style, an energetic charm and a publicly cultivated reputation as one of Italy's most envied bachelors.
But 18 months ago all that came to a very public end. He was found near death in a coma from a cocaine and heroin overdose, in the apartment of a 54-year-old transsexual prostitute named Patrizia. It was front-page news in every major newspaper -- including the one owned by his family. 
 When he was released from the hospital, he promptly left the country. 
 Now, he is back in what has been a slow and meticulously managed return to Italy after an exile in America. Ostensibly, his renewed visibility is to promote his new designer eyewear line, Italian-Independent. But another, far more delicate campaign is at work here, the one to restore his image -- and by extension that of his family -- with his countrymen. 
 But Mr. Elkann, 29, is very clear about one thing: He is not asking for anyone's forgiveness. 
 ''I have never let down Italy and I never will,'' he said during a rare interview in the lobby of a hotel on the outskirts of Bologna. ''I love my country and I owe a lot to my country, and in that sense whatever I can and will be able to do for my country I will do.'' 
 With his signature mane of red hair pulled back, Mr. Elkann spoke on a range of subjects that include his new passion for design (''I am not yet even a decent designer, but I love it''), the mission statement of his new company (''My key goal is to make complexity become your simplicity'') and why he currently prefers life in New York over Italy (''It doesn't allow you to be lazy''). 
 But the task of reinserting himself into Italy will not be easy. Apart from his own problems, he has the steep history of his family to contend with.
 ''I believe that in Italy there are two important things. One is the Vatican and the other is the Agnelli family,'' said the writer Giancarlo Galli, who wrote a biography of Gianni Agnelli, Mr. Elkann's grandfather. ''And in the same way Italians love and hate the Vatican they also love and hate the Agnellis,'' he said. 
 Gianni Agnelli is a near mythic figure in Italy: A fabled industrialist who turned his family's car company into the most important company in Italy and one of the major European car builders. He was also a subtle yet extremely powerful behind-the-scenes political player for decades.
 ''Put together,'' Mr. Galli added, ''the Agnellis represent many things.'' And not all of those things are good. 
 ONE potential liability for Mr. Elkann -- whose mother, Margherita Agnelli, was the only daughter of Gianni -- is his maverick streak. He has a disdain for convention and his unpredictability can flare up, as it did during the interview, when he aired an extraordinary theory: that his overdose may have been orchestrated by Luciano Moggi, the disgraced former head of Juventus, which the Agnelli family owns.
 Mr. Moggi resigned last year and has remained under investigation for his role in a soccer game-fixing scandal. Mr. Elkann says the two argued a week before the episode. 
 ''Why was there a photographer already waiting at the hospital?'' when he arrived in the ambulance, he asked. 
 Mr. Elkann speaks in grandiose terms befitting someone of his pedigree but also emits an affected earnestness of someone who seems to be grasping for some acknowledgment that has long escaped his reach. 
 He is sober now, he said, but he chain-smoked through the interview, at the end of which he openly admitted that he was no saint. 
 He blamed the strain of watching his family company pass through an especially difficult period for the events of the now infamous evening. 
 ''I am an obsessive personality,'' he said. ''And if you are an obsessive personality you need to be aware of it and be able to drive it with success. There are moments in your life when you are driving it well but you shift and you shift badly and you hurt yourself. It's like a car accident; we all have crashes, and I was very lucky not to die in that crash.'' 
 But this is not simply about Mr. Elkann's fall from grace or his graceful return to the covers of fashion magazines. It is merely the latest chapter in the saga of the Agnellis and their role as Italy's unofficial royal family. 
 Because of Fiat's historical importance to Italy (at one point accounting for almost 5 percent of the country's economy), the government has, at times, stepped in to underwrite and subsidize the carmaker, which has not endeared the family to portions of the taxpaying Italian citizenry. 
 The Agnellis have also been immersed in drama and a series of tragedies, including drug overdoses, divorces, abrupt deaths, suicides and internal power struggles. 
 And there has been no shortage of schadenfreude over Mr. Elkann's fall. He is currently being parodied as a character on a popular Italian comedy show. 
 ''How are you supposed to deal with it?'' Mr. Elkann said, when asked about the parody and jokes. ''You've got to laugh about it and to smile about it. If you come from a family like mine, and challenge yourself to do new things and have success being satirized, you just have to accept it.''
 BUT Mr. Elkann also knows a thing or two about image control. He previously served as worldwide director of brand promotion for Fiat and was credited with rejuvenating the company by splashing the Fiat trademark across sweatshirts, wine bottles, watches, luggage and chocolate. Whether on the covers of tabloids or business journals, he was the public face of Fiat. 
 Luciano Regolo, the director of Novella 2000, a celebrity magazine that has chronicled Mr. Elkann's life, said that the Italian public was ready to move on. ''In this case his actions were not dishonest against the public or business,'' he said. ''I don't think if it is a drug problem that he has to ask forgiveness.''
 Mr. Elkann repeatedly noted that life was a long journey -- ''a marathon'' -- and he had a message for his enemies: He intends to be waiting for them at the finish line, with a smile on his face. 
 ''In America if you succeed you don't have to apologize,'' Mr. Elkann said. ''In Italy success is envied, and envy is the worst, worst, worst thing in the world. It's easy for me to say, because I have had more than many others, but at the end of the day I have never envied anyone. I wish to no one that they waste their time envying anyone else.''

HEADLINE: A Failed Meeting On the Mideast

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Charade in Jerusalem'' (editorial, Feb. 21) misses the point as to why the Jerusalem summit meeting failed to make progress.
The failure was not a result of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's having ''indulged'' the ''inherent caution'' of Israel's prime minister, Ehud Olmert. Rather, it was a failure because the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, undermined the very purpose of the get-together. 
 In signing the Mecca agreement with Hamas, Mr. Abbas failed to get the Islamic group to accept the three preconditions to move forward -- recognizing Israel, abandoning terrorism and accepting past agreements between Israel and the Palestinians. 
 Ms. Rice's hope in proposing the Palestinian-Israeli summit meeting was that Israel and the United States would offer concessions and assistance to Mr. Abbas to strengthen him in the critical struggle against extremist Hamas. The Mecca accord made this approach impossible. 
 With Fatah now in the government with Hamas, without a change in Hamas's ideology, Mr. Abbas has less -- not more -- authority, and credit for any concessions would go to the unity government. In other words, the Hamas-led government would reap the benefits, the very opposite result from what was intended.
 Israel will continue to communicate with Mr. Abbas. But for now, the only logical approach is to deny Hamas the economic assistance and diplomatic recognition it desires to tighten its hold on the Palestinian people.Abraham H. Foxman National Director Anti-Defamation League New York, Feb. 21, 2007To the Editor:
 You claim that ''Hamas's refusal to accept Israel's right to exist and its people's right to live free from terrorism is undeniably the biggest single obstacle to peace.'' I disagree. Rather, the issue is the occupation, a seemingly unending, brutal occupation that has lasted for generations. 
 It was Israeli occupations that gave birth to Hamas and Hezbollah. There are Palestinians still living in refugee camps, and many still live in surrounding countries. Millions of people are affected. Most of the Palestinians today are young and have lived their whole lives as less than second-class citizens in their own land. 
 Imagine what it must be like to have grown up in Gaza or Jenin. Now contrast that with growing up in Tel Aviv. That you don't recognize that as the ''biggest single obstacle to peace'' is appalling.
 Israel is fully capable of negotiating its rights with the Palestinians during the negotiations that should occur for Palestinian independence. It is unfair that the Palestinians should be forced by foreign powers and occupation forces to give up negotiating points even before those negotiations have begun.Gary E. Kaminski Buena Vista, Pa., Feb. 21, 2007To the Editor:
 The Bush administration should not be blamed for not coming up with new ideas that will solve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. No new or old idea will work as long as the Palestinians continue to put all their efforts into violence against Israel, willingly at the expense of their own lives and well-being. 
 The editorial does not present any new idea, either. The idea of having Israel give concessions to the Palestinian Authority to shore up its ''moderate'' leaders is quite worn out and has proved only to result in Israeli deaths as Palestinian terrorists, with their government's compliance, exploit every opportunity of increased autonomy and freedom of movement to stage attacks. 
 A new idea that might ultimately work is holding the Palestinians truly accountable for their actions, but for that to happen we have to remain steadfast in our refusal to aid the Palestinian Authority in any way until its priorities change.Beth GorodTeaneck, N.J., Feb. 21, 2007

HEADLINE: A Contract Is a Contract, Right?

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
So what you would do if you ran State Farm's Mississippi operation?
 Here is what you have been facing. A year and a half has passed since Hurricane Katrina. Although overshadowed by New Orleans, the Mississippi coast was hit hard, with tens of thousands of homes destroyed, resulting in 485,913 claims statewide. You are the largest home insurer in the state. Over 84,700 of those claims have come from your customers.
You think you've handled the disaster well. Didn't you rush 4,000 claims agents into the areas hit by Katrina? Haven't you settled all but a small percentage of claims? Haven't you paid around $1 billion in just the six Mississippi counties closest to the gulf?
 And yet, instead of praise, you have become the object of scorn and anger. And, this being Mississippi, lawsuits. Not even three weeks after Katrina -- three weeks, for crying out loud! -- the state attorney general, Jim Hood, filed suit against you and four other insurers, and opened a criminal investigation. 
 Then the plaintiffs' bar started circling, led by the most famous and feared lawyer in the land, Richard F. Scruggs, who, unfortunately for you, happens to be a Mississippian who lost a beachfront home in the storm. Among his clients are Senator Trent Lott (his brother-in-law) and Representative Gene Taylor, both Katrina victims who were insured by State Farm. Not merely content to sue you, they have been making noises in Washington about the need to get tough on the insurance companies. 
 These last months have been nightmarish. At one key trial, the judge decided to find you liable without even sending the case to a jury -- and then stuck you with $1 million in punitive damages. He has also made rulings that put you, in the words of Martin F. Grace, a professor of risk management at Georgia State University, ''between a rock and a hard place.'' Meanwhile, the local newspaper, The Sun Herald, has been hammering you on a regular basis. The attorney general keeps upping the rhetoric. A pair of whistle-blowing sisters took documents and leaked them to Mr. Scruggs. Although they were forced to return the documents, Mr. Scruggs has been able to characterize them in ways that make you look greedier than an Enron executive. The two sisters are now consultants for Mr. Scruggs. 
 The judge, L. T. Senter Jr., would clearly like to get this all resolved, and so would you. So a few weeks ago, you settled Mr. Scruggs' s 639 cases for $79 million. And in an effort to placate both Mr. Scruggs and Mr. Hood -- and ward off another giant round of lawsuits -- you agreed to allow 35,000 claims that had been closed to be reopened. In return, Mr. Hood agreed to shut his investigation and lawsuit. But the judge said he had reservations about the settlement and asked for more information. It just never ends.
 So I ask again: what would you do? Here is what State Farm did. It announced that the environment in Mississippi had become so untenable that the company was going to stop writing new home insurance policies in the state. ''We don't want to turn our back on the state,'' said Mike Fernandez, State Farm's vice president for public affairs. ''But it was a business decision we had to make, reluctantly.'' Well, maybe. Or maybe State Farm just couldn't take it anymore.
 ''This is not my first rodeo,'' said George Dale, who has been the insurance commissioner of Mississippi for 32 years. When Hurricane Camille hit in 1969, he continued, he was an assistant principal of a school he had to keep open so it could serve as a shelter for people who lost their homes. 
 ''The issue after that storm is exactly the same as it is today,'' he said. ''If the wind came before the water, you had coverage. And if you had water before wind, you didn't.''
 What Mr. Dale means is this: homeowner insurance policies in this country do not cover flood damage. But they do cover wind damage. Most policies also have something called an anti-concurrent clause, which essentially says that if any of the damage is caused by ''an excluded peril''-- i.e., a flood -- then the insurer does not have to pay off the claim, even though some of the damage might well be a result of wind.
 There is something absurd about having to distinguish between wind damage and water damage. A destroyed house, no matter what the cause, is a tragedy, and people expect their insurance companies will come to their rescue. Why else would they have insurance? But insurance companies are not charities; they don't want to pay for something they don't cover. Yet when they say no, people understandably become upset.
 Insurance companies do not cover floods for a reason: it would be prohibitively expensive. Instead, the federal government stepped in long ago and offered federal flood insurance, but only up to $250,000. Alas, at the time of Hurricane Katrina, only 16 percent of Mississippians had federal flood insurance, which is par for the course: most people, even in coastal areas, do not buy federal flood insurance. And even if they do, the insurance doesn't necessarily cover the cost of rebuilding a waterfront home. So after a big hurricane, especially in coastal areas subject to giant storm surges, it really does become a matter of deciding whether a house was destroyed by wind or by water. 
 Which is also why it is easy to see how this kind of dispute is ripe for litigation. In plenty of cases, it is easy enough to tell whether the damage has been caused by wind or water. But many of the houses on the coast were completely flattened: ''slab cases'' they are called, because all that remained was the slab. These are the cases that have caused much of the trouble.
 State Farm contends that the most likely result of a slab case is that the house was overwhelmed by the storm surge, and therefore flooding was the cause. And the homeowners -- and Mr. Scruggs and Mr. Hood -- contend that the winds were so high that day that the homes were likely to have been flattened by wind before the storm surge arrived.
 ''There are cases where we were able to document some wind damage, and we paid something on those claims,'' Mr. Fernandez said. ''But there were a number of cases where there was no specific evidence other than the comment of the insured saying he believed there was wind damage. That's where you get on the slippery slope.'' He added: ''This is not easy stuff. We are talking about people's lives.''
 I am actually making the situation sound saner than it is. And indeed, if all there was to the story were reasonable people contesting water versus wind, it would be sane. In general, that is how things have played out in Louisiana and Alabama, which don't have the same kind of litigious environment as Mississippi does. 
 That does not mean it is not tragic for those whose houses were destroyed by flood in those states, nor does it mean that there isn't something seriously wrong with an insurance system that forces these kind of water-wind distinctions. What it does mean is that the people in those two states aren't trying to abrogate the terms of the contract they've signed with their insurers. It is hard to see how an economy can function if contracts are not upheld.
 But in Mississippi, the insurance contract has been largely tossed aside by the power of litigation -- and the belief that the insurance companies, especially State Farm, should pay up no matter what the cause of the damage. Not that anyone is about to characterize it that way. Instead, they say they are merely trying to get State Farm to live up to the terms of its contract. But they have also worked to demonize the company until it is ready to throw up its hands and settle anything and everything, just to be done with it.
 Mr. Hood's tactic has been to press on with his criminal investigation. ''They are the worst actors down here,'' he told me, and went on to complain that the company had ruthlessly turned down wind claims using the anti-concurrent clause as its basis. He added that his investigation was focusing on ''fraudulent denial of claims,'' which of course State Farm vehemently denies.
 Mr. Scruggs, for his part, tried at first to persuade Judge Senter to toss out the standard flood exclusion. Although that tactic failed, the judge eventually began making rulings that gave Mr. Scruggs the upper hand. The judge has essentially ruled that the onus is on the insurance companies to prove water damage in slab cases, and if they can't prove it, they have to pay the claim. In effect, he tossed out the anti-concurrent clause, without ever quite saying so.
 Mr. Scruggs has also raised the possibility that the company has tried to ensure that its engineering reports stress flood damage, while ignoring reports that were weighted toward wind damage. ''They tried to create a pretense of scientific support for the claims by retaining engineering firms'' that were captive to the company, Mr. Scruggs told me. ''If the slab was caused by wind, a buzzer would go off that said, 'wrong answer!' '' he added.
 This strikes me as highly unlikely, and the handful of documents I saw that supposedly backed up these allegations looked pretty thin. What is far more likely is that State Farm, no matter how much it denies it, was tougher than its competitors about not paying claims where flood was the primary cause. And for that reason it has become Public Enemy No. 1 in Mississippi. It has also played hardball in court, which hasn't helped its image. (Late this week, it filed a motion asking Judge Senter to recuse himself from one of the big cases, on the ground that two of his employees are in disputes with insurance companies. )
 Here's the real problem with situations like this one. Litigation can sometimes be useful as a tool to punish companies that have genuinely done wrong. Who would argue that the banks that aided the Enron fraud shouldn't have been sued?
 But what appears to be happening here is something increasingly common in this litigation-mad society. Lawsuits, and the threat of lawsuits, are being used to get to a result that people want -- even if it is not the result they originally agreed to. ''This is not the first time we've had a huge social problem that requires a lot of money to fix -- and the bill is being handed to the insurance industry,'' said Randy J. Maniloff, a lawyer with White & Williams who writes a blog on insurance issues.
 Given the way things are playing out in Mississippi, it won't be the last time either.

HEADLINE: Chavez Ends Busy Week Aiding Venezuela's Latin Neighbors

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Feb. 23 

 BODY:
President Hugo Chavez met here on Friday with President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua to discuss an array of Venezuelan assistance programs, capping an unusually frenetic week for this country's efforts to enhance its political and economic influence in parts of Latin America. 
 At the heart of many of the agreements reached this week -- with Nicaragua, Ecuador and Argentina -- is Venezuela's use of its windfall from historically high oil prices, and sometimes its own reserves and exports of oil, to lift its regional profile.
Mr. Chavez is using Venezuela's oil revenues, valued at more than $50 billion a year, to counter the influence of the United States and multilateral lending organizations like the International Monetary Fund.
 The Venezuelan aid for Nicaragua has been a godsend for Mr. Ortega, the former Sandinista guerrilla leader who was elected president last year. Venezuela has already agreed to forgive more than $30 million in Nicaraguan debt, provide more than two dozen generating plants to alleviate an electricity shortage and open an office of Venezuela's development bank in Managua to offer low-interest loans to small businesses.
 Venezuela is also considering building an oil refinery in Nicaragua and a pipeline across that country from the Caribbean to the Pacific to transport Venezuelan crude oil to refineries in China and Japan, part of an effort to move away from exporting oil to the United States. 
 ''Nicaragua can forget about fuel problems,'' Mr. Chavez said during a recent visit to Managua.
 The talks with Nicaragua were preceded in recent days by an offer from Venezuela of $500 million in financial assistance to Ecuador, where the administration of President Rafael Correa has been considering efforts to restructure part of its foreign debt. 
 On Friday, Rafael Ramirez, Venezuela's energy minister, was in Ecuador for the arrival of a Venezuelan tanker carrying 220,000 barrels of diesel fuel, part of a fuel swapping deal aimed at saving Ecuador millions of dollars in foreign exchange.
 This week, Mr. Chavez's government said it would provide $135 million in financing for an Argentine dairy cooperative. Venezuela and Argentina also said they would create a regional development bank and carry out a joint $1.5 billion bond issue. 
 The bonds are intended to offer Argentina an alternative to the monetary fund and to give investors in Venezuela a way of acquiring dollar-denominated securities at a time when hard currency is increasingly sought after here.
 Elsewhere, Venezuela has revealed how it deals with countries with governments that speak critically of Mr. Chavez. Venezuela shut an aluminum plant in Costa Rica with 400 employees last week after Oscar Arias, Costa Rica's president, criticized Mr. Chavez's recently acquired power to govern by decree.

HEADLINE: Better Pay for Judges

 BODY:
Justice Anthony Kennedy of the Supreme Court told the Senate this month that the salaries paid to federal judges are so low that they threaten both the quality and the independence of the judiciary. The problem is real, and Congress should quickly pass a bill to fix it. 
 Justice Kennedy gave some startling examples of judges who had left the bench in search of better-paying employment. In 2005, nine federal judges resigned or retired -- the most in any single year. Four went to work for JAMS, a for-profit arbitration and mediation firm where, as Justice Kennedy noted, ''they have the potential to earn the equivalent of a district judge's salary in a matter of months.''
The $165,200 a year earned by a federal district court judge sounds like a lot. But it is not in the upper ranks of the legal world, from which the federal judiciary should be able to recruit new members. A district court judge's salary is now about half of what a law school dean makes, and roughly what a starting lawyer makes at a top New York law firm. Since 1969, the real pay of federal district court judges fell by about 25 percent, while the real pay of the average American worker rose 18 percent. If judges' pay had risen at the rate of the average worker, the $165,200 salary would now be $261,000.
 One way the Constitution protects the independence of federal judges is by providing that -- no matter whom the judges anger or disappoint -- their compensation ''shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.'' But that independence is eroded when inflation erodes salaries and judges must go to Congress with hats in hand.
 A bill to raise judges' salaries would also be an ideal place to impose a much needed ethical reform: a ban on all privately financed ''educational'' junkets for judges. These trips, which are often paid for by groups that want to persuade judges to take a particular view of the law, inevitably raise worrisome questions about judges' impartiality. 
 Capable, independent and impartial judges are essential to the workings of American democracy. Congress should come up with the money necessary to keep the judiciary strong.

HEADLINE: Leaving the Options Open With Iran

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER; Nazila Fathi contributed reporting from Tehran.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 

 BODY:
As the Bush administration tries to rally allies to tighten sanctions on Iran yet again, it is sending mixed messages to Tehran about its commitment to a diplomatic solution, trying to create new openings for negotiations even while holding open, ever so vaguely, the possibility that the United States might some day resort to force.
 In Australia on Friday, Vice President Dick Cheney, one of the strongest advocates of pressing for a ''regime change'' in Iran, reiterated his belief that a diplomatic solution was possible. But Mr. Cheney noted that ''the president has also made it clear that we haven't taken any options off the table,'' a phrase that President Bush frequently uses but has conspicuously avoided in recent weeks while discussing the issue. 
 At the same time, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice restated her willingness to meet the Iranians anyplace to talk about anything as long as they first agree to stop producing nuclear fuel, even temporarily.
 White House officials insist that there is no contradiction.
 ''The idea that we are ginning up another war -- there is no evidence for that,'' one senior administration official said Friday. The official added that Iran needed to know that it could not let negotiations drag on forever, and that any talk of military options was a signal that Washington would not negotiate endlessly while Tehran used the time to continue its work on uranium enrichment. 
 But, so far, the White House has declined to say at what point the Iranians will have pushed the United States too far -- in other words, how many working centrifuges in Iran would be too many, or at what point it would be impossible to guarantee that Iran could not achieve a ''nuclear option,'' the ability to turn ostensibly civilian nuclear facilities into bomb-making ones.
 For now, administration officials say, Mr. Bush is happy to leave the Iranians guessing. He ordered an additional aircraft carrier into waters within striking distance of Iran and its nuclear facilities last month, a step that senior officials say they believe took the Iranian leadership by surprise. He has issued warnings to the Iranians not to meddle in Iraq and has focused on intelligence findings that the most deadly bombs used against Americans in Iraq bear marks of Iranian origins. 
 But Mr. Bush has denied that he is trying to provoke Iran into a response that would provide a pretext for direct confrontation. ''To say it is provoking Iran is just a wrong way to characterize the commander in chief's decision to do what is necessary to protect our soldiers in harm's way,'' Mr. Bush said at a news conference on Feb. 15, shortly after accusing Iranian forces, but not necessarily the country's leadership, of worsening the violence in Iraq.
 In interviews in recent days, three administration officials, all of whom insisted on anonymity because they were speaking about a strategy still being developed, said the carrier movements, the accusations about weapons in Iraq and the use of sanctions against the government were all intended to provide Mr. Bush with some leverage in dealing with Iran.
 The officials have made little secret of their desire to fuel dissatisfaction inside Iran with the country's fiery president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who on Friday vowed anew to continue enriching uranium, saying, ''If we show weakness in front of the enemies, they will increase their expectations.'' 
 R. Nicholas Burns, the under secretary of state for policy and the lead negotiator on Iran, said Thursday that the multipronged approach was showing an effect. ''We've roiled their government, and I think we've shocked them a bit,'' he said.
 Mr. Burns is headed to London for a meeting on Monday with France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China about devising a new, tighter set of sanctions against the Iranian government -- one that might include a further crackdown on export credits or conventional arms sales. 
 Mr. Burns will undoubtedly run into more resistance from the Russians and the Chinese, who told American officials flatly in December that they would not put additional economic pressure on the Iranians. But Mr. Burns said he was not looking for a major escalation of sanctions, and other administration officials say that modest steps would be fine for now.
 ''The most important thing about the last resolution was that we achieved a consensus, we kept the Russians and Chinese on board,'' one senior administration official said. ''And in the end, that's what has serious impact in Iran.'' 
 Administration officials say that the need to hold that consensus together is overriding the differences on Iran that roiled the administration in its first term. Back in 2002 and 2003, when the prospect of a nuclear-capable Iran was more distant, the administration decided not to explore several offers through intermediaries to open discussions. Mr. Cheney and others argued that the success they anticipated in Iraq would chasten the Iranians, bringing them to the table on more favorable terms.
 Mr. Cheney, however, appears increasingly isolated now that many of his proteges have departed the Defense Department, the State Department and other corners of the administration. He was described by several top officials as only a minor player in the president's decision in May to offer incentives to Iran if it agreed to suspend its fuel production. 
 But the Iranians did not accept last year's offer, and if the administration and the Europeans are unable to find a formula that works for all sides, the talk of military options is bound to persist.
 ''No one has defined where the red line is that we can't let the Iranians step over,'' one senior official said. But Mr. Bush, the official said, is determined ''not to let them get one lugnut turn away from having a bomb.''
 Some diplomats who are trying to bridge the differences between Washington and Tehran insist that Mr. Bush is going to have to give some ground. ''To focus only on suspension in my view is not the right approach,'' Mohamed ElBaradei, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said early this week to The Financial Times. 
 In Vienna on Friday, Dr. ElBaradei repeated his idea of a ''time out'' to allow talks, with Tehran halting uranium enrichment and the United Nations suspending sanctions. And he has consistently preferred to allow a modest amount of face-saving ''research and development'' in Iran, and focus instead on preventing the country from having an industrial capacity to produce nuclear fuel.
 So far, though, Mr. Bush has said that even that much nuclear knowledge cannot be allowed in a country he does not trust.

HEADLINE: Profit and Sales Off at Lowe's as Housing Slump Continues

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C., Feb. 23 

 BODY:
Profit at the Lowe's Companies fell 11.5 percent in the fourth quarter, but beat analysts' expectations.
 The company, based in Mooresville, N.C., said it earned $613 million, or 40 cents a share, down from $693 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in the period, which ended Feb. 2, fell 3.7 percent, to $10.4 billion from $10.8 billion a year earlier. Sales in stores open at least one year, known as same-store sales, fell 5.3 percent. 
The company, which opened 58 stores in the quarter, had expected same-store sales to decline 4 percent to 6 percent for the quarter.
 The drop in sales was a result of a slowing housing market, significant deflation in lumber and plywood prices and tough comparisons with last year, when rebuilding efforts were under way after a damaging hurricane season, the chief executive, Robert A. Niblock, said.
 ''There has been a slowdown in the major-renovation-type stuff,'' Mr. Niblock said. ''It's nothing we haven't seen before. People will start getting back to life as normal.''
 The profit was better than the 37 cents a share expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. Shares of Lowe's rose $1.30, to $34.93.
 Lowe's said it planned to open 150 to 160 stores this year and expected its sales to increase 5 to 6 percent in the first quarter and 10 percent over the full year. 
 Some analysts said Friday that Lowe's might have borne the worst of a slowdown from the slumping housing sector.
 ''Yes, it does appear that the worst is behind them,'' said Stephanie Hoff, senior retail analyst with Edward Jones. ''I think the question going forward though is how rapidly can we travel down that road to recovery.''
 A Banc of America Securities analyst, David S. Strasser, wrote in a research note: ''Lowe's indicated its sales trends appear to have bottomed. That is encouraging as our buy thesis has been predicated on a first-half bottoming and second-half recovery.''

HEADLINE: U.S. in Talks With Britain on Installing Missile Defense System

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL; Thom Shanker contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 23 

 BODY:
Britain and the United States said Friday that they were discussing the stationing of an American antiballistic missile defense system on British soil.
 The United States previously offered to locate the missile system in the Czech Republic and Poland, drawing furious objections from Russia, though Washington argues that the system is not built to defend against Russia but against Iran, principally, and other potential threats.
Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokeswoman said Friday that Britain had been secretly lobbying for inclusion in the system for some time. ''It is our intention that whilst the United States are in the decision-making process, the U.K. should be considered as part of that,'' the spokeswoman said. 
 ''The prime minister thinks it is a good idea that we are part of the consideration by the United States'' she said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, which the British civil service requires. ''We believe it is an important step toward providing missile defense coverage for Europe, of which we are part.'' 
 The possible step, first mentioned in The Economist magazine, seems sure to prove contentious in Britain, and to cloud Mr. Blair's final months in office, along with two other events that surfaced Friday. 
 In one, relatives of British soldiers slain in Iraq began a peace vigil in blue nylon tents near Mr. Blair's office, and in the other, Mr. Blair pondered a new military deployment in Afghanistan. 
 Just two days after Mr. Blair announced a withdrawal of 1,600 of the 7,100 British soldiers in southern Iraq, Defense Secretary Des Browne said ''some additional forces'' -- possibly about 1,000 soldiers -- would be sent to join the 5,600 Britons who are part of NATO forces confronting an expected spring offensive by the Taliban in Afghanistan.
 Word of the missile defense negotiations followed remarks in Washington on Thursday by Gen. Henry Obering III, who discussed the deployment of missile defenses in Britain, saying, ''We are always looking for new ways to partner with the United Kingdom, whether that be co-development or a hosting, or any of the activities of that nature.'' He also said that radar systems were already in final testing in Britain.
 At first the American Embassy in London made remarks that the British news media seized on as a rebuff of Mr. Blair's interest. David Johnson, the deputy chief of mission at the United States Embassy in London, told a BBC radio interviewer: ''I would see as we go forward. There may be opportunities for us to talk to other countries about other needs, but right now we're concentrating on the Czech Republic and on Poland as the primary sites where we would be looking for this.''
 In a subsequent statement, Mr. Johnson said any suggestion that his remarks ''were a rebuff to the British government is nonsense. We have been and will be in discussions with the British government as we develop our missile defense system and be open to opportunities for joint work as we go forward.''
 The negotiations are most likely to raise political hackles at a time when many in Mr. Blair's Labor Party and in the opposition Conservatives are pressing for Britain to distance itself from the United States after their close and sometimes unpopular alliance in Iraq.
 The Conservatives said the government had given no information about its discussions with the United States. ''If there is a request to base part of the U.S. National Missile Defense system in the U.K., we would need to see the exact nature of that request before taking a decision,'' said Liam Fox, the Conservative spokesman on defense. The government, he said, needs ''to be more honest with the opposition'' to secure bipartisan support for the proposed missile deployment.
 Mr. Fox also took issue with the plan to deploy more troops to Afghanistan, saying other European countries, including Germany, France, Italy and Spain, should commit troops in the hazardous Helmand Province of southern Afghanistan, where many British soldiers are based.
 ''It is clear that the government has failed to get our NATO allies to carry their share of the burden in Afghanistan,'' he said, complaining that, with deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, ''it is clear now that our army is so overstretched we can't carry two conflicts.''
 Apart from Iraq and Afghanistan, British troops are deployed in the Balkans and in Northern Ireland.
 The political hazards of Mr. Blair's military ventures were underlined by the protest on Whitehall, the broad boulevard running by the gated and closely guarded entrance to Downing Street, where Mr. Blair has his office and residence.
 Rose Gentle, whose 19-year-old son Gordon was killed in Basra, Iraq, in 2004, led a small group of protesters who pitched camp and submitted a letter addressed to Mr. Blair calling for a meeting with him.
 ''This is our sixth such visit, and each time you have not seen fit to give us a few minutes of your time,'' the letter said. ''We have a number of questions that we need answered about the deaths of our sons in Iraq, and we insist that you meet us.''
 ''Please believe us, Mr. Blair, that neither we nor these questions will go away,'' the letter said.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about discussions between Britain and the United States over the possible stationing of an American antiballistic missile defense system on British soil misidentified the rank of an American military officer who was quoted discussing the subject. Henry Obering III is a lieutenant general, a three-star position -- not a general, a four-star position.

HEADLINE: At $45 Billion, New Contender For Top Buyout

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and CLIFFORD KRAUSS; Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The biggest leveraged buyout ever is about to be surpassed. Again.
 A group led by the private equity giants Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company and the Texas Pacific Group is near a deal to acquire the TXU Corporation, a Texas utility, for about $45 billion, according to people involved in the talks.
The amount of private money that is being offered is a huge financial endorsement of the company's energy strategy. TXU has irritated environmental advocates by proposing to build 11 coal-fired power plants in Texas. Despite calls for regulating greenhouse gases, TXU has been the most aggressive in the power industry in pushing coal as the answer to growing electricity demands. Nationwide, power companies are planning to build about 150 coal plants over the next several years. 
 The deal itself, if approved at a TXU board meeting tomorrow, would be a landmark. It would exceed the Blackstone Group's recent $39 billion acquisition of the office landlord Equity Office Properties, the largest buyout ever. And that would mean that Henry R. Kravis, a co-founder of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, has managed to upstage, at least for the time being, his longtime rival in deals, Stephen A. Schwarzman, a co-founder of Blackstone. 
 Energy has been fairly recent territory for private equity. While energy deals accounted for 16 percent of all mergers last year, only 9 percent of those deals involved buyout firms, according to Thomson Financial. The first big foray came last year, when Kinder Morgan, the Texas pipeline giant that was created from some assets of the former Enron, was sold to a group that included Goldman Sachs, the American International Group, the Carlyle Group and Riverstone Holdings for $27.5 billion.
 Awash in hundreds of billions of dollars, private equity firms, which raise money from pension funds and wealthy individuals, have taken on new targets in a buying spree. In 2006, private equity firms raised more than $174 billion for 205 funds, according to Thomson Financial.
 Having just finished raising new supersize funds -- K.K.R. and Blackstone are about to complete funds each worth more than $20 billion -- and with banks and hedge funds willing to lend them money in record amounts with few restrictions or covenants, private equity has now begun to aim at even bigger prey. A deal the size of TXU will probably require that the private equity firms raise more than $30 billion in debt.
 People involved in the talks cautioned that the deal still faced approval by TXU's board and several negotiating points remained, so the talks could collapse.
 TXU did not respond to telephone requests for comment.
 ''It's a pretty dramatic development because TXU's position in electricity in Texas is controversial and uncertain,'' said Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy expert at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in Houston.
 TXU, based in Dallas, has 2.4 million customers in the state. It also owns and operates one of the largest lignite coal surface mining operations, producing 23 million tons a year. With its large, low-cost nuclear and coal-fired group of plants, it has been able to raise electricity prices to match the rise in natural gas prices the last three years. 
 Like other utility companies in recent years, TXU has sought to reinvent itself. A new management came in three years ago and sold natural gas assets after the price of natural gas soared, got out of speculative marketing, cleaned up its books and went back to its core business of electricity generation and transmission. The company's shares have been a favorite of Wall Street, rising from a low of $5.44 in 2002 to $60.02 yesterday.
 But after being on the rise, the company has now hit strong headwinds. TXU's plans to build 11 coal-fired plants have faced increasing political opposition from environmental organizations, civic groups and prominent politicians like the mayor of Dallas, Laura Miller.
 Rallies, hearings and informational meetings have been attracting crowds of critics around the state who view the plants as a symbol in the struggle to reduce global warming. Environmentalists believe if they can stop at least some of the plants in a conservative state like Texas, it will be a boon to activists around the country who oppose coal and favor renewable energy like solar and wind.
 TXU has said that the growing population and economy in Texas need more energy and has claimed that the plants will be cleaner than many older coal-fired plants in the state. They have also argued that coal gasification technologies, which environmentalists say would produce cleaner energy, are not yet ready for the marketplace. The 11 plants would have a capacity of more than 9,000 megawatts, about 3.5 percent of the nation's current coal-fired power and would cost an estimated $10 billion.
 Recently, in response to criticism, TXU promised that the new plants would leave vacant space for future deployment of equipment designed to capture carbon dioxide so the climate-warming gas does not enter the atmosphere. Moreover, the company says it is conducting research on oxygen firing, chilled ammonia and other technologies to capture carbon. 
 TXU's plan was dealt a sharp blow, at least for the short term, by State District Judge Stephen Yelenosky, who on Tuesday ruled against a 2005 executive order by Gov. Rick Perry to put the plants' permit process on a regulatory fast-track. The judge issued a temporary injunction stating that the Texas governor, whose powers are limited compared with most state governors, did not have the authority to decide how much time regulatory agencies should take before issuing decisions. 
 The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality will make the ultimate decision on the permits, but not before administrative law hearings that promise to be rancorous. 
 Still, despite the uproar over the coal plants, TXU has many attractions for a potential buyer, analysts said. It is a strong company in a profitable business made all the more valuable because it operates in Texas, which has a growing economy and population base. 
 ''Utilities right now have a lot of value because they have guaranteed cash flows and guaranteed rates of return which gives them guaranteed income,'' said Barbara Shook, an analyst with the Energy Intelligence Group, a publications and research firm. ''And they have hard assets. In the post-Enron world, hard assets carry a lot of value.''
 ''TXU is going to grow no matter what, because the state of Texas is growing and that translates into higher demand for electricity,'' she added.
 The Texas energy scene is evolving. Still the center of the nation's oil business, it is also now the state with the most wind power production. Austin and other cities have become centers for renewable energy companies. But unlike California, Texas has been slow to develop conservation policies and has no goals for cutting carbon emissions.
 Under the terms of the deal being discussed, the investors would pay about $70 a share for TXU, these people said. TXU's market value is about $27.5 billion. The company has more than $12 billion in debt.
 Other private equity firms may join the group, these people said. A spokeswoman for K.K.R. declined to comment as did a spokesman for Texas Pacific.

HEADLINE: Tuning In to One Company

 BODY:
Vigorous competition in the private sector has served the United States economy and consumers extremely well, providing a greater array of choices, more innovation and lower prices. The two -- and only -- satellite radio companies are now eager to merge and are arguing that together, they will prove to be the exception to the rule. 
 The industry is important and still young. We urge regulators to take a hard look at the companies' proposal before leaving the field in the hands of a single player.
Sirius and XM provide subscription radio services for some 14 million customers, with each company beaming more than 100 channels of music and talk radio, much of it without commercials. The services -- both less than six years old -- have generated considerable excitement with things like high-profile and high-price deals, including the $725 million in cash and stock that the shock-jock Howard Stern is reported to have signed for. 
 Together the two services have also managed to accumulate $6 billion in losses since receiving their licenses a decade ago. 
 The companies' managers argue that the $13 billion merger could finally make them profitable by letting them cut costs and redundant programs, while giving consumers more programming options for their bucks. As for the fear of creating a monopoly, they argue that competition will still come from terrestrial radio (commonly known as AM and FM), iPods and other next-generation technologies. 
 It is important to remember that these are not widget makers. Radios carry important discourse and debate -- they are vital to the free exchange of ideas protected by the First Amendment. Recent experience shows that media consolidation usually leads to more homogeneous content, politically as well as artistically, and it rarely benefits the consumer or the country. 
 There is also the question of what precedent would be set if regulators accepted the broadest possible definition of audio competition, and whether that could lead to even more mergers in radio. No less troubling are reports that the companies believe that they have an incentive to merge before the Bush administration and its overly friendly-to-business regulators leave office.
 The companies should, of course, be allowed to argue their case. And consumers should voice their opinions as well. Unless they want to pay for both services, subscribers are currently missing out on exclusive shows: Mr. Stern can be heard only on Sirius, and the nation's empathizer in chief, Oprah Winfrey, only on XM. Sports fans who want football and baseball have to pay for both services.
 Consumers should also recognize that XM and Sirius compete vigorously for customers, talent and corporate partners. Both even charge the same rate, $12.95 a month, a price that might well rise if there was no competition.
 When XM's and Sirius's licenses were granted, the Federal Communications Commission stipulated that ''one licensee will not be permitted to acquire control of the other.'' The chairman of the F.C.C., Kevin Martin, reiterated that point this week but left the door open to a possible merger, saying, ''The companies would need to demonstrate that consumers would clearly be better off with both more choice and affordable prices.'' We are skeptical about the chances of that happening.

HEADLINE: For a Rare Moment, The Play's The Thing

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
IN a typical Broadway season the impending arrival of ''Coram Boy,'' which opens at the Imperial Theater in a little more than two months, would already be causing murmurs among the small but loyal population of Broadway playgoers. After all, with a cast of 40, this play will undoubtedly be one of the most expensive ever staged on Broadway, as well as the first to open at the Imperial in 30 years. Its earlier run at the National Theater in London, staged by a hot director, won raves. And for heaven's sake it's an ambitious play, not a musical, which means it's a rarity on Broadway. Right?
 Not this spring.
Each new Broadway season opens with a cherished ritual. The play is proclaimed dead, killed by -- pick one or more -- the musical, the tourists, the unions, the cost of advertising or the general decline of American culture. And those few plays that somehow make it through are inevitably burdened with caveats: That one's British, so it doesn't really count. That one got off the ground only because of that famous actress in the lead. That one's just a revival. And that one is being produced by a nonprofit theater, and that's what they're supposed to be doing. 
 But like the bad guy in a slasher franchise, the Broadway play never seems to stay dead for good. Between January and June there will be 12 plays opening on Broadway (counting ''Salvage,'' the third installment of Tom Stoppard's ''Coast of Utopia,'' which opened last weekend). What is more surprising, nine of them are being produced commercially, and almost all have directors with pedigrees. 
 By contrast three, maybe four, commercially produced musicals are scheduled. 
 So what are we witnessing? A renaissance of the Broadway play?
 Alas, no. But we are seeing something remarkable: a quirk of timing, a precious pocket of breathing space between musical-heavy seasons that happens to coincide with a scheduling hole for busy British directors. For those who like their words unsung, it's a beautiful thing.
 ''I think you have to nod your head to say that we have some alternatives this year,'' said Emanuel Azenberg, a Broadway producer who often bewails the state of the play on Broadway. ''I don't know that it's encouraging,'' he added. ''But it's unlike previous years.'' 
 With more and more musicals taking over Broadway, even moving into the smaller theaters, plays have often served mainly as filler, a way to keep the rent paid for theaters that are waiting for the lucrative musical to move in. This spring those in-between time slots have lined up, and the result is a dramatic constellation. Of the nine commercially produced plays, seven are limited engagements.
 The largesse may be a liability for some producers. Those who in any other season might have had the middle- or highbrow play with the superb director are suddenly standing in a crowd. 
 ''You have good intentions of how you will actually line things up, trying to align them like a train schedule,'' said Bob Boyett, a producer of ''Coram Boy'' and four other plays opening this spring. In the end, he added, it doesn't always work that way.
 First, the asterisks. Three of the plays are appearing at nonprofit theaters. Four were recent hits on the West End in London and are either transferring as a whole or being staged by the same directors. (Five of the directors with plays this spring are American.) And half are revivals: Brian Friel's ''Translations'' was first produced Off Broadway in 1981 at the Manhattan Theater Club, which is producing it now; Craig Lucas's romance ''Prelude to a Kiss,'' in previews at the Roundabout Theater Company's American Airlines Theater, first played on Broadway in 1990; Eugene O'Neill's ''Moon for the Misbegotten,'' a transfer from Kevin Spacey's Old Vic in London, has been seen on Broadway four times previously, most recently seven years ago; Eric Bogosian's ''Talk Radio'' was a hit at the Public Theater in 1987; ''Inherit the Wind'' has been on Broadway twice before; and R. C. Sherriff's World War I drama, ''Journey's End,'' has also been on Broadway before, albeit in 1930.
 That still leaves six straight plays making their New York debuts, three by American authors: ''Radio Golf,'' the last of August Wilson's 10-part play cycle; ''Deuce,'' by Terrence McNally; and ''The Year of Magical Thinking,'' Joan Didion's stage adaptation of her 2005 memoir. The other three -- ''Coram Boy,'' ''Frost/ Nixon'' and ''Salvage'' -- are by British authors but have not been seen here.
 It's quite a lineup, though given the dreary success rate of plays on Broadway, it's worth asking: Are all of these producers -- and their investors -- a little crazy? 
 After all, two of the three commercial plays that opened on Broadway in the fall faltered: ''The Little Dog Laughed,'' which had strong reviews, lost money; and ''The Vertical Hour,'' which boasted the star power of Julianne Moore and Bill Nighy, is closing early, though its producers insist it will recoup its investment. Only ''Butley,'' with Nathan Lane, recouped and closed on schedule.
 ''I think there's not enough of an audience to successfully support all of those shows,'' Roy Gabay, the producer of ''Little Dog,'' said of the spring play lineup. ''That's sort of a fact. I see four shows a week and can't keep up. What are the people going to see four shows a year going to do?'' 
 The madness has not gone unnoticed. ''Who needs a tax write-off badly enough that they're going to try to put an August Wilson play on Broadway?'' asked Isaac Butler, a Brooklyn theater director, on his blog Parabasis. He added: ''Broadway is a place for big musicals and the occasional British Import; with the economics of the place being what they are, that is unlikely to change anytime soon.''
 Not only is it getting more expensive to put on plays, but also the number of people going to plays -- a fifth of the number going to musicals -- has hardly budged over the last seven years, according to surveys last season by the League of American Theaters and Producers. And that audience, unlike the one that prefers musicals, still mainly comprises people who live in the New York area and who tend to be savvier about finding discount tickets. 
 But even the smartest bargain hunters will have to put down a few hundred dollars to see just a few of the plays this spring. Mr. Boyett does not see that as a problem. ''I almost never run into anyone who says, 'I really resent paying $100 for this,' '' he said. ''I think it's because in other areas of their life, like sports and concerts, they pay a lot.''
 According to league surveys, the most important factor cited by playgoers in deciding what to see is the cast. More than a third said they choose a particular show to see a performer (compared with only 5 percent of those going to musicals). 
 That's a promising statistic for plays like ''Deuce,'' ''Magical Thinking,'' ''Inherit the Wind'' and ''Frost/Nixon,'' all of which will feature performances by some of theater's best-known actors, while ''A Moon for the Misbegotten'' has its celebrity factor in Kevin Spacey and ''Talk Radio'' a theatrical star in Liev Schreiber. 
 The next two most important elements in play selection, according to the surveys, are word of mouth and reviews. 
 Of the three plays depending almost entirely on reviews and word of mouth, two are being mounted by Boyett/Ostar, the production company run by Mr. Boyett, a former television producer, and Bill Haber, a founder of Creative Artists Agency. (The other play on Boyett/Ostar's roster this spring is ''Inherit the Wind,'' a revival of the Scopes monkey trial chestnut with Christopher Plummer and Brian Dennehy, which, according to production officials, is having healthy advance sales.)
 The first one is the revival of ''Journey's End,'' which received raves in London and has been recast for Broadway under the same director, David Grindley, with a roster long on theater talent but short on big names. Ticket sales have not taken off; the grosses posted for its first week and a half of previews have been less than impressive. 
 The other is ''Coram Boy,'' a stage adaptation of an epic young-adult novel set in the 18th century, which has a large cast, including a choir singing Handel's ''Hallelujah'' chorus. Mr. Boyett is betting that ''Coram,'' which is being staged by its London director, Melly Still, with a new American cast, becomes a must-see event, and he compared it to ''The History Boys,'' which Boyett/Ostar brought over last year as part of an agreement with the National.
 ''I would have loved to have a little more time with 'Coram Boy,' to build familiarity with it,'' he said, adding that the sudden availability of the Imperial forced his hand. When ''High Fidelity'' closed,'' he said, ''we rushed in.'' 
 The other play that may be facing long odds comes at the tail end of the season: August Wilson's ''Radio Golf.'' There are no celebrities in the cast. No trail of British accolades. Productions of the play at regional theaters over the last few months have received good reviews but not raves. The last Wilson play on Broadway, ''Gem of the Ocean,'' was beset by financial difficulties before it opened in 2004 and it closed within three months. 
 So what can the producers realistically expect this time around?
 ''We're thinking that it's the completion of the August Wilson cycle,'' said Rocco Landesman, a producer of the play and the president of Jujamcyn Theaters, who named one of his theaters after Mr. Wilson. ''I think it's something you have to do.''
 So it's just philanthropy?
 ''Are we thinking that we're going to get rich off this?'' he said. ''Probably not.'' But he added: ''There's a difference between something that's a long shot and a hopeless cause. I think there's always hope.''

HEADLINE: Job Security, Too, May Have a Happy Medium

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
FOR more than a decade, many American economists have pointed to Europe and Japan as prima facie evidence that layoffs in the United States are a good thing. The economies in those countries were not nearly as robust as this country's. And the reason? Too much job security in Europe and Japan, the economists said. 
 American employers, in sharp contrast, have operated with much more ''flexibility.'' Hiring and firing at will, they shift labor from where it is not needed to where it is needed. If Eastman Kodak is struggling to establish itself in digital photography, then Kodak downsizes and labor moves to industries and companies that are thriving -- software, for example, or health care, or Wal-Mart Stores or Caterpillar. 
This shuffling out of one job and into another shows up in the statistics as nearly full employment. Never mind that the shuffling does not work as efficiently as the description implies or that many of the laid-off workers find themselves earning less in their next jobs, an income roller coaster that is absent in Europe and Japan. A dynamic economy leaves no alternative, or so the reasoning goes among mainstream economists. 
 ''Trying to prevent this creative destruction from happening is a recipe for less economic growth and less productivity,'' said Barry Eichengreen, an international economist at the University of California, Berkeley. 
 Starting in the mid-1990s, Europe and Japan did wallow in recession or weak growth while the American economy expanded at a spectacular clip. But no longer. Growth is slowing in the United States just as it speeds up in the 25-nation European Union and in Japan. Unemployment rates in those countries are also beginning to come down, suggesting that the American system is not the only route to full employment. 
 As the gaps close, does that mean that job security, in the European and Japanese style, is the right way to go after all? The question would be easier to answer if the European Union countries and Japan had stuck to their orthodox job security. They have not. On their way to revival, they adopted some of America's practices. 
 ''A number of countries have found ways to make their labor markets more flexible, without sacrificing their greater commitment to a government role in equalizing incomes,'' said Paul Swaim, a senior economist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. 
 So the old dichotomy -- insecurity versus security -- is gradually giving way to a new debate. ''It is obviously the right mix of security and insecurity that has to be achieved,'' said Richard B. Freeman, a labor economist at Harvard. ''You can't protect people their whole working lives. That undercuts incentive. But you can't tell people they have no security at all.''
 The guideposts in this search for the right mix should not be just economic growth rates and unemployment levels. These are too often affected by business cycles. Many American economists, bent on demonstrating the payoff from layoffs, paid relatively little attention to the cyclical reasons for the underperformance of Japan and Europe.
 ''Sometimes we forget these cyclical forces,'' said Sanford M. Jacoby, an economic historian at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
 Japan and Western Europe flourished in the 1980s. And then the cycle changed. Japan plunged into a prolonged recession, brought on by the bursting of stock market and real estate bubbles, an overcautious central bank and a banking crisis. Europe also fell into the doldrums, partly because of the difficulties of organizing the European Union. Integrating East Germany into West Germany, Europe's strongest economy, did not help, either.
 But now Japan is in the fifth year of an ever-stronger recovery, and this year, according to some forecasts, growth in the European Union may even exceed that in the United States, where the economy may be weakening in the sixth year of a recovery. 
 Cycles count. But so do labor policies. 
 In some European countries, employers are using temporary and part-time workers much more than they did in the past. That gives them leeway to expand and contract their work forces without having to add full-timers who are protected against layoffs. Similar protection exists in Japan, which also relies for ''flexibility'' on part-timers and temps. 
 If cost-cutting is necessary in Japan, there is a pecking order, says Yoshi Tsurumi, an economist at Baruch College in Manhattan and a consultant to Japanese companies. Dividends are cut first, then salaries -- starting at the top. Finally, there are layoffs -- if attrition is not enough to shrink staff.
 ''The matter of flexibility is important,'' Mr. Tsurumi said, ''but the Japanese notion is to retrain and transfer people within an organization.''
 Elsewhere, France and Germany have eased job protection for employees of small businesses. Payroll taxes paid by employers have been cut for some low-income workers, increasing the demand for them.
 And the Danish model is getting a lot of attention. Employers in Denmark are relatively free to lay off workers, but the state then steps in with benefits that replace 70 percent of the lost income for four years. Government also finances retraining and education, pressuring the unemployed to participate and then insisting that they accept reasonable job offers or risk cuts in their benefits.
 THE Danish government devotes 3 percent of the nation's gross domestic product to retraining, compared with less than 1 percent in the United States. And, of course, everywhere in Europe, the state pays for health insurance and for pensions that often encourage early retirement by replacing big percentages of preretirement income.
 ''What the Europeans and the Japanese understand is that modern economies can sustain social protections without killing the golden goose,'' said Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. 
 That is an understanding that perhaps will take root among American economists and policy makers, deprived as they now are of their long-running contention that job security resulted in weak economic growth in Europe and Japan.

HEADLINE: When Religious Needs Test Company Policy

BYLINE: By KELLEY HOLLAND

 BODY:
MANAGERS must deal with big issues all day long -- from acquisitions to runaway health care costs -- but in many cases it is the little things that count the most. That can be especially true in matters of faith in the workplace. 
 How little? Toni Riccardi, formerly the chief diversity officer for PricewaterhouseCoopers, remembers being asked whether a lactation room in a facility in the Asia-Pacific region could be used as a Muslim prayer space as well. It was a specific question about a small area in a single office -- but all of a sudden work-family matters had the potential to collide with issues of work and faith. 
Religion has become a flashpoint in many offices as more employees seek to bring their whole identities to work. So managers are contending with how to create workplaces that are comfortable and welcoming for employees of all faiths -- and of none. 
 There are several reasons for the shift. For one, a global economy is bringing much greater religious diversity to the workplace Everyone wants their beliefs to be accepted, if not equally represented. Add to that the fact that religion is now a public topic, from a president who talks openly about his faith to a proliferation of religious television programming. 
 When everybody from the president on down ''is wearing their religion on their sleeve, then it's not surprising that employees will feel empowered to be more assertive about asserting their rights to religious expression in the workplace,'' said Dr. Georgette Bennett, the president and founder of the Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding, in New York.
 Now, I have worked in several offices where a few people left early every Friday to observe their Sabbath, or took certain days off for religious observance, and no one made a big deal of it. But things don't always run that smoothly: complaints of religious discrimination to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission increased 20 percent, to 2,541, from 2001 to 2006. 
 Those figures may understate what employees are feeling. The Tanenbaum Center's research indicates that only 23 percent of employees who believe that they are experiencing religious bias complain -- but of those who feel that way, 45 percent are looking for new jobs. 
 ''Managers have to think what the factors are that attract or cause people to leave their organization,'' said Ms. Riccardi, now the senior adviser on diversity and inclusion at the Conference Board, which published a report last November on faith in the workplace. ''If religion is one, they have to think about how to manage that,'' and create an environment that is inviting to as many people as possible.
 Question No. 1 is how to make general accommodations for the beliefs and practices of religious employees in a way that is fair to all workers. Employers are required by law to make substantial accommodations for their employees' religious practices, as long as doing so does not create a major hardship for them. 
 Some companies serve as hosts of employee-run groups that hold discussions on different faiths and the like. Ford, for example, supports the Ford Interfaith Network, which among other things has lobbied for physical accommodations for employees' religious practices, like sinks designed for the religious washings that Muslim employees may perform. 
 Other companies take a more hands-off approach. Procter & Gamble does not sponsor any organized religious activities on company property, according to Vicky Mayer, a spokeswoman, but it makes accommodations that include giving employees floating holidays to use for religious observance and providing rooms for prayer. 
 When it comes to specific questions about faith at work, though, managers often have to improvise. I.B.M. was faced with a tricky situation several years ago when a new hire, a veiled Muslim woman, showed up for her first day of work and was told she had to have her picture taken for her employee identification badge. The woman objected on religious grounds to showing her face. 
 So I.B.M. officials came up with a solution: she had her picture taken in a veil, and that was on the identification badge she used day to day. But a female photographer also took her picture without a veil for a second badge, which the employee carried in her purse, according to Laurie Friedman, a spokeswoman for the company. If the employee ever had to show that badge, she would be required to do so only to a female security officer. 
 I.B.M. managed to work through that particular challenge, but British Airways learned the hard way that a small incident involving religion can quickly become a really big deal. 
 A uniformed employee of the airline came to work last year wearing a cross on a chain over her uniform. British Airways views its uniform as a symbol of the airline, and company policy dictated that employees who wore jewelry should wear it under the uniform whenever practical. 
 After the employee, Nadia Eweida, was told to put the cross under her uniform, she appealed the policy. She lost, appealed again -- and then newspaper editorials began castigating the airline, and the Anglican church criticized the policy. Even Prime Minister Tony Blair delivered a gentle reprimand to British Airways. 
 Last month, the airline revised its policy to allow symbols of faith to be worn as lapel pins, or in some cases on chains around the neck, and Ms. Eweida, who was on unpaid leave, returned to work on Feb. 3.
 And what of the request to allow a lactation room to double as a prayer room at PricewaterhouseCoopers? Ms. Riccardi realized on reflection that there was a problem. Muslims need to pray at specific times each day, she said, but for nursing mothers, too, ''when it's time, it's time.'' She advised against the change.

HEADLINE: A Weak Dollar Is Music to Foreign Tourists

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI

 BODY:
The lure of Times Square, Rodeo Drive and points in between is stronger than ever to foreign tourists. In 2006, international travel receipts in the United States reached a record $107.4 billion, according to the Commerce Department. That represents a full recovery, and then some, from the effects of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. 
 Spending by foreign travelers, though it occurs on American soil, is counted as an American export. And over the years, travel has done its part to keep the trade deficit (about $763 billion for 2006) from ballooning any further. In fact, 2006 was the 18th year in a row that the United States had a travel surplus ($7.3 billion).
Americans can thank the falling dollar for attracting so many more foreign tourists lately. Europeans can indulge in meals, shopping and entertainment while barely making a dent in their store of euros. Meanwhile, Americans who may be contemplating a trip to Paris are looking at the exchange rate and wondering: ''Can a $100 croissant be far off? Maybe I'll stay home this year.'' PHYLLIS KORKKI

HEADLINE: Investors Mostly Glum in a Short Trading Week

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI

 BODY:
After a string of uneven days, the stock market closed mostly lower last week amid renewed inflation fears. Announcements of big merger plans -- between Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio, and between Whole Foods and Wild Oats Markets -- were not enough to offset investors' mild economic gloom. 
 Investors who had been lulled by recent inflation news were somewhat jolted to learn on Wednesday that consumer prices had risen more than expected in January. Concerns that home loan defaults are on the rise helped cement the week's downward trend. Countrywide, the largest home lender in the United States, fell 5.7 percent for the week.
The week was shortened by the Presidents' Day holiday on Monday. Over the four remaining days, the Dow Jones industrial average dipped 120.09 points, or 0.94 percent, to close at 12,647.48. It was the Dow's worst weekly performance since August. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dipped 4.35 points, or 0.30 percent, to close at 1,451.19. The Nasdaq composite index gained 18.79 points, or 0.75 percent, to close at 2,515.10.
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond fell to 4.67 percent from 4.69 percent the previous week. PHYLLIS KORKKI

HEADLINE: Those Multiple Choices In Long-Term Care Policies

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
INSURANCE, they say, is one product you can't buy when you need it most. When it comes to coverage for long-term care, however, a myriad of choices makes even timely buying a daunting process. 
 Although industry statistics indicate that more than two of three people turning 65 will eventually need such care -- which may be provided in a nursing home, assisted-living facility or at home -- even deciding whether you should buy long-term care insurance is a challenge.
Then there's the design of the actual policies, which may be customized for each buyer's pocketbook and unknowable health future.
 ''There's a million different variations and permutations,'' said Steve Killiany, a planner and long-term care specialist at the West Financial Group in Bethesda, Md. ''There's the benefit period, the amount of daily benefit, inflation protection, the waiting period'' and other considerations like the financial strength of the insurance company. 
 The popularity of these policies is arising from several factors, including the climbing cost of health care, longer life expectancies, and a desire to avoid relying on family members who may live far away for care. If you're wealthy enough, of course, there may be little need for this coverage. If you're poor enough, Medicaid will pick up the bill. Not only is there a huge middle ground between rich and poor, but people differ in their desire to draw down assets instead of passing them along to the next generation. 
 A couple with $1 million, for example, may want to be sure that they leave a legacy big enough to put a grandchild through college, rather than risk draining all their funds if they need care for a long time. Mr. Killiany generally considers those with assets of $200,000 to $4 million as candidates for long-term care insurance, but other experts shun any upper limit.
 ''Money is a very touchy subject,'' said Jesse R. Slome, executive director of the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance, an agent trade group based in Westlake Village, Calif. ''Some people are unwilling to spend what they've accumulated and sometimes kids don't want them to.''
 If you decide to join the eight million Americans who now have long-term care policies, either individually or through employers, an even tougher question may be when to buy. 
 There is no simple answer, but Mr. Killiany suggests doing so around the age of 50, when you're relatively young and probably healthy enough to qualify for a modest premium.
 You'll be wise to compare terms of two or three different companies and, if you have the opportunity, a group plan. In general, healthy people do better with individual policies; those in poor health or with a family history of disease, may do better in a group. Industry leaders are companies like John Hancock, MetLife, MassMutual, Prudential and Genworth.
 A typical company policy for a 65-year-old buyer might pay benefits of $150 a day for three years -- a total of about $164,000 -- with payments starting 90 days after a claim is made. With automatic inflation protection to raise the daily benefit 5 percent each year, the annual premium with Hancock for people with a standard health rating would be $1,650 if you buy at age 50, $1,840 if you buy at 55, $2,233 at 60, $2,845 at 65, $4,225 at 70 and $6,560 at 75.
 Once you have been assigned the appropriate risk category, your annual premium will not rise, regardless of your claims or deteriorating health, unless your company wins regulatory approval to raise premiums for all its policy holders in your state.
 (If you move, the rules in the state where you bought the policy apply.) 
 In buying a policy, you can choose almost any number of years -- or a lifetime -- of benefits and raise or lower the daily dollar amount or the waiting period before benefits begin. Inflation protection against rising costs of care can be on either a simple or a compound basis -- or you can choose to do without it. 
 Premiums, which generally rise 8 or 9 percent for each year you wait to apply, also depend on which of three main health-related risk categories -- preferred, standard or substandard -- you are assigned. The preferred, or good-health, designation typically saves 10 to 20 percent.
 The average age of individual buyers is the early 60s; for applicants in their 70s, only one in five qualify for good-health discounts and two-fifths of this age group are denied coverage at any price, according to the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance.
 Premiums are also governed by other considerations, like whether you are married and, if you are, whether your spouse is also applying for a policy.
 Married people -- and in some cases committed partners or even siblings -- are entitled to discounts of 15 to 40 percent because they have a presumed care provider living with them, thereby reducing the cost or likelihood of claims. There is also, in effect, a volume discount for the second policy.
 If a couple can afford only one policy, said Dee Balliett, a partner at Balliett Financial Services in Winter Park, Fla., it may be a good idea to buy coverage on the healthier, younger person. If a husband is older than his wife and he has the only policy, for example, his wife may be left with no one to care for her after his death -- and without insurance. 
 Long-term care policies also take time to buy -- usually several weeks, while the company evaluates statements you have made about your health, perhaps checking them with your doctor. You may also be subject to an interview, probably by telephone, in which the company gauges your mental acuity.
 The questioner may ask you to name as many fruits or vegetables as you can, for example, or to perform simple arithmetic calculations. Insurers pay particular attention to signs of memory loss, which can hint at many years of claims by people in good physical health.
 ''It's the cognitive claim that terrifies'' the companies, Mr. Slome said. ''Insurers are less concerned about disease and conditions that will kill somebody than those that will allow them to live for many years.''
 Healthy buyers should welcome such checking, even if it involves answering questions that a 4-year-old could handle, because it suggests that their premiums won't be subsidizing poor risks, a situation that makes experts wary of some group plans.
 You can generally reduce coverage, and premiums, at any time -- but you cannot raise coverage without making a fresh application.
 Although each policy contains a customized mix of options, the industry has standardized much of the contract language, helping to make policy premiums eligible for tax breaks. For example, for you to collect benefits, you must be unable under federal law to perform two or three of six ''activities of daily living'' without substantial assistance. These ''triggers'' involve bathing, dressing, eating, going to the toilet, continence and basic mobility.
 Specialists recommend that the policy specify that this determination be made not by the company, but by your own licensed health care practitioner (not necessarily a doctor).
 Last year, 36.5 percent of claims paid by eight top long-term insurers were for nursing home care, 33.9 percent for care in the home and 29.6 percent for assisted-living costs.
 While women use long-term care for an average 3.7 years, compared with 2.2 years for men -- and are also more likely to be without a spouse -- Mr. Slome considers a policy that pays for three years a good, middle-of-the-road choice for most people. Only 8 percent of claimants exhaust benefits in that time, the association has found. (You may stop and restart claims as your health permits.) 
 BENEFITS can be paid under three methods. The main one these days is called reimbursement, with the company paying either you or your provider only when you receive services it deems eligible. The other methods are indemnity, under which the insurer pays a set amount directly to you so long as you obtain some care, and disability, under which you get a full benefit if you are eligible, whether or not you choose to use any services.
 Insurance specialists warn that one of the most costly mistakes made by buyers, particularly those under 70, is shunning inflation protection in order to minimize their premiums. 
 Another major error, Mr. Killiany said, is trying to save money by not taking a full benefit for home care on the assumption that such care will always cost less than care in an institution. But dealing with progressive illness at home, with individualized nursing care, can be far more expensive than it is in a nursing home.
 While long-term care insurance can be expensive, careful choices of coverage and deductibles, along with the possible tax breaks, can make it more accessible. You can deduct premiums from federal income taxes to the extent that they and other medically related expenses exceed 71/2 percent of adjusted gross income. And 37 states now offer deductions or credits for long-term care insurance premiums. (New York and New Jersey are among them; Virginia's deduction begins for 2007.) And premiums can be up to 100 percent deductible for businesses.
 Moreover, you can save as much as 8 percent or so by paying premiums annually instead of monthly or quarterly.
 Nonetheless, this coverage is not for everyone, experts caution -- and certainly not for those who can ill afford the premiums.
 ''I don't put long-term care at the top of the list'' for sound old-age financial planning unless you have significant assets and want to leave an inheritance, said Ms. Balliett in Florida. ''But if that's your choice, then you better get it.''

 BODY:
THE GOLDEN ROAD
 Notes on My Gentrification.
 By Caille Millner.
 248 pp. The Penguin Press.
 $22.95.
This memoir follows a young woman's erratic maturation from working-class San Jose, where she was an African-American growing up in a predominantly Hispanic community, to Harvard and beyond -- often to the back of beyond. Caille Millner also takes stabs at some socio-economic analysis -- of class tribalism, the tech boom, urban real estate patterns, and other phenomena that might seem odd in the life story of a 27-year-old. But while these forays dilute the more urgent tale of her search for a moral compass, they are inextricable, ultimately, from her self-image as a smart, scrapping, awkward young woman yearning for meaning and stability.
 The ''gentrification'' of the subtitle was well under way by the time Millner started high school. Her parents had overcome hardship to become academics, eventually moving to the more affluent Almaden Valley. After a dispiriting spell in a mediocre public middle school, Millner enrolled in a Catholic girls school, where the Ivy League was placed within her reach. Reach for it she did, with such addled fervor that now, only a decade after she was a college freshman, she looks back on her life with some astonishment. 
 At 16, Millner wrote an essay for The San Jose Mercury News drawing attention to the racism she perceived at her school. Getting published may have been just the thing for her C.V., but after the article appeared, fellow students signed a petition in protest of her complaint, which they claimed was unfounded. Her car was vandalized, and she endured the ''silent hostility'' of her mostly white, high-achieving classmates. Later, she learned that some of her peers had resented the supposed edge she had gained with her expose -- endowing herself with a marketable claim to oppression and making them look bad.
 Millner graduated in ''a shower of scholarships and awards.'' Shrewd student of the system that she was, and still is, she imagined that the college admissions committee saw itself as the shaper of ''a classic underdog story with a Hollywood ending,'' in which she was the plucky heroine.
 She was not a righteous crusader, it emerges, but a paralyzed schoolgirl under pressure to achieve. Today Millner, who is a member of the editorial board of The San Francisco Chronicle, describes her youthful essay and its fallout as one of the ''identity narratives'' members of her generation spew out to gain an advantage in the meritocracy. ''Now I have come clean,'' she tells us, ''and ruined a story that formed a critical part of who I once presented myself to be.'' As terrifying to Millner as the backlash she wrought in high school was her accidental discovery of her own skill at image manipulation. Her ambivalence about identity is at the heart of ''The Golden Road.'' As a girl she felt at home among her Hispanic neighbors. The civil rights movement was exotic to her; her earliest lessons in outrage involved the indignities suffered by illegal day laborers. Yet, eventually she was wounded and excluded by those Spanish-speaking compatriots. Later, as a fledgling journalist in South Africa, she would develop a deep affection for the mixed-race Cape Town enclave where she was living. But she found that it was held back by its own stultifying cultural codes.
 Millner had been suspicious of mainstream definitions of success, and angry at her parents for moving to a more prosperous town. She says this migration deprived her of the black credentials she was straining to cultivate. In Almaden Valley, she encountered ''contemporary racism with a smile,'' and while repelled by smug children of privilege at Harvard, she also grew numb listening to African-Americans' tales of subtle exclusion. She was drawn to activist students, but was crushed when they turned out to be cynical resume-stackers, adopting causes to impress corporate recruiters. ''What I learned at Harvard,'' she reveals, ''was how to behave as though I had gone to Harvard.''
 Initially energized by a living-wage campaign for campus workers, Millner grew disenchanted with the student protesters, whose engagement in the class struggle she found theatrical and self-serving. She secluded herself in her dorm room, where she spent weeks ''curled up on the floor, staring silently out at nothing.'' On the eve of her graduation, she got so hammered that she had to drink infant-rehydration formula to fortify herself for the ceremony. Millner's drug use, a recurring theme, is sometimes depicted as if it were one more commitment on her crammed to-do list. It was not, she implies, reckless debauchery but deliberate self-medication in the face of life's pressures.
 Just as Millner wandered the globe, from Cape Town to Brooklyn, tentatively adopting causes and identities, her writing has an unsettled quality. Characters -- a complex brother, forceful parents -- appear and evaporate. She is capable of enviably precise observations and lyrical descriptive turns -- a sky is like the ''crushed velvet lining of a jewelry box'' -- but these vie with wearying passages of social theory. When we read that ''the hybridity seemed irreconcilable for so many years until I understood the American habit of maintaining a reductive naivete through compartmentalized guilt,'' we want to send in a search party to find the human being trapped under all the big words.
 Millner tells of ''an eating disorder,'' but she is coy, not telling us how or if she was treated for it. She confesses to an interest in ''dangerous men,'' but the accounts of her affairs are flat and withholding. She offers justifications for her attraction to a racist, misogynist computer geek on the West Coast -- there was a ''strong sexual spark,'' she had power over him, she was young -- but she never convincingly evokes his alleged magnetism. Nor do we understand why she fell for a sculptor she refers to as the ''Englishman,'' because she never gets down to the messy business of examining her emotional connection with him.
 With her jargony commentary on society, Millner often seems to be building defenses against getting too personal, being too clear. And while she too rarely pierces this fog, when she does, it's worth the effort. We're allowed glimpses of an idealistic, delicately calibrated young woman desperate to grow up, fall in love and change the world. ''I smoked clove cigarettes, and read obscure books, and wore dark currant lipstick that didn't suit my complexion. I refused to show surprise, interest or delight,'' she writes. Such clear-eyed, breezy recollections, delivered with a light touch, win us over.

HEADLINE: What a College Education Buys

BYLINE: By Christopher Caldwell. 
Christopher Caldwell is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
How important is college to Americans? Put it this way: When Philip Zelikow, the State Department counselor who worked often on Israel-Palestine issues, resigned in November, he cited ''some truly riveting obligations to college bursars.'' That's how important college is -- it's more important than peace in the Middle East.
The Democrats' promise last fall to make college more affordable for the middle class was a no-lose gambit. It pleased everybody. When the new majority voted in January to halve the interest rate on federally guaranteed student loans, 124 Republicans joined them. ''I just think that we need more of our kids going to school,'' said Representative Roscoe Bartlett, a Maryland Republican. But given that 45 percent of U.S. high-school graduates already enroll in four-year colleges, how dire can this ''need'' be? 
 Certain influential Americans have begun to reassert the old wisdom that a college education is one of those things, like sky diving and liverwurst, that are both superb and not for everybody. Not long ago, the conservative social scientist Charles Murray wrote a three-part series in The Wall Street Journal in which he attacked the central assumption behind President George Bush's No Child Left Behind initiative. The idea that ''educators already know how to educate everyone and that they just need to try harder'' is a costly wrong impression, he wrote. Not all schoolchildren have the intellectual capacity to reach ''basic achievement'' levels. In college, similar limitations apply. The number of Americans with the brains to master the most challenging college classes, Murray argued, is probably closer to 15 percent than to 45.
 Of course, part of the reason Americans think everyone should go to college is for its noneducational uses. Anyone can benefit from them. Colleges are the country's most effective marriage brokers. They are also -- assuming you don't study too hard -- a means of redistributing four years' worth of leisure time from the sad stub-end of life to the prime of it. (Just as youth shouldn't be wasted on the young, retirement shouldn't be wasted on the old.) 
 But the price of college long ago outstripped the value of these goods. The most trustworthy indicator that an American college education is something worthwhile is that parents nationwide -- and even worldwide -- are eager to pay up to $180,000 to get one for their children. This is a new development. A quarter-century ago, even the top Ivy League schools were a bargain at $10,000 a year, but they received fewer applications than they do now. Presumably, college is steadily more expensive because its benefits are steadily more visible. In 1979, according to the economists Frank Levy and Richard Murnane, a 30-year-old college graduate earned 17 percent more than a 30-year-old high-school grad. Now the gap is over 50 percent. 
 These numbers don't tell us much about how people get educated at a typical American college offers. You can go to college to get civilized (in the sense that your thoughts about your triumphs and losses at the age of 55 will be colored and deepened by an encounter with Horace or Yeats at the age of 19). Or you can go there to get qualified (in the sense that Salomon Brothers will snap you up, once it sees your B.A. in economics from M.I.T.). Most often, parents must think they are paying for the latter product. Great though Yeats may be, 40-some-odd thousand seems a steep price to pay for his acquaintance. The timeless questions that college provokes -- like ''What the hell are you going to do with a degree in English?'' -- must get shouted across dinner tables with increasing vehemence as college costs rise inexorably. 
 But the education kids are rewarded for may not be the same education their parents think they are paying for. Economists would say that a college degree is partly a ''signaling'' device -- it shows not that its holder has learned something but rather that he is the kind of person who could learn something. Colleges sort as much as they teach. Even when they don't increase a worker's productivity, they help employers find the most productive workers, and a generic kind of productivity can be demonstrated as effectively in medieval-history as in accounting classes. 
 Moreover, if you're not planning on becoming, say, a doctor, the benefits of diligent study can be overstated. In recent decades, the biggest rewards have gone to those whose intelligence is deployable in new directions on short notice, not to those who are locked into a single marketable skill, however thoroughly learned and accredited. Most of the employees who built up, say, Google in its early stages could never have been trained to do so, because neither the company nor the idea of it existed when they were getting their educations. Under such circumstances, it's best not to specialize too much. Something like the old ideal of a ''liberal education'' has had a funny kind of resurgence, minus the steeping in Western culture. It is hard to tell whether this success vindicates liberal education's defenders (who say it ''teaches you how to think'') or its detractors (who say it camouflages a social elite as a meritocratic one). 
 Maybe college cannot become much more accessible. The return on college degrees must eventually fall as more people get them, and probably not everyone wants one. In France, people often refer to their education as a ''formation.'' The word implies that an increase in your specialized capabilities is bought at a price in flexibility and breadth of knowledge. In most times and places, this bitter trade-off is worth it. But for the past few years at least, the particular advantage of an American degree has been that it doesn't qualify you to do anything in particular.
 Pure college'* occupations with the most job openings for college graduates (in thousands). Projected 2004-2014.
 *Occupations where a high concentration of workers have at least a bachelor's degree.

HEADLINE: The Luminist

BYLINE: By Arthur Lubow. 
Arthur Lubow, a contributing writer, last wrote for the magazine about the singer Thomas Quasthoff.

 BODY:
On a damp winter morning, 20 weather-beaten men waited at a bleak corner in east Vancouver. You can find scenes like this in most cities: places where laborers gather, hoping that a van will pull up with an employer offering cash in return for a day's work. This scene, however, was riddled with curious anomalies, starting with the middle-aged figure dressed in black who stood behind a tripod-mounted camera and patiently watched the men wait. And what were the men waiting for? Not a job. 
That they already had, courtesy of the photographer, Jeff Wall, who had hired them at the actual ''cash corner'' where they normally congregated and then bused them to this spot he preferred a half-hour's drive away. No, they were waiting for Wall to determine that the rain had become too heavy or the light had grown too bright or the prevailing mood had turned too restless for him to obtain the feeling of suspended activity and diffused expectancy that he sought in the picture. He was prepared to come here, day after day, for several weeks. On any given morning, typically after three hours elapsed, he would adjourn until the next day, authorizing the men to receive their paychecks of 82 Canadian dollars and get back into the bus. Until then, all of us -- the men, Wall and I -- waited for something to happen that lay outside our control.
Photography has always involved waiting. When the technology was young, slow-acting emulsions required both photographer and subject to wait motionless for the image to register. The introduction of fast film changed the way a photographer must wait. In the tradition of documentary photography that arose, the photographer is understood to be waiting for the right convergence of subject, lighting and frame before clicking the shutter -- waiting for what a master of the genre, Henri Cartier-Bresson, famously called ''the decisive moment.'' Lee Friedlander, another great street photographer, compared this anticipatory state to the hunting alertness of a ''one-eyed cat.'' The metaphor of the hunt has seeped into the essential language of photography. You don't click, press or squeeze a picture; you shoot one. Walker Evans wrote of his ''subway series,'' the portraits of unaware New York train passengers that he began in the late 1930s: ''I am stalking, as in the hunt. What a bagful to be taken home.'' And Diane Arbus's friend and mentor Marvin Israel said after her death in 1971: ''The photograph is like her trophy -- it's what she received as the reward for this adventure.'' 
 One thing that Wall knew for certain when he took up the profession in the late 1970s is that he would not become a photojournalistic hunter. Educated as an art historian, he aspired instead to make photographs that could be constructed and experienced the way paintings are. ''Most photographs cannot get looked at very often,'' he told me. ''They get exhausted. Great photographers have done it on the fly. It doesn't happen that often. I just wasn't interested in doing that. I didn't want to spend my time running around trying to find an event that could be made into a picture that would be good.'' He also disliked the way photographs were typically exhibited as small prints. ''I don't like the traditional 8 by 10,'' he said. ''They were done that size as displays for prints to run in books. It's too shrunken, too compressed. When you're making things to go on a wall, as I do, that seems too small.'' The art that he liked best, from the full-length portraits of Velazquez and Manet to the drip paintings of Jackson Pollock and the floor pieces of Carl Andre, engaged the viewer on a lifelike human scale. They could be walked up to (or, in Andre's case, onto) and moved away from. They held their own, on a wall or in a room. ''If painting can be that scale and be effective, then a photograph ought to be effective at that size, too,'' he concluded. 
 However, judging from the record of his three decades of work, which is the subject of an exhibition opening today at the Museum of Modern Art in New York (and traveling later to the Art Institute of Chicago and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art), I suspect that what Wall found most unsatisfying about photography when he took up a camera was its marginal position in the art world and in art history. There was an established roster of great photographers and classic photographs, which embraced, among other things, the uncannily empty Paris streetscapes of Atget, the formally inventive New York skylines of Alfred Stieglitz and the austere Hale County studies of Walker Evans. The canon led right up to the street photography of Robert Frank, Garry Winogrand, Diane Arbus and Lee Friedlander. ''I couldn't get into '60s art photography -- Friedlander, Arbus and Winogrand and Stephen Shore,'' Wall says. ''These guys were in a photo ghetto. They were into their own world, with photo galleries and their own photo books.'' Ambition also colored his thinking. For an energetic young man, what appeal was there in a genre whose practitioners seemed to have already taken their best shots? 
 Wall thought big. When he emerged in 1978 as a fully formed artist, he presented photographs that demanded equal status with paintings. In sheer size, they were measured in feet, not inches. He produced them as unique objects, not in editions, and their aura was heightened by the mode of display: enormous transparencies lit from behind by fluorescent bulbs, a ''light box'' format that was typically used for advertising. Like a commercial light box, a Wall photograph grabbed you with its glowing presence, but then, unlike an advertisement, it held your gaze with the richness of its detail and the harmony of its arrangement. You could study it with the attention you devoted to a Flemish altarpiece in a church, and you could surrender yourself to its spell as if you were in a movie theater. 
 In his methodology, Wall sidestepped altogether the central challenge preoccupying the street photographers, of how to impose a satisfying formal composition on a subject captured instantaneously. Rather than hunt for material to photograph, he manufactured his subject matter in the studio. He was creating what he depicted, not merely the depiction itself. His first cataloged photograph, ''The Destroyed Room,'' shows a strewn heap of women's clothing in a ransacked room that a careful observer can detect (and is meant to detect) was constructed as a set for the photo shoot. Equally clear, in this tableau of violence directed against a woman's possessions, is the tip of the artist's hat to the feminist art criticism of that time. However, what even a well-educated viewer might have missed, without Wall's printed exegesis, is the reference the photographer was making to a great 19th-century painting, ''The Death of Sardanapalus,'' by Delacroix, in which an Assyrian king, his armies defeated, languidly commands the pre-emptive destruction of his court and harem. As significant as any of these allusions is Wall's insistence that you recognize them. He was pushing his claim to belong to the great tradition of Western art as hard as he could. 
 How things have changed. Photography no longer needs to clamor for a place at the table; at times, it seems to be hogging the meal. One of the great shifts in Western art over the last three decades is photography's move from a subsidiary position, akin to the one still occupied by drawings and prints, to a central place alongside painting and sculpture. Literally, it has ascended. Anne Tucker, curator of photography at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, recalls that in the '70s, photos were found ''on the way to the restroom or the restaurant in every museum.'' She adds: ''We've left the basement.'' 
 The commercial arena has also registered photography's elevated status. Last year, an Edward Steichen moonlit pond from 1904 set a record for a photograph at auction when it fetched $2.9 million at a Sotheby's sale. Even in the context of the art-world bubble, that was eye-popping. Denise Bethel points out that in 1990, when she came to the Sotheby's photographs department she now runs, the record at auction for a painting was held by a van Gogh portrait of Dr. Gachet, which sold that year for $82.5 million, and for a photograph by an Edward Weston study of a nautilus shell, which brought $115,000 in 1989. What has occurred since? ''The record for a painting at auction today is Picasso's 'Boy With a Pipe,' for $104 million,'' she says. ''Over 15 years, you have gone from $82.5 million to $104 million, which could just be inflation. In photographs, the record was set here at Sotheby's with $2.9 million for a Steichen photograph. In 15 years, from $115,000 to $2.9 million -- that's not inflation. That gives you some idea of the explosion in photography.'' The explosion continues: Earlier this month, Sotheby's London set a new record by selling Andreas Gursky's giant diptych of a 99-cent discount store for $3.3 million.
 Whatever his rueful ambivalence about the art-world sales mania, Wall can take some credit for the recognition of photography as a full-fledged art form. (As for his own prices: While a large Wall photograph infrequently appears at auction, his dealer's price -- and remember, a gallery generally charges much less than an auction resale brings -- is about a million dollars. The typical buyer is a museum or a major private collector.) ''His best pictures are so good and so original and so fabulous, nothing else today looks like them,'' says Peter Galassi, chief curator of photography at MoMA, who has curated the current exhibition with Neal Benezra, director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. 
 Singular as Wall's achievement may be, his ambition has inspired a wave of younger photographers. You can see the influence of his huge images and studied compositions on the Dusseldorf group led by Gursky, Thomas Struth, Thomas Ruff and Candida Hofer. (Gursky has cited Wall as ''a great model for me.'') You can see it as well in the man-in-the-street pictures of Philip-Lorca diCorcia -- done with a large-format camera, strobes and unwitting passers-by -- which continue Wall's reworking of the documentary tradition. The recent staged portraits of derelicts by an older photographer, Boris Mikhailov, in which the unfortunate actors are playing themselves, also owe a debt to Wall. Gregory Crewdson's elaborately staged tableaux of overwrought small-town Americana are a mannered extension of Wall's cinematographic use of performers and sets. The list could go on indefinitely. Wall doesn't like the work of all of these photographers. He is critical of pictures that are unthinkingly big merely for the sake of being big, of sensational subject matter that is ''too remarkable and too interesting'' and of photographers who ''want to nail something'' and ''hit it square on and make it impressive,'' where he himself would ''rather miss the nail and leave it crooked.'' But he likes the notion that he has extended the possibilities of photography -- and of art. 
 One of THREE CHILDREN born to a physician father and a homemaker mother, Wall, who is 60, grew up in a comfortable neighborhood in south Vancouver, where his parents encouraged his early ambition to be an artist. Although all four of his grandparents were Jewish immigrants from the Ukrainian city of Odessa, and he has produced two photographs set in a Jewish cemetery, he says that his parents ''weren't religious, weren't very observant of anything,'' and that Judaism ''is not a subject that I'm that obsessed or fascinated by.'' An intense, clever boy who loved to read, Wall especially enjoyed perusing art publications. Magazines and books were the way the best contemporary art could be seen in Vancouver. Wall remembers his first view of important abstract paintings at the Seattle World's Fair of 1962 as an ''overwhelming'' experience. ''I came back and painted 18-foot canvases,'' he says. Later, studying art history at the University of British Columbia, he continued to make art. 
 Through his interest in contemporary art, Wall awoke to the possibilities of photography -- realizing, like many other young artists, that photography offered a way out of the cul-de-sac in which painting had lost itself. The Modernist credo that the artist must not indulge in illusionism but should instead call attention to his bag of tricks -- which for a painter included the support of the canvas, the surface of the paint and the two-dimensional flatness of the image -- had led to the monochrome paintings of Minimalism. ''I had done monochromes to the point where I was painting on the walls with transparent varnish,'' Wall recalls. ''Some would have a little bit of gold in them, so it would glitter in the sunlight. There was a clear surface of shiny nothing. There was no place you could go beyond that.'' The only plausible next step -- and this is where the art world had moved -- was to renounce the physicality of art entirely in favor of conceptualism. Committed to political and artistic radicalism, most conceptual artists sought to avoid making artworks that might function as commodities, mystifications or palliatives that helped sustain the status quo. In its purest form, conceptual art shunned the baggage-encumbered media of paint or wood and instead manipulated language. ''As soon as it was clear that a piece of paper that said it was an artwork was art, then anything was an artwork,'' Wall says.
 It was under the cloak of conceptual art that photography in the 1970s emerged from the photo ghetto and entered mainstream art galleries. Photoconceptualism often took the form of documentation -- either of workaday urban structures and other undistinguished sites (typically accompanied by deadpan, off-kilter texts) or of ephemeral performances. The perfection of the image and the print, so crucial to traditional photography, no longer mattered. The photographic image had been reduced to a kind of thought-illustration, and the artists taking the pictures regarded themselves not as photographers but as artists using photography. Wall himself scored a precocious success as a conceptual artist in 1970, when his cheaply produced booklet, ''Landscape Manual,'' of nondescript Vancouver places that he photographed from a car was included in ''Information,'' a hallmark conceptual art exhibition held at MoMA in New York. Still, this was not what had drawn him to art, and it did not hold him for long. 
 In 1970, Wall stopped making art. With his wife, Jeannette, a native of England whom he had met as a student in Vancouver, and their two young sons, he moved to London to study art history at the Courtauld Institute of Art. Wall spent much of his three years in London watching movies and reading critical theory. After the family returned to Vancouver in 1973, he earned a living as an instructor; while teaching studio art and art theory, he wrote screenplays and fantasized about becoming a filmmaker like the auteurs he admired -- Hitchcock, Bresson, Fassbinder and Jean-Marie Straub and Daniele Huillet. Friends warned him off. ''I kept saying to Jeff, knowing he was a control freak, 'Hitchcock was able to have a lot of control over the images in his work, but you won't be able to go to Hollywood and have that kind of detailed control in a movie,' '' recalls his early mentor and close friend, Ian Wallace, a postconceptual artist who has had a long and interesting career combining photography and monochrome painting. What apparently cured Wall of the filmmaking bug was the experience of collaborating on a failed movie with Wallace and a mutual friend, Rodney Graham, who has since gained a reputation of his own as both an artist and a musician. The Hitchcock-influenced film followed a woman who steals clothes as she shops. ''Jeff was a powerful personality and had all these ideas,'' Graham says. ''It ended up being totally his film.'' Actually, it ended up being no film at all. Wall was unhappy with it and ditched the project, leaving Wallace to salvage stills as large blowups.
 The art that Wallace was creating on his own, Wall says, seemed more successful. Wallace produced very large photomontages that he would cut up and paste, rephotograph and hand-color. Sometimes he would stage modern-dress versions of classic paintings, in which his friends would assume one or -- with the benefit of montage -- several parts. (When I asked Wall whom he played in Wallace's rendition of Caravaggio's ''Calling of St. Matthew,'' he replied: ''Jesus. I probably wouldn't have settled for any other role.'') In the way that a calorie counter might admire a gourmand friend, the finicky Wall respected Wallace's loosely constructed images. ''They looked really good, really rough too,'' Wall says. ''He was very free. There were no precedents.'' 
 As he well knows, that's not quite true. The history of photography is stocked with precedents, dating back to its earliest days. You think there is something new about seamless photomontages? In the 1850s, Oscar Gustave Rejlander and Henry Peach Robinson made elaborate composites from multiple negatives. Or staged tableaux? Hippolyte Bayard depicted himself as a drowned man in 1840, and photographers have been staging such shots ever since, with F. Holland Day's hammy impersonation of Christ at the end of the 19th century anteceding Wall's more restrained performance in the role. Yet the use of photomontage and the staged tableau seemed fresh to Wall, Wallace and their friends because they were using these techniques in the self-reflexive Modernist spirit of their age. Their versions were patent contrivances, calling attention to their artificiality. 
 Wallace's work was strongly in Wall's mind when he took his family on a trip to Europe and Morocco in the summer of 1977 and first visited the great collection in the Prado in Madrid. As he has sometimes recounted the story, the impression made on him by the Velazquez paintings in the Prado reverberated with the advertising light boxes that he encountered on the side of bus kiosks as he traveled, setting off an explosive artistic reaction when he got back to Vancouver. ''I saw the Velazquez, Goya, Titian -- I loved it and wanted to be part of it somehow,'' he told me. ''Every time the bus stopped, you were looking out the window, and there was a sign in a light box. I began to think, It's luminous, Velazquez was luminous, I'll try it. I thought, It has a certain vulgar quality, a rough quality, a slightly uncivilized air they brought to high painting.'' The paintings in the Prado exerted a galvanizing impact a century earlier on Manet, one of Wall's heroes; the parallels must have been irresistible. Even before these bus-stop epiphanies, however, Wall had been considering light boxes as a way of avoiding the distressing deterioration of photographs over time. ''I was always interested in permanence,'' he says. ''It's really important to me that art gets old.'' Far more than most oil paintings, color photographs degenerate. Cibachrome printing, which uses metallic rather than organic dyes, is more durable than the alternatives. Unfortunately, the dyes are embedded in a shiny paper that Wall loathed. By printing the pictures as transparencies in light boxes, he avoided that drawback.
 When he came home, Wall started working at a furious pace on the light-box transparencies that inaugurated and continue to characterize his mature artistic career. It was a turbulent period: Jeannette had left him, an estrangement that lasted a dozen years. ''I did a lot of work between '78 and '79,'' he says now, with the uninflected tone and ruminative evenhandedness that are features of his conversation. ''Even though I wasn't that pleased about the situation, I wasn't that displeased on another level.'' He was ready in late 1978 for his first one-man show, which took place at the Nova Gallery, a small exhibition space devoted to photography that Claudia Beck, an art historian, and Andrew Gruft, an architecture professor, opened in Vancouver two years earlier. Wall interviewed them before agreeing to the exhibition, to make sure they were versed in the latest art discourse. ''His attitude was, 'I don't want to show with you if you don't have the right ideas about things,' '' Beck recalls. Soft-spoken and exceedingly polite in his normal interactions, Wall has a razor-sharp mind that can slash through artists and critics he disdains.
 Presenting his exhibition as an ''installation'' rather than as a photography show, he placed ''The Destroyed Room'' in the storefront window of the Nova Gallery, enclosing it in a plasterboard wall. You could see it only from outside, where, especially after dark, it resembled an actual vandalized room. ''Cars would jam their brakes on at night,'' Gruft says. ''I think we had a few near misses.'' Before the show closed, the piece was purchased by the National Gallery of Canada, a rousing send-off to a young artist's career. 
 Although Wall's early light boxes reflected what was happening elsewhere in the art world, some of the resemblances were superficial. By using himself as a model, he was playing with the idea of performance that photographer-artists as diverse as Urs Luthi, David Lamelas, Hannah Wilke and the just-emerging Cindy Sherman were exploring; yet unlike these artists, he didn't care to make points about social role-playing or identity formation. His use of a light-box format that is derived from advertising suggested a radical analysis of the spectacle of consumer culture, but in what may be revisionist hindsight, he maintains today that when he chose to make Cibachrome transparencies, ''I was not especially interested in doing a critique of advertising -- it was an accident.'' His fastidious concern with the physical beauty of his images also set him apart from most of the contemporary avant-garde photographers and closer to the painters he revered. 
 For, attuned as he was to the ideas that preoccupied conceptual artists, Wall cared more about the pictorial issues that have historically governed painting. In the contemporary painter's crisis, he found an opportunity. He thought photographers could undertake the mission that many painters were neglecting: the depiction of how contemporary people talk, dress, work, quarrel and play. He understood just how strange it would be for an artist with Modernist credentials to resuscitate ambitions that had been largely moribund since the passing of Manet. Nevertheless, there are qualities specific to photography that might prove advantageous to the depiction of quotidian reality. Where a painter must employ tricks of foreshortening and tonal gradation to simulate what the eye perceives, a photographer need only point the lens to have everything emerge in instant perspective. Although a smooth photographic surface may be less tactilely pleasurable than a textured layer of paint, it arrives unburdened by the weight of art history. ''There's just a whole lot of problems that photography doesn't have to engage with,'' says Michael Fried, a prominent critic and art historian who has championed Wall's work. ''The photograph shifts the register to a different place. The missing ingredient is everything to do with touch and sensuous surface. It's a big price, but by paying that price there's a lot that is sidestepped.'' 
 But staging a street scene and then photographing it as if it had ''really'' occurred: Wasn't that a pretense that betrayed the honest parameters of photography? Shouldn't a photograph be a document of things the photographer found in the world? Not necessarily, Wall thought. ''What an artist could do with photography wasn't bounded by the documentary impulse -- but that other part was underdeveloped,'' he told me. ''Painting could be topographical realism or it could be angels -- in the same medium. Why couldn't photography do the same?'' Many earlier photographers, like Brassai and Bill Brandt, occasionally set up shots that appeared to be candid. Unlike them, Wall and his like-minded colleagues, including Sherman and diCorcia, were unashamed of their fakery. For them, it was one mark of their artistry. 
 In his early work, Wall self-consciously emphasized how weirdly hybrid his enterprise was. He overlaid allusions to great 19th-century painting and to current feminist art criticism in studio pictures that showed off their artificial construction. For example, in ''Picture for Women'' (1979), he reconceived Manet's masterpiece ''A Bar at the Folies-Bergere'' by changing the setting to a photographer's studio. In Manet's painting, the central figure, a barmaid with downcast eyes, is visibly the object of a male gaze, emanating from a customer who is seen reflected in the mirror behind her and who is located in a perspectivally impossible position that approximates the one occupied by the viewer of the painting. When he composed his photograph, Wall set his camera, seen (like Manet's gentleman client) as a mirror reflection, at the center; an attractive young woman stands at the left, coolly contemplating the camera and the photographer beside it, who is none other than Wall himself. In a clever inversion, the camera and its operator have become the central subject of the picture and the object of feminine scrutiny. If it were merely a didactic exercise, ''Picture for Women'' would hold limited interest. However, the beauty of the seven-foot-long glowing image enthralls even viewers unfamiliar with the art-historical allusions. If you do recognize how Wall converted the receding globe lights of the Folies-Bergere bar into regularly positioned overhead bulbs, deepening the pictorial space in his photograph as Manet did in his painting -- well, so much the better. But your enjoyment of the picture doesn't depend on it. 
 Over the course of Wall's career, which numbers only about 130 pictures, he has restlessly resisted repeating himself. Very soon he moved out of the studio, where he often spent months on a picture, to photograph landscapes and street scenes. ''I tried to open several paths at once, knowing there were several you could follow,'' he says. For landscapes, his main challenge was locating places he thought were worth photographing. The pictorial tradition of Vancouver rests on sublime scenery, either celebrating its majesty or deploring its destruction. Artists of Wall's generation shied away from that. ''We're all interested in the fissures and cracks in the city, not in the romantic, beautiful notion of the city,'' says Christos Dikeakos, a photographer. ''Sometimes, we like to think of ourselves as National Geographic photographers who have gone off assignment.'' Although residents of Vancouver who see Wall's photographs will recognize their city, with its distinctive overhead electric wires and encircling mountains, Wall asserts that the sites he seeks are the generic nondescript ones. ''This is a drab strip, I love it,'' he said one gray morning as we drove down a commercial thoroughfare, coming back from the day-laborers shoot in an eastern suburb. ''It has a lot of potential.'' 
 Having chosen not to live in an art capital like New York or London, Wall professes that he could just as easily have lived anywhere, with little effect on his work. ''One thing I hate with small cities is the myth of their specialness,'' he says. ''It's like in Europe, everywhere has its own ham, its own wine, its own cheese, and they're all nice, but it doesn't interest me.'' He is after ''the indeterminate American look,'' which he says he can find by not looking for anything in particular. ''You have to forget about the idea of the spirit of the place,'' he says. ''It's one of the big, consoling myths of people who live nowhere.'' Starting in 1980 with ''Steves Farm, Steveston,'' in which he photographed a subdivision marching onto agricultural land, Wall has, in his landscapes, zeroed in on an equipoise between the natural and the man-made. In a Wall picture, the industrial structures that inhabit a harbor or the lofty pine that has survived suburban sprawl is no more or less ''natural'' than the other aspects of the scene. 
 While no impediment to shooting landscape pictures, the laborious setup of a large-format camera on a tripod loomed as a critical constraint in the genre of street photography, which is traditionally done by a quick-moving lensman toting a lightweight 35-millimeter Leica. Beginning in 1982, through the re-creations that he calls ''cinematographic photography,'' Wall circumvented the problem. Typically, he would see something, often a small event with compressed human drama and political overtones: two working-class women absorbed in a heated conversation; a man making a racist gesture to an Asian passer-by; a dejected Vietnamese man standing beneath a tree. Rather than snap it, he would go home, think about this glimpse of everyday life or popular culture and then, if he wanted to proceed, hire performers to re-enact the scene. He argues that the sharpness of his resulting image comes close to what the ever-adjusting and -compensating eye perceives, a precision that usually eludes the documentary photographer. We have grown so accustomed to the grainy, blurry pictures of Robert Frank, Weegee, Cartier-Bresson and other great documentary photographers that we extol the deficits -- the lack of clarity and detail, the patches that are too bright or too dark -- as the hallmarks of authenticity. ''You'd have some loss, and that would be interpreted as life escaping film,'' Wall told me. His pictures display a different loss. ''You have to accept the fact that it is not a snapshot and can't have those qualities,'' he said. ''It is a semblance of life occurring on the fly, but it is a semblance. A semblance has its own value.'' He pointed out that in the visual arts only photographers and cinematographers are criticized for staging rather than directly recording scenes, since the other arts can never offer anything other than re-creations of the outside world.
 Rather than employ professional actors, Wall usually prefers to hire people like those they are portraying. It's a device he lifted from cinema. ''One of the things I liked about Italian neo-realism was just using people as they were, in situations similar to their real situations,'' he says. ''If you're interested in the actual, it's the closest to the actual.'' In later years he has tried to elide the distinction to the vanishing point, engaging actual art restorers in ''Restoration,'' field anthropologists in ''Fieldwork'' and day laborers in ''Men waiting,'' the picture I watched him shoot. The performers are playing themselves. However, they are also clay in the hands of the artist. The risk in these ''cinematographic'' pictures is that Wall will overmanipulate them, until the figures stultify into lifeless puppets. Technological progress exacerbates the danger by giving him greater powers of control. 
 At the beginning of the 1990s, enlisting the aid of new advances in digital technology, Wall went on holiday from the actual to explore the realm of fantasy and allegory with elaborate montages. ''I thought the computer was an escape route into the unreal,'' he says. To deflate the grandiosity of these photographs, which he constructed as elaborately as the grandes machines of French Salon 19th-century history painters, Wall injected a sharp black humor. In his studio he staged a vampires' lawn picnic and, even more extravagantly, a conversation among resurrected Soviet soldiers slain in Afghanistan. He imported Hollywood special-effects consultants as part of his team. ''I used up a lot of blood,'' he says. He quickly grew tired of these outlandish subjects, but computer technology remains part of his artistic arsenal. By converting his film exposures into digital files, Wall can then superimpose them invisibly and endlessly, often assembling a final image on film from many different shots. The technology freed him from the tyranny of the shutter click and allowed him to build a photograph in the way in which a painter makes daily additions and adjustments to a canvas. For an elaborate work like ''A Sudden Gust of Wind (After Hokusai),'' depicting a group of men who react as a wind blows away papers and leaves, he used more than a hundred shots in the painstaking composition of the final 12-foot-long picture. ''The historical irony,'' says the critic Michael Fried, ''is that at the very heart of what these guys are doing when they use advanced computer technology to assemble a photograph pixel by pixel is this point-by-point labor that predates Renaissance brushwork and goes back to the earliest panel painters, where you put the paint on dot by dot.'' Wall has reconsidered two earlier pictures that he made before the availability of advanced digital technology and, with the agreement of their owners, revised them with material from alternate takes. ''The problem in the old days when you were working with one piece of film is, it's like triage,'' he explained to me. ''You had to take the least bad.'' 
 With computer montage, Wall can also surmount some of the stumbling blocks that bedevil photographers who want, as he does, to reproduce the way the eye sees. It is virtually impossible to photograph a room with daylight streaming in the windows unless you either underexpose what's inside or white out the exterior view. In ''Morning Cleaning, Mies van der Rohe Foundation, Barcelona'' (1999), he was able, through seamless montage, to depict the detail of the shadowed pavilion interior and what lies outside the glass wall that a janitor is washing. He could similarly accommodate the wild variety of incandescence in ''After 'Invisible Man' by Ralph Ellison, the Prologue,'' an over-the-top re-creation of the light-festooned basement dwelling of the protagonist of Ellison's novel. The use of photomontages is invisible without being truly hidden. 
 In an implicit acknowledgment that the walls of the photo ghetto had fallen, around 1990, in a series of still lifes, Wall began directly engaging with photographers as he had done with painters. ''He felt he had to go away from photography to build this whole castle, using cinematography, using the painting tradition of Delacroix, Manet, Velazquez,'' says Peter Galassi. ''Now into that castle he has found a way to introduce all the photographic material he excluded originally.'' Although Wall is still obsessed by the longevity of his work, he no longer restricts himself to light boxes. He began making large, beautifully gradated black-and-white photographs on paper in the mid-'90s (''Men waiting'' is in black and white) and ink-jet color prints more recently still. Over the last decade, he has acquired four small buildings in a convenient if drug-infested downtown district. There, with the help of two full-time assistants and others as needed, he can develop and print all of his work.
 ''Men Waiting,'' with its cast of 20, its two-week shoot and its on-the-street location, is a small-scale Wall production. Not long before, the artist devoted a full year to ''In front of a nightclub'' -- a picture of young people standing outside a Vancouver club at night. The shoot took so long because the club Wall found, on a heavily trafficked thoroughfare, could not be photographed as he wished. There was no place for him to stand with his tripod and large-format camera. So he had the club exterior -- the columns and grille-work of the facade, the gum-spotted sidewalk, the concrete curb -- reconstructed in a studio. One assistant worked for six months dressing the set. ''Of course, you can't see everything he did, but that doesn't matter,'' Wall says. ''There is dirt and moss growing in the cracks where the bottom of the building is crumbling, but you can't see it. The discoloration of the sidewalk is extremely accurate, and it took many layers of application. My son and his friends came and chewed gum. That was their job for two weeks.'' He placed his strobes in the precise locations occupied by the street lamps and other lights that shine opposite the real nightclub. Concealed in a van with blacked-out windows, he and his assistants parked outside the actual club on several nights and, using a telephoto lens, took 300 or 400 snapshots of the kids gathered there. Wall scrutinized the photos for characters and clusterings he liked, then he hired 40 extras from a casting agency. Dividing them into two groups and giving them general directions, he photographed them over the course of a month on alternate nights. (''People's metabolism is different at night, their coloring is different,'' he explains.) For each group he finished with only one frame that satisfied him. ''You only need one,'' he points out. Using digital technology, he combined the two photos of the crowd with a third one of the building into his final picture. 
 Wall enjoys going to extraordinary lengths. ''The artistry of doing something is just fascinating,'' he told me. ''If you don't like the artistry, why be an artist? It's fun.'' For another picture, ''The Flooded Grave,'' he kept an oversize custom-built aquarium in his studio for more than six months. The concept of the photograph was to depict a watery world within a freshly dug grave. In his quest for verisimilitude even in this hallucinatory picture, Wall retained two marine biologists who fished out sea anemones, sea urchins and octopuses from a single offshore spot. ''I wanted to make it just like a moment in time undersea, not a compendium or display,'' he explains. ''I wanted to make it as real as I could.'' 
 While in his early pictures Wall openly displayed his contrivances, now he would rather not discuss them. ''It doesn't make any difference,'' he says of the nightclub picture reconstruction. ''Because what you are seeing here is an exact replica of the place. People get all hung up on the process, and they don't see the picture.'' Some critics who supported Wall at the beginning of his career say that he himself has gotten hung up on his process -- seduced by the elaborateness of his techniques and the gorgeousness of his images into abandoning the effort to make viewers think hard in a Modernist way about the gaps and distortions inherent in perception. Benjamin H. D. Buchloh, a leading art historian and critic who was an important friend and backer of Wall 25 years ago, says that ''Jeff's shift into narrative representation and Pop versions of subject matter in the light boxes was a strategy to make conceptual art more communicative. It became eventually so grand and so glamorous, it aimed so much at redeeming pictorial traditions, that the original intention was lost.'' In place of the former critical approach, Buchloh and like-minded commentators argue, Wall is trying to do as a 21st-century photographer what 19th-century painters like Manet and Seurat did in their elaborate depictions of contemporary life -- an historically absurd undertaking. ''His claim to be a new history painter is very problematic for me,'' Buchloh says. ''The pictures have become very overwhelmingly spectacular objects. There is a kind of Wagnerian Gesamtkunstwerk quality. You have the set and the narrative; all we are waiting for is the sound.'' 
 Wall himself asserts that without conceptual art's exploration of documentation, performance and manipulated language, his career is inconceivable. Indeed, he argues that the sustained attempts by conceptual artists to expose and undermine the pictorial claims of photography ultimately opened the way for a resurgence of depictive art. ''How could the iconophobia of the mid-'60s not have on the flip side of the medal someone like me?'' he says. ''If that phase hadn't happened, I would be trying to be like Seurat or Manet or Cezanne, and that would be a big failure, because you can't be someone not of your time.'' Significantly, being of his time to Wall no longer entails an obligatory nod to critical art theory in his pictures, nor the need to write theoretical essays as he once very successfully did. ''My love of depiction is just affectionate,'' he told me. ''I'm a more affectionate person than I thought I was. I like trees or I like people's faces. That's one reason I think my work has changed. I realized I wasn't interested in filtering my affection for things through certain levels of mediation.'' Yet the Modernist demotion of subject matter's importance resonates for him more strongly than ever. ''Believing in the specialness of what you are photographing is a disaster,'' he said. ''Then you think the photograph will be good because of what is in it. Cezanne taught me that that is not true. An apple is not very interesting. He expunged any attachment to the subject matter, except what he brought to it. In the painting he would bring it back to life. Only by believing that his painting it is what would enliven it could he make it happen.'' Over the last 15 years, Cezanne has replaced Manet as Wall's cynosure. 
 Wall is most comfortable discussing his pictures in terms of their formal composition and their broad underlying themes. ''He likes being sober,'' says his friend the photographer Roy Arden. ''He enjoys having a clear mind.'' When I asked what interested him in the subject of day laborers, Wall told me that he was fascinated by ''the physical animal energy that is present on the street and waiting to be disposed of.'' Yet he also, with minimal prodding, acknowledged that the subject matter of his more politically charged early pictures is linked thematically with the recent work. The germinating idea for the nightclub picture, for example, is the solitary figure of a rose seller who can be seen unobtrusively working his way through the line of young clubbers. The rose seller is a quintessential Wall character, as is the small boy who watches at the edge of the room in ''A ventriloquist at a birthday party in October 1947'' and the down-on-his-luck Native American standing near a dumped shipment of spoiled lettuce in ''Bad Goods.'' For that matter, ''Men waiting'' could easily have been called ''Band of Outsiders.'' ''I think Jeff identifies with these figures,'' says Wall's friend Ian Wallace. ''They become an allegory for his own sense of difference. He's created those figures to mirror his own alienation or sense of exclusion.'' When I asked Wall how he related to these marginal types, he first explained how single figures break up a formally boring clump, but then readily conceded: ''My pictures are obviously related to my own life. Why would I be interested in them otherwise? I'm not a sociologist. I must identify with these figures, even though I often don't like them, I don't even feel that sympathetic to them sometimes. But I must identify with them in some way because they keep coming into pictures that I want to make.'' One of his less successful pictures, ''The Goat,'' depicts four boys tormenting a fifth; it was shot in a lane near Wall's childhood home. ''I don't see that as autobiographical, although I was probably an outsider kid in some way,'' he said. ''But I wasn't the loner kid in school. I never got ostracized from anything. In 'The Goat,' I would more likely be part of the gang than the other guy, although I wouldn't be proud of it and I would probably identify with the other guy.'' 
 A more startling piece of autobiographical material lies buried (or out in plain sight) in ''The Destroyed Room,'' the breakthrough light box that depicts a woman's brutalized bedroom. Wall made the picture in 1978, which was the year his wife, Jeannette, left him for another man. (After that relationship ended, Jeannette returned to Jeff, bringing with her a third son, whom they have raised together.) To construct the scene in the picture, Jeff used Jeannette's clothing. ''I borrowed her clothes because we were still on good terms and she had the good clothes,'' he told me. For all the talk of allusions to Delacroix and feminist art criticism, I wondered if the most crucial piece of subtext for ''The Destroyed Room'' might revolve around a spurned husband's rage. ''You're probably right, but it doesn't feel right to me,'' he said. ''I don't remember feeling particularly angry at that time.'' He acknowledged that he ''might express a feeling through a series of mediations.'' But the subject didn't intrigue him. ''I don't find my own experiences very interesting,'' he said. ''I find my observations interesting. Maybe that's why I'm a photographer. Maybe an observation is an experience that means more to you than other experiences.'' 
 Wall has been accused of being a control freak who smothers the life out of his pictures. He certainly is a man who likes to plan for all contingencies and command a situation. Yet he has chosen an art form that is characterized by uncontrollability; even with digital editing, accidents will occur. Sometimes they are happy accidents. In the course of shooting ''Men waiting,'' for which he had prepared in his usual meticulous way, he changed the frame of the picture. One of the reasons he liked the location he had selected (to double for the less formally complex if admittedly authentic ''cash corner'') was a scraggly little tree that had shed its leaves for winter. Further down the street was another tree, a giant fir. After taking five days to find his camera position, he concluded that he couldn't eliminate the unasked-for fir from the picture, but by including only part of the trunk, he would minimize it. On one of the first days of the shoot, the rain increased, and several of the men huddled beneath the evergreen for shelter. When that happened, Wall realized that the fir had a role to play in the picture after all. He changed the camera setup to encompass the entire trunk, allowing the crowd of men to continue to the edge of the picture and, by implication, beyond. ''That tree bothered me all along,'' he told me. ''If it hadn't rained hard, I might never have noticed it. Now I'll just include it. It's stronger for it.'' Throughout the shoot, he would perceive undirected movements -- an umbrella stuck in the mud, a hooded head lowered -- and choose to keep them. Speaking softly on a walkie-talkie, he would ask his three assistants to adjust the position and behavior of the waiting men. The final picture was structured by his intelligence and artistic sense, but it was animated by the unpredictability of his living subjects. ''You can't make these things up,'' he said. 
 I asked Wall about ''Polishing,'' a photograph of a young man shining his shoes before he goes off to work. The picture had required many experiments to arrive at the correct angle and position of the camera and subject so that the hand applying the rag to the shoe looked the way Wall envisioned it. ''If you want to get a photo like Garry Winogrand, you go to a shoeshine stand and you fire away, and either you get it or you don't,'' he said. ''It's the same problem, but I get to do it over and over again until I get it right. The level at which the rendering must be done is ratcheted up. If you're in the street and you get it right, great. If you get it almost right, that might be O.K., too.'' No sooner had he said that, however, than he retracted it. ''No, I don't think that's true. If the hand is wrong in a Winogrand, he would probably reject it.'' He mused for a moment about all the pictures that the great street photographers must have missed to their frustration. Then, comparing documentary photographers of the past with the digitized, artifice-friendly practitioners of today, he said something he would never have said when he started out 30 years ago: ''The more you think about it, there are fewer differences than you might think. It's all photography.'' Thanks in part to Wall's pioneering pictures, ''artists using photography'' no longer feel a need to distance themselves from others in their medium. They have emerged from their clumsily confining, defensive chrysalis.

HEADLINE: When the Parking Space Becomes the Destination

BYLINE: By PHIL PATTON

 BODY:
IT was just a patch of black asphalt, but for the weary Manhattan motorist orbiting the narrow streets of Chinatown, it glimmered like an oasis in the Sahara. 
 For years, Michael Schneeweiss of MGS Parking Management presided over that patch, dispatching attendants to greet parkers so happy to find a spot that they almost forgot to grumble about the rates.
But now the lot is gone. Reversing Joni Mitchell's lyrics, the developers pulled up a parking lot and put in a paradise -- a luxury condo development at 123 Baxter Street whose amenities include Internet-capable refrigerators. The 100 parking spaces that Mr. Schneeweiss managed have been replaced, below the 24 condos, by 74 spots in New York City's first automated parking garage. Two dozen spaces will be reserved for apartment owners. Starting Thursday, the rest will be open to the public -- first for monthly lessees and, come spring, for drive-ins.
 The project is the work of AutoMotion Parking Systems, the American subsidiary of Stolzer Parkhaus of Strassburg, Germany. Stolzer Parkhaus has built 28 automated garages in 11 countries since its first, in Kronach, Germany, in 1996. The software and hardware that moves the cars around in the garages were adapted from systems that store materials and goods in warehouses. 
 ''This is the future,'' Mr. Schneeweiss said during a recent tour of the Chinatown garage, shaking his head as if he did not quite believe it yet. 
 But the future is coming on fast in cities like New York, where shiny towers are rising over what had long been parking lots. ''There is a proliferation of high-rise condo construction in major urban areas,'' said Donald R. Monahan, vice president of Walker Parking Consultants in Greenwood Village, Colo., who follows innovations in the business closely. ''Usually these have small footprints that do not offer enough room for traditional garages. They offer a good opportunity for the new technology.''
 Not only are developers looking at automated garages, city planners and architects are discussing new ideas to manage automobiles, even when they are stationary. Urban theorists and policy makers are increasingly looking at the effects of parking on traffic, development, pollution and energy efficiency. Smart parking could save energy. 
 Mr. Schneeweiss, a parking industry veteran who wears a jaunty racing cap, and Ari Milstein, director for planning at AutoMotion, recently showed off the Baxter Street garage. 
 The driver pulls off the street and into a room roughly the size of a one-car garage attached to a house. The car rests on a large pallet, a traylike area with shallow troughs for the wheels.
 ''Lasers check that the car is aligned,'' Mr. Milstein said, and determines that it is not one of the trucks or S.U.V.'s too big for the garage. The driver locks the car, takes the keys and picks up an electronic card from a nearby machine. A large door closes behind the car; motion detectors ensure that no children or pets are left behind.
 Then the pallet holding the car slides below ground level, into two subterranean floors of storage.
 ''It's simple -- park, swipe and leave,'' Mr. Milstein said.
 The returning driver pays -- using a credit card at a machine, or handing cash to the human ''parking concierge'' in a booth. The machinery retrieves the pallet holding the car, which rises to ground level, pointing toward the exit. You unlock the doors and drive away. 
 ''You get your car in under three minutes,'' Mr. Milstein promises. ''It's as easy as an A.T.M. or E-ZPass.'' Rates will be comparable to conventional parking in Manhattan, he said, about $400 a month.
 For the driver, the advantages of an automated system go beyond convenience and speed. The car remains untouched and unopened, and with the parking area ostensibly off limits to people, valuables are safe inside. Assuming the mechanized parts are functioning properly, the car avoids potential scrapes and bumps. Seats and mirrors remain just as you left them; the radio will still be tuned to, say, Lite FM. There is no tipping.
 ''You can even go shopping,'' Mr. Milstein said, ''bring things back to your car, lock them in the trunk and go on shopping.'' 
 For the developer, automated garages offer cost advantages in construction and operation. By omitting ramps and walkways, about twice as many cars can be tucked into the same space. Labor and insurance costs are lower, and getting cars in and out is faster.
 Michael Stolzer, dispatched from Stolzer Parkhaus in Germany to help set up the new garage, showed off the computerized control area and the storage floors. The cars on their pallets can be stacked more tightly than those in a traditional garage; clearance in the storage cubicles is only roof-high, not human-head high. 
 The design recalls the way bakeries stack goods on racks: car cakes on trays. 
 AutoMotion has built only one previous project in the United States, a 74-space automated garage at the Summit Grand Parc, a luxury residential building in Washington, not far from the White House. But the company has three more projects under way in the New York area, Mr. Milstein said. 
 Automated garages are much more common in Europe and Asia, said John Van Horn, editor and publisher of Parking Today, a magazine, Web site and blog based in Los Angeles. ''There are thousands of them in Europe,'' he said. ''There is one on practically every corner in Japan. In the U.S., it has mostly been a matter of European technology licensed to people who don't understand the parking industry.''
 But the Baxter Street project is different, said Mr. Van Horn, who visited the site this month. ''With the technology and the footprint there, it should be viable,'' he said. There are economic incentives: a traditional garage on the site could have held only 24 cars, too few to be feasible. And, he noted, AutoMotion is affiliated with one of the building's developers, the American Development Group.
 An earlier and much publicized automated project in Hoboken helped to raise doubts about such operations. Opened in 2002, the Garden Street garage was designed by Robotic Parking Systems of Clearwater, Fla. In 2004, a Cadillac dropped several floors in the garage and a Jeep suffered a similar fate a year later. Jeff Faria, a spokesman for Robotic Parking, said the problems resulted from factors other than the garage's equipment. 
 Mr. Van Horn said publicity about the Hoboken garage made developers wary of such projects.
 Parking is a $26 billion industry, according to the International Parking Institute in Fredericksburg, Va. The institute says there are about 40,000 parking garages and other facilities with 105 million spaces.
 In ''Park It! NYC 2007 '' (Park It! Guides) Margot J. Tohn says there are 1,110 off-street parking garages and lots in Manhattan, with 104,000 spaces. 
 That, most motorists would say, is not enough. According to surveys done by the National Parking Association, a trade organization based in Washington, the average cost of building a parking spot averages about $14,000 nationally and about $18,000 in the New York area. 
 Donald C. Shoup, an urban planning professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, is an advocate of reform of zoning and building code requirements for off-street parking. In his book, ''The High Cost of Free Parking'' (American Planning Association), he contends that local regulations have distorted the shape of cities by subsidizing the automobile and penalizing people without cars, who tend to be less affluent. He has been embraced by the new urbanists and those who advocate ''congestion pricing'' tolls on city streets and highways.
 Information technology could make parking easier and more efficient. At many airports and on the edges of some European cities, overhead digital signs display information about available spaces in parking decks. Various plans have been offered for finding and reserving parking spots by mobile phone or the Internet. 
 Professor Shoup argues for market-based parking, with rates that vary by the time of day or the season. Some planners advocate a high-tech, socially networked system of pricing -- a spot market for parking spots. One start-up company exploring a system to reserve and rent spots is SpotScout (spotscout.com).
 Proponents of automated parking like to compare their garages with vending machines. Long frustrated by the homeliness of traditional decks -- dim places suitable for mob executions or reporters' meetings with Deep Throats -- architects have taken inspiration from the vending machine to reimagine future garages. 
 In Europe, Smart dealerships display stacks of the lovable little cars in glass structures, as attractive as snacks. At Volkswagen's Autostadt customer center in Wolfsburg, Germany, where many buyers pick up their new cars, two silolike glass towers hold cars fresh from the factory. These are robotically retrieved by a central elevator and delivered to the customers waiting below, adding drama to the handover of the keys. 
 Inspired by Pez candy dispensers, Keith Moskow, of Moskow Architects in Boston, has sketched a concept for a see-through automated garage for car-sharing services like Zipcar. A German company, CarLoft (carloft.de), is building an apartment tower in Berlin that lets residents park their cars on their balconies. A New York architect, Annabelle Selldorf, has offered a similar vision for a Manhattan building with elevators that would let tenants drive their cars into garages next to their high-rise apartments.
 The Smart Cities project of the Media Lab of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has suggested a variety of possible visions of future parking. Smart parking places could signal their availability electronically to passing motorists. Ryan Chin, Mitchell Joachim and other researchers at the Media Lab propose to redesign vehicles to make them easier to park -- the spatial demands of parking could be reduced by six to eight times, they argue, with small cars that nest together like grocery carts.

HEADLINE: Blue-Collar Work Ethic, White-Glove Manners

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER JENSEN

DATELINE: BETHLEHEM, N.H. 

 BODY:
WORK -- that is the role of a pickup truck in a rural area. Pickups haul stuff. They plow snow. They are tools, not macho-mechanical ego-support systems.
 On the other hand, there aren't too many people whose goal is to be uncomfortable while doing any kind of work, including driving a full-size pickup.
''We worked very diligently in terms of refinement,'' said Jully Burau, the assistant chief engineer for General Motors' full-size pickups, including the 2007 Chevrolet Silverado and the similar GMC Sierra.
 It is irksome that diligence doesn't always guarantee success. But it did with the Silverado and Sierra, all-new trucks that combine a traditional work ethic with a surprising amount of finesse. 
 That's a good thing for General Motors, since Toyota has just come out with its own all-new (and bigger than ever) full-size truck, the 2007 Tundra. [Page 4.] 
 G.M. cannot afford to have the Silverado fail. Last year, it sold 636,000 of the trucks, making the Silverado the second-best-selling vehicle in the United States. First was the Ford F-Series pickups. (G.M.C. sold another 210,000 Sierras.)
 Pickups are also money machines. An automaker easily makes $4,000 to $5,000 in net profit on a full-size pickup, said David E. Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research, a consulting and research firm in Ann Arbor, Mich.
 As with most full-size pickups, there are so many variants of the Silverado/Sierra that the indecisive may never be able to settle on one. The offerings start with a regular cab, which comes with only a front seat that carries two adults comfortably. The extended cab offers a back seat, but one so small that adult legs may not be extended. 
 Finally, there is the crew cab with a truly usable back seat where two adults may ride with dignity.
 The cargo beds are available in lengths of 5-foot-8 (short bed), 6-foot-6 (standard bed) and 8 feet (long bed). 
 There are five suspensions ranging from ''smooth ride'' and ''off road'' to one designed for maximum towing prowess. 
 There is a choice of four engines: a 195-horsepower 4.3-liter V-6, a 295-horsepower 4.8-liter V-8, a 315-horsepower 5.3-liter V-8 and a 367-horsepower 6-liter V-8.
 Base prices for these light-duty Silverados start at $18,760 and run to $38,990 including the destination charge. Options can push the price above $45,000.
 My test model was an extended-cab LT2 with four-wheel drive and the standard bed. It had a 5.3-liter V-8 and a starting price of $31,690. The options, totaling $3,029, included leather upholstery and the Z71 off-road suspension package, bringing the price to $35,619. Beneath an updated and smoothed-out look is a new, stronger frame and redesigned suspension -- the changes included replacing the old torsion-bar front suspension with a new coil-over shock design.
 Befitting the work-truck role, the rear suspension is still a solid-axle design, but it is well behaved and not inclined to skitter even while cornering on a rumpled surface.
 The advantage of the more robust body and frame became clear on Route 16 along the lovely Androscoggin River. Hit a rough surface and the Silverado feels solid, unlike a 2007 Ford F-150 driven about the same time that easily got the shakes.
 Unfortunately that feeling of solidity carries over to the Z71 suspension. Its stiff ride is mildly unpleasant on a bad road and jiggly at other times.
 The steering is vastly improved, giving the driver a far better sense of what the vehicle is doing. Consequently, the Silverado felt remarkably responsive for a 5,300-pound vehicle as it followed Route 26, climbing and turning to slip through the crack in the mountains called the Dixville Notch. In comparison, the F-150 felt ill at ease and a bit clumsy.
 The feel of the brake pedal is quite good; antilock brakes are standard on all models.
 Should the Silverado start to slide, help is available from electronic stability control, which G.M. calls StabiliTrak. Unfortunately that life-saving help is available only to those with extra cash.
 While StabiliTrak is standard on the crew cab, it is a $425 option on the extended cab -- and only if you buy the more expensive LT rather than the base model, the WT (for ''Work Truck''). Getting an LT increases the price over the entry-level model by almost $3,000; the fancy LTZ is another $5,500 or so. 
 Nor can you get StabiliTrak on Silverados with the regular cab. 
 One worry about any vehicle with a high center of gravity, like a pickup, is rolling over. In rollover-resistance tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the tested Silverado (which had StabiliTrak) did well, earning four out of five stars.
 Powertrain snobs may sneer at G.M.'s quaint four-speed automatic transmission, given that the new Tundra is available with either a five-speed or six-speed automatic. 
 But the four-speed and the 5.3 engine are splendid companions. There is neither a wait for acceleration nor a racket when power is delivered. Downshifts come quickly and upshifts go smoothly, so there is no sense of second-class gearbox status. 
 The 5.3-liter engine has a cylinder-shutdown system that G.M. calls ''active fuel management.'' When all cylinders aren't needed, the engine switches from a V-8 to a V-4 to save gas. At a steady speed on a flat surface, four cylinders may suffice, but if you nudge the gas pedal the truck is running on all cylinders again. 
 On a 200-mile Interstate trip through the hills of Vermont I set the cruise at 65 miles an hour, watched an instrument on the dash tell me how many cylinders were being used, and managed 18 m.p.g.
 The model I was driving was rated at 16 miles a gallon in town and 20 on the highway by the Environmental Protection Agency. That is a tiny bit better than the E.P.A. estimate for the 4.3-liter V-6 or the 4.8-liter V-8. 
 The test truck's engine also had a flexible fuel feature, which means it can use E85, a blend of 15 percent gasoline and 85 percent ethanol. But E85 is hard to find outside the Midwest and using it with an engine that can also burn gasoline means a huge drop in fuel economy. Burning E85 drops the city rating to 12 m.p.g., from 16 m.p.g., the E.P.A. says, and the highway rating to 15, from 20. 
 Working on the assumption that gas costs $2.24 a gallon and E85 is $2.11, the E.P.A. figures that over 15,000 miles the reduced fuel economy would cost you $434 more than burning 100 percent gasoline. 
 Work trucks have to be able to work, obviously, and G.M. says that almost every Silverado variant can now carry a bigger payload. A payload is the combined weight of people and cargo. The increase is typically 100 to 200 pounds depending on the model, the automaker says.
 The model I tested had a payload capacity of 1,735 pounds, an increase of about 350 pounds. Its cargo bed can carry 60.7 cubic feet of whatever, an increase of almost 4 cubic feet.
 With the 6-liter V-8, the maximum towing capacity has increased to 10,500 pounds from 10,200.
 The interior has received a serious upgrade along with everything else. It includes comfy front seats and enough soundproofing to make the cabin wonderfully hushed even at highway speeds. There are plenty of trays and bins for orderly motoring. 
 The only complaint about the controls is that the heating and air-conditioning switches are so low and small that they can be hard for squinting baby boomers to read. This suggests a new profit center: a dealer-installed magnifying glass with suction cups that could be fixed to the dash or the driver's forehead.
 One safety disappointment is that inflatable air curtains, which cover the side windows andare designed to provide head protection in a side-impact crash, are not available on the base (''Work Truck'') models. Buyers must make a big leap to at least an LT, at which point the safety device is a $395 option.
 Safety researchers say such protection can significantly reduce the chance of serious head injuries. It is unfortunate G.M. has restricted its availability.
 The Silverado has yet to be crashed in side-impact tests, but it got a top score -- five stars -- in front tests by the safety agency.
 G.M.'s cars have taken a lot of criticism over the years, but with the new Silverado and Sierra the company has proved that it still has the expertise to build a first-rate full-size pickup. The only disappointment is that lifesaving equipment is not available to budget-minded buyers.INSIDE TRACK: Whistle while you work.A Big Fist and Some Trash Talk 
 WITH the arrival of the 2007 Tundra this month, Toyota has made its most serious move yet into the full-size pickup market, which it calls ''the single largest opportunity for Toyota's future growth'' in the United States.
 The truck's maximum-macho styling also makes it clear that Toyota is not pulling its visual punches with the bigger-than-ever model. One subtle hint that Toyota is taking off the gloves: it describes the design theme as ''the power of the fist.'' 
 Toyota introduced its first large pickup, the T-100, in 1993 when American-Japanese trade tensions were high. Small by American full-size-truck standards, the T-100 wasn't a serious competitor. 
 Toyota regrouped in 1999 with its first Tundra, then in 2003 added the hefty Double Cab, which posed a more direct challenge to Chevy, Dodge and Ford.
 The latest Tundra gets right in the face of Detroit's big trucks in size and abilities. It comes in three cab styles and three bed lengths.
 The transmissions are five- and six-speed automatics. Engine choices are a 236-horsepower 4-liter V-6; a 271-horsepower 4.7-liter V-8; and a 5.7-liter V-8 rated at 381 horsepower and 401 pound-feet of torque. 
 But unlike the new Chevrolet Silverado's 5.3-liter V-8, the Toyota engines cannot shut down four cylinders to save fuel. That gives the Silverados better fuel economy, according to government estimates. 
 Tundras start at $22,935 for a regular cab with two-wheel drive. The most expensive Tundra has a base price of $42,495. One big advantage over the Silverado: electronic stability control and inflatable side air curtains are standard on all models.
 Toyota is in a position to more than double Tundra sales. A new San Antonio plant can build 200,000 a year, and an Indiana factory is expected to produce about 100,000.
 A decade ago nobody imagined Toyota would have the nerve to build a full-size truck in Texas, the star-spangled heartland of American pickups. But who would have guessed that a Camry would compete in Nascar's Nextel Cup? CHRISTOPHER JENSEN

HEADLINE: A New Orleans Neighborhood Rebuilds

BYLINE: By KRISTINA SHEVORY

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
FOUR months or so after Hurricane Katrina, and just as residents of the Broadmoor neighborhood had begun moving back into their water-logged homes, a rebuilding commission set up by the mayor delivered another shock. 
 If Broadmoor did not bring back half its residents within four months, their homes could be razed and the land turned into parks. So Broadmoor took action.
Three days after the commission released its plan, residents of Broadmoor, which is west of downtown, held a protest rally. A meeting was called to work out a plan, and more than 600 people attended, many of them driving from Baton Rouge and Houston. For them, their neighborhood's future could not be left to someone else. This was where they had grown up, married and had children. 
 ''We love our neighborhood, and we had to do something,'' said LaToya Cantrell, the president of the Broadmoor Improvement Association. 
 Ms. Cantrell estimates that two-thirds of the 2,900 homes in the economically diverse neighborhood have been repainted and restored. The hope is that by year's end, 80 percent of the houses will be rebuilt. 
 Although only 55 percent of its former residents have returned, new residents are moving into Broadmoor, the group says, many attracted by the neighborhood's spirit and low home prices. (Before the August 2005 hurricane, the average home price for Broadmoor and the surrounding area was $255,750, compared with $167,500 last year, according to Real Property Associates in Metairie, La.)
 While New Orleans haggles over a master redevelopment plan, people in some neighborhoods like Broadmoor have been rebuilding on their own. They are forming partnerships with companies, universities and nonprofit organizations to help gut homes, assemble volunteers and find pumping equipment. 
 ''I think what has happened is the government has pursued a very laissez-faire approach,'' said Thomas Murphy, a senior fellow with the Urban Land Institute in Washington. ''There's been no strong redevelopment authority to date; that agency doesn't exist.'' 
 Rebuilding has not been easy. For those who choose to stay, sky-high insurance premiums and rising crime rates await them. Insurance payouts have been slow, and a state rebuilding program has paid only a small fraction of applicants. In a city that often did not run smoothly before Katrina, some residents are growing frustrated and leaving. But others, like those in Broadmoor, refuse to go. 
 The flood waters and the hurricane damaged 71.5 percent of the city's homes, according to the Greater New Orleans Community Data Center. Flood depths in the city ranged from 4 to 20 feet because much of the city sits below sea level. In Broadmoor, when the levees broke, 8 to 10 feet of water surged through homes after the local pumping station flooded. High winds and helicopter rescues also damaged roofs. Then looters took over. 
 ''Everything was dead,'' said Ernie Osteen, a Broadmoor resident who visited his home a week after the storm. ''I was in the military and the smell reminded me of dead bodies.'' 
 Before the storm, Broadmoor resembled much of New Orleans. More than two-thirds of its residents were African-American, and most residents were lower-middle-income. About half were homeowners.
 Designated a historic neighborhood, Broadmoor had much to lose in the storm. Many of the homes, which include Spanish colonials, bungalows, classical mansions and double-shotgun houses, were built by the early 1950s.
 Working out of a doublewide trailer at a local church, residents surveyed Broadmoor and designed a database on the area's 7,000 residents and selected block captains to monitor the area. Meetings were held on the best ways to revitalize the neighborhood, like deterring crime and reopening the local elementary school. 
 At the time, many people were juggling full-time jobs and community work while they renovated their homes. Ms. Cantrell lived in a downtown Marriott hotel for months until she finished gutting and renovating her house. Others lived on the second floor of their homes while they gutted the lower floors. 
 Even though their neighborhood group was strong, the residents knew they couldn't do it all themselves. They appealed to the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard for help in writing and carrying out a rebuilding plan. (Initially, Harvard students showed Broadmoor the template for a development plan and told them about the kind of data and statistics they would need to write one. Harvard later sent students from the schools of law, design and education to help put together a database, pass out fliers, call residents to see if they were returning and start a training program for block captains.)
 By late March 2006, Mayor C. Ray Nagin scrapped the rebuilding commission's recommendation and said that people could rebuild wherever they saw fit -- but that they would be doing so at their own risk. It didn't really matter to Broadmoor, though, because the residents had already seen it was possible to resurrect their neighborhood.
 ''The city did us a favor'' with the original commission decision on razing homes, said Kelli Wright, who heads the neighborhood's repopulation committee. 
 Broadmoor's residents kept pushing ahead, contacting former residents scattered across the country. Many were eager to return, but they wanted to ensure that they wouldn't be the only ones on their block. Others needed help in gutting homes, finding doctors and looking for temporary residences. So the group set up a database to track what people needed and to connect them with people who could help.
 ''They didn't know who to call or what to do,'' said Marilyn Crump, vice president of the Broadmoor Improvement Association. ''Information was crucial because it wasn't really available.'' 
 In July, Broadmoor released its blueprint and became the second neighborhood in the city with one; the other is Gentilly. They hoped that it would encourage more people to return and that it would bring in other donors. Within a few months, the neighborhood received $5 million in pledges from the Clinton Global Initiative -- an annual event in Manhattan started by the William J. Clinton Foundation that brings together corporate and individual philanthropists who pledge to help different causes. 
 Randy Poindexter, who was living in Lafitte, south of New Orleans, vowed to return to the city to help it recover and picked Broadmoor, she said, because of its ''tremendous will to survive.'' She bid on five houses and finally bought the sixth for $139,000 in June. She later spent $50,000 to renovate the flooded first floor.
 ''I felt like they had a fighting spirit,'' said Ms. Poindexter, 59, who is an artist. ''I wanted to be a part of it. It's the greatest sense of community that I've ever experienced.''
 There remains much left to accomplish. The elementary school and library are still closed, crime is a problem and the local pumping station needs a generator. Some families are living on their front lawns in trailers provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, while others are scrambling to paint their homes and landscape their yards. Salt infuses the lawns and the grass is dead. (Residents who have spent at least $100,000 renovating a house sometimes find it difficult to put more into landscaping.) 
 But despite the difficulties, Ms. Crump, the association's vice president, said, ''We always said we're coming back, and we're coming back better.'' 
 Although redeveloping their neighborhood can seem daunting, residents are focused on doing what they can. They are trying to turn the library into a community center, and they won approval this month to open a charter school next year. Crime is a top priority, and they have recently increased neighborhood patrols and started a housing assistance program to encourage police officers to move into the area.
 Their first returning police officer, Nancy Parker, who rented a house in Broadmoor before the storm, expects to move in within the next two weeks. Ms. Wright, who is also a real estate agent, helped Ms. Parker improve her credit, get her title fees waived and negotiate the selling price down $50,000, to $225,000, for her three-bedroom house. 
 ''I'm a first-time home buyer, and I didn't know the first thing about buying a home,'' Ms. Parker said. ''They pretty much held my hand through the process and sent us everything we needed. Kelli has worked miracles.''
 After living in a government trailer outside New Orleans for the past nine months with her husband, two children and a dog, Ms. Parker said she was thrilled she can finally come home. ''I really am happy,'' she said. ''They gave me a chance to go back home to an area where I'm comfortable, to neighbors I know.''

HEADLINE: Very Big Plans for Hempstead Village

BYLINE: By VALERIE COTSALAS

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD 

 BODY:
WITH an overcoat and wool cap to protect him from the frigid wind on an icy afternoon, Wayne J. Hall Sr. pointed out not only the blight on a stretch of north Main Street in the village of Hempstead, but also the features that he says would bring in buyers for future condominiums: the first station on the Long Island Rail Road's Hempstead line, and the adjacent Long Island Bus transit center.
 ''That's where everything begins and everything ends,'' said Mr. Hall, the village mayor. ''You go out from here and you come back to here. I really believe that that's what will make this project go.'' 
The project is a plan to build 2,500 condominiums priced at market rates in an area currently made up of empty lots, boarded-up buildings and homes, a few storefronts and a corner lingerie shop.
 The condominiums are part of a staggering $2 billion proposal to redevelop 26 acres in this 3.2-square-mile village of about 70,000, according to Mr. Hall.
 A Manhattan real estate investment firm called UrbanAmerica is proposing the plan, which also includes more than 600,000 square feet for retail shops and a 1,500-seat performing arts center. 
 Even if the complete redevelopment is approved after environmental reviews and studies of local infrastructure, it will probably be years before construction could begin. 
 But in a preliminary step, trustees voted earlier this month to allow UrbanAmerica to help the village settle a lawsuit with another developer, R. B. Hempstead. That suit arose from an agreement the developer had with the village under a previous mayor to condemn properties in the same area to make way for big-box stores, said Claude Gooding, the commissioner of the village's community development agency.
 Once the $10 million suit is settled, ''UrbanAmerica will assume the rights to develop north Main Street,'' Mr. Hall said.
 UrbanAmerica's development plan is ambitious for the village, whose residents the mayor characterized as largely African-American and Hispanic working families struggling with high taxes and aging infrastructure.
 If the plan were approved as it stands today, it would generate up to $40 million in annual tax revenue for the village, according to Edward Scott, a senior vice president of development for UrbanAmerica.
 Most of the condominium buyers would be expected to move in from other parts of Nassau County. None of the residential units will be priced below market rates, which would make them affordable to more local residents, the mayor said. 
 Mr. Scott said affordable units could come only with government subsidies that lower the cost of construction. ''We're a for-profit institution,'' Mr. Scott said, ''and we have to have returns for our investors.''
 The company wants to create a market in Hempstead for new condominiums where none currently exists, he said. ''We're taking a huge risk in our belief that the demand for real estate -- quality real estate built in a first-rate fashion in a very convenient location from a transportation standpoint -- would not discriminate and go other places,'' Mr. Scott said in a telephone interview.
 Those other in-demand places would include nearby wealthy communities like Garden City, a short distance up Main Street from Hempstead village's downtown area, but socioeconomically a world away.
 In Garden City, for example, a current listing for a two-bedroom, two-bath condominium in an 18-year-old building with a doorman and concierge is $960,000. By contrast, Mr. Hall said, new two-bedroom condominiums in Hempstead village would range in price from about $250,000 to $300,000 at current market rates.
 Young professionals who commute to Manhattan and empty nesters who can't afford to buy in Garden City, or other Nassau County communities, are the targets for the new development, Mr. Scott said. 
 The firm began looking at development opportunities in the area four years ago when the Nassau County Office of Minority Affairs was trying to bring in minority investors and contractors to compete for business in Nassau, he said. 
 Most of the owners of UrbanAmerica are African-American, Mr. Scott said, and the company is interested in investing in minority communities overlooked by developers. 
 Investors in the firm's two equity funds are mostly pension funds, insurance companies and lenders. But they also include Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive of American Express, who grew up in Hempstead, Mr. Scott said.
 UrbanAmerica is developing projects in more expensive markets, including a tower with a five-star hotel, retail shops and luxury condominiums on the waterfront in Baltimore, but it has not yet financed a project in a low-income area like Hempstead village. A proposal the company made for a similar project in Oakland, Calif., fell through when the market for condominiums in that area ''dried out,'' Mr. Scott said. 
 One issue the company may face is community opposition. The village will have to persuade landowners on the site that is designated for development to sell, or force them to sell using its powers of eminent domain. 
 Mr. Hall said most landowners are ''resigned to the fact that the revitalization is going to happen and they are probably ready to sell.''
 But few businesses in the area on a recent visit even knew of the village's latest plan.
 At Universal Servi Express, which provides long-distance phone calls for a fee, an employee knew nothing of the village's interest in redeveloping Main Street. A few doors down at Main Street Wireless, a cellphone services store, two employees had heard only about a now-defunct plan for big box stores in the area.
 Across the street at Los Amigos Deli and Grocery, the clerk said he didn't know anything about it. 
 It was the same story at nearby Giovanni Salon. But Giovanni Segovia thought new development might be a good idea. ''I think it's good for the village; sometimes it's a little dangerous at night around here,'' Mr. Segovia said, waving a hair dryer over his customer's head. ''But they would have to pay or relocate us.''
 New development might also bring a reduction in the taxes that he pays on a six-bedroom single-family house in the village, currently $15,000, he said. ''For this area,'' he added, ''that's too much tax.''

HEADLINE: The Sizzling Luxury Market

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL. 
E-mail: bigdeal@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE unseasonably warm January real estate market was particularly heated among the wealthiest, who, brokers say, lavished their hard-earned and inherited money on ever more expensive co-ops, condominiums and town houses. 
 ''It's not just the Wall Street bonuses -- there is just so much liquidity in the market,'' said Kirk Henckels, the director of Stribling Private Brokerage, who has just released a report on the luxury residential market.
Mr. Henckels's report looks back to 2006, but he and other market observers say that the high-end market has been setting a pace for the rest of the market in the new year and that the trends have continued into February.
 Although some analysts worry about high inventories of unsold apartments, especially new condos, Mr. Henckels says the high-end deals have produced some spot shortages, in prewar co-ops, for example. 
 The Stribling report points to 2006 as a record-setting year in co-ops, especially those costing more than $5 million -- the price range where if you have to ask, you probably can't afford it. For the first time, the total prices of Manhattan co-ops selling for $5 million or more passed the $1 billion benchmark, with buyers spending nearly $1.4 billion, up from the $980 million tallied in 2005. There were 11 co-op sales at more than $20 million last year, up from four in 2005, the report said. 
 And the steady stream of closings in January already filed with the New York City Department of Finance shows the luxury market has remained strong. Although some sales are not reported for many weeks or even months, the records show that 38 January sales of co-ops, condos and town houses for at least $5 million were reported as of mid-February, with a total value of $382 million. In January 2006, only 16 such sales, worth a total of $124 million, were reported by mid-February. 
 The sales so far this year include the $27 million purchase by Frederick R. Adler, an investor, of a three-bedroom condo at the Ritz-Carlton New York at 50 Central Park South, as well as the three separate apartments bought by Franck Ruimy, an investment fund manager, in the tower designed by Richard Meier at 165 Charles Street, for a total of $17.7 million.
 The list excludes the $18.5 million sale by Elizabeth Ross Johnson, an heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, at 1 Central Park West, the Trump International Hotel and Tower -- because it was resold the same day for $21.25 million, a transaction that was included. 
 Figures compiled by Gregory J. Heym, an economist at Brown Harris Stevens, show that the positive momentum continued into February. He found that in the first 20 days of February, the number of contracts signed for apartments that cost more than $2 million nearly doubled, to 153 contracts from 80 the year before. He put the total value of these contracts at more than $566 million, up from $307 million the year before, an 84 percent increase.
 Mr. Henckels said that there were still many large apartments available in new and newly converted buildings, but that the supply of older co-ops on the market had been all but depleted, at least until the spring, when many new listings typically appear on the market. ''The store is empty,'' he said. Related Deals At Related Companies 
 WHEN it comes to buying and selling real estate, executives at the Related Companies -- the builders of the Time Warner Center and scores of other projects across the country -- seem to like to keep their transactions in the family.
 In December, Stephen M. Ross, the chairman of Related and the new chairman of the Real Estate Board of New York, took title to the 8,900-square-foot, full-floor penthouse atop one of the swankiest addresses in New York: 25 Columbus Circle, the south tower of the Time Warner Center, according to city records.
 No price was listed on the transaction, apparently because Mr. Ross was both the buyer and a principal of the company that sold the condominiums.
 The next month, Mr. Ross sold his co-op at 965 Fifth Avenue for $10 million, but not to just any buyer, and without listing it for sale through the system set up by the real estate board, according to a real estate professional who searched for the listing. The buyer was Bruce A. Beal Jr., one of Mr. Ross's top lieutenants. Mr. Beal, an executive vice president at Related, oversees acquisitions and development for the company in New York and across the metropolitan area.
 Mr. Ross is not the only Related executive to buy into the company's projects. 
 In 2004, Robert Puddicombe, a company executive, bought an apartment on the 70th floor of the Park Imperial at 230 West 56th Street, then a new mixed office and condominium building built by Related. He paid $329,950 for what was listed as a 1,107-square-foot, one-bedroom penthouse, with terraces and one bath. According to the offering plan, it was one of the smallest apartments in the building.
 But in the almost three years since that purchase, the description of the unit has changed. Two weeks ago, Mr. Puddicombe sold the apartment on West 56th Street for $6.425 million, a nifty return of nearly 20 times what he paid for it. But from the listing, it was no longer the same modest one-bedroom. 
 The apartment, sold by Elizabeth Sample, a senior vice president at Brown Harris Stevens, was described in the listing as having 2,100 square feet of space, two bedrooms, three baths and two gas-burning fireplaces. The buyer was Kevin McGovern, a venture capitalist, who was looking for a pied-a-terre a few blocks away from his Manhattan office. 
 Ms. Sample said Mr. Puddicombe bought essentially raw space at the top of the building in 2004, with ceilings of at least 24 feet, and built an exquisitely finished second level within that space, containing an additional bedroom that opens onto a 29-foot-wide terrace that is planted with grass and has a garden as well as a view of Central Park. She said the lower level of the apartment has 14-foot ceilings, and the ceilings in the upper level top out at 10 or 11 feet.
 City tax records, not always up to date, still show the size as 1,107 square feet and list a market value of $92,588 on the apartment. 
 Last November, shortly before he sold his 56th Street apartment, Mr. Puddicombe bought another apartment for $940,900 on East 96th Street, in One Carnegie Hill, another project developed by the Related Companies.
 The company said it does not comment on the private real estate transactions of its employees.A Condo Big Enough For a Freshman Class 
 MIKHAIL KURNEV has built 2,000 college dormitory rooms across Lower Manhattan, but when it came to his own home, he opted for a place uptown, with a little more space. Mr. Kurnev this month bought a loft-style, full-floor condominium in Loft 67, at 219 East 67th Street, the former offices of the Christie's East auction house, according to city records.
 Mr. Kurnev is president of Coalco New York, a division of Coalco International, a diversified development company based in Russia, with extensive aluminum holdings and real estate investments around the world. Coalco New York's portfolio includes more than 30 percent of New York University student housing, as well a number of luxury residential developments. 
 The condo in Loft 67 has 4,655 square feet of space, a 50-foot terrace and floor-to-ceiling windows, according to Loy Carlos, a broker for the Corcoran Group who represented the developer. It was sold as ''raw space,'' not a daunting challenge, perhaps, to an experienced real estate developer.

HEADLINE: An Affair to Remember

BYLINE: By Gerald Eskenazi. 
Gerald Eskenazi is the author, most recently, of ''I Hid It Under the Sheets: Growing Up With Radio.''

 BODY:
I DON'T claim that my recent letter to William Clay Ford Jr. -- a cri de coeur about my problematic Jaguar -- led to his giving up the chief executive's post at his family's car company. But it certainly was part of his problem. You see, rising on my 70th birthday, I thought: Does my car define me? I knew the answer.
 Unfortunately, I had fallen in love with my Jaguar -- and therein lies a cautionary tale, in which I learned the economic lesson of sunk costs and suffered the same ego-deflation as the smarties who held on to their tech stocks because, once, they had been so fine. 
It was such a sleek beauty when I bought it, just before the millennium, that even the guy pumping gas in Williston Park, N.Y., not far from where I lived, admired it. A woman once stopped me outside of the Bronx Zoo, told me to roll down my window and complimented the look of the thing.
 I was convinced that taxi drivers -- in New York City! -- gave me the right of way, that pedestrians waited for the ''walk'' sign. In fact, I even told friends how driving the Jaguar made me a better person. My wife thought I was batty.
 Even while I was basking in the glow of the shiny hood ornament, with its leaping cat, I overlooked the three times the car was towed for overheating, for simply dying, for being too complex. I dismissed the fact that eight times I brought in the car because the sun roof wouldn't open, or the ''turn off engine'' light went on or the trunk seemed soldered shut. After all, it was under an extended warranty. But that came to an end after a few years. 
 In the meantime, I had been seduced by the sleek lines, the cachet, and so what that both times the hood ornament was stolen on Manhattan streets, where I had eschewed the safety of my Long Island garage to visit friends, it cost me $275? This was, after all, a Jaguar XJ8, the kind of car you see in a cortege escorting Queen Elizabeth, the kind of car that impressed even the president of the Jets football team, who said to me, ''You're doing pretty well, huh?'' -- as if I were one of his $2 million-a-year defensive tackles.
 So I threw in a few thousand dollars after a harrowing trip from Baltimore spent mostly in the service lane of the Jersey Turnpike, so I could manage the overheating instead of worrying about stop-and-go traffic. A radiator? What car needs a new radiator these days? And when the machine started to putt-putt after I bought gas, I thought I had been sold dirty fuel. Instead, another couple of thousand went for a new transmission.
 The yearly inspection? Another $1,600 because well, I never quite figured out why. How about $500 for the 10,000-mile check-up?
 You have to understand that never in my life had I owned something that could be considered luxurious. Indeed, when I bought the Jaguar in 1998, my other car was a Saturn.
 But in my business -- I was a sportswriter with this paper for decades, beginning in 1959 -- I have had the opportunity to be among the haves, and sometimes to share vicariously in the good life with the likes of Alfred Vanderbilt, Donald Trump and Leon Hess (who owned those immaculate gas stations as well as the Jets football team).
 Even when I visited my upscale cousin (he's a psychiatrist) in Westport, Conn., just down the road from Paul Newman's place, I felt I belonged. 
 Thus, I shelled out $1,694 to stop the Jag from having the hiccups. That last check got to me. It led to my whiney letter to the head of Ford, Jaguar's parent company. I told him how the car had broken my heart, how it squawked and sputtered. Honestly, I don't know what I wanted him to say. Maybe to tell me, ''I feel your pain.''
 No response. For no sooner did Mr. Ford get my letter than he stepped down as the No. 1 man at his eponymous place of business. I was on my own again.
 And then on that fateful day when I woke up, wondering whether this car defined me, I put it out on eBay. Not a nibble. I went to a Jaguar dealer. He offered me $1,000. Shocked, I refused, and decided to trade it in. I read about the most practical cars, and my practical cousin (he's a financier now, but started out driving a laundry truck) from Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., took me to a Lexus dealer and hooked me up with a handsome car that works. Perhaps sensing my pain, the dealer gave me $3,000 for the Jag.
 You know, selling the Jaguar has made me a better person.
 But it took an epiphany, which finally brought into focus the thousands I had squandered.

DATELINE: MORRISTOWN 

 BODY:
KENT MANAHAN is as skilled at ticking off the benefits of living in New Jersey as any self-satisfied new suburbanite. Only when she starts up, it's a lot more convincing. ''New Jersey is a paradox in all that it offers,'' the petite, platinum-blond newscaster said over tea near her home in Morris Township. ''We're an urbanized state, yet we are so rural and so wealthy in our suburbs. You could be at High Point and be in New York in an hour. Or you could be on a beautiful farm in the southern part of the state and then be in Philadelphia in no time at all.'' 
 She should know. Since 1982, Ms. Manahan has been anchoring NJN News, the only nightly program dedicated to covering all things New Jersey. 
 And not just for New Jerseyans: through a quirk in Federal Communications Commission requirements, NJN News is seen nightly not only on WNJN, a public station that reaches all of New Jersey and parts of New York, Pennsylvania and Delaware, but also on WNET, the Manhattan-based but Newark-licensed public station that draws viewers from throughout New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. An estimated 68,000 viewers watch NJN News on WNJN each night; an estimated 40,000 tune into NJN News on WNET.
 ''When I started out, no one was reporting on New Jersey,'' said Ms. Manahan, who began her WNJN career in 1976 as a reporter. ''The people of New Jersey knew more about the governor of New York than their own governor.''
 NJN News has since won three regional Emmys for outstanding newscast, and Ms. Manahan has won five individual Emmys for her reporting. She is modest on the subject of her own success -- ''I don't think I have any particular talent as a TV personality,'' she said -- but borderline boastful about her news team. 
 ''In the newsroom, it's a total group effort,'' she said. ''Some of us have been together for 10, 15, 25 years. I've worked with William Jobes, our news director, Michael Aron, our chief political correspondent, Jim Hooker, our State House correspondent, and Mike Curtis, our producer, for many years -- a decade and a half or more. We depend on each other so much and work so closely together that we all could do each other's jobs. That's the way it has to be when you're in a market this competitive.'' 
 Another point of pride is the program's broad reach and ''issue-driven'' format. Competing cable news stations do an admirable job of zoning in on local areas, she said. Where NJN differs is in its proficiency at cinching the state together through common concerns. 
 ''We've established our reputation in political, economic, social, scientific and health reporting,'' she said. 
 Sometimes, NJN breaks from its straight-from-the-newsroom format: 14 years ago, Ms. Manahan thought to ask two former governors, Tom Kean and Brendan Byrne, to square off against each other in a televised discussion of current issues. Through that half-hour of points and counterpoints, the still-running weekly program ''On the Record'' was born. Before that, in 1985, Ms. Manahan reported a documentary, ''Battered Wives, Shattered Lives,'' that went on to be broadcast nationally. 
 ''The interview that will be with me forever came from that documentary,'' she said. It was with a Bergen County woman who shot her husband to death in the early 1980s. ''She was the first woman in the country to be found not guilty because of battered wives syndrome. It was a very emotional interview; really wrenching.'' 
 Following her heart into the community has been as much a part of Ms. Manahan's life as her 75-minute drive, Monday through Friday, from Morris Plains to Trenton, where NJN News broadcasts. As the mother of six -- Ms. Manahan and her husband, Peter Manahan, a former Morris County prosecutor, raised five sons and one daughter, who range in age from 28 to 35 and all live in nearby towns -- she has always championed educational causes. Currently, she sits on the Board of Regents at Seton Hall University. ''It's a way to give young people opportunities, which I find incredibly rewarding,'' she said.
 Also rewarding, even after all these years, is the prospect of sending out each new day's news. ''I get so much personal satisfaction from it,'' she said. ''When I go to work, yesterday's news is gone, and today's a clean slate. There's a great sense of renewal in that.''

HEADLINE: Hoboken in the '70s: Stayin' Alive

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLL

DATELINE: HOBOKEN 

 BODY:
ONCE this city was a place where ocean liners were built, the piers bustled with cargo and hardworking immigrant families settled in for generations. 
 Today, Hoboken's waterfront is used for recreation; young families and old-timers walk streets lined with restaurants, offices and high end boutiques, and condos with views of the Manhattan skyline fetch commanding prices. 
In between came the 1970s, the decade of pet rocks, lava lamps, Richard Nixon's presidency and Watergate. That's when Hoboken was, to put it nicely, in a transition period. 
 To put it a different way, ''it was considered the armpit of Hudson County,'' said Robert Foster, the executive director of the Hoboken Historical Museum.
 ''It had the lowest per capita income, highest unemployment, the lowest education levels,'' Mr. Foster said. ''Everything was bad, especially morale.'' 
 For people who know Hoboken only as it is today -- with two Starbucks, a hot real estate market and an active nightlife -- it can be tough to imagine an impoverished city struggling with racial tensions and crumbling infrastructure. But a new photography exhibition at the museum, ''From Another Time: Hoboken in the 1970s,'' chronicles the decade in mostly black and white pictures and offers insight into the city during one of its most difficult times. 
 The exhibition, which runs through July 1, is mounted on discarded plywood retrieved from construction Dumpsters throughout the city. 
 The work of three photographers, Caroline Carlson, John F. Conn and Benedict J. Fernandez, is displayed on panels devoted to subjects including Hoboken High School, politics, the national bicentennial and, of course, bars and food. 
 Some photos depict Hoboken at its bleakest -- a pack of stray dogs roaming a parking lot outside of the Erie-Lackawanna Hoboken Terminal; trash-strewn, debris-filled lots; faces filled with despair. Others show everyday life: clotheslines strung between apartment buildings and weighed down with clothing; men selling fruit and vegetables from the back of trucks. Still others show the lasting power of some Hoboken traditions: revelers at the annual Madonna dei Martiri feast, people hanging out in bars on Washington Street, neighbors talking on the stoop. In each section of the exhibition, laminated newspaper articles offer context for the pictures. 
 The museum also borrowed 1970s high school yearbooks from the city's library and set up a reading stand where people can thumb through them. 
 A companion book, ''From Another Time: Hoboken in the 1970s'' ($25), features all the photographs in the exhibition (and quite a few more) and essays by Sada Fretz, a local resident, and Anthony DePalma, a reporter for The New York Times and a Hoboken native who now lives in Montclair. 
 The exhibition sketches the life of the city during a tumultuous time. ''The Hoboken of the '70s was not about it being a young city like today,'' Mr. Foster said. ''It was that we didn't know if it was going to live or die.'' ''From Another Time: Hoboken in the 1970s,'' Hoboken Historical Museum, 1301 Hudson Street, Hoboken; (201) 656-2240; www.hobokenmuseum.org. $2 for nonmembers. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 2 to 9 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 p.m.

HEADLINE: A Move to Establish New Life Near the Station

BYLINE: By JILL P. CAPUZZO

DATELINE: Elizabeth 

 BODY:
INSIDE the restored turn-of-the-century train station, guests nibbled on Caesar salad and admired the tin ceiling. To get here, they passed through vacant lots strewn with rubble and pieces of chain-link fencing, the surrounding buildings marked with graffiti. The juxtaposition provided the perfect backdrop earlier this month for Gov. Jon S. Corzine to announce that the 20 acres surrounding the midtown train station would become a so-called transit village.
 The following week, more fanfare was bestowed upon the city of Burlington, which also earned transit village status -- a designation that, for each of these two latest recipients, included an initial $100,000 state grant to help support plans for mixed-use development around their train stations. 
 In the last eight years, the State Department of Transportation has formally designated 19 transit villages around New Jersey Transit rail and bus stations as part of a ''smart-growth'' effort to encourage residential and retail development at transit hubs. 
 With the transit village designation, municipalities are eligible for professional assistance and possible state grants, as well as quicker approvals for mixed-use projects. The bigger payoff comes when the most successful transit villages have been able to leverage that designation into millions of dollars in private investment.
 In Elizabeth, local officials view their transit village status as an opportunity to help revitalize the city's aging midtown. The state transportation commissioner, Kris Kolluri, called the addition of Elizabeth ''a watershed moment'' for the transit village program. 
 But there has been mixed success with the program. After the press conferences, some towns have found that their transit village designation, which they had hoped would be a catalyst for change, did not accomplish all that was expected. 
 And, as more towns look to be included in the program, some local elected officials are facing strong opposition from residents. Opponents say they do not want any more traffic and development near the train stations, which they say are already too crowded and fail to offer adequate parking for daily commuters. 
 Plans for 300 new homes, a hotel and extensive office and retail space around Hamilton Township's busy train station, which has not yet been formally designated a transit village, were recently put on hold after the political makeup of the town council changed. The plans became a major issue in last November's election because many residents had balked at the proposed transit village plans.
 ''It's the easiest thing in the world to get up and say 'No more development,' '' said Glen Gilmore, the mayor of Hamilton and an advocate of the transit village plan. ''But you have to recognize the reality that the population is growing, and this is exactly the kind of development you want.''
 In nearby West Windsor, local officials began holding public workshops last week on plans to develop 350 acres surrounding the busy Princeton Junction train station. There, residents and commuters have raised concerns about more development around an already overcrowded train station, which has enough parking for only half of the station's 7,000 daily commuters. The waiting list for a parking permit is seven years.
 State financing for the program is also an issue. From 2002 to 2005, the program received $1 million annually, but no state money was earmarked for transit villages for the current fiscal year. The state has, however, identified $2 million in federal funds that can be used for transportation and air-quality studies related to transit villages. 
 FINANCIAL awards to individual towns have also been somewhat arbitrary, ranging from $650,000 for Metuchen to nothing for Netcong. 
 ''There's been no standardization of what you're going to get with this designation,'' said Jan Wells, an assistant research professor at the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University. ''In reality, the carrots they are putting out there now are probably federal dollars.'' 
 Some communities have found the designation helpful. The mayor of Collingswood, M. James Maley Jr., said that his town received no additional funds when it was first named a transit village in 2003, but that the designation did provide leverage for other state grants.
 ''Unfortunately, there hasn't always been money attached,'' Mr. Maley said, ''but it gives you brownie points that can get you money from other departments for studies and planning.''
 The designation also increases the potential to attract private dollars.
 ''Developers see towns designated as transit villages as much friendlier places, there's a welcome mat outside,'' Ms. Wells said. ''And towns say, now that I'm a transit village, developers will want to come here.''
 However, she said, it is no magic formula. The transit villages that have been most successful are ones that have spent years planning and building community support. 
 Such is the case in Collingswood, which has transformed its downtown. In the next several weeks, residents will begin moving into the first of 119 luxury condominiums being built on the site of an old lumberyard a few blocks from the train station.
 In Rahway, a $16 million renovation of the train station has spawned development of 86 town houses along the river, as well as plans for a 15-story mixed-use development, including 20,000 square feet of retail space, a 102-room hotel and 200 condominiums. 
 For every success story like Collingswood or Rahway, there are stalled transit villages, like the one in Pleasantville, where the area around the bus station has little appeal to private developers, or at the Matawan-Aberdeen station, where plans for 500 new homes have been blocked by disagreements between the two municipalities.
 One problem has been in tracking which projects are working and which are not. Reporting requirements for transit villages have been strictly voluntary, said Ms. Wells, whose office has been in charge of monitoring the program since 2002. This year she received annual reports from 9 of the 17 previously named transit villages. 
 ''Some just don't have anything to say,'' Ms. Wells said. ''Others just don't have the staff to keep track of all the information that's requested, and that is a problem.''

HEADLINE: A Plan to Protect New York Water

 BODY:
New York is in an elite club among major American cities; it's one of five that does not require filtration of its drinking water. That's largely thanks to a visionary strategy devised a century ago that established an upstate watershed consisting of 19 reservoirs and a system of aqueducts. That enviable system contributed to the phenomenal growth of the city and even now delivers nearly pristine water to 8 million people every day. But its days as an essentially filtration-free system could be numbered unless the city takes firm action to protect it.
 The federal government, specifically the Environmental Protection Agency, evaluates the system every five years and recommends a course of action to keep the water clean enough to avoid filtration and the attendant costs of building a filtration plant. These costs could run as high as $10 billion, leading to higher water bills for everyone. 
 The next evaluation is due in a few weeks, and while the city and state have already invested a great deal of time, effort and money in keeping the watershed clean, Washington should not be at all bashful about keeping the heat on. 
 In particular, it should ask the city to increase its efforts to acquire more open space to protect the watershed from development, which may be the gravest single threat to water quality.
 While upstate residents are understandably hungry for growth and the jobs it brings, the potential long-term cost of such development is usually overlooked. A recent significant increase in new second homes and a string of economic development projects in and around the watershed -- including the proposed casino in Sullivan County -- means more roads, more runoff and additional sewage. Even modest development in the wrong places can despoil streams and creeks, affecting the water that flows to the reservoir and, ultimately, to the city. Recognizing the risks, the city 10 years ago agreed to a program of acquiring land for conservation. The city's Department of Environmental Protection has done an able job, purchasing some 75,000 acres, as part of a $1.5 billion investment in wastewater treatment and other programs. And yet New York is far from having a handle on the problem, not least because it cannot claim sole ownership of the land it wants to protect. Other cities without filtration -- San Francisco, Seattle and Portland, Ore. -- completely control their respective watershed areas. Boston owns about 50 percent of the source of its unfiltered water. New York controls just 30 percent of the 1 million-acre Catskill-Delaware watershed, and acquiring land is getting tougher and pricier. 
 Another problem is that the city's D.E.P., for reasons of history, may not always be the right party to negotiate for land. Some upstate residents still bear a grudge over the loss of whole towns that were condemned and flooded in the early 1900s to provide water downstate. And however energetic the department has been, its bureaucratic process is often at odds with the need for expeditious action to close land deals. 
 One possible answer to this is to enlist the assistance of nonprofit land trusts and organizations with expertise in conserving land through purchases and negotiated easements, like the Nature Conservancy, the Trust for Public Land and the Open Space Institute. The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group and a longtime watchdog in the watershed, has recommended spending $350 million over the next 10 years on land acquisition -- a cost that the state should share with the city. That amount could buy 100,000 acres. James Tierney, the watershed inspector general and assistant attorney general for the state, says the target should be 150,000 acres in the next decade. Even that seems reasonable if it will hold off the day of reckoning on filtration.

 BODY:
Holding Back the HudsonQ. For two years, while driving up the Henry Hudson Parkway, I have noticed at least one and often two huge barges anchored in the river, off about 100th to 120th Streets, attended by a tugboat. What is going on? A. What's going on, according to the Coast Guard, is a long-term job to repair seawalls.
Workers are reinforcing the granite and concrete walls used to protect the riverbanks from heavy winds and high water. Parts of the walls are more than 100 years old. Several companies are involved, but not the Coast Guard, which only keeps track of who's on the water. Barges carry the wall reinforcements and hold the heavy-duty cranes needed to put the blocks in place. 
 A Coast Guard spokesman said that former built-up areas along the bank that were part of the working port system were well protected with seawalls; one, for example, was the site of a defunct shipbuilding company near the Fairway market on 132nd Street. But undeveloped stretches, some of them now footpaths, need much more reinforcement. A Biblical FoundationQ. Whenever I pass the Nehemiah Houses in Brooklyn, I wonder who they were named for. I love that name.A. Like many other names, it comes from Scripture. The houses were built by the Nehemiah Housing Development Fund Corporation, named for the Old Testament prophet sent by the king of Persia to Jerusalem in the fifth century B.C. to help rebuild the city after Babylonian captivity.
 In the early 1980s, a group of church leaders and civic activists, called the East Brooklyn Congregations, began their version of a new Jerusalem: a plan that is credited with reviving East New York and Brownsville when no one else wanted to build there.
 City Hall provided vacant, seemingly worthless city land for tracts of small single-family houses, mass-produced for no profit. Poorer residents could afford them. To date, Nehemiah has built about 2,900 homes, and a South Bronx affiliate has added about 1,000 units.
 A leader of the East Brooklyn Congregations, the Rev. Johnny Ray Youngblood, preached sermons in 1981 based on the Book of Nehemiah, recalled Michael Gecan, regional supervisor for the Industrial Areas Foundation, the parent organization for the homebuilding group. The text reads in part: ''Jerusalem lies in ruins, its walls destroyed by fire.'' It continues: ''Come, let us rebuild the walls and be rid of the reproach.''
 ''Many of us heard one or more of those sermons and then walked outside into the streets of East New York, where the neighborhood lay in ruins, its walls destroyed by fire and other forces,'' Mr. Gecan wrote in an e-mail message. Mr. Youngblood's sermons inspired the leaders of East Brooklyn Congregations to name their effort the EBC Nehemiah Plan.Famous Last ExitQ. Anyone who braves ''Last Exit to Brooklyn,'' the grim novel by Hubert Selby Jr., might wonder: Is there a particular exit he was referring to?A. It's not just a fictional device. The literary history ''Remarkable, Unspeakable New York,'' by Shaun O'Connell, identifies the source as a sign on the Gowanus Expressway, just before the entrance to the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel. The exit leads to ''a wasteland of docks, abandoned factories, bars, slums and housing projects, structures left for the down-and-out of the city,'' he wrote. 
 Selby's book, a 1964 collection of stories about the seedy underside of Red Hook in the 1950s, remains a chronicle of an urban nightmare. MICHAEL POLLAK

HEADLINE: Robert Moses Vs. Jane Jacobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''A Town Revived, a Villain Redeemed,'' by Phillip Lopate (Feb. 11): New York is indeed again ascending, though I would argue that it is in large part despite what Robert Moses did, rather than because of it. Very few doubt the need for large-scale planning. Jane Jacobs supported mass transit; Moses never did. 
 The photograph accompanying the article is of Moses' proposed Brooklyn-Battery Bridge. No one questioned the need for a crossing, but had the bridge been built, it would have blighted Lower Manhattan's skyline for generations. Only through intervention from Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt was this plan halted, and a tunnel constructed instead.
 No doubt Moses did do much good, but a person whose worst mistakes were stopped not because he recognized them as such, but only because others were able to stop them, is hardly ''redeemed.'' Peter KaufmanBrooklyn HeightsTo the Editor:
 To look for a little bit of both Robert Moses and Jane Jacobs is a contradiction in terms. 
 Jacobs believed in big projects: mass transit and boulevards that strengthened the city, not massive highways through neighborhoods that weakened it; transit-accessible big parks and neighborhood-based little parks that were gathering places, not acres of fenced-in green space with towers in the middle; a vast school and health care system; and cultural venues that added to the whole in a big way by reinforcing the parts in a small way.
 Most of all, she believed in a genuine public process that encouraged citizens to help shape their community, not just testify about it.Roberta Brandes GratzUpper West SideThe writer is the author of two books about urban revitalization.To the Editor:
 I would remind Phillip Lopate and others who are seeking to bring Robert Moses back from exile that he began remaking the city nearly 75 years ago. (And that Jane Jacobs wrote her classic book 45 years ago.) The people of New York have a bit more say about their city now!Herbert J. Gans Morningside HeightsTo the Editor:
 Phillip Lopate's appreciative re-appraisal of Robert Moses' work in New York was interesting, and I agree for the most part. I differ, however, with his characterization of Westway as a ''worthy'' idea ''shot down by neighborhood opposition.'' 
 Westway was not a worthy idea; it was a below-ground highway creating the base for large commercial and residential development which, in addition to endangering striped bass and other fish, would have closed the waterfront to all but the affluent in the high rises.
 I would add that the not quite complete park now running along the Hudson from Battery Park City to 59th Street exists primarily as a result of efforts by neighborhood activists and others who opposed Westway for a better alternative.Ross Graham Chelsea

HEADLINE: An Affair to Remember

BYLINE: By Gerald Eskenazi. 
Gerald Eskenazi is the author, most recently, of ''I Hid It Under the Sheets: Growing Up With Radio.''

 BODY:
I DON'T claim that my recent letter to William Clay Ford Jr. -- a cri de coeur about my problematic Jaguar -- led to his giving up the chief executive's post at his family's car company. But it certainly was part of his problem. You see, rising on my 70th birthday, I thought: Does my car define me? I knew the answer.
 Unfortunately, I had fallen in love with my Jaguar -- and therein lies a cautionary tale, in which I learned the economic lesson of sunk costs and suffered the same ego-deflation as the smarties who held on to their tech stocks because, once, they had been so fine. 
It was such a sleek beauty when I bought it, just before the millennium, that even the guy pumping gas in Williston Park, N.Y., not far from where I lived, admired it. A woman once stopped me outside of the Bronx Zoo, told me to roll down my window and complimented the look of the thing.
 I was convinced that taxi drivers -- in New York City! -- gave me the right of way, that pedestrians waited for the ''walk'' sign. I even told friends how driving the Jaguar made me a better person. My wife thought I was batty.
 Even while I was basking in the glow of the shiny hood ornament, with its leaping cat, I overlooked the three times the car was towed for overheating, for simply dying, for being too complex. I dismissed the fact that eight times I brought in the car because the sun roof wouldn't open, or the ''turn off engine'' light went on or the trunk seemed soldered shut. After all, it was under an extended warranty. But that ended after a few years. 
 In the meantime, I had been seduced by the sleek lines, the cachet, and so what that both times the hood ornament was stolen on Manhattan streets, where I had eschewed the safety of my Long Island garage to visit friends, it cost me $275? This was, after all, a Jaguar XJ8, the kind of car you see in a cortege escorting Queen Elizabeth, the kind of car that impressed even the president of the Jets, who said to me, ''You're doing pretty well, huh?'' -- as if I were one of his $2 million-a-year defensive tackles.
 So I threw in a few thousand dollars after a harrowing trip from Baltimore spent mostly in the service lane of the Jersey Turnpike, so I could manage the overheating instead of worrying about stop-and-go traffic. A radiator? What car needs a new radiator these days? And when the machine started to putt-putt after I bought gas, I thought I had been sold dirty fuel. Instead, another couple of thousand went for a new transmission.
 The yearly inspection? Another $1,600 because well, I never quite figured out why. 
 You have to understand that never in my life had I owned something that could be considered luxurious. Indeed, when I bought the Jaguar in 1998, my other car was a Saturn.
 But in my business -- I was a sportswriter with this paper for 41 years -- I have had the opportunity to be among the haves, and sometimes to share vicariously in the good life with the likes of Alfred Vanderbilt, Donald Trump and Leon Hess (who owned those immaculate gas stations as well as the Jets).
 Even when I visited my upscale cousin (he's a psychiatrist) in Westport, Conn., down the road from Paul Newman's place, I felt I belonged. 
 Thus, I shelled out $1,694 to stop the Jag from having the hiccups. That last check got to me. It led to my whiney letter to the head of Ford, Jaguar's parent company. I told him how the car had broken my heart, how it squawked and sputtered. Honestly, I don't know what I wanted him to say. Maybe to tell me, ''I feel your pain.''
 No response. For no sooner did Mr. Ford get my letter than he stepped down as the No. 1 man at Ford. I was on my own again.
 And then on that fateful day when I woke up, wondering whether this car defined me, I put it out on eBay. Not a nibble. I went to a Jaguar dealer. He offered me $1,000. Shocked, I refused, and decided to trade it in. I read about the most practical cars, and my practical cousin (he's a financier now, but started out driving a laundry truck) from Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., took me to a Lexus dealer and hooked me up with a handsome car that works. 
 You know, selling the Jaguar has made me a better person.
 But it took an epiphany, which finally brought into focus the thousands I had squandered.

HEADLINE: Does the Shoe Fit?

BYLINE: By CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
Edmund Wilson said of Proust that we always feel as if we are reading about the end of something -- ''the society of the dispossessed nobility and the fashionable and cultivated bourgeoisie, with their physicians and their artists, their servants and their parasites.'' So it is when we think about the house of Yves Saint Laurent. Whether or not YSL is the last great Paris house -- it was founded in 1961, 15 years after Dior and 48 years after Chanel -- we have the feeling that it is. And, as with so many things that occupy Saint Laurent and his faithful partner, Pierre Berge, not least posterity, this feeling was the result of a very deliberate effort. 
The more we learned about Saint Laurent's neurotic character, the more Berge harped on the superiority of his genius; and while misery and degradation scarcely matter in the making of beautiful dresses for rich ladies, they are the recognized, if stock, qualities of a Great Artist. In the early 1990s, perhaps aware of Saint Laurent's waning influence, Berge stepped up the rhetoric. He famously declared that when Saint Laurent dies, so ends a particular world. Not the lament of ''the last fires of a setting sun,'' as Wilson said of Proust's novel -- more like a scorched-earth campaign. Berge meant for us to think that no one could follow Saint Laurent. If the implications of such sick and desperate thinking have never been examined, it's because Saint Laurent's genius was real, his suffering induced sympathy, and Berge saw to it that the master was put into a museum while still alive.
 Of course this would be an extremely cynical interpretation of a fashion legend but for one fact: not one of the three designers who has succeeded him in his house has managed to fully take his place. Despite the magic of the YSL name, despite the millions of dollars invested and the millions lost -- as much as $70 million as recently as two years ago -- nobody, it seems, can get the brand right. Meanwhile, Chanel and Dior, once seen as dowagers next to cool Saint Laurent, have thrived and earned billions.
 Alber Elbaz, the Moroccan-born, American-trained designer who has made such a success of Lanvin, was the first to try at YSL, and while his three collections were more engaging and relevant than they seemed at the time, he got the ax in 2000, after Gucci Group bought the company and installed Tom Ford. Ford certainly had a new vision for the brand, as well as the attention of Wall Street and Hollywood, but his efforts were hindered by the global economic slump that followed the Sept. 11 attacks. It also didn't help that Berge continually derided Ford's work. By the spring of 2004, though, both Ford and the Gucci chief executive Domenico De Sole were out, having lost control in a power struggle with the group's French owner, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR).
 Initially hired as Ford's assistant, Stefano Pilati has held the job since then. Pilati is tall and ginger-haired, with a dandy's outmoded elegance and a charming, if self-conscious, manner that masks sudden changes in mood. He came from Prada, where he had worked on the Miu Miu line with Miuccia Prada and Fabio Zambernardi. Like much of his conversation, Pilati's designs sometimes betray an intellectual view of fashion more typically associated with Prada than with Saint Laurent. Nonetheless, he's been responsible for a number of trends, beginning with his first YSL collection, where he reintroduced the tulip skirt and the wide belt and, despite negative reviews, set off a wave of coquettish fashion. Two seasons later, in a Spanish-inspired collection, he scored again, with slim, high-waisted pants. This past fall, few styles were more widely copied than his YSL tunics.
 Aware of the gap between the brand's perceived status and its financial losses, Francois-Henri Pinault, the chairman of PPR, and Robert Polet, the chief executive of Gucci Group, have made YSL a top priority, along with its sister brands Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga. For C.E.O., they plucked Valerie Hermann from Dior, where she had worked closely with its chief executive, Sidney Toledano, and had proved, through her rapport with John Galliano, that she could identify with extreme talent and still please shareholders as well as the chairman of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Bernard Arnault. In her eight years at Dior, revenues exploded, the company hit upon an advertising image that related more directly and aggressively to young consumers, and Galliano was at his maximal creativity.
 Hermann says she agreed to take the YSL job even before she met Pilati, convinced that she could turn things around. ''First, I think YSL is a fantastic brand,'' she said over lunch in Paris last December. ''Second, it was a great challenge, because it was losing so much money for so long.'' Hermann, a wife and a mother of three, rarely avoids eye contact, though her toughness is mediated by enthusiasm. She added: ''Is it a desperate situation? No. That's why I came, because I was sure we could do something.''
 Since the problems at YSL date to the early '90s, fixing them will take time. But to Hermann, the turnaround is now a certainty, if not a fact, and she points to the success of the Muse and Downtown bags and the draw of classic YSL themes like leopard print and patent leather. Last year, revenues rose a strong 19 percent, to 194 million euros (about $250 million). Hermann is no less proud of her relationship with Pilati, though one suspects it has its trials. But, as she told me: ''There isn't one day when we're not talking. I think it is part of the deal. If he fails, I fail. And if I fail, he will probably fail as well.''
 The skeptical view among editors and even some of his friends is that Pilati has still not created a YSL that feels new and relevant and that immediately connects with women the way, say, Prada or Chanel do. 
 Part of the problem is that each season, Pilati seems to take one step forward, only to fall two back. He can create looks that are unique to the season, but in a way it doesn't matter; by the time he has finished piling on the accessories, or putting them on a superlong runway, or photographing them according to some obscure concept, you don't care how different the garment is. One colleague suggested that it's too complicated and overly intellectualized. Zambernardi of Prada told me, ''So far, I like what Stefano is doing for YSL, and I never liked what Tom Ford did.'' But while not wishing to sound critical of his friend, Zambernardi said that in ''wanting everything to be conceptual and very thoughtful,'' Pilati can get bogged down and lose sight of what's contemporary.
 This was especially true of his spring collection, staged on a long runway so thickly covered with violets and dirt that each time a model seemed on the verge of losing her footing, the audience gasped. And Yves Saint Laurent, of all fashion names, is supposed to symbolize freedom and power.
 ''I know!'' Pilati said, looking agonized when I brought it up. ''That's what annoyed me the most -- I had lost the dynamic of the Saint Laurent woman. These women were fragile looking, and it's not the woman I want! They're wobbling!'' He said the original idea was to suggest a woman leaving a city and tracing her own path by walking on the violets. ''And violets are a symbol of modesty and virginity,'' Pilati added. But that wasn't the dominant thought one had of the show. It was: Why does he have to make everything so difficult?
 Filling a giant's shoes is not easy, and at least with Saint Laurent's, it was always assumed that the fit would never be perfect -- which is altogether different from getting the brand right. Also, Saint Laurent carried such emotional weight with people who were young in the late '60s and '70s, when the house seemed to be the psychic center of fashion, that successors were bound to be uniquely punished if they didn't get the line of the shoulders just so or possess his same romantic color sense. Mind you, if one were to take Berge's claim that ''Yves is like Proust'' to its logical extreme, one would see the fatal impossibility of duplicating Saint Laurent, or any great designer, since everything is relative to the time and place where it is first experienced. Surely the laws of relativity apply equally to master and successor.
 Nonetheless, there is a burden attached to YSL. ''To begin with, this house has so much myth behind it and under it,'' Elbaz told me. ''It was a house that was not a house. It was one big family. I felt like a son-in-law in that place. Mr. Saint Laurent'' -- who retired in stages, continuing to design the couture collections until 2002 -- ''let me have the daughter, which was the ready-to-wear.'' He laughed. ''Now that I got a divorce, everybody says, 'Oh, he was fabulous.' '' To Elbaz, the essence of Saint Laurent was perfection, but to make his collections seem relevant, Elbaz felt he had to play with imperfection -- turning 12 classic dresses, for example, into 12 shirts. He was roundly criticized. ''Is it too much Saint Laurent or is it not enough? That's the whole issue with that house,'' Elbaz added. 
 Although Ford initially got on well with Berge and Saint Laurent and based his first YSL show on Saint Laurent's muse, Betty Catroux, he soon realized he could never hope to take YSL in a new direction if he allowed Berge to be involved, as Berge expected. This may account for Berge's scorn. In any case, revivals of fashion houses have tended to work best when the founders are dead or otherwise absent. Berge, who declined to be interviewed for this story, has been more visible since Ford left and PPR took control of Gucci Group. Pilati said that after his spring show, on the violet catwalk, Berge told him he longed for the day when he -- Pilati -- did something simple, a comment that on the face of it seems benign. But Pilati is vulnerable in other ways. A year ago there was a rumor that Hedi Slimane, of Dior Homme, would replace him, a suggestion fueled by the Saint Laurent-like perfection of Slimane's fall 2006 men's show.
 ''I really couldn't have cared less when I heard all those rumors,'' Pilati said one afternoon in his studio. ''I'm very aware of my limits -- everybody knows them.'' I asked him if he thought Slimane could do a better job at YSL. ''I respect him,'' Pilati replied. ''I would like to say yes, he could do it. But nobody's ever seen a women's ready-to-wear collection from him.''
 It's probable that anyone holding the reins at YSL, at least while there are still people around who care, would feel vulnerable. As Pilati said: ''I knew from Day 1 that I could be attacked from many angles. Because I'm Italian, because I've never been famous, because Hedi was better, because Alber was better, because Tom was better, more powerful and more beautiful. I mean, everything!'' He smiled. ''And I knew it from Day 1.''
 Another issue occupying the front row is whether Pilati's clothes are cool. A lot of editors don't think so. They use terms like ''fussy'' and ''too Italian'' to indicate they don't think his sensibility is ideal for a French house whose sex appeal was defined by a bourgeois housewife dipping into a local brothel. Of course, editors lodged similar complaints against Karl Lagerfeld when he first went to Chanel. But the question of cool has never been in doubt with Lagerfeld, nor with Nicolas Ghesquiere at Balenciaga. ''I'm aware that, somehow, Saint Laurent is not cool,'' Pilati said. ''But it has the opportunity to be.''
 Olivier Zahm, the editor of the magazine Purple Fashion and a friend of Pilati's (he also works on the men's ad campaign for YSL), suggests that the definition of cool may be limited by the perspective of editors and ultimately not as free as the opinions of young consumers. 
 ''There's a lot of supercool stuff on the runways, but nobody will wear it,'' Zahm said. ''I think Stefano has a good understanding of what a young lady in London or New York wants to wear if she loves fashion, in the old-school sense.''
 While Pilati has every reason to feel secure in his job and in his relationship with Hermann, there is a tentativeness that creeps into his work, an element of second-guessing that is reflected in the brand's advertising images as well. It may be that he doesn't have a strong right-hand person (Pilati said this is the case), or it may be that he is unduly influenced by the last opinion he heard, as friends and colleagues suggest.
 A French editor, after seeing Prada's collection of turbans and jewel-tone satin mini-dresses, remarked that the clothes were just the kind that Pilati should be doing at YSL. Certainly few houses have a greater claim to those references than YSL. In fact, Zambernardi believes that Pilati should take YSL ''back to zero,'' and added: ''I think it's difficult to do new things when the founder is still around. For French people, Saint Laurent is an institution. They almost feel that nothing is going to get better than him.'' It is, finally, this thinking that is holding the house of YSL back, and making a dutiful son-in-law of the talented Mr. Pilati. Maybe Alber Elbaz was onto something when he thought that imperfection was the only way to be modern. Maybe to get YSL right, you just have to be a little bit wrong.

HEADLINE: An Affair to Remember

BYLINE: By Gerald Eskenazi. 
Gerald Eskenazi is the author, most recently, of ''I Hid It Under the Sheets: Growing Up With Radio.''

 BODY:
I DON'T claim that my recent letter to William Clay Ford Jr. -- a cri de coeur about my problematic Jaguar -- led to his giving up the chief executive's post at his family's car company. But it certainly was part of his problem. You see, rising on my 70th birthday, I thought: Does my car define me? I knew the answer.
 Unfortunately, I had fallen in love with my Jaguar -- and therein lies a cautionary tale, in which I learned the economic lesson of sunk costs and suffered the same ego-deflation as the smarties who held on to their tech stocks because, once, they had been so fine. 
It was such a sleek beauty when I bought it, just before the millennium, that even the guy pumping gas in Williston Park, N.Y., not far from where I lived, admired it. A woman once stopped me outside of the Bronx Zoo, told me to roll down my window and complimented the look of the thing.
 I was convinced that taxi drivers -- in New York City! -- gave me the right of way, that pedestrians waited for the ''walk'' sign. In fact, I even told friends how driving the Jaguar made me a better person. My wife thought I was batty.
 Even while I was basking in the glow of the shiny hood ornament, with its leaping cat, I overlooked the three times the car was towed for overheating, for simply dying, for being too complex. I dismissed the fact that eight times I brought in the car because the sun roof wouldn't open, or the ''turn off engine'' light went on or the trunk seemed soldered shut. After all, it was under an extended warranty. But that came to an end after a few years. 
 In the meantime, I had been seduced by the sleek lines, the cachet, and so what that both times the hood ornament was stolen on Manhattan streets, where I had eschewed the safety of my Long Island garage to visit friends, it cost me $275? This was, after all, a Jaguar XJ8, the kind of car you see in a cortege escorting Queen Elizabeth, the kind of car that impressed even the president of the Jets football team, who said to me, ''You're doing pretty well, huh?'' -- as if I were one of his $2 million-a-year defensive tackles.
 So I threw in a few thousand dollars after a harrowing trip from Baltimore spent mostly in the service lane of the Jersey Turnpike, so I could manage the overheating instead of worrying about stop-and-go traffic. A radiator? What car needs a new radiator these days? And when the machine started to putt-putt after I bought gas, I thought I had been sold dirty fuel. Instead, another couple of thousand went for a new transmission.
 The yearly inspection? Another $1,600 because well, I never quite figured out why. How about $500 for the 10,000-mile check-up?
 You have to understand that never in my life had I owned something that could be considered luxurious. Indeed, when I bought the Jaguar in 1998, my other car was a Saturn.
 But in my business -- I was a sportswriter with this paper for decades, beginning in 1959 -- I have had the opportunity to be among the haves, and sometimes to share vicariously in the good life with the likes of Alfred Vanderbilt, Donald Trump and Leon Hess (who owned those immaculate gas stations as well as the Jets football team).
 Even when I visited my upscale cousin (he's a psychiatrist) in Westport, Conn., just down the road from Paul Newman's place, I felt I belonged. 
 Thus, I shelled out $1,694 to stop the Jag from having the hiccups. That last check got to me. It led to my whiney letter to the head of Ford, Jaguar's parent company. I told him how the car had broken my heart, how it squawked and sputtered. Honestly, I don't know what I wanted him to say. Maybe to tell me, ''I feel your pain.''
 No response. For no sooner did Mr. Ford get my letter than he stepped down as the No. 1 man at his eponymous place of business. I was on my own again.
 And then on that fateful day when I woke up, wondering whether this car defined me, I put it out on eBay. Not a nibble. I went to a Jaguar dealer. He offered me $1,000. Shocked, I refused, and decided to trade it in. I read about the most practical cars, and my practical cousin (he's a financier now, but started out driving a laundry truck) from Hastings-on-Hudson took me to a Westchester Lexus dealer and hooked me up with a handsome car that works. Perhaps sensing my pain, the dealer gave me $3,000 for the Jag.
 You know, selling the Jaguar has made me a better person.
 But it took an epiphany, which finally brought into focus the thousands I had squandered.

HEADLINE: Taxed: What Makes New York Different

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
A new report showing that New York City has by far the heaviest tax burden of the nine largest American cities raises a question: Just what do New Yorkers get for paying all those taxes? 
 The report, released by the city's Independent Budget Office on Wednesday, found that state and local taxes consumed $9.02 of every $100 in household and business income, compared with an average of $6.16 in the eight other cities with populations over one million. New York has an unusually high city personal income tax, which can reach 3.65 percent.
There is broad consensus that New York is heavily taxed. The report explained the situation by alluding to the exceptional costs of Medicaid -- the health insurance program for the poor, which New York, unlike most cities, partly finances -- and, to a lesser extent, welfare programs. 
 Kim Reuben, an economist at the Urban Institute, said that a far greater proportion of New York State residents are covered by various health and social services programs than in California, Texas or Florida.
 But those are not the only areas in which New York seems to spend a lot more on services. With 8.2 million residents, its Police Department has 37,000 officers -- four times the number in Los Angeles, which has nearly half of New York's population. Spending on the city's schools has increased substantially under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.
 ''There's no question that the City of New York provides a higher level of services than cities elsewhere,'' said Michael A. Pagano, a professor of public administration at the University of Illinois in Chicago.
 Comparing services across big cities is difficult, Dr. Pagano added, because governance structures vary widely. Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston have county governments, while Philadelphia is both a city and county. New York, which comprises five counties, is unusually expansive, with a network of parks, libraries and public hospitals that all rely on the city. (The budget office's study adjusted for such variation by taking into account city, school, county and state taxes, on residents as well as businesses.) 
 Six of the nine largest cities are in the Sunbelt, where the warmer weather means less money is needed for removing snow and repairing streets damaged by the freeze-thaw cycle. 
 New York's services also cost more, Dr. Pagano said, because its work force of 270,000 (120,000 of whom work in education) is heavily unionized. 
 As one of the oldest of America's big cities, New York has aging bridges, highways, tunnels and roads that require constant upkeep. Unlike Houston, where growth is largely unchecked, New York has a tangle of planning, zoning, landmarks-preservation and other land-use rules that require the city's enforcement, said Christopher W. Hoene, a political scientist and research director at the National League of Cities. 
 Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University, said New York's high-taxation reputation has endured for decades. ''There's a social contract in New York between the wealthy people, who are paying a good share of the income tax, and the large numbers of low-income New Yorkers, who get a fair amount of city benefits,'' he said.
 Edmund J. McMahon Jr., director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a project of the conservative Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, argued that more is not necessarily better. 
 ''The position of Manhattan political elites has been, 'Well, we can tax with impunity,' '' he said. ''What they never ask is, 'Would we better off if we didn't tax with impunity?' '' 
 One of the concerns, Mr. McMahon said, is the city's excessive reliance on Wall Street -- a worry that Mayor Bloomberg has expressed. ''We have a tax structure in this city that's more dependent than ever on high-income businesses and individuals,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Real Tests for Real Children

 BODY:
The No Child Left Behind Act required the states to raise educational standards and test student performance, in exchange for federal aid. But things have not worked as Congress planned. Instead of moving toward the educational excellence that the country needs to compete in the global economy, many states opted for dumbed-down tests and deliberate sleight of hand to create the fraudulent appearance of progress. 
 As a result, states that perform well with their own watered-down exams do shockingly poorly when their students take the far more rigorous federal test known as the National Assessment of Educational Progress. A report this month by the bipartisan Commission on No Child Left Behind highlights this problem and calls for the development of more rigorous tests and national standards in reading, language arts, math and science.
 States would then be offered the options of embracing the national standards and tests, building new ones based on the national model or keeping their existing standards and tests. States that chose not to embrace the national standards would have to submit their tests and standards to federal evaluation -- to see how they compare to the national model -- and the results would be reported to parents and the general public.
 This proposal, which would have been shot down in previous years, is finding a great deal of sympathy in Congress. That is good news, given the work that has to be done to ensure that all of America's children can compete in the world.

HEADLINE: What High School Club Prepares Students for a TV Game Show?

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER. 
E-mail: lijournal@nytimes.com

DATELINE: SMITHTOWN 

 BODY:
''SHE went to Africa in the 1950s, where she worked for paleontologist Louis Leakey,'' Robin Jacobsen said, reading aloud from a list of trivia questions. ''Name this British ethologist known for her detailed, long-term research with chimpanzees.''
 Joe McGrann, an 11th grader, hit his buzzer. 
''Jane Goodall,'' he replied. 
 Ms. Jacobsen, co-adviser to the Quiz Bowl club at Smithtown High School West, acknowledged his correct answer, then added another tidbit. ''If you rang in early you might have said Dian Fossey, who also worked with apes and gorillas,'' she said. 
 Ms. Jacobsen, a 39-year-old teacher of United States history, economics and government, was drilling the members of the club after school on a recent Wednesday afternoon. A former contestant on ''Jeopardy!'' and ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' Ms. Jacobsen, of Seaford, calls herself ''a pop-culture junkie.'' She is also an avid reader who loves to do crossword puzzles. 
 ''I have a lot of random knowledge,'' she said, ''and I try to impart that to them.'' 
 To help prepare members of the club for forthcoming competitions on Cablevision's ''Long Island Challenge,'' Ms. Jacobsen, with her fellow teacher Jeff Cohn, urges the students to think fast and make split-second decisions under pressure. 
 The ''Long Island Challenge,'' a 10-year-old academic quiz show on Channel 12, pits two teams from opposing high schools against one another in a Jeopardy-style format, testing students' knowledge of history, the arts, literature, math and science. 
 Only five students per school participate in the television show, but 20 members of the Quiz Bowl club attend monthly competitions with teams from other local high schools and are headed to a tournament at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in March. 
 To prepare, Mr. Cohn and Ms. Jacobsen drill the students, firing off questions in rapid succession. But one question remains unanswered: Will Ms. Jacobsen's expertise rub off? 
 Smithtown High School West has won its first two rounds of ''Long Island Challenge'' competition. Its first match, against Harborfields High School, will be shown March 3 and 4 at 6:30 and 9:30 p.m. The third-round appearance will be taped at the end of March. If the team makes it to the Long Island championship, it will face off against schools from New Jersey and Connecticut for the program's first tristate championship. 
 Mr. Cohn, 56, of Lido Beach is a former lawyer who switched careers to teaching seven years ago. He sees the competition as helping students ''get the benefits of thinking quickly on their feet.''
 ''They get the ability to have confidence in their knowledge,'' he said. Though he stressed that being involved in the Quiz Bowl club was mainly about fun, there can be more tangible rewards. Each student participating in the ''Long Island Challenge'' championship receives $500; each regional champion school gets $2,500 in prize money; and the school crowned tristate challenge champion receives $10,000. Teams from 32 schools are in the Long Island competition. 
 Ms. Jacobsen said she started watching ''Jeopardy!'' when she was 16. 
 ''It just happened to be on after the soap opera I watched, 'Edge of Night,' '' she recalled. In 11th grade, she joined the Quiz Bowl team at Sanford H. Calhoun High School in Merrick. 
 Watching the ''Jeopardy!'' host Alex Trebek toss out the answers in different categories, Ms. Jacobsen and her sister, Tracy Marino, became ''very disciplined'' and ''very militaristic'' about the game, Ms. Jacobsen said
 ''I never blurted out an answer not in the form of a question,'' she said. ''It helped me on the show.''
 Ms. Jacobsen appeared on the television show in 1999, winning twice and earning $10,000.
 She had less luck with ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire,'' which she began watching while on maternity leave with her daughter, Kiersten, now 2 1/2. Ms. Jacobsen appeared on the program in September 2004, three weeks after Kiersten was born. She was up to $16,000 when her brother-in-law, Jim Perkowski, a groundskeeper at Eisenhower Park, supplied her with a wrong answer during the ''phone-a-friend'' lifeline. The question was about the diameter of a hole in golf. (The correct answer is 4.25 inches.) 
 ''I went home with $1,000,'' she said. 
 As a result of her ''Jeopardy!'' experience, she has been able to help students prepare for competition with strategies as well as facts, she said.
 ''Anticipate, don't hesitate,'' she advises. ''If you think you know it, buzz.'' 
 Mike Chen, 17, the Quiz Bowl and ''Long Island Challenge'' team captain, said he had learned that a big part of succeeding at such competitions was ''not the knowledge but the confidence and the aggression.'' 
 ''It's better to try,'' he said, ''than to let the other team get it.''

HEADLINE: An Affair to Remember

BYLINE: By Gerald Eskenazi. 
Gerald Eskenazi is the author, most recently, of ''I Hid It Under the Sheets: Growing Up With Radio.''

 BODY:
I DON'T claim that my recent letter to William Clay Ford Jr. -- a cri de coeur about my problematic Jaguar -- led to his giving up the chief executive's post at his family's car company. But it certainly was part of his problem. You see, rising on my 70th birthday, I thought: Does my car define me? I knew the answer.
 Unfortunately, I had fallen in love with my Jaguar -- and therein lies a cautionary tale, in which I learned the economic lesson of sunk costs and suffered the same ego-deflation as the smarties who held on to their tech stocks because, once, they had been so fine. 
It was such a sleek beauty when I bought it, just before the millennium, that even the guy pumping gas in Williston Park, not far from where I lived, admired it. A woman once stopped me outside of the Bronx Zoo, told me to roll down my window and complimented the look of the thing.
 I was convinced that taxi drivers -- in New York City! -- gave me the right of way, that pedestrians waited for the ''walk'' sign. In fact, I even told friends how driving the Jaguar made me a better person. My wife thought I was batty.
 Even while I was basking in the glow of the shiny hood ornament, with its leaping cat, I overlooked the three times the car was towed for overheating, for simply dying, for being too complex. I dismissed the fact that eight times I brought in the car because the sun roof wouldn't open, or the ''turn off engine'' light went on or the trunk seemed soldered shut. After all, it was under an extended warranty. But that came to an end after a few years. 
 In the meantime, I had been seduced by the sleek lines, the cachet, and so what that both times the hood ornament was stolen on Manhattan streets, where I had eschewed the safety of my Long Island garage to visit friends, it cost me $275? This was, after all, a Jaguar XJ8, the kind of car you see in a cortege escorting Queen Elizabeth, the kind of car that impressed even the president of the Jets football team, who said to me, ''You're doing pretty well, huh?'' -- as if I were one of his $2 million-a-year defensive tackles.
 So I threw in a few thousand dollars after a harrowing trip from Baltimore spent mostly in the service lane of the Jersey Turnpike, so I could manage the overheating instead of worrying about stop-and-go traffic. A radiator? What car needs a new radiator these days? And when the machine started to putt-putt after I bought gas, I thought I had been sold dirty fuel. Instead, another couple of thousand went for a new transmission.
 The yearly inspection? Another $1,600 because well, I never quite figured out why. How about $500 for the 10,000-mile check-up?
 You have to understand that never in my life had I owned something that could be considered luxurious. Indeed, when I bought the Jaguar in 1998, my other car was a Saturn.
 But in my business -- I was a sportswriter with this paper for decades, beginning in 1959 -- I have had the opportunity to be among the haves, and sometimes to share vicariously in the good life with the likes of Alfred Vanderbilt, Donald Trump and Leon Hess (who owned those immaculate gas stations as well as the Jets football team).
 Even when I visited my upscale cousin (he's a psychiatrist) in Westport, Conn., just down the road from Paul Newman's place, I felt I belonged. 
 Thus, I shelled out $1,694 to stop the Jag from having the hiccups. That last check got to me. It led to my whiney letter to the head of Ford, Jaguar's parent company. I told him how the car had broken my heart, how it squawked and sputtered. Honestly, I don't know what I wanted him to say. Maybe to tell me, ''I feel your pain.''
 No response. For no sooner did Ford get my letter than he stepped down as the No. 1 man at his eponymous place of business. I was on my own again.
 And then on that fateful day when I woke up, wondering whether this car defined me, I put it out on eBay. Not a nibble. I went to a Jaguar dealer. He offered me $1,000. Shocked, I refused, and decided to trade it in. I read about the most practical cars, and my practical cousin (he's a financier now, but started out driving a laundry truck) from Hastings-on-Hudson took me to a Westchester Lexus dealer and hooked me up with a handsome car that works. Perhaps sensing my pain, the dealer gave me $3,000 for the Jag.
 You know, selling the Jaguar has made me a better person.
 But it took an epiphany, which finally brought into focus the thousands I had squandered.

HEADLINE: Dead in Our Backyard

 BODY:
At sunrise one week ago, Orlando Moreno was freshly dead, a corpse wrapped in rags and filthy clothes and laid out on a mattress resting on a slab of ice and frozen dirt. He died at home. Home was a tent in a dense patch of woods in Huntington Station, a few yards from a park, baseball fields, a lumber yard and a big Long Island Rail Road station, where thousands of white-collar commuters wait every weekday morning with coffee and newspapers for the hourlong ride to Manhattan. 
 The cause was not immediately clear, but the circumstances surrounding the death made it seem not too reckless to guess. The overnight low was 18 degrees. He had been drinking alcohol, which can greatly increase the likelihood of freezing to death, although an early autopsy report, strangely, did not list hypothermia as a factor. 
He was only 22, an immigrant from Honduras, without a real home or a steady job. He had not been well. Someone who knew of his case said he had been beaten badly, had been in the hospital for weeks last year and never fully recovered. Others said he medicated his troubles with liquor but did not take the medication he had been given after his injuries. He had family here, including a younger brother with a wife and a baby boy and a home in Huntington Station, but for reasons that were unclear Mr. Moreno would not or could not stay with relatives on the frigid last night of his life. 
 He missed a few other chances for a warm bed that Saturday night. A volunteer organization that had helped him before sent a van by the woods twice that evening, picking up eight other homeless Latino men and taking them to sleep in a nearby church basement. The van driver never encountered Mr. Moreno, who stayed in the tent with another man, one of several who tried and tried to wake him up on Sunday morning. The Suffolk County Department of Social Services said it would have found Mr. Moreno a bed -- it had many vacancies that night -- but he never called. The Suffolk police make it a practice to give people who appear to be homeless the number for social services, especially when the weather is bitter and it is dangerous to be on the street. But Mr. Moreno was not on the street, he was in the woods, and there is no evidence that anyone except his homeless comrades ever saw him. 
 Not many hearts have stirred for the dead Mr. Moreno. His family, of course, is mourning and planning a funeral, making arrangements to send his body home. The volunteers who run the shoestring program for the homeless in Huntington are not going to say much. They do their charity work with almost fearful discretion, because they know that if too many people learn that homeless men are finding shelter in their Long Island neighborhoods -- in their churches, no less -- great passions will be aroused, and those passions will not be charitable. 
 Suffolk County officials are making no apologies for Mr. Moreno's death, and it is hard to see, at this point, exactly why they should. Homeless people always die in winter, especially those who lack the will or wherewithal to find help. 
 But still, the unnecessary death of a young man cannot but provoke sorrow and frustration. The question is where to direct it -- at an economic system that lures poor immigrants across our borders but offers them no way to find a legal footing, and expects them to live and die in the shadows? At a Long Island housing market that has no rental units any ordinary person can afford? At a community that can tolerate 21st-century Hoovervilles within arm's reach of garish suburban affluence? 
 Some may be tempted simply to blame Mr. Moreno for thinking he could find a better life here. But given the absence of an obvious target of blame, still others of us -- the vast majority, probably -- may be inclined simply to forget about it and move on.

HEADLINE: What Works in State Government

 BODY:
One of the more important hearings of this legislative session occurred Feb. 13, but only about a dozen people attended. It took place before a legislative subcommittee that is taking baby steps toward making the state government justify how and why it is spending our money. This process has the eye-glazing name of ''results-based accountability,'' but forget labels; it's one of the few serious attempts that has taken place in years to bring scrutiny, not to mention sanity, to the budget process. 
 Most people run their household budgets by, at minimum, trying to avoid wasting money. But state government isn't like that. Sometimes hearings in the General Assembly will spotlight certain programs that are succeeding or failing, but those are rarities. Connecticut's money management involves line-item budgeting. Most expenditures in the state budget are approved with a few percentage points added for inflation. The system does not keep track of money, rarely measures performance and, too often, rewards failure. 
But change is in the air. Last year, the legislature started a pilot project on results-based accountability. This year the House speaker, James Amann, made it a subcommittee under the Joint Committee on Appropriations. The subcommittee could not tackle the entire budget, so it picked a few areas to examine, among them early childhood programs for children from birth to 5 years of age. The Department of Environmental Protection, to its credit, volunteered for scrutiny of its stewardship of Long Island Sound. 
 The chairwoman of the subcommittee, Representative Diana Urban, a Democrat who is also an economist, set forth questions concerning goals, how much money is spent in pursuit of them, and how success or failure is measured. She also asked for low-cost or no-cost alternatives to achieving the goals. The basic question is simple: What works?
 The answers were revealing. First, the state spends $533 million on birth-to-5 programs, most of it on preparing children for school. The money is scattered across at least seven agencies, and there is little (and in some cases no) data on how effective it is. Making one agency responsible for administering this money would go a long way toward helping the effort succeed. 
 The D.E.P.'s testimony raised different issues. Asked to measure its performance against the goal of a clean Long Island Sound, the agency said that by several measures the Sound was becoming more polluted, a consequence of cuts in the state's Clean Water Fund. Proposed increases in the governor's budget should help matters. The agency has also suggested a public education campaign to help people lessen their use of fertilizer, to reduce the runoff flowing into the Sound. But scrutiny revealed that two-thirds of the department's budget comes from hunters, fishermen, state parks and federal funds. It is extremely vulnerable to fluctuations in funding that have occurred in recent years, something few lawmakers were aware of until the hearing. 
 No one expects the legislature to obtain this level of detail from all state agencies -- yet. But the effort is already making waves. ''We want to turn the budget on its head,'' said the Appropriations chairwoman, Representative Denise Merrill, a Democrat. If she had her way, she said, each agency would put on one sheet of paper its goals and proof that what it is doing works. That will not happen this year, or the next. But more accountability is welcome -- and overdue.

HEADLINE: A Whole New Ballgame for Blomberg

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Starting a new career is difficult enough, but doing it without the staples of one's life? That may be asking too much.
 ''They have to have pastrami, corned beef and brisket,'' Ron Blomberg said. ''A guy I talked to said they don't have it over there. He said bagels aren't the same as in America. Does that mean I'm going to have to FedEx all my food from America? That's the only way I'd eat.''
Blomberg, whose claim to fame besides eating is that he was the major leagues' first designated hitter in 1973, was thinking ahead to his first job as manager of a baseball team. In June he will manage the Bet Shemesh Blue Sox in the inaugural season of the Israel Baseball League.
 Blomberg, Art Shamsky and Ken Holtzman, all former major leaguers, will be unveiled today at a news conference in Manhattan as half of the managers in Israel's first professional baseball league. The 45-game season is scheduled to open June 24. 
 ''Look at who they're bringing in,'' Blomberg said. ''They're bringing in three Jews to be coaches. Is it going to work? I think it's going to take time. In America, soccer isn't a big deal other than high schools and colleges. I think this will be the same thing. They have soccer and basketball and now baseball.''
 With a large American population in Israel, Blomberg will probably be a central figure among the league's personnel. The town whose team he will manage has a particularly sizable population of former residents of New Jersey and New York, and many remember Blomberg as a popular member of mediocre Yankees teams in the early 1970s. 
 He has basically been out of baseball since 1978, but he has remained a familiar figure to many fans.
 ''I do a lot of Yankee fantasy camps and corporate speaking,'' Blomberg said. ''I still do a lot of bar mitzvahs and speaking for Jewish organizations.''
 Blomberg, 58, said the number of speaking engagements had risen since the publication last year of his book, ''Designated Hebrew.'' 
 ''I'm in the process now of writing a baseball cookbook,'' he added. 
 That's not surprising for a man who has always liked to eat. His feats in that regard were so prodigious that the Stage Deli in Manhattan recognized him in retirement last year by bringing back a sandwich named for him: the Ron Blomberg, a triple-decker combination of corned beef, pastrami and chopped liver, with a Bermuda onion. 
 ''He's one of our treasured customers,'' said Barry Orenstein, the Stage manager. ''He's a friend of the store. Whenever he's in New York, he frequents us. We had his book signing here last year. He loves matzo ball soup and the food here.''
 Blomberg continues to like baseball, too, although he hasn't had much contact with it.
 ''I do a little bit of scouting for the Yankees,'' he said. ''I do high school games and college games in Atlanta. I have been offered some baseball coaching jobs, but the only way I would go back into baseball is basically with the Yankees.'' 
 Blomberg, who continues to have a mutual love affair with New York fans, has appeared at Yankees Old-Timers' Days and recalled one game in particular.
 ''Four years ago I hit a home run off Mike Torrez into the upper deck,'' he said. ''I said that's great. But I can't do it anymore. Now I can't see the ball. It's blurry. Balls that come at 30 miles an hour look like 100. At a fantasy camp last November, I had a camper throw me a 30-mile-an-hour fastball and I struck out.''
 Blomberg said that his knees and shoulders were bad, too, but that they wouldn't interfere with his initial attempt at managing.
 ''I can coach, I can motivate people,'' he said. ''I still know the game of baseball. The game of baseball is scoring more runs than the other team. The game of baseball is pitching.'' 
 Blomberg has never been to Israel. He recalled that when he was playing for the Yankees, he was invited to visit by Golda Meir, the prime minister, and Moshe Dayan, the defense minister.
 ''It's a good way to go to Israel,'' he said of his new job. ''It's a good way to see where the world started. When I was growing up, I planted trees in Israel for $1. I can go see the trees I planted.''
 Blomberg referred to a program started years ago by the Jewish National Fund in which schoolchildren planted trees in Israel. Now Blomberg hopes to be a part of helping baseball grow in Israel.A Lineup of Support
 Commissioner Bud Selig, who with his wife, Sue, is a major contributor to Israeli institutions; Wendy Selig-Prieb, his daughter and the former chief executive of the Milwaukee Brewers; and Randy Levine, the president of the Yankees, are serving on the advisory board of the Israeli league.
 Daniel Kurtzer, the former United States ambassador to Egypt and Israel, is the league's commissioner, and Dan Duquette, the former general manager of the Montreal Expos and the Boston Red Sox, is the baseball operations director.
 The six teams will be the Bet Shemesh Blue Sox, the Modi'in Miracle, the Tel Aviv Lightning, the Ra'anana Express, the Netanya Tigers and the Petach Tikva Pioneers.Soriano Front and Center
 After Alfonso Soriano resisted moving to left field from second base a year ago, the Chicago Cubs are making him a center fielder. It's a brave or a foolish thing to do, a plan that could give Lou Piniella, the Cubs' new manager, stomach pains.
 ''He's a talented young man,'' said Frank Robinson, Soriano's former manager, starting kindly. ''He works hard. If he's willing to do it, he has a chance. But I think they're putting a big burden on him. He was just starting to get the hang of left, and he had a long way to go.''
 Last spring was a trying one for Robinson and Soriano. Then the manager of the Washington Nationals, Robinson wanted Soriano to switch to left field because he had a second baseman, Jose Vidro. Soriano refused, saying he was a second baseman. Then he changed his mind, although he didn't explain why.
 ''I talked to him, Jim Bowden talked to him,'' Robinson said, referring to the general manager. ''I didn't put any pressure on him. When he decided to come back the next day, he put all that stuff behind him, went out to left field and worked hard.''
 Assessing Soriano as a left fielder, Robinson said, ''He was below average when he started out there, got better as the season went on and was average by the end of the season.''
 Soriano benefited from the move, signing with the Cubs for eight years and $136 million. ''Wow,'' Robinson said when the figures were mentioned. ''I guess he did.''
 Asked his view of Soriano as a center fielder, Robinson said: ''We had a chance to try him in center, but we thought that was too much of a burden on him. We wanted him to focus on left field and we never thought of putting him in center.''
 But, Robinson added: ''If hard work and a willingness to try it mean anything, he'll be all right. He'll work hard at it and give it a good shot and do the best he can out there. He's a good kid.''Rodriguez's Opt-Out Clause
 The recent talk about the opt-out clause in Alex Rodriguez's contract prompted a theory on why the clause was put in the contract. 
 As rich as the contract is, a record $252 million over all and salaries of $27 million in each of the final three years, there is no need for Rodriguez to walk away from the contract after its seventh season for economic reasons. But had Rodriguez stayed with Texas for the first seven years, the opt-out clause might have served as a way for him to go where he really wanted to go six years ago.
 The Mets were Rodriguez's first love, but Steve Phillips, then the Mets' general manager, shattered that desire by recoiling at the initial asking price uttered by Scott Boras, Rodriguez's agent, and running as fast as he could in the opposite direction.
 By having the opt-out clause, Rodriguez, now 31, preserved his ability to go to the Mets while he was still young enough to make a difference and to give the Mets a chance to make up for the mistake they made in December 2000.
 There are still some who say that if the Mets had conducted themselves in a more professional and capable manner at that time and made a counteroffer, they might have secured Rodriguez, then a shortstop, for a lot less than $252 million. 
 If that had happened, New York would have spent the past six years comparing Rodriguez's Mets with Derek Jeter's Yankees and not the past three years gossiping about the relationship between the players.

HEADLINE: Quinn Is at the Combine but Is Not in the Combine

BYLINE: By KAREN CROUSE

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, Feb. 24 

 BODY:
Brady Quinn, the former Notre Dame quarterback, has come to the N.F.L. scouting combine to patch the leak in his reputation, a chore complicated because he cannot figure out what is causing it. 
 For much of his senior season, Quinn was considered a lock to be the No. 1 pick in the 2007 draft, but his prospects have been downgraded since he threw his last pass in a losing effort against Louisiana State in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 3.
 He is now hearing that he may not even be the first quarterback chosen, that Louisiana State's JaMarcus Russell, a junior, could go to the Oakland Raiders, who have the first pick, and that Quinn could fall to the Miami Dolphins at No. 9 or tumble out of the top 10. 
 ''Quinn is not the talk of the draft,'' Mel Kiper Jr., the ESPN draft expert, said this week in a teleconference. ''In fact, he's lost momentum, so if he goes ninth, I think he should be happy.'' 
 How can that be, Quinn wonders, when he is training harder than ever? He spent the past month at Athletes' Performance, a workout facility in Tempe, Ariz., developing everything from the largest muscles in his legs to the smallest muscles in his eyes, hoping to prove himself worthy of being the top pick. 
 ''It's kind of hard for a guy to slip when we haven't done anything,'' he said, meaning on the football field. ''It's funny to sit back and hear some of that, and you're thinking: 'Man, did I not, like, lift today? Did somebody see me in the weight room miss a rep?' I'm kind of confused.''
 Does this sound familiar? A year ago, a can't-miss quarterback from another prestigious program saw his value dip in the weeks before the draft. Like Quinn, Matt Leinart of Southern California went from being the sure No. 1 pick to a speculative top-10 investment.
 Reached by telephone Friday, Leinart, who was drafted 10th by the Arizona Cardinals and went on to start 11 games as a rookie, said: ''I've read where Brady Quinn's being called this year's Matt Leinart. You know, it's so stupid to me because he's a proven winner. He's been on national TV week in and week out; he's put up great numbers; he's had a great coach in Charlie Weis.'' 
 A four-year starter at Notre Dame, Quinn threw for 11,762 yards and 95 touchdowns. As a junior in 2005, he nearly pulled off an upset of Leinart's top-ranked and undefeated Trojans, capping an 87-yard drive late in the fourth quarter with a 5-yard scoring run to give Notre Dame a 3-point lead. It might have gone down as Quinn's signature game if Leinart had not turned it into his own by marching the Trojans down the field and scoring the winning points on a 1-yard run with three seconds left. 
 Quinn was clutch that day, but that is a faded memory. What sticks in people's minds are the final two games of his senior season, one-sided losses to U.S.C. and L.S.U. in which he completed 37 of 80 passes and threw many of them with his weight on his back foot.
 It came out later that Quinn was playing on one good leg, having sustained a minor knee injury on a scramble against U.S.C. that he reinjured against L.S.U. After completing 15 of 32 passes for 148 yards in the Irish's 41-14 loss to the Tigers, Brady traveled to Birmingham, Ala., to consult with the noted orthopedic surgeon James Andrews. 
 Quinn skipped the Senior Bowl last month on the advice of Andrews, who, he said, ''advised me to pretty much take my time and make sure I was healed before I did any running, testing, things of that matter.'' 
 The knee, Quinn said, ''is doing well; it's coming along.'' 
 He will not throw or run this weekend, having decided to wait until next month's two pro days on the Notre Dame campus to perform the physical drills. He came to the combine for the psychological testing and team interviews. 
 Quinn handled the news media part of the combine with aplomb, answering questions in a storytelling voice, his hand gestures and facial expressions calling to mind a charades player. He relayed a conversation he had had the night before with A. J. Hawk, his brother-in-law and a linebacker who was a rookie last season with the Green Bay Packers. 
 Hawk was filling Quinn in on what to expect. ''He said make sure you get a couple of good curls in and ask them to measure your biceps and announce it,'' Quinn said. ''I kind of sat back and said: 'Really? They measure your biceps?' I'm sitting there thinking for a second what I'm going to do. Should I get all pumped up before I get up there? He just started laughing and said, 'No, just kidding.' '' 
 Quinn, who was measured at 6 feet 3 1/2 inches and 232 pounds, grew up in Dublin, Ohio, not far from Cleveland. The Browns have the third pick in the draft and no established starting quarterback. Quinn was scheduled to meet with team officials over the weekend during the speed-dating part of the combine. He said he could picture himself playing for Cleveland. 
 ''I think economically that would be a good situation right now with them drafting in the third spot.'' Quinn said. ''But I'm not biased toward any team. Whatever team I go to play for, I'm going to be happy to play for.'' 
 Quinn was asked what he would say to a general manager who asked why he deserved be a top-three pick. 
 ''I'd tell him I'm the most prepared collegiate player for the N.F.L. in the draft,'' he said, sounding more earnest than arrogant. ''There's not one other player that's had the kind of coaching that I've had the past couple of years. There's not one other player that's done what I've done the past couple of years.''

HEADLINE: Rivals on Legal Tightrope Seek To Expand Freedoms in China

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
Li Jinsong and Li Jianqiang are Chinese trial lawyers who take on difficult political cases, tangle with the police and seek solace in the same religion, Christianity.
 But like many who devote themselves to expanding freedoms and the rule of law in China, the two spend as much time clashing over tactics and principles as they do challenging the ruling Communist Party.
The two Mr. Lis are part of a momentous struggle over the rule of law in China. Young, well educated and idealistic, they and other members of the so-called weiquan, or rights defense, movement, aim to use the laws and courts that the Communist Party has put in place as part of its modernization drive to constrain the party's power.
 The informal network of rights defenders may be the only visible force for political openness and change in China at a time when the surging economy and the country's rapidly expanding global influence have otherwise strengthened party leaders. The authorities have refrained from suppressing it entirely, at least partly because it operates carefully within the law and uses China's judicial system, as well as the news media, to advance its aims. 
 Yet nearly 18 years after the June 4, 1989, crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing, China quickly crushes any organized opposition. Rights defenders face the delicate task of coordinating their actions and expanding their collective influence when they remain autonomous, rudderless and, very often, rivalrous.
 The two Mr. Lis have feuded about how to handle big court cases. When they met the Bush administration's China specialists in the White House last November, they argued about whether top leaders like President Hu Jintao were basically benevolent. A joint interview on Radio Free Asia devolved into a shouting match over whether rights defenders could work with party leaders or should actively oppose them.
 As their confrontation grew, Li Jianqiang, the more combative of the two, wrote a manifesto that called China a ''super jail'' and described its leaders as ''ruthless dictators.'' He listed Li Jinsong's name as the lead author and posted it on the Internet.
 Li Jinsong, who takes a much softer line, said the essay, which circulated widely, so enraged China's top leaders that it derailed a major appeals court victory in his highest-profile case, involving China's ''barefoot lawyer,'' Chen Guangcheng. The essay may also have given the police in Shandong Province an excuse to send some thugs who assaulted him, he said. Li Jianqiang acknowledged a few weeks later that he wrote the essay himself. But he said it amounted to a minor mistake and dismissed claims that it had a direct impact on the court case.
 They and the dozens of other advocates who consider themselves rights defenders have had notable victories, mostly by calling attention to problems at the local level that more senior officials move to fix. They have exposed corruption, illegal land seizures and labor and environmental abuses that have prompted policy changes or at least made many Chinese more aware of the concept of human rights. 
 As China's only consistent homegrown critics of government abuses, they have received attention from the international news media and human rights groups. President Bush invited several rights defenders to the White House last spring.
 Yet they are, as the nationalist leader Sun Yat-sen lamented about Chinese opposition groups in an earlier era, ''grains of sand.'' They divide into camps on the fundamental question of whether to try to improve the current Communist Party-run system by supporting well-intentioned party leaders, or to seek an end to Communist rule. ''Some of us are waiting for a good emperor, some kind of Gorbachev, to come and fix the system,'' Li Jianqiang said. ''Many of the rest of us think that is a waste of time. We need to be building a civilization outside the Communist Party.''Change From Within
 That debate is a delicate one for a group whose basic goals -- helping people exercise the rights granted to them, at least on paper, by an authoritarian government -- at least nominally overlap with those of the party's leadership.
 China's top leaders, committed to attracting foreign investment and making the country a respected world power, have promised to conform to human rights norms and to run the country ''according to law.''
 The Communist Party often does not subject itself to the laws it enacts, prompting cynicism about its real intentions. But many rights defenders say they can help bring about meaningful change because the party and government bureaucracy is not monolithic.
 Top party leaders, according to this way of thinking, hope to use the legal system and the news media to check abuses of power at the local level, which they view as threats to their own popularity and longevity.
 The defining moment came in 2003. Prime Minister Wen Jiabao seized on a case of a migrant worker beaten to death by the police that had been championed by rights defenders. He abolished vagrancy laws that gave the police the authority to round up migrants at will.
 Rights defenders concluded that grass-roots organizing and the tactical use of local courts could allow them to circumvent local fiefs in China's authoritarian bureaucracy and appeal directly to more enlightened leaders at the top.
 ''China is slowly transforming itself from rule of man to rule of law,'' Li Jinsong said. ''I believe that this process has the support of the top leaders. They face resistance within the system, and they need outside help.''
 But this view, once widespread, has fallen out of favor among other rights defenders. Li Jianqiang calls it a ''peasant mentality'' because farmers since feudal times have looked to the emperor, presumed to be benevolent, to solve problems they say are caused by venal local officials.
 He contends that President Hu, who once talked as though he wanted to expand constitutional rights and strengthen the legal system, has more recently done the reverse. 
 In internal party speeches, Mr. Hu has called on officials to guard against ''color revolutions'' of the kind that swept Central Asia and Central Europe, which officials here attributed to a potent combination of civic and social organizations and foreign forces. Mr. Hu has clamped down on lawyers and journalists and tightened the party's control over the courts. 
 Gao Zhisheng, one of the most outspoken rights defenders, was arrested and convicted of subversion last year, though he was given a suspended sentence because the authorities said he provided information about other dissidents. Another rights defender, Guo Feixiong, was arrested and faces charges of illegal business activity. A third, Guo Guoting, fearing police intimidation or possible prosecution, fled to Canada.
 ''The strategy of submitting petitions and using legal actions to draw the emperor's attention is a proven failure,'' Li Jianqiang said. ''It ends up encouraging rule by man, not rule of law.''Same Name, Two Paths
 Li Jinsong and Li Jianqiang became lawyers in 1994. Both are Christians. The similarities do not run much deeper.
 Li Jianqiang, 42, lives in the east coast city of Qingdao. He eagerly discusses politics and the law. He relates his run-ins with China's police or State Security officials like war stories. He has an impish smile. 
 As an employee of the Qingdao city government, he joined public protests in favor of democracy in 1989. When the military shot student protesters in Beijing on June 4, 1989, local governments moved to weed out people who had supported the students. Mr. Li lost his job.
 He returned to school to study law, but never shed his reputation as a troublemaker. He took on cases involving accusations of police or government malfeasance, but he said he was often harassed by local authorities. Increasingly, he found it difficult to represent clients in his home province, Shandong.
 So he became itinerant. He defended a journalist accused of leaking state secrets in Hunan Province and a writer accused of posting subversive materials on the Internet in Hubei Province. Recently, he sued local authorities in Zhejiang Province after they demolished a Christian church that the government had not sanctioned.
 He met other young lawyers who called themselves rights defenders. He became a Christian in 2005, he said, when some of them introduced him to the religion. He worships in an unofficial ''family'' church in Qingdao.
 ''I decided we have a spiritual vacuum in our society that only God can replace,'' he said. 
 Li Jinsong, 41, practices law in Beijing. He often wears dark business suits over dark shirts. That, along with a courteous and deferential manner, gives him the air of a priest. But he frowns and speaks in clipped phrases when asked to discuss his personal background, including his religion. He said he began attending a government-authorized Protestant church in 1988.
 ''It's not something I deny, but not something I like to talk about publicly,'' he said softly.
 Though he practices commercial law, he has also defended ''vulnerable people,'' as he calls them. He helped migrant workers force a transportation company to stop raising ticket prices before a major holiday, when migrants scramble to return to their hometowns in the countryside. A Beijing court compelled the Finance Ministry to revise an administrative ruling against one of his clients in 2001, a milestone case that some saw as confirming a right to sue government entities.
 But it was a case in Li Jianqiang's home province, Shandong, that made Li Jinsong well known in legal circles. He became the lead lawyer for Chen Guangcheng, a self-trained legal expert who, despite being blind since a childhood illness, championed peasants in legal actions against local authorities.
 In 2005, Mr. Chen sought to organize a class-action lawsuit on behalf of hundreds of peasants forced to have abortions or undergo sterilization procedures after local officials in Linyi City, Shandong, failed to meet their official population-control quotas. The police put him under house arrest, and prosecutors later indicted him on charges of destroying property and disrupting traffic. Relatives and supporters say the charges were concocted to punish him.
 Li Jinsong and other rights defenders used a publicity campaign to increase the pressure on local officials to treat Mr. Chen fairly, while alerting top leaders in Beijing to what they and many others said was an embarrassing abuse of authority at the local level. 
 Li Jianqiang, though not personally involved, criticized the strategy at the time. He wrote in an open letter that Li Jinsong had made ''stupid mistakes'' that backed the local authorities into a corner and did little to help Mr. Chen.
 Both men, it appeared, had reasons to think they were right. Mr. Chen's prosecution and trial, in a county court, made a mockery of China's official judicial procedures. Local thugs prevented Li Jinsong from entering Mr. Chen's village to interview witnesses. They flipped over his car when he visited. The day before the trial, the local police detained a fellow lawyer on a pretense. The verdict: guilty, and a harsh prison sentence of four years and three months for Mr. Chen.
 Li Jinsong's luck changed sharply on appeal. Last October, a higher court in the city of Linyi overturned the verdict and ordered a new trial. Mr. Li and other rights defenders hailed it as a major victory. They saw the hand of more senior officials at work.
 ''There are some leaders who I believe are conscious of what was happening and wanted to see a fair result,'' he said. ''We saw their intervention in this case.''A Visit to America
 China's rights defenders have developed a reputation for being a force for legal, evolutionary change. In the United States, foundations and religious groups that support grass-roots activities here have backed them.
 One pioneer in that effort is the China Aid Association, a religious group based in Midland, Tex., that has ties to the Bush administration. The association monitors conditions for Christians and supports rights defenders, many of whom are Christian. 
 Last November, the China Aid Association invited the two Mr. Lis and two other rights defenders to visit Midland and Washington. The two did not know each other well. Li Jianqiang's criticism of the handling of the Chen case did not endear them to each other. But Li Jinsong said he looked forward to the trip.
 ''I thought we might come to understand each other better if we met outside China,'' he said.
 Instead, their debate intensified. After prayer sessions in Midland, in the offices of members of Congress and at foundations where they meet potential donors, the two Mr. Lis offered conflicting versions of what should be done to advance the rule of law in China. They disagreed on whether the United States should encourage political change or support top leaders who wanted to carry out such changes.
 Li Jinsong, still elated about the appeals court victory in Mr. Chen's case the month before, often cited the case to support his view that the top leaders had good intentions.
 Though the two lawyers smiled and stood side by side for photographs in front of the White House and State Department, they said they argued with each other when they met the Bush administration's China experts inside. When they appeared together for a broadcast on Radio Free Asia, their differences burst into the open.
 Li Jinsong said during the broadcast that he had urged donors and Bush administration officials to steer aid to Communist Party officials ''who do good,'' as well as to rights defenders hoping to improve things from the outside. 
 He said he wanted ''to express my appreciation'' for President Hu, Prime Minister Wen and Vice President Zeng Qinghong. 
 ''These three leaders do not want to see abuses and would not tolerate them if they knew about them,'' he said.
 Li Jianqiang said he and Li Jinsong had a ''basic disagreement.'' Top leaders, he said, have more responsibility, not less, for human rights abuses.
 He said that during the 1990s, when President Jiang Zemin was in power, there were relatively few arrests of dissident writers. Today, with Mr. Hu in charge, there are many more, he said.
 ''There are a larger than usual number of unjust arrests,'' Li Jinsong acknowledged. ''But I am sure that if the top leaders knew about them, the people would be set free.''
 ''That is nonsense,'' Li Jianqiang responded. ''The leaders play deaf and dumb and pretend they have a real legal system.''A Prayer for China
 After their meetings in Washington, Li Jinsong got the news that Chen Guangcheng's second trial, as ordered by the appeals court, would convene in a few days. He had to cut his trip short and catch the first flight home.
 Just after he departed, Li Jianqiang, who stayed on in the United States, wrote an essay he titled ''A Prayer for China.'' It said, in part, ''In this free, God-blessed land, where we received a friendly reception by the American government, we must not forget our pitiable homeland.''
 He said China would not have a better future without ''systemic change'' in politics and culture. ''Our government clasps chains on the people and enslaves them. In our one-party dictatorship, the law is little more than an ornament, and the rights in the Constitution are laughable lies.''
 On Nov. 27, the same day Mr. Chen's second trial took place in Shandong, Li Jianqiang posted the letter on a popular overseas Web site. The names of the four rights defenders on the trip were listed at the bottom. Li Jinsong's came first. 
 Under pressure a month later, Li Jianqiang wrote a second letter, which he also posted online, saying he made a mistake listing Li Jinsong's name. Li Jinsong said the damage was done.
 Mr. Chen's second trial was only slightly less of a mockery than the first, in the eyes of Mr. Chen's supporters. A crucial witness, who Mr. Li said was prepared to testify to providing false evidence against Mr. Chen after the police tortured him, was arrested on the eve of the trial. Three days later, the court issued the same verdict it had in the first trial, sentencing Mr. Chen to four years and three months in prison.
 Li Jinsong and several other supporters of Mr. Chen say Li Jianqiang's essay may have hurt Mr. Chen's chances of a favorable verdict. Officials in Shandong used the essay to claim that Mr. Chen's supporters had been infiltrated by foreign forces seeking to undermine the Communist Party, they said.
 A senior law professor and government adviser in Beijing, who is not connected to the Chen case, said he attended a meeting shortly after Mr. Chen's second trial in which top judicial officials, including Luo Gan, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee who oversees the judicial system, discussed the case. It was cited as an example of how ''hostile forces'' had used the courts to provoke social unrest, said the law professor, who asked not to be identified because the meeting was secret. 
 ''We had hoped the second trial would be a fair trial,'' Li Jinsong said. ''But the essay undercut those who wanted such a result.''
 Li Jianqiang acknowledges that the essay was his attempt to signal a common stance among rights defenders where none existed. But he said it could not have had the impact Li Jinsong claimed. Having been posted online the same day the trial took place, it could hardly have influenced the trial itself, he said. And he said he considered it unlikely that it prompted central government leaders to dictate a different verdict.
 ''In our system, the decision to convict is made before the trial, not after,'' he said.
 Instrumental or not, the letter shows how the rights defense movement is struggling to maintain a sense of purpose amid an intensifying police crackdown and a string of public defeats. 
 In late December, Li Jinsong traveled to Shandong to prepare another appeal. He never reached his destination.
 After entering the province, his overnight bus from Beijing was stopped on a public highway and boarded by thugs. They singled out Mr. Li and a colleague, dragged them from the bus and rained blows on their heads and bodies. They left them bloodied on the sidewalk and sped off.
 Li Jinsong was treated for minor injuries. He said the local police ignored his attempt to file a complaint.
 Mr. Li debated with friends whether he should try to return to Shandong to attend the appeal hearing. In the end, he did not have to decide. The judges met privately, with no lawyers present. This time, they backed the local court, sending Mr. Chen to prison.

HEADLINE: In the Stent Era, Heart Bypasses Get a New Look

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
After more than a decade-long decline, is heart bypass surgery poised for a comeback? 
 Some doctors say it may be time to give bypass operations a second look. They include even some cardiologists who specialize in the far more popular alternative -- using stents to keep coronary arteries open.
No one is predicting a sudden surge back to bypass, which is still a far more invasive and initially riskier way to treat plaque-clogged heart arteries, a condition that afflicts millions of Americans. 
 But in light of new safety concerns over the long-term risks of stents, as well as accumulating data indicating that the sickest heart patients may live longer if they receive bypass surgery instead, some well-known stent specialists say the pendulum may have swung too far away from bypass surgery. 
 ''We as cardiologists have probably pressed forward on stent technology a little faster than we should have,'' said Dr. Kirk Garratt, the director of research into stents and related heart therapies at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, one of the nation's leading stenting centers.
 It is a remarkable acknowledgment, considering the medical and financial stakes in play. In the last decade, the number of bypass surgeries in this country has fallen by a third -- to about 365,000 last year. Meanwhile, the number of patients receiving stents has soared, to nearly a million in 2006. 
 To some extent, the stent preference has been propelled by patients themselves, who have an understandable aversion to major surgery. 
 ''Most of the time that I recommend bypass surgery, the patient begs me to put in stents instead,'' said Dr. Ralph Brindis, senior cardiovascular adviser for the network of Kaiser Permanente hospitals and clinics in Northern California.
 But stents are also big business, with powerful advocates like Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson, whose stent sales totaled about $2.9 billion last year. They, along with competitors trying to catch up, have invested heavily in expanding the use of stents. 
 And cardiologists, the specialists who are most likely to diagnose artery disease, are in many cases also the doctors who implant stents. Their judgment heavily influences which patients get referred to surgeons. 
 Meanwhile, as Medicare and other insurers have curbed their payments for bypass surgeries, the cost of stenting has risen with the introduction of newer devices. Surgery and stent procedures are now comparably priced for patients with multiple blockages -- an average of around $30,000, according to the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association. Both procedures are generally covered by insurers. 
 As a result of these forces, surgeons, once the kings of the cardiac ward, have seen their annual incomes dwindle. They averaged $425,000 last year, down from $1.02 million in 1990, after adjusting for inflation, according to John O. Goodman, a leading consultant to cardiovascular doctors.
 Meanwhile, Mr. Goodman said, the average income of an interventional cardiologist, as a stent specialist is known, has risen to $550,000 from an inflation-adjusted $392,000 in 1990. 
 But Mr. Goodman says he expects the number of bypass surgeries to begin rising this year, although he declines to forecast by how much.
 What has changed most recently in the stents-versus-surgery calculus is new evidence that surfaced in clinical trials last year. The data disclosed a previously undetected risk with stents, which are tiny mesh cylinders that are placed in arteries via filament-thin catheters threaded from a tiny incision in the thigh. 
 The new evidence showed that patients receiving the most popular form of stents -- ones coated with drugs to reduce the likelihood that the artery will close again -- have a slight risk of forming potentially fatal blood clots in the stents long after they have been implanted. 
 That changed the cost-benefit calculus of stents versus surgery in cases where patients have multiple blockages in two or more arteries or have other complications. 
 Bypass surgery is the recommended treatment for such patients, according to the guidelines of the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology. But some doctors say too many patients never hear about those recommendations from their cardiologists.
 A joint committee of the heart association and cardiology society expects to release new guidelines within the next month that could clarify the proper boundary between stenting and surgery, according to Dr. Sydney C. Smith Jr., the head of the committee.
 One controversial factor in such assessments is the accumulating data suggesting that surgery may help the sickest heart patients live longer.
 Studies tracking long-term results among patients around the nation have prompted some surgeons to argue that thousands of people with blockages in multiple arteries may be dying months or even years prematurely because they receive stents instead of surgery. 
 Dr. Robert A. Guyton, the chief of cardiothoracic surgery at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, argues that as many as 200,000 such patients who get stents each year should be having bypass surgery instead. He bases that conclusion on studies using data from nearly 40,000 patient cases in New England and New York and at Duke University.
 Stenting and bypass surgery are both meant to relieve symptoms like chest pain and shortness of breath, which are caused by a buildup of arterial plaque that may eventually lead to heart attacks and gradual heart failure.
 Neither stents nor bypass surgery can halt the buildup of plaque. But surgery, by bypassing an entire section of diseased artery with a vessel taken from elsewhere in the body, can restore more blood flow and the benefits may last longer. 
 And while bypass surgery still typically involves the trauma of sawing through the breastbone to open the chest, the operation is getting gentler. Blood vessels for grafting can be harvested from arms and legs through much smaller incisions than in the past, for example. 
 And about 20 percent of the operations no longer require stopping the heart and attaching patients to an external pump, thus eliminating a step believed to increase the risk of strokes in the sickest patients. Some bypasses now can even be performed using a robotic tool through small incisions between the ribs. 
 Most of the debate over stents versus surgery focuses on complex patients like Edgardo Hilario, 59, a Kmart shelf stocker from Spotswood, N.J. After he was hospitalized last fall with severe chest pain, his doctors found that he had four severe blockages in three arteries. 
 Mr. Hilario was operated on last month at St. Michael's Medical Center, a 337-bed teaching and referral hospital in Newark. 
 The chief of cardiac surgery there is Dr. Mark W. Connolly, a nationally known heart surgeon who was named physician of the year in 2006 by the American Heart Association. Well-regarded among stent specialists, he was invited to speak last fall at their national meeting. 
 Dr. Connolly, who says he has performed more than 4,000 bypass surgeries, operated on Mr. Hilario and another patient, Francisco Tobio, that day. Both patients probably would have received stents in many other hospitals. 
 In fact, Mr. Tobio had arrived at St. Michael's expecting to have a stent procedure performed by Dr. Fayez Shamoon, who had previously treated Mr. Tobio's wife. But the X-rays of Mr. Tobio's blockages led Dr. Shamoon to consult with Dr. Connolly, and the two doctors together advised him to have surgery instead. 
 ''Dr. Shamoon put three stents in my wife, so I trusted him,'' Mr. Tobio said.
 All hospitals expect both cardiologists and surgeons to consult withheart patients when the form of treatment is in question. But with few patients demanding the chance to talk to a surgeon, it is usually up to a cardiologist like Dr. Shamoon to initiate such a meeting. 
 How often that happens may depend on the degree of respect and collaboration between a hospital's cardiologists and surgeons, many doctors say. 
 Another factor, cardiologists say, is the unwillingness of some surgeons to take on complex cases, especially in states like New York and California that now report performance statistics for each doctor.
 ''They started sending cases back to us because of reporting,'' said Dr. Robert Jesse, the top cardiologist for the Veterans Health Administration.
 The data suggesting that patients may be suffering as a result of such trends is hardly ironclad. Little of it comes from randomized clinical trials, which are considered the highest level of evidence in medicine. Instead, the pro-bypass case rests mainly on data from registries that track long-term outcomes for every patient treated at a single major hospital or across large regions. 
 Such registries can offer a more accurate picture of how medicine is really practiced than clinical trials, which focus on preselected patients. But many researchers say that because registry data tends to be collected more haphazardly, it is better at identifying issues for further study than guiding medical practice. 
 Two major clinical trials now under way will try to directly compare stents and bypass surgery in patients with the most serious forms of artery disease. One trial, sponsored by Boston Scientific, randomly assigns 1,500 patients to either surgery or stenting. The other, sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, compares stenting to bypass surgery in diabetic patients with multiple coronary blockages.
 But the first results, which will come from the Boston Scientific trial, are not expected before the second half of next year. And those near-term results cannot be conclusive about the main stent safety issue now worrying doctors -- the long-term risk of potentially fatal blood clots. 
 Moreover, by the time the trials' longer-term results are available in 2012, they may have little applicability to medical practice at that time. 
 Despite the forces now favoring stents, Mr. Goodman, the consultant, says he expects the number of bypass surgeries to begin rising this year. Concerns about stent safety will play a role, he said, but another inducement will come from patients who received stents in recent years and now need follow-up care. 
 That is what happened to Joseph Gubernick, 72, the chief marketing officer for a division of the Estee Lauder Companies. 
 Mr. Gubernick had four bare-metal stents implanted in 2000 at Lenox Hill Hospital, after suffering a heart attack on a business trip to Japan. Last fall, when he began feeling symptoms he feared were signs of a new blockage, Mr. Gubernick called Dr. Connolly at St. Michael's.
 A St. Michael's cardiologist, Dr. Jonathan Goldstein, took X-ray images of the arteries, and told Mr. Gubernick, ''The time for stents is past.'' 
 Dr. Connolly did the bypass operation on Dec. 20.
 ''I'm back at work and feeling terrific,'' Mr. Gubernick said on Thursday.

(Photo by Emile Wamsteker for The New York Times)(pg. 20)Chart/Diagram: ''5 Questions for the Heart Doctor''Are stents or bypass surgery -- or no procedure at all -- the best course of action? Here are some of the questions medical experts say patients with coronary artery disease should ask their cardiologists.1. What is the latest medical thinking on what I can expect if I rely solely on drugs, a better diet and exercise to treat my condition?Patients who can put up with occasional chest pain or shortness of breath may be better off without surgery or stenting.2. Are my blockages just in one or two places or in numerous spots in my arteries?Surgery is more likely to be helpful if the blockages are in many locations.3. Do I have a blockage in my left main coronary artery or in my upper left anterior descending (LAD) artery that can be bypassed using a mammary artery?The left main and LAD are the heart's two most vital arteries. A mammary bypass, using a vessel already in the chest that does not have a life-critical function, is considered the most durable treatment for blockages in those arteries.4. Can some or all of my blockages be bypassed using robotic surgery?Where feasible, this option is much less invasive and leads to quicker recovery than standard bypasses.5. In my case, would stents be used in ways that have been approved by the F.D.A.?When stents are used in locations and contexts not explicitly approved by federal regulators, the risks may be higher than indicated by clinical trial data. And the placement of the stents may limit the type of repairs that could be made subsequently, if bypass surgery becomes necessary.

HEADLINE: Would You Like That in Tens, Twenties or Normans?

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

DATELINE: GREAT BARRINGTON, Mass. 

 BODY:
The scene could have been lifted from a caper movie:
 An old Volvo station wagon zooms through the southern Berkshire Hills. Its nervous driver pulls up in front of a bank. But instead of pulling off some heist, her gang begins hustling boxes of freshly minted currency in, not out.
 Once inside, they pause to admire the wads of tens, twenties and fifties. No $100 bills, though; no Benjamins. But there are some Hermans, and even a few Normans. 
 So began this area's great socioeconomic experiment, one in which several dozen businesses agreed to include an alternative currency in their daily transactions and give a discount to those who used it. 
 Now people can pay for groceries, an oil change, even dental work with currency bearing the likenesses of local heroes like Herman Melville and Norman Rockwell. 
 Be forewarned, though: these bills do not travel well. Try paying a tab in Boston with a Norman and you could wind up in the Charles.
 The central purpose behind BerkShares is to strengthen the local economy, perhaps even inoculate it against the whims of globalization, by encouraging people to support local businesses. Amazon does not accept BerkShares, for example, but the Bookloft on Route 7 does.
 Five months into the experiment, some people embrace it, some endure it, some ignore it altogether. At the very least, BerkShares have reminded everyone just how complex this thing called community is.
 The Volvo's driver that day was Susan Witt, white-haired and 60, and her bank delivery had been a long time in coming. As the director of the E. F. Schumacher Society, which promotes concepts like regionally based economies, Ms. Witt had spent a dozen years refining the idea of a currency specific to Berkshire County.
 She raised the money, gathered a band of like-minded people and secured the support of banks and the Chamber of Commerce for a one-year trial. By late September, a Massachusetts company that specializes in banknotes had printed the bills, complete with serial numbers and anti-counterfeiting features.
 Then there they were, 835,000 BerkShares stacked on a bank table. 
 In addition to Melville on the twenties and Rockwell on the fifties, there was a Mohican on the ones; Robyn Van En, champion of community-supported agriculture projects, on the fives; and W. E. B. DuBois, a founder of the civil rights movement, on the tens.
 ''I cried,'' Ms. Witt recalls.
 Now people are walking into banks and exchanging federal currency for a different kind: 11 BerkShares for $10. The idea is that merchants will absorb the 10 percent discount, then use those same BerkShares to pay their own bills. 
 Theoretically, you would pay Roger the Jester with BerkShares for performing at your child's birthday party, the jester would use the bills to buy food at Guido's Fresh Marketplace, Guido's would pay its vendors, and so on.
 Steve Carlotta down at the Snap Shot camera store says BerkShares have strengthened customer loyalty. And Melissa Joyce, manager of the Berkshire Bank branch on Main Street, says they have led to something almost forgotten in this electronic age: lines of bank customers, all waiting to trade Benjamins for Normans.
 ''Our whole goal is the face-to-face transaction,'' Ms. Witt says.
 But the Great Barrington area, while simply beautiful to look at -- cuddled in the Berkshire Hills, beside the Housatonic River -- is a complicated place, with artists and affluent weekenders living beside farmers and blue-collar workers. And BerkShares have come to highlight the tug of war between the ideal and the real.
 For example, the Berkshire Co-op Market took in an astounding 160,000 BerkShares in the first three months. But it soon found that many vendors would not accept the currency for large payments, which translated into a $16,000 hit in discounts. The co-op has since cut back on its participation.
 Guido's has become BerkShares central. But Rick O'Neill, the store's customer service manager, says it absorbs the 10 percent discount by cutting back on advertising, which, in turn, hurts local publications.
 That is why John Conlin, the owner of an entertainment-system store called Tune Street, deposits his BerkShares rather than spend them in other stores. Guilt, he says. ''I don't want to impose that 10 percent on another business owner.''
 Then there is the unsettling side of BerkShares that goes beyond the suspicion that their popularity is driven more by the discounts than by any sense of community. Simply put: If you're not with us, you're dead to us.
 Paul Masiero, the owner of Baba Louie's, a restaurant on Main Street, whose family also owns Guido's, says he did not immediately join the BerkShares program because of the extra bookkeeping. Then he heard that some were saying baba-phooey to Baba Louie's.
 ''We felt they were bad-mouthing us around town,'' Mr. Masiero says, half-smiling. ''So, eventually, we signed up. And we've had a warm, fuzzy feeling ever since.''
 He adds that his employees were already nudging him to embrace BerkShares because the principle is sound. So now he accepts them on his two slowest days, deposits them and takes the 10 percent hit.
 Ms. Witt makes no apologies for avoiding places that do not support the program. ''It's an economic choice,'' she says.
 Sipping tea in the Neighborhood Diner, which accepts BerkShares, she talks of hoping to open a BerkShares ATM and smiles to show the handiwork of a dentist being paid in BerkShares installments.
 The total job will cost about $1,000, she says. That's a lot of Hermans.

HEADLINE: Sure, Lunch Isn't Free, but Late-Night Snacks Are

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Feb. 23 

 BODY:
The nighttime gathering begins about a quarter to 10. The scavengers circle nonchalantly, as if to avoid looking too eager to pounce. 
 But the moment the meal lands at their feet, the rush to grab the most appetizing morsels begins. Within moments, the food is nearly gone.
No, these are not vultures picking at a carcass. These are college students going after bread. Free bread, that is. Freshly baked artisan bread. 
 Each night at closing time at Atticus Cafe in downtown New Haven, the leftover loaves of sourdough, seven-grain and cranberry-pecan bread are gathered up and placed outside the door, available for the taking.
 ''Come on, look for the round roll,'' one searcher told another on a recent Wednesday night. 
 ''Take a couple more; we can put them in the freezer,'' said a particularly voracious member of the group as his friend picked out a loaf. 
 Though the takers vary each night, there is a certain predictability in the bread line across the street from Yale University's main campus. There is the runner who needs his late-night carbs or the biology major who has to pull another all-night study session. 
 Usually, one or two homeless people show up, and the students silently clear the pathway to the bag of bread, never saying what many of them are thinking: ''He needs it more than we do.'' 
 The bread gathering at the small bakery and bookstore is not exactly a secret; anyone who walks past can see the open stack of loaves each night. 
 Still, those privy to the knowledge, passed on from the library and dorm-room denizens, feel like members of a club: those who know where to get really good food free. 
 ''Most of the time, nobody believes it until they come over and see,'' said Mackenzie Wehner, a junior. ''You kind of want to brag about it, but then again, I don't want this crowd to get too big.'' 
 Her boyfriend, Kyle Washabaugh, nodded vigorously in agreement: ''No way.'' 
 Like all private clubs, there are other unwritten rules here: Take one loaf at a time -- common courtesy is to wait for the crowd to dissipate before reaching for seconds. It is fine to search for a favorite, if the hunt takes 30 seconds or less. Never, ever toss a slice on the pavement. Finally, please, try not to make small talk. 
 Nobody quite knows when the bread giveaway began. The owner, Charles Negaro, said it must have been soon after he started the bakery in 1981. By then, the bookstore was doing well, and Mr. Negaro wanted to bake his own bread for the cafe. 
 It was not exactly altruism or some epiphany that led him to give it away, Mr. Negaro said. 
 ''To tell you the truth, I don't remember deciding anything,'' he said the other day. ''I guess we just thought, better to give it away and let somebody enjoy it.'' 
 There were never any complaints, he said, though he has a vague recollection that one of his employees said the move would lead them to lose sales if people just waited to get the bread free. 
 ''So what, so we lose three loaves of bread we could have sold?'' Mr. Negaro said, laughing. 
 Truth be told, there are plenty of students who say they show up regularly for the nightly giveaway, and have never once paid for the ciabatta or the baguette they happily devour free. And there is no shame. 
 ''I'll rarely buy bread at the store -- it's bad economics,'' said Greg Phelan, a senior economics major. ''I come here, get something, eat it that night with my roommates or put it in the freezer. It goes on all the time. I'm definitely not the only one.''

HEADLINE: A Thaw in the Housing Market

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to home sales in Westchester, spring seems to be arriving earlier than usual this year, according to brokers and others who monitor the residential real estate market. 
 After a November and December that were more sluggish than usual, phones are jangling again in real estate offices throughout the county and attendance at open houses is swelling, they report.
Usually, the spring selling season doesn't start to warm up until mid-March, and its early arrival this year may indicate that an upswing in the market is finally under way, according to Greg Rand, a managing partner for Prudential Rand in White Plains, and other brokers.
 This does not indicate that residential sales prices will be climbing, however; on the contrary, median sales prices may drop even further before stabilizing, Mr. Rand cautioned. 
 For the first time in an October-December quarter since 1994, when the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service began reporting statistics on a quarterly basis, the median price for a single-family home in Westchester dropped from the same quarter a year earlier. The median as of Dec. 31 was $630,000, down 3.4 percent from $652,250 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2005.
 In addition, the number of sales for all residential properties in Westchester dropped 13.6 percent, to 2,077, in the fourth quarter of 2006, and the dollar volume of sales was down by 12.7 percent, to $1.315 billion, compared with the fourth quarter of 2005. 
 The median will probably be even lower at the end of the first quarter on March 31 -- perhaps by as much as another 3 to 5 percent, Mr. Rand said, based on his tracking of sales so far this year.
 These sales numbers, which at first glance could be seen as bad news, may actually be signs of a market that is finally growing healthier in Westchester, one of the most expensive counties in the United States, observed Joseph Houlihan, an owner of Houlihan & O'Malley Real Estate Services in Bronxville.
 A continued decrease in the median sales price may be a dose of reality in what has been an inflated and one-sided market, he said. ''There was a growing gap between what sellers wanted and buyers were willing to pay,'' Mr. Houlihan said. ''Now, though, it seems sellers are becoming more realistic and that gap may be closing.''
 As an example, he cited the case of a three-bedroom, two-bath split level house in Eastchester that went on the market for $669,000 and sold within three weeks because it was priced in line with what comparable houses in the neighborhood were going for.
 By comparison, Mr. Houlihan said, several of his agency's listings that buyers perceived as overpriced have languished on the market, and some sellers have even taken them off the market altogether hoping that prices will soar again soon.
 But many professionals believe that a resurgence in sales prices is not likely to happen in the short run. At the offices of the Westchester County Board of Realtors and the Westchester Putnam Multiple Listing Service in downtown White Plains, P. Gilbert Mercurio, chief executive of the Board of Realtors, said one reason for the recent slowdown was that ''prices had overshot their mark'' in recent years.
 In addition to the increased realism on the part of sellers, Mr. Houlihan said, there were other factors causing an early flurry of activity in the market -- notably, the handsome bonuses being handed out on Wall Street. ''And even if they're not actually buying yet,'' he said of the current crop of house hunters, ''there's definitely a lot more looking going on.'' 
 Linda Roth, the manager of Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage's Scarsdale office, cited a seven-bedroom newly built $4.5 million Tudor with lots of high-end extras on Carstensen Road in Scarsdale as ''just the kind of house that Realtors are hoping will draw Wall Street financial types with bonus money in hand.''
 But even investment professionals are exhibiting considerable caution, according to Cynthia Landis, a vice president and brokerage manager in Larchmont for Sotheby's International. ''There's definitely bonus money out there,'' she said, ''but people are being very cagey when it comes to talking about it.'' 
 Mr. Mercurio agreed that the county ''is very dependent on what happens in New York City,'' but he saw other factors in Manhattan that may also have contributed to the increased activity so early in the season.
 ''Even during the slowdown, about 24 percent of all single-family home sales in 2006 were in the $1-million-plus range,'' he noted. ''Westchester's high-end market has always shown strength.''
 He speculated that the thriving condo market and lower-than-average unemployment rates in Manhattan were enabling some owners there to sell and begin their search for homes in the suburbs. 
 The relatively broad selection of properties on the market is also playing a key role in the pickup in activity, said Mr. Rand, whose company has 21 offices, including seven in Westchester.
 Westchester's year-end inventory of 5,774 units in all categories was 21 percent higher than at the end of 2005, according to the latest report from the Board of Realtors. The current levels of inventory are comparable to those of the mid-1990's, ''which supported high-performing markets at the time,'' the report said.
 The largest choice of inventory is occurring in the condo market -- ''everything from new luxury units to ordinary duplexes and 20- to 30-year-old construction,'' Mr. Mercurio said.
 The condo market has fared better than the markets for single-family homes, co-ops and two to five-family homes, with the number of condo sales in October through December down only 4.2 percent, to 345, from the same quarter in 2005.
 By comparison, sales for single-family homes were down 14.8 percent, to 1,121; co-op sales dropped 14.8 percent, to 437; and multifamily home sales slid 19.1 percent, to 174. 
 In addition, mortgage interest rates are expected to remain relatively stable, acting as a further lure for buyers, said Joseph Tringali, a banker with the Melville-based Capstar Mortgage Bankers, which has an office in New Rochelle. 
 ''We've seen an upward trend in rates, but historically they're still low,'' he said.
 Still, there is a concern about possible defaults among a group of people who took out adjustable rate mortgages two years ago and who also borrowed 100 percent of the purchase price of their house, Mr. Tringali said. A house that was purchased for $500,000 then, for example, might be worth less now, and the mortgage rates might be due to be adjusted upward.
 Meanwhile, whatever the reason or combination of reasons, the Westchester market seems to ''have finally passed through the low point,'' Mr. Mercurio said, and appears to be moving ahead.

HEADLINE: New Help for 'Subprime' Borrowers

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
When it comes to looking for mortgages, do low-income borrowers get the credit they deserve? According to a recently released study by the Center for African American Policy at the University of Denver, the answer is no.
 Industry analysts and executives say that the report's conclusions are generally sound but that advances in mortgage underwriting could change the situation in the near future.
The study, released last month, examined the lending practices at banks in 14 cities and found that because many people who live in low-income, minority areas have no credit history, they pay more interest on mortgages, if they can even qualify. 
 The reason, the study said, is that in low-income neighborhoods, banks are less aggressive in offering credit cards and other financial services to their customers, chiefly because it is less profitable to do so. Credit cards are a key component of a borrower's FICO credit score, and banks, in turn, use that score to determine a mortgage applicant's risk of foreclosure and the interest rate to charge.
 With less information to go on, and with little financial incentive to take the time to check the applicant's financial references, lenders and brokers often assign a higher interest rate to those with thin credit files. That is the case even if the applicant's payment history suggests a low risk of delinquency, advocates for low-income borrowers say.
 Rickie C. Keys, the author of the study, said the federal government needs to loosen some restrictions that compel banks to be timid about lending in lower-income areas. (Among other things, he said, federal regulations require banks to hold higher capital reserves when lending to those with low credit scores.)
 ''The objective is to give those consumers access to credit, so they can improve their credit scores and get out of this Catch-22 cycle,'' Dr. Keys said.
 Dr. Keys and Mary H. Coleman, a Mississippi state representative and the immediate past president of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators, have begun working with banking executives to write legislation that would increase the flow of credit in low-income areas.
 In the meantime, Craig Focardi, an analyst with the Tower Group, a financial services consultancy in Needham, Mass., said the industry was approaching the problem from a different direction. ''There are a fair amount of incentives available to correct the problems the study points out,'' he said.
 For ''subprime'' borrowers whose credit is insufficient to qualify for the lowest mortgage rates, most lenders offer a Timely Payment Rewards feature that reduces the interest rate after 24 consecutive months of on-time payments. 
 Banks have also begun using two new services, from the Fair Isaac Corporation and the First American Corporation, to more easily evaluate ''thin file'' applicants. Both services have automated the labor-intensive process of evaluating credit based on utility and rental payments, etc.
 Neighborhood Housing Services of America, a nonprofit affordable-housing organization, last year began using First American's credit scoring service, called the Anthem Report, to qualify low-income borrowers for loans they might not have received in the past.
 The organization's subsidiary, Just Price Solutions, received a commitment late last year from the State Farm Group to buy $100 million worth of loans underwritten with Anthem scores. Of the 138 loans approved so far, most borrowers have received 30-year mortgages with fixed rates around 6.7 percent. 
 Brian Cosgrove, the president of Just Price Solutions, said that six of the organization's loans so far have been approved for New York-area borrowers. He added that if the borrowers had applied through conventional lenders, they would probably have been offered adjustable-rate mortgages with introductory rates of 7.5 to 8 percent for two years. ''We think this is a sustainable solution to get people in houses,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Digital Deprivation in a Land of Affluence

BYLINE: By WOODY HOCHSWENDER. 
E-mail: conn@nytimes.com

DATELINE: SHARON 

 BODY:
MANY Americans take high-speed Internet service for granted. But in Connecticut, the state with the highest per-capita income in the country, there are still pockets of people without broadband, perhaps the keystone utility of the digital age.
 For all its suburban affluence, Connecticut remains a fairly rough-hewn state -- 60 percent is still agricultural or open space -- and in the woodlands between cities, there are areas where broadband connections are difficult and expensive to wire. 
 Without a high-speed connection, life slows to a standstill. Photos and music files move through dial-up phone wires like a pig being ingested by a snake. Surfing the Net is like crawling up a huge sand dune. Telecommuters are bereft. Small, independent businesses languish.
 ''You're not able to compete economically and intellectually with other areas,'' said Jessica Clerk, an artist and writer who lives on a dirt road in the back country of Sharon and needs broadband to do music research. 
 Nearby, Brian Wilcox, an equine photographer who depends almost entirely on e-commerce for his business, spent more than five years mailing CDs of his horse show pictures to a commercial Web site as he waited and hoped for a high-speed connection.
 For homeowners deep in the woods or far from a telephone company switching station, waiting to get broadband is a bit like waiting for Godot. It can take years. High-speed Internet providers are quick to point out that when you choose to live in a remote or rural area, you can expect problems with your utilities. 
 However, there is an existential dimension. As the digital age transforms the culture and the economy, it seems there are more people who wish to live life on their own terms. Ms. Clerk refers to such people as ''a brain cottage industry'' -- writers, booksellers, artists, craftsmen, traders and entrepreneurs to whom the Internet can be indispensable. By leaving parts of the state unwired, she said, ''we're creating pockets of economic discrimination.''
 Seth Bloom, a spokesman for AT&T Inc., the biggest telephone and D.S.L. provider in the state, acknowledges the problem. ''There are areas all over the state where there are topographic anomalies and very spread-out neighborhoods,'' he said, noting that Litchfield County in the northwest and Windham County to the northeast both present challenges. Nevertheless, he says, 93 percent of Connecticut residents now at least have access to D.S.L.
 D.S.L. is a distance-driven product. If you live more than 18,000 feet from a switching station, for example, you may be out of luck. Beyond a mile and a quarter, bandwidth becomes attenuated, resulting in slower speeds.
 To extend D.S.L.'s reach, AT&T in December introduced AT&T U-verse, a program that runs an advanced fiber-optic cable into neighborhoods, then uses the existing copper wire to connect to homes. 
 Cable companies have greater infrastructure obstacles than the phone company. For example, cable providers do not own the telephone poles and can be reluctant to bring a cable line across a state road without an existing pole crossing, since burying the line involves expensive excavation. They will not generally do it for a handful of homes.
 ''There are definitely pockets of remoteness,'' said Robert Spain, the director of governmental relations at Charter Communications, a cable company active in rural Connecticut. In the southern part of the state, including towns around Danbury like Brookfield and Woodbury, and extending as far as Trumbull, Charter's franchise communities are ''fully built out,'' he said, while in rural Windham County -- towns like Canterbury, Chaplin, Pomfret, Willington and Woodstock -- ''we're still in the process.''
 Typically, cable providers sign agreements with individual towns to obtain the franchise for wiring the area. For example, several towns in northwest Connecticut are wired by Comcast. An examination of all 24 franchise agreements filed with the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control shows that the key clause regarding ''line extensions'' -- or the wiring of outlying ''new growth'' neighborhoods -- always contains the phrase ''as expeditiously as possible.'' This has been interpreted in various ways.
 ''We have certain criteria from a business perspective,'' Mr. Spain said. ''If it doesn't provide a reasonable return on investment, you have to look at it on a case-by-case basis.''
 Paul Cianelli, president of the New England Cable and Telecommunications Association, a trade group, said that with satellite companies competing with cable for television subscribers, the industry dynamics have changed. No longer can cable companies assume that line extensions will net dual subscribers -- television and Internet. This makes it costlier to offer cable to every corner of the state.
 Meanwhile, absent government subsidies or a technological breakthrough, some people, like digital Flintstones, will be without broadband for years to come.

HEADLINE: Serious Book to Peddle? Don't Laugh, Try a Comedy Show

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
FEW authors, no matter how serious or scholarly, can afford to be so stubbornly Pynchonesque as to refuse to participate in a book tour. If they want to sell books, that is.
 But fewer still could have guessed until recently that their best pitchmen -- and most engaged interviewers -- would be the comedians of late-night cable.
Take Muhammad Yunus, the Bangladeshi ''banker to the poor'' who recently appeared on ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart'' on Comedy Central after it was announced that he had won the Nobel Peace Prize. 
 ''Tell me about microfinancing and microlending,'' Mr. Stewart asked earnestly. ''Because there's a theory that you developed through your work in economics that has really proven to be incredibly effective in fighting poverty.'' 
 Mr. Stewart has also interviewed Ishmael Beah, the young Sierra Leonian who just published ''A Long Way Gone,'' a memoir about his wrenching experience as a child soldier; Jeffrey Rosen, the George Washington University law professor who wrote ''The Supreme Court: The Personalities and Rivalries That Defined America''; and Vali Nasr, the Middle East expert who was promoting ''The Shia Revival,'' an examination of ethnic conflict in Iraq. 
 Since when did microlending, global poverty, constitutional law and civil wars in Africa become topics for frank discussion on fake-news comedy shows?
 Publishers say that particularly for the last six months, ''The Daily Show'' and its spinoff, ''The Colbert Report,'' which has on similarly wonky authors, like the former White House official David Kuo, have become the most reliable venues for promoting weighty books whose authors would otherwise end up on ''The Early Show'' on CBS looking like they showed up at the wrong party.
 Mr. Yunus's appearance gave a jump-start to his national press tour and sent his rank on the online bookseller Amazon soaring, said Susan Weinberg, who is the publisher of PublicAffairs. ''It was our piece de resistance,'' Ms. Weinberg said. ''It had a huge impact on the book.''
 Tony Fox, a spokesman for Comedy Central, said that though ''The Daily Show'' has been on the air since 1996, the number of authors featured has increased significantly in the last five years.
 Authors are treated to a fairly straight conversation with Mr. Stewart, but Stephen Colbert, who remains in character as a Bill O'Reilly-type commentator, can be a more challenging interviewer who forces the author to play along with his schtick. ''It's a different experience,'' Ms. Weinberg said wryly.
 Television programs that devote significant attention to serious authors have practically gone the way of the illuminated manuscript, publishers lament. Brian Lamb's long-running ''Booknotes'' program on C-Span was permanently shuttered in 2004. ''The Charlie Rose Show'' doesn't generate as much buzz as it used to or translate into higher sales after an author appearance, some publishers say. And the morning shows seem to prefer a bad Britney to a good book.
 Many publishers shrug off ''The Tonight Show With Jay Leno'' on NBC and ''Late Show With David Letterman'' on CBS, saying they are too celebrity-driven to be interested in serious authors, and usually fail to generate a bump in sales anyway.
 All that's left are programs like ''60 Minutes'' on CBS, ''Imus in the Morning'' on MSNBC, ''Larry King Live'' on CNN, and, of course, ''Oprah'' -- all extremely competitive venues for placing an author.
 ''The people who have abandoned us have abandoned us,'' said Martha K. Levin, the publisher of Free Press, which last fall released ''In the Line of Fire,'' a memoir by Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the president of Pakistan. ''Particularly for nonfiction, we are so dependent on media. And television has an impact that is unparalleled.''
 But the Comedy Central shows are also becoming extremely competitive for publicists placing their authors. After a ''Daily Show'' appearance, several publishers said, the author's Amazon ranking rises and the daily sales figures ''pop,'' in industry parlance. It is not at all unusual, one book publicist said, for a title to go from a 300,000 rank to a spot in the Top 300 -- not often the case after shows like ''Charlie Rose.''
 ''If I had my choice between Charlie Rose and Jon Stewart, I'd pick Jon Stewart, no question,'' said one publicist who spoke anonymously because she didn't want to anger the bookers on ''Charlie Rose.''
 About a year ago, publicists began noticing that Mr. Stewart was interviewing serious authors, said Lissa Warren, the senior director of publicity for Da Capo Press. ''It was almost an 'oh my God' moment,'' she said. ''There aren't that many television shows that will have on serious authors. And when they do have one, it's almost startling.''
 Part of the surprise, publishers said, is that the Comedy Central audience is more serious than its reputation allows. The public may still think of the ''Daily Show'' and ''Colbert Report'' audience as a group of sardonic slackers, Gen-Y college students who prefer YouTube to print. But publishers say it's a much more diverse demographic -- and more important, a book-buying audience. 
 ''It's the television equivalent of NPR,'' Ms. Levin, of Free Press, said. ''You have a very savvy, interested audience who are book buyers, people who do go into bookstores, people who are actually interested in books.''
 According to Nielsen Media Research, the nightly audience for ''The Daily Show'' averages about 1.6 million, while ''The Colbert Report'' attracts an average of 1.2 million. (''The 1/2 Hour News Hour'' on Fox, the conservative answer to the Comedy Central shows, had its premiere with 1.5 million viewers last Sunday but does not plan to do author interviews, a Fox spokeswoman said.)
 Michael Mandelbaum, a professor of American foreign policy at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, said during his interview last year on ''The Daily Show'' to promote ''The Case for Goliath,'' Mr. Stewart drew out the most important themes of the book -- points that were ignored by other interviewers.
 ''In my experience, it's not just that serious books get a hearing on comedy shows,'' Mr. Mandelbaum said. ''But serious books get a serious hearing, as well as a funny one, on comedy shows.''
 And if it is true that comedy thrives on opposites, then perhaps the combination of serious and slapstick makes perfect sense. ''They can be themselves on the show,'' said Mr. Fox of Comedy Central, describing the dynamic between authors and Mr. Stewart. ''They can be the straight guy and he's the funny guy.''
 Not that Mr. Stewart injects comedy into every interview. He all but wept when he interviewed Mr. Beah, saying, ''I've rarely read a book that makes my heart hurt -- but this really does.''
 Jeff Seroy, a spokesman for Farrar, Straus and Giroux, Mr. Beah's publisher, said the Stewart appearance had a huge effect, doubling the online sales of the book the day after the show.
 Mr. Seroy said that in meeting Mr. Beah before the show Mr. Stewart said, ''I don't know how I'm going to make this funny.''

HEADLINE: Of Tax Cuts And Those $10 Million Bat Mitzvahs

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
TWENTY-FOUR hours in the life of my rapidly aging brain:
 I woke early in a hotel room in Kansas City, Mo. Went across the street to do a small speech for a group that I never write about. Rushed to the airport to fly on a tiny little Embraer airliner to Houston. (By a miracle, it had a full-sized and very comfortable bathroom -- kudos to Embraer and to Continental for having such pity on us passengers.)
In my hotel room in Houston, my phone did not work. I called the desk staff to ask that they turn it on. First they said they were not sure that my account allowed me to use the phone. Then they said they were too busy to use the phone turn-on equipment for me. I spoke strongly to them. 
 They sent up an engineer, an older man (not as old as I am), to tell me that my phone was not broken. ''The people at the desk turn over pretty often,'' he said, ''and they aren't very smart to start with and they don't care much about the guests, but I'll get it turned on.'' That man had given a perfect summary of what's wrong with hotels. And he got the phone turned on. 
 Off to supper all by myself at a nearby spot called Sullivan's. Between courses of its sinfully good food, I read Marshall Frady's awesome biography of Martin Luther King Jr. Wow, what that man went through. What Southern blacks have gone through. It is fortunate beyond belief that providence sent a man as great as Dr. King to redeem the soul of the nation. Still, far more needs to be done.
 Back to my room. I watched a show called ''The Big Idea With Donny Deutsch.'' It was about lavish parties. Now, you remember how we were having those tax cuts for the very rich so they could invest more and make America grow? Remember that? 
 Well, surprise! Some of that money is going to lavish Sweet 16 parties and $10 million bat mitzvahs, with Tom Petty and Kenny G and private jets flying the guests around. Five-hundred-thousand-dollar parties in New York and Malibu are no longer at all unusual. Even million-dollar parties for the rich are not out of the ordinary, according to the party planners on the show.
 I started to feel hysterical. Is this what America is all about? We're in a war and we cut taxes to stimulate the economy -- and it probably did -- and we are having million-dollar parties at home while our soldiers are paid starvation wages to offer up their lives in Iraq? We're in a war and the government cannot afford to pay for adequate training for our soldiers, but the society at home is routinely having million-dollar weddings and bar mitzvahs?
 Can anyone say ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire''?
 We are creating a debt that is about $3 trillion greater than it was when Bill Clinton left office, and one sequel is $10 million birthday parties? Is this what supply-side is all about? To obligate future generations so our generation can have $10 million parties for teenagers?
 (And by the way, here's an idea: since the purpose of the lavish party is to show how rich the parents are, why not skip the party and just buy a page in the newspaper with an audited statement of the net worth of the family in question? Wouldn't that be simpler and more direct?)
 DONNY DEUTSCH'S show ended with his gushing about how great parties are. I picked up some newspapers. Hmm. I saw an article about the chairman of Herbalife leading a private equity firm's offer to take the company private. He must be trying to underpay his shareholders for it -- otherwise there's no built-in profit for him. Of course, he's a fiduciary for those same shareholders, obliged to put their interests ahead of his in every situation. Never mind. This is about money.
 Then I read an article about the head of Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, Isadore Sharp, taking that company private. His family owns the supervoting shares that control the Four Seasons, and Mr. Sharp says he wants to simplify succession issues with his children. (Don't we all?) Several people have been quoted as saying he's underpaying for the company. Why does he have to do the deal at all? The potential for conflicts of interest is simply overwhelming.
 Four Seasons declined to comment when I called to ask, but I assume Mr. Sharp wants to buy the company on the cheap. Every buyer does. The shareholders for whom Mr. Sharp is a fiduciary want -- and by all legal history, deserve -- the highest possible price. Again, why do the deal at all? If he controls the votes of the company, can't he work out succession issues by parceling out those super shares in his will or a living will? Something does not smell quite right here. At least, not to me.
 And, hey, lookie here who's investing along with Mr. Sharp. Why, it's the richest man in the world, Bill Gates. See, he's not rich enough now. He has to get into this ethically dodgy deal to get even richer. Very nice. I guess he'll use that money to do ethical things.
 Now, it's morning. Lynn E. Turner, the supersmart former chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has sent me a report from Goldman Sachs, the premier money-making entity in the history of the world. The Goldman report says that all of the special pleaders -- most notably the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, which was organized at the behest of the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr. -- are wrong when they predict the demise of New York as the world center of finance because of excessive regulation. Demise is not imminent, the report says, and in any event, regulation has something, but not a lot, to do with what little does ail Wall Street.
 The main factors are the astounding growth in developing nations, which now have their own perfectly good financial markets, and the convenience of London in terms of time zones and immigration laws.
 This is what I had been thinking all along. The report did not mention that the listing fees are far higher in New York than in London, but then doesn't Goldman Sachs own a chunk of the New York Stock Exchange? Anyway, the report represents some common sense from Goldman, and good for it. I wonder if Mr. Paulson will read the report. It's very short.
 Now, off to plan my son's $15 million 20th birthday party.

DATELINE: AUBURN HILLS, Mich. 

 BODY:
DAIMLERCHRYSLER always seems to outdo itself at the Detroit auto show, and this year was no exception. The company showcased celebrities like the pop singer Seal and the chef Bobby Flay, and then generated a fresh round of buzz via an artificial ice rink (its surface carefully scuffed to keep visitors from slipping) that it built to show off its legendary Mercedes-Benz line.
 For DaimlerChrysler itself, however, the corporate mood was just as cold as the ice. Although the German auto giant's chief executive, Dieter Zetsche, shook hands warmly with each of about two dozen journalists who came to a press briefing at last month's car fest, he grew unusually frosty when asked about the future of Chrysler, its struggling American brand. ''We are in recovery mode again,'' he acknowledged. 
Less than six weeks later, on Valentine's Day, Mr. Zetsche announced that DaimlerChrysler was keeping all options open as it tries to tackle its Chrysler problems. At least one of those options involves a possible sale: the company recently retained JPMorgan Chase to scout for a buyer willing to take Chrysler off its hands, most likely at a bargain-basement price. Suddenly, it seems like 1979 all over again: Chrysler is in crisis, with sales falling, costs rising and cars piling up on dealer lots. But this time, there is one big difference: No one is talking about a government-financed bailout to give Chrysler another chance -- in part because it is no longer an American icon.
 Chrysler is not ''too big to fail,'' as it was described then, its tens of thousands of well-paying union jobs too vital to lose. It is now a vestigial part of a sector of the economy -- manufacturing -- that does not loom as large in the nation's consciousness. ''It is a new world,'' said Ron Pinelli, the president of Autodata in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., which tracks industry statistics. ''If Chrysler disappeared, would anyone's life change, except for the people that work for the company?''
 Chrysler's rebound from its near-death experience of the late '70s is the stuff of legend. It survived back then by closing plants and persuading its remaining workers to accept pay cuts, among other things; then it repaid the government aid, with interest, well ahead of schedule. As recently as two years ago, the company was the money-spinning master of hot cars like the 300C and the PT Cruiser.
 But now, Chrysler is fighting for its survival again, a situation that lays bare the failure of previous generations of managers to resolve, or even fully address, its many fundamental problems. Rather than using crises as opportunities to remake Chrysler in the model of its Japanese competitors, say analysts conversant with the company's trajectory, a revolving cast of corporate stewards repeatedly relied on silver bullets to revive the automaker. Over and over, they introduced a single hot-selling model here or tightened the screws on suppliers there, instead of doing the tougher work that real transformation required.
 Many in Detroit say they feel as if they have been sucker-punched. Overnight, Mr. Zetsche has gone from the jovial ''Dr. Z,'' who gamely starred in several hokey television commercials last summer in an effort to bolster Chrysler's sales, to someone whom some employees regard as a symbol of betrayal by their German parent.
 ''It really did seem as if it came out of nowhere," said Kevin Boyle, a history professor at Ohio State University who was raised in Detroit and has written extensively about the auto industry. ''People thought that this was the trade-off: they would give up being a hometown company for the security that the takeover was going to bring.
 ''It was absolutely a false sense of security,'' he added. ''But you see what you want to see.''
 EVEN if the public spectacle of the last 10 days -- Is Chrysler for sale? Who wants it? Who is a serious suitor and who is just flirting? -- has been nothing more than an exercise in determining the company's value on the open market, analysts say it is abundantly clear that the powers in Stuttgart have no special sentiment for Chrysler. Mr. Zetsche is already struggling with sagging popularity in Germany. A number of officials inside DaimlerChrysler blame him for failing to fix Chrysler when he served as its chief executive from 2000 to 2005, say people who advise the automaker but didn't want to be named because of their ties to the company.
 In particular, some of these officials have questioned why Mr. Zetsche allowed the company to keep developing big gas-guzzling S.U.V.'s and pickups when it became clear that gas prices were headed higher. Moreover, he left Chrysler in a virtual product drought for the better part of last year, after the company had gained sales and market share during 2005. 
 Still, analysts say the blame does not lie only with Mr. Zetsche or the other American and German executives who promised a ''merger of equals'' when Daimler-Benz combined with the Chrysler Corporation in 1998 (a nominally friendly merger that became an outright takeover in subsequent years). 
 In a large sense, they say, Chrysler is simply winding up where it might have been nearly three decades ago, had its former chief executive, Lee A. Iacocca, not been able to postpone the pain with $1.5 billion in federal loan guarantees and the introduction of smart-selling models like the K-cars, minivans and the Jeep Grand Cherokee -- not to mention multiple reorganizations.
 Despite that, ''there was no root-and-branch transformation, not at Chrysler or at any of the Detroit companies,'' Professor Boyle said. ''It must have driven the people inside those companies nuts.'' 
 Chrysler now exists in a world where the Big Three are all under siege -- where, in fact, the very term Big Three no longer accurately describes Detroit's automakers. The old era ended last year, when Toyota slipped past DaimlerChrysler to rank third in American sales behind General Motors and Ford. Few could have envisioned this situation 28 years ago, when no less than Vice President Walter Mondale aligned himself with Mr. Iacocca to bolster the case for a federal bailout, so crucial was Chrysler to the American economy.
 With the White House Christmas tree gleaming nearby, Mr. Mondale urged Congress to act quickly ''so that we can provide security for thousands and thousands of jobs and insure Chrysler's long-term success as a major American automotive producer.''
 Chrysler's present circumstances are an even sharper contrast to the giddiness, tinged ever so slightly with apprehension, that enveloped the company nine years ago, when its executives flocked to the New York Stock Exchange for a reception on the eve of the merger with Daimler-Benz.
 Back then, Robert J. Eaton, Mr. Iacocca's hand-picked successor, promised that Chrysler would be part of something grand, sweeping and -- most of all -- new. Mr. Eaton's statements were in keeping with similar managerial pledges that Mr. Iacocca had previously recycled into two best-selling books. (A publicist for Mr. Iacocca did not respond to a request for an interview.) 
 But analysts say Mr. Iacocca's efforts, followed by the DaimlerChrysler merger, served to mask serious underlying problems at Chrysler that heated competition from more nimble competitors has now brutally exposed. Chrysler's travails have pointed out a truth about Daimler, too. Daimler and other German automakers, with their historical focus on craftsmanship and high performance, simply have trouble running mass-market brands -- at least in markets like the United States where they cannot charge a premium.
 Consider Volkswagen, which has tried endless solutions through the years and, like Chrysler, has been on a constant roller coaster of rising and falling sales, both in the United States and elsewhere. It, too, has failed in its latest turnaround effort, jettisoning senior managers like the former Chrysler president, Wolfgang Bernhard, and turning to Porsche as its own savior. BMW, for its part, doesn't even try to wade into Chrysler territory. It has hesitated for years about selling a cheaper car in the United States, for fear of damaging its brand image, even though it offers one in Europe. 
 Analysts also say that instead of leveraging its newfound identity as part of a global company, Chrysler stuck too long with its identity as a Detroit carmaker. DaimlerChrysler has long kept Mercedes-Benz and Chrysler apart, except for some tepid efforts at cooperation on cars like the Chrysler Crossfire, based on the Mercedes SLK, or the Chrysler 300 sedan, which has a Mercedes-designed transmission. Instead, Chrysler relied too long on the same mix of vehicles that made it so successful in the 1990s: the sport utilities, pickups and minivans that comprise about three-quarters of its sales. 
 ''Chrysler's had a tendency in the past to miss when the market changes,'' said James Hall, vice president for industry analysis at AutoPacific, a consulting firm that is based in Tustin, Calif. Chrysler, Mr. Hall said, ''has a cyclical history of falling into the barrel and clawing themselves out.''
 Those mistakes collided last year, when big vehicles lost favor with American consumers paying $2 to $3 a gallon for gasoline. But Chrysler kept building them, winding up with 100,000 more Jeeps, Dodges and Chryslers than dealers had ordered, and being forced to park the unsold vehicles in endless rows on lots surrounding Detroit's airports.
 The situation is perplexing, given that Mr. Zetsche and his successor at Chrysler, Thomas W. LaSorda, were saying the right things -- that Chrysler needed to model itself on Toyota and Honda, not on General Motors and Ford, and that the company had to move closer to what its customers wanted, not build cars simply to keep plants humming.
 But the company has a long history of saying one thing while doing another. Acting as pitchman in the company's darkest days, Mr. Iacocca declared, ''If you can find a better car, buy it!'' Later on, he acknowledged that his name alone was not enough to sell ''lousy cars'' and that the company had to improve their quality before buyers would take a chance.
 LIKEWISE, in the 1990s, Chrysler was universally declared by analysts to be the industry's low-cost producer, able to squeeze billions of dollars in savings out of its parts purchasing and to develop new models like the Plymouth Prowler in a fraction of the time and expense that other automakers might need.
 Though the savings were genuine, they were not nearly enough to make the company competitive with Japanese competitors. Chrysler's real advantage was as the industry's high-margin automaker, earning an average of $1,400 a vehicle across its lineup -- most of it coming on sales of S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks, for which there was little foreign competition -- while G.M. and Ford were still making more cars, at a loss, than they were making light trucks at a profit. 
 Chrysler's big profits at the time, coupled with the zeal of Daimler-Benz's chief executive, Jurgen E. Schrempp, to create a global automotive giant, attracted the German luxury-car maker's most senior officers to Chrysler's glitzy headquarters in Auburn Hills, where Mr. Eaton was eager to cut a deal. The executives' confidence in the future of the combined company meant that dozens of pages of documents creating the merger contained no separation agreement -- a prenuptial without provisions for a divorce.
 German executives soon realized that Chrysler would not be the cash cow that they had hoped for. Still, Mr. Zetsche was the face of freundlichkeit, or friendliness, when he arrived in Detroit in 2000 to direct what became the first of three corporate restructurings. He acted quickly to become a part of the local community and a calming force. Detroit, which had been roiled by an outbreak of anti-German sentiment, adopted Mr. Zetsche as a favorite son.
 When he left in 2005 to become chief executive of DaimlerChrysler, Mr. Zetsche was given a warm send-off by employees certain that he would look out for them in Germany. ''He was supposed to be Chrysler's protector back in Stuttgart,'' wrote the Detroit News columnist Daniel Howes, ''the mustachioed Mercedes-Benz veteran who learned what the Americans could do, how their market and its pressures were different, how the pentastar and the three-pointed star could work more closely together.''
 LAST fall, Mr. Zetsche flatly denied that Chrysler would be sold, after Bodo Uebber, DaimlerChrysler's chief financial officer, refused to rule out the possibility. Even as he inhaled the frigid air last month at the auto show in Detroit, Mr. Zetsche was still talking of Chrysler's value to DaimlerChrysler. The company, he said, ''is in much better shape than it was six years ago,'' when he took charge.
 Now Mr. Zetsche speaks of doing the best thing for Chrysler -- and for its parent -- a shift in phrase that has sent shivers down the backs of Chrysler's workers. Chrysler executives, meanwhile, are doing their best to put on brave faces about the company's future.
 ''I would not let one year say the entire story here has changed,'' Mr. LaSorda said last month. Sitting in the boardroom of the Detroit Fire Department, which lends Chrysler a firehouse each year during the auto show to use as a lounge for employees, dealers and the press, Mr. LaSorda talked up the company's efforts to heal tattered relationships with its dealers. Chrysler infuriated dealers last year when it tried to make them take on more vehicles when they could not sell the ones already on their lots.
 ''We lost their confidence and trust, and we are going to work tirelessly to get it back,'' he vowed.
 Likewise, Chrysler dealers say they have accepted the olive branch and declare that they are ready to do battle yet once more to save the company. ''We're fighters,'' said Eric Nielsen, a dealer at the Franklin Sussex Auto Mall in Sussex, N.J. ''We're going to be there.''
 But there is no guarantee that they will be there under Daimler's wing -- or anyone's, for that matter.
 This time, neither Congress nor customers are in charge of Chrysler's ultimate fate. That lies with the DaimlerChrysler supervisory board in Germany, a 20-member collection of corporate executives, union leaders and industry experts that includes just four Americans. 
 The prospect that all the past efforts might have only forestalled Chrysler's demise is sad to Douglas A. Fraser, the 90-year-old former president of the United Automobile Workers union, who once lobbied alongside Mr. Iacocca to save the company.
 ''Chrysler would have ceased to exist'' if not for the federal bailout, Mr. Fraser said. ''It would have been devastating to an awful lot of people.''
 Even so, at least Chrysler workers at that time might have been able to find jobs in what was still the undisputed car-making capital of the North American market. 
 ''Then, the workers would have had a chance at least to go to work at Ford or G.M.,'' Mr. Fraser said. ''Now that's not an option.''

HEADLINE: Racing to Make the Pit Stops a Little Bit Greener

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

 BODY:
WHEN Nascar drivers like Dale Earnhardt Jr. and IndyCar racers like Danica Patrick put pedal to the metal this season, they'll be making the transition to cleaner racing fuels. 
 At today's Nascar Nextel Cup race in Fontana, Calif., the tanks of all 43 competitors will, for the first time, be filled with gasoline that does not contain poisonous lead compounds. When the Indy Racing League season gets under way next month in Florida, the open-wheel racecars will be topped off with ethanol, which is corn-based, instead of methanol, a fossil fuel derived from natural gas.
In each series, the deafening roar and the radar-gun-busting speeds will remain intact, but the engines will burn fuels much closer to what the fans use in their own cars. 
 The notion that the fuel consumed on the racetrack should be more closely related to that from service-station pumps is not far-fetched; after all, automakers have long tried to convince customers that racing improves the breed. 
 ''At one point, motorsports could take the lead in regards to a lot of technology that would trickle down to the everyday street car,'' said Bobby Rahal, the 1986 Indianapolis 500 champion. 
 ''Today, the technology of everyday cars is more sophisticated,'' said Mr. Rahal, who is a partner with David Letterman in teams that race in the IndyCar and the American Le Mans Series. ''This is an opportunity for motorsports to provide value to the automotive industry.''
 The trend is not limited to the headline-makers. The American Le Mans Series for sports cars and prototypes is switching to E10, a blend that is 10 percent ethanol and 90 percent gasoline. Even fuels not yet available are getting into the act; last month, a newly formed racing body announced that it would organize a Hydrogen 500 race in 2009.
 For the image-conscious groups that sanction racing series, the fuel changes offer an opportunity to promote themselves as being in step with the times and sensitive to concern about fossil fuels. 
 ''As long as we keep developing cleaner fuels to help the environment, I'm all for it,'' Jimmie Johnson, the defending Nextel Cup champion, said this month. 
 It is also smart marketing, creating an attraction for new sponsors and partners. Both the I.R.L. and the American Le Mans series have formed alliances with the ethanol industry. 
 Nascar's transition to unleaded gasoline has been slow, and for teams, somewhat costly. A program to develop unleaded racing fuel was begun with Unocal, Nascar's former fuel supplier, but the changeover was postponed when Unocal left the series in 2003, according to Robin Pemberton, Nascar's vice president for competition.
 Sunoco took over the program, developing a blend it calls 260GTX that has a 98 octane rating, down from the lusty 112 rating of its leaded racing gas. Unleaded was tested last year in the Busch and the Craftsman Truck series, the two tiers beneath the Nextel Cup.
 Despite the drop in octane, Nascar teams say they have developed engines that can generate roughly the same amount of horsepower as they had on leaded gasoline.
 Mr. Pemberton said that unleaded gas was not used last week at the Daytona 500, Nascar's season opener, because the engines at the Daytona race are required to use restrictor plates. The restrictors limit air flow into the engine through the carburetor to reduce horsepower and speed.
 ''We needed to get more information on the parts and pieces used in restrictor-plate races,'' he said in a telephone interview.
 Mr. Pemberton played down speculation that Nascar did not want to gamble on using unleaded gas in an event that the organization considers to be its Super Bowl. Because unleaded fuel does not provide as much lubrication to the engine's valves as leaded gas, several team owners said Nascar did not want to run the risk of engine failure in a race as important as the Daytona 500.
 ''Even though we'll be racing 100 percent on unleaded from here on out, there's still going to be a learning curve,'' Mr. Pemberton said.
 Doug Yates, the co-owner of Robert Yates Racing, a prominent Nextel Cup team, said that the transition to unleaded had cost his team $1 million over all. The team is spending 40 percent more on engine valves, which now need a special coating to prevent wear caused by the reduced lubricity of unleaded fuel, he said. 
 ''It changes how you build the engines, how you tune the engines,'' Mr. Yates said. ''It changes the parts you use.'' 
 Though it has not been an easy transition, Mr. Yates said he thought the change needed to be made. He said he would like to see the series race with smaller, more fuel-efficient engines that are more like today's production cars than a 1950s sedan.
 ''I'm nervous about the first race,'' Mr. Yates said, ''but I think we've done our homework fairly well.''
 Cars in the I.R.L., whose main event is the Indianapolis 500, will be powered by fuel containing 98 percent ethanol, which the league promotes as homegrown and renewable. But they are still not going to be at the top of the E.P.A. fuel economy charts.
 Les Mactaggart, senior technical director of the I.R.L., said in a telephone interview that the ethanol-burning engines were expected to get 3.5 miles a gallon, up from 2 m.p.g. on the 90-10 methanol-ethanol mixture used in the 2006 season. 
 According to Mr. Mactaggart, the engines developed by Honda for the I.R.L. are capable of generating about the same power -- estimated at 650 horsepower -- and speed as the methanol-ethanol engines. 
 The I.R.L. season will not begin until March 24, but the ethanol engines appear to be reliable. Seventeen I.R.L. drivers turned 1,700 laps around a road course at Daytona International Speedway in the ethanol-powered cars in testing on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1. There were no breakdowns or blowups, Mr. Mactaggart said.
 ''The cars are going to go just as fast, and they'll be just as reliable,'' said John Lewis, senior director of operations for the I.R.L. Apparently, there were side benefits. The old fuel blend had a bitter smell and stung the eyes, said Michael Andretti, an IndyCar champion who now owns an I.R.L. team (and will drive in this year's Indianapolis 500). The exhaust from cars powered by ethanol smelled like buttered popcorn, Mr. Mactaggart said; Mr. Andretti politely countered that he thought it smelled more like garbage. 
 ''But we're not going to know the difference racing,'' Mr. Andretti said in a telephone interview. ''It's a great effort to help the environment. The league has shown it can adapt to it, and Honda has done a tremendous job adapting the engines to it.''
 Mr. Mactaggart said that because there were more road courses on the schedule this year the I.R.L. would use 3.5-liter V-8 engines, an increase from the 3-liter engines of 2006. The larger engines are designed to produce more midrange power, a benefit on the road circuits where speeds are lower. (On the high-speed oval tracks, fast-moving air is packed into the engine -- about the same effect a turbocharger would deliver.)
 But because the mileage has improved, the fuel tanks of the IndyCars have been reduced to 22 gallons from 30 gallons to maintain the same number of pit stops in a race, Mr. Mactaggart said. 
 The new fuel contains 2 percent gasoline, which had to be included in the blend so the Department of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms would not have to monitor its movement, he said. One hundred percent ethanol is, in effect, the same stuff that moonshiners transported in the dead of night.
 To elude the authorities, the moonshiners drove souped-up cars that they would race on weekends. Those races were the genesisof the Nascar series that became the Nextel Cup; racing, while making progress, seems to have come full circle as well.

HEADLINE: A Bad Hand for the Catskills

 BODY:
Gov. Eliot Spitzer has announced he wants a sprawling Indian casino in the Catskills. In order to get it, he plans to go to Washington to lobby the secretary of the interior for final approval. 
 Mr. Spitzer has his reasons. There is the promise of economic development for people desperate for jobs. There is the reward of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for the state that do not have to come from higher taxes. And finally, there is the newer rationalization that if New Yorkers are going to gamble anyway, they might as well lose their money in New York, not New Jersey or Connecticut.
 But as any gambler knows, as dazzling as things look in the casino business, the odds are never stacked in your favor. Mr. Spitzer should realize that these shorter-term rewards will not turn out to be a good deal for New Yorkers in the long run. The costs in crime and social problems are barely figured in. For that reason alone, the secretary, Dirk Kempthorne, who as governor of Idaho opposed the kind of land deal this casino will require, should stick to his guns now that he is in Washington. 
 The casino for the St. Regis Mohawk tribe would be at the Monticello Raceway site, about 90 miles north of New York City. It could be as big as 13 football fields, drawing as many as six million visitors a year, and bringing with it a corresponding increase in traffic. 
 Enviromentalists, however, assert that the federal government has so far failed to perform a comprehensive assessment of the project's impact on the human and natural environment, as required under the National Enviromental Policy Act. The casino's proponents argue that the raceway was built long ago to accommodate crowds. But a gambling casino could draw even more people, and the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Sullivan County Farm Bureau have sued the department for failing to do the required studies. Can anybody really argue that so many cars will not significantly affect the human environment?
 Mr. Kempthorne has long argued that casinos belong on tribal land. The casino would be more than 400 miles from the tribe's Akwesasne reservation along the Canadian border, and once he approves this new reservation area in the Catskills, there will be dozens more proposals moving through the Bureau of Indian Affairs toward his desk.
 One way out for Mr. Kempthorne would be to suggest that he wants to see what would happen to the area. He could find out how the community, the farmers and the atmosphere would fare if Monticello became another Foxwoods or a first step toward a Las Vegas in the Catskills. A full environmental impact assessment would help give the secretary a little breathing room, and it would let the rest of the world see what would really happen if Monticello became a gambling destination for New York City.

HEADLINE: Play It Safe at Indian Point

 BODY:
Is there any truly compelling reason not to conduct a thorough, independent safety inspection of the Indian Point nuclear plant?
 It's hard to think of one.
The plant is old. Despite what the rosy ads insist, its safety, security and vitality are matters of intense debate. The plant's owner, Entergy Nuclear Northeast, wants to renew the licenses for its two reactors, which expire in 2013 and 2015. If past problems are any indication, that means we might be hearing about siren failures, tritium and strontium leaks, groundwater contamination, employee intimidation, inadequate evacuation plans and jitters about radioactive-waste storage, sabotage and terrorist attacks until at least 2035.
 A chorus of local lawmakers, from members of Congress to the county legislatures in Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties, has stepped up efforts to get the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to conduct what is known as an Independent Safety Assessment at Indian Point. That is a ramped-up version of normal inspection procedures, and a highly sought-after goal of those who want the plant to undergo the most rigorous examination possible. 
 Legislation to require the assessment has been introduced in both houses of the newly Democratic Congress. The sponsor in the Senate is Hillary Clinton, who at about this time last year was prematurely boasting of her success in winning a personal commitment from the head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to conduct the Independent Safety Assessment, a commitment that later evaporated, if it ever existed at all.
 The nuclear agency just doesn't want to do it. It argues that existing methods of oversight are plenty, and that the public should trust it to know what is best. Entergy has gone along with what the federal agency says. But if Entergy were smart, it would call its critics' bluff and embrace the notion of a long, involved, gold-standard safety inspection. It would throw open its domes to outside scrutiny and then trumpet its clean bill of health to all the world. Such a move would wax and polish the company's reputation to gleaming, console shareholders and the general public, and quite possibly shut some critics up.
 There is little indication that Indian Point, at this moment, is unsafe or an immediate menace to the region. There is no proof that it is as horribly run as its critics contend, and there is surely no clear way to justify quickly pulling the plug on all the energy it provides. All the same, we are not comfortable in letting the plant's future rest entirely on the word of Entergy, the nuclear industry and Bush administration regulators.
 While we agree with one argument they make -- that nuclear power should remain part of the nation's energy grid, particularly in an era of global warming -- it is clear that pro-nuclear arguments are colored by very large doses of economic self-interest. The nuclear lobby's supposedly eco-friendly dream is for hundreds of new reactors to pop up across the continent like dandelions in a clean, carbon-free world. (The nation would need that many to wean itself from coal and natural gas.)
 That argument plays into the industry's desire for self-preservation and its assertive push to keep existing nuclear plants operating. Yet local concerns simply must be taken into account. As expressed in the nearly unanimous voices of their elected representatives, many people in the densely populated region around this badly situated nuclear plant badly want a thorough, independent review of safety at Indian Point. They want to put the debate to rest, and get on to worrying about other things.
 It is hard to imagine why a company that runs such a safe, secure and vital nuclear plant wouldn't want that, too.

HEADLINE: Race, Politics and a Bridge in South Carolina

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: RIMINI, S.C. 

 BODY:
The woman's voice echoed down the empty road, the sound bouncing back to the desolate spot by her trailer. 
 ''Too isolated. Too peaceful,'' she complained, but the echo had already made Mary Bawa's point.
A powerful congressman, James E. Clyburn, the House majority whip, has staked his pride and a lifetime's tempered pugnacity on ending that echo and this hamlet's isolation with a new bridge. He faces the derision of hunters, environmentalists and much of South Carolina's political establishment, who all see it as a pork-barrel waste of $150 million. 
 Undergirding Mr. Clyburn's 10-year fight for what opponents mock as a ''bridge from nowhere to nowhere'' is the issue of race, the starting point in his four-decade ascent. The potential beneficiaries are mostly poor, rural blacks; the opponents are largely whites. 
 Mr. Clyburn wants to connect this forlorn central South Carolina community of about 500, across an artificial lake and swamp, to the equally destitute settlement of Lone Star, population 214, using nine miles of bridge and roadway. The poverty rate is 30 percent and above in both places, barely perceptible interruptions of broken-down houses on remote rural roadways. Lone Star's most substantial structure is an old, abandoned brick store by the railroad tracks, empty for years; Rimini boasts a couple of old frame dwellings and trailers, and a store with an antique, faded bread sign on it. 
 The benefits of the bridge are disputed. But listening to Mr. Clyburn and the handful of residents here, they almost appear a side issue. 
 His push for the span across Lake Marion, in its motivation and drive, harks back to the earliest days of a career begun when South Carolina was still wrestling with segregation. Since then Mr. Clyburn has reached a pinnacle of his party's leadership, achieving a number of firsts for a black man along the way: first black governor's adviser, in 1970; first black congressman from his state since the late 19th century, in 1992. He has pragmatically worked within the white-dominated system, while watching his state partly transform itself as a New South success story.
 Yet Mr. Clyburn's campaign for the bridge linking two mostly black specks on the map in the heart of his district, eschewing pragmatism, is imbued with the sharp spirit of defiance from the civil rights era, when he was jailed as a college student protesting segregation.
 It is a fight pitched in terms from another era. Defending his position, Mr. Clyburn's words seem fueled as much by a political lifetime's butting against white-held levers of power as by the bridge's potential benefits, and his stated desire to alleviate a swath of black rural poverty.
 The issue on the surface is 2.8 miles of bridge over Lake Marion and the pristine Upper Santee Swamp alongside a long-established railroad trestle. A few trains rumble through, though mostly it is a place where only waterfowl make loud noises. 
 Underneath that surface issue, however, is the congressman's will to buck his white opponents. ''Their opposition is not about the environment,'' Mr. Clyburn said angrily. ''Their opposition is very much more base than that,'' he said, emphasizing the word. 
 Arrayed against him are the Republican governor, much of the state's Congressional delegation, the reservations of various state and federal agencies, some of the region's leading environmental groups and a vociferous chorus of white huntsmen, some of whose racist commentary has been carefully collected from the Internet by the congressman's staff. Even the state's Transportation Department has said the bridge is not a priority. The opposition appears to make him even more determined to proceed. 
 ''I am the hardest person in the world to intimidate,'' Mr. Clyburn, 66, said in an interview. 
 ''They're wrong about this bridge,'' he added, ''they know damn well they're wrong.''
 The hamlets themselves are barely 50 miles south of the state capital, Columbia, but seem a world away. 
 ''Last five years, economy gone down,'' said Troy Nelson, unemployed and looking for a job, like his cousin Richard. Both were standing outside the low, cinder-block Drayton Family Store in Rimini. ''Right now, you'd accept any type of work,'' he said. The area ''needs a whole lot of help,'' he said.
 ''The system disregard this area,'' Richard Nelson said. 
 Mr. Clyburn, numbers at the ready, says the bridge will make jobs, schools and hospitals far more accessible to these places of chronic high unemployment and low schooling rates; environmental advocates counter that the bridge will hardly lessen commuting times, and will not alter the fact that residents will still find their respective regional hubs of Orangeburg (for Lone Star) and Sumter (for Rimini) more convenient for services. 
 What is more, it will ''destroy over 15 acres of wetland'' said the Southern Environmental Law Center in a lawsuit filed last year, hurt the wildlife in the unspoiled Sparkleberry Swamp and generally disrupt a calm place.
 ''It's the biggest waste of money,'' said Robin Inabinet, a white fisherman, stepping off his boat on the Lone Star side of Lake Marion. ''There's nothing here, and there never was nothing here.''
 On the other side of the lake, though, the sense of grievance, and of resentment against whites, is strong. 
 ''Rimini just happens to be a little community of black people, most of them poor,'' said Johnny Taylor, who runs the Drayton store. ''They just don't want to see nothing good happen to it.'' 
 For now, the project's opponents have the upper hand, with the Health and Environmental Control Department denying it a permit in January. Mr. Clyburn vows to fight on. 
 ''It's about destroying a pristine area,'' Mr. Inabinet said. ''This is one of the last undisturbed areas on the east coast.''
 J. Blanding Holman IV, a lawyer with the environmental law center, said that roads tended to fragment habitats for wildlife. 
 But these arguments hardly intersect Mr. Clyburn's train of thought, pitched at a wholly different historical perspective. Where the lawsuit sees ''spectacular remoteness and beauty,'' Mr. Clyburn sees the land underneath Lake Marion, flooded by the creation of a hydroelectric project in 1941, and some of it undoubtedly owned by blacks. The lawsuit speaks of enjoyable kayaking trips on the water; Mr. Clyburn resurrects 40-year-old discussions about building a bridge over it, to help the impoverished areas. 
 His critics resolutely reject any racial basis for the disagreement; Mr. Clyburn, the lifelong pragmatist who worked his way up, sees race as fundamental. 
 ''You see all this, and you know why it was never done -- because the people over there had no political power, none,'' he said.
 ''These people were disenfranchised,'' said Mr. Clyburn, a fundamentalist minister's son who said he may have been ''divinely put where I am to fight this battle.'' 
 Scornfully, he suggests that his critics are merely hiding the basic truth about race.
 ''The bridge was not built in 1968 because of discrimination,'' he said. ''That's what it was, and we all know that. And all these people who are running their mouths, they know that. They know the deal. They get upset simply because I know the deal.''

HEADLINE: This Is Not Your 1983 Governor's School Aid Plan

BYLINE: By FORD FESSENDEN

 BODY:
THE new Democratic governor has proposed his first budget, calling for a significant increase in education spending for New York City and similarly needy school districts. Many suburban districts would get less aid. The mayor praises the governor's vision; suburban state senators are howling.
 In this chronology, the new governor is not Eliot Spitzer. It is Mario M. Cuomo, and the year is 1983. Governor Cuomo was trying to redistribute more state education aid to needier districts, but the plan was met with fierce opposition. Suburban superintendents invaded the capitol to protest. And Republican legislators fought the plan and won: school aid around the state remained pretty much at the same level it was the year before. A lawsuit was filed to challenge the state education aid formula, and the court eventually ruled that the state had to address concerns about needier districts. Gov. George E. Pataki vigorously fought the lawsuit for 12 years. 
 Now, that Governor Spitzer has unveiled his ambitious proposal to increase state aid significantly for schools in New York City and other needy districts, school officials on Long Island are poring over the plan to find out what it will mean for their districts. 
 Across Long Island, 72 of 117 districts would get increases of 3 percent or more in the governor's proposed budget. Nine districts, including Farmingdale, Cold Spring Harbor and Elwood, would get less than last year. Hempstead and Brentwood would see significant increases. 
 Mr. Spitzer's proposal to shift dollars to poorer districts differs from Mr. Cuomo's in crucial details: Mr. Cuomo tried to cut aid to more affluent districts, which meant that just about every suburban district would lose money. Mr. Spitzer has proposed a spending increase so huge -- $7 billion in added spending over four years -- that there are few losers: Some rich suburban districts will get slightly more, while poor districts get a bonanza.
 Also, Governor Spitzer, intent on winning support from most Republican suburban lawmakers, promises that his proposal will be coupled with property tax relief. He has also proposed changing the aid formula so that all districts get an increase in their lump-sum state aid, known as ''foundation'' aid. Additional state dollars would be provided for specific categories, based on need.
 ''The time you really hear from the districts is when you actually cut their state aid,'' said E. J. McMahon, executive director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a conservative fiscal policy group. ''Unless the superintendents are saying, 'This is going to have a severe impact and lead to cutting back extracurricular activities,' the opposition might not be that strong.''
 Matthew T. Crosson, president of the Long Island Association, said his group might look to limit the impact of school taxes on businesses, which could increase if costs rise but state aid doesn't.
 But beyond that, he said, ''The concept of this -- which is if you're going to have additional aid it should go to the areas that need it the most, and if you're going to have property tax relief it should go to those with the biggest burdens -- it's hard to argue with that.''
 Under the governor's plan, there would be a $1.4 billion increase in state aid, to $19.2 billion this year. An additional $1.5 billion would go to expanding the STAR tax rebate program next year, with the projection that it would grow to $6 billion in three years. The State Court of Appeals, ruling in a 13-year-old education financing case last year, said more had to be spent in New York City and other needier districts.
 Every district would get at least a 3 percent increase in the basic aid program this year, and some would get much larger jumps. Depending on some smaller, targeted aid programs, a handful of districts would lose money compared with 2006-7. Over all, Long Island's state aid would increase by 5.2 percent. In comparison, aid for New York City would increase by 9.5 percent, for Brentwood by 12.3 percent and for Hempstead by 9.6 percent. 
 Some school officials worry that districts that are neither rich nor poor will suffer. ''I believe he gave an honest effort to get money to poor districts, but he did it at the expense of the average-need districts,'' said Jim Kaden, vice president of the Nassau-Suffolk School Boards Association.
 In Westchester, Lisa P. Davis, president of the Westchester-Putnam School Boards Association, said she would urge parent-teacher associations to lobby against the proposal, even though her school district, in Chappaqua, would get a 5.4 percent increase. ''We want to make sure we get what we should based on all our districts' needs,'' she said.
 Homeowners in every district in the suburbs would also get a substantial increase in tax rebates: an average of 23 percent on Long Island. 
 The Republican state senators say it ought to be more.
 ''Long Island traditionally gets about 13 percent of state aid,'' said Tom Dunham, a spokesman for Senator Dean G. Skelos, a Republican from Rockville Centre and the deputy majority leader. ''The governor's budget cuts our share of new aid to 8 percent. By doing that, Long Island schools are losing $68 million in money they would be entitled to under their 13 percent share.''
 But the governor's allies think there aren't enough losers to foment a revolution this time.
 ''With this plan, we believe we are covering all the bases,'' said Geri D. Palast, executive director of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, the educational advocacy group that sued the state for more state aid to city schools and now supports the governor. ''Nobody's losing. Over all, the number of winners necessary to make a majority are there.''

HEADLINE: Venezuela Spending on Arms Soars to World's Top Ranks

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Feb. 24 

 BODY:
Venezuela's arms spending has climbed to more than $4 billion in the past two years, transforming the nation into Latin America's largest weapons buyer and placing it ahead of other major purchasers in international arms markets like Pakistan and Iran. 
 Venezuelan military and government officials here say the arms acquisitions, which include dozens of fighter jets and attack helicopters and 100,000 Kalashnikov assault rifles, are needed to circumvent a ban by the United States on sales of American weapons to the country.
They also argue that Venezuela must strengthen its defenses to counter potential military aggression from the United States. 
 ''The United States has tried to paralyze our air power,'' Gen. Alberto Muller Rojas, a member of President Hugo Chavez's general staff, said in an interview, citing a recent effort by the Bush administration to prevent Venezuela from acquiring replacement parts for American F-16s bought in the 1980s. ''We are feeling threatened and like any sovereign nation we are taking steps to strengthen our territorial defense,'' he said. 
 This retooling of Venezuela's military strategy, which includes creation of a large civilian reserve force and military assistance to regional allies like Bolivia, has been part of a steadily deteriorating political relationship with the United States. 
 The Bush administration has repeatedly denied that it has any plans to attack Venezuela, one of the largest sources of oil for the United States. But distrust of such statements persists here after the administration tacitly supported a coup that briefly removed Mr. Chavez from office in 2002.
 Venezuela's escalation of arms spending, up 12.5 percent in 2006, has brought harsh criticism from the Bush administration, which says the buildup is a potentially destabilizing problem in South America and is far more than what would be needed for domestic defense alone. 
 The spending has also touched off a fierce debate domestically about whether the country needs to be spending billions of dollars on imported weapons when poverty and a surging homicide rate remain glaring problems. Meanwhile, concern has increased among Venezuela's neighbors that its arms purchases could upend regional power balances or lead to a new illicit trade in arms across Venezuela's porous borders. 
 Jose Sarney, the former Brazilian president and a leading senator, caused a stir this week when he was quoted in the newspaper O Globo as describing Venezuela's form of government as ''military populism'' and ''a return to the 1950s,'' when Venezuela was governed by the army strongman Marcos Perez Jimenez. 
 ''Venezuela is buying arms that are not a threat to the United States but which unbalance forces within the continent,'' Mr. Sarney said. ''We cannot let Venezuela become a military power.'' 
 Still, officials in the administration of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil have been hesitant to publicly criticize Venezuela's arms purchases. 
 The issue remains delicate after the Brazilian company Embraer lost a deal to sell military aircraft to Venezuela because the planes included American technology. 
 After turning unsuccessfully to Brazil and Spain for military aircraft, Venezuela has become one of the largest customers of Russia's arms industry. 
 Since 2005, Venezuela has signed contracts with Russia for 24 Sukhoi fighter jets, 50 transport and attack helicopters, and 100,000 assault rifles. Venezuela also has plans to open Latin America's first Kalashnikov factory, to produce the Russian-designed rifles in the city of Maracay. 
 A report in January by the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency pegged Venezuela's arms purchases in the past two years at $4.3 billion, ahead of Pakistan's $3 billion and Iran's $1.7 billion in that period. 
 In a statement before the House Intelligence Committee, Lt. Gen. Michael D. Maples, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, called attention to Mr. Chavez's ''agenda to neutralize U.S. influence throughout the hemisphere,'' contrasting Mr. Chavez with the ''reformist left'' exemplified by President Michelle Bachelet of Chile. 
 Beyond Russia, Venezuela is also considering a venture with Iran, its closest ally outside Latin America, to build a remotely piloted patrol aircraft. Gen. Raul Isaias Baduel, the Venezuelan defense minister, recently told reporters that the project to build 20 of the aircraft could be used to bolster border surveillance and combat environmental destruction in Venezuela. Venezuela is also strengthening military ties with Cuba, sending officers and soldiers there for training.
 Supporters of the arms buildup contend that under Mr. Chavez, who has been in power for eight years, Venezuela has spent proportionately less on its military in relation to the size of its economy than the United States or than other South American countries like Chile and Colombia. 
 In 2004, the last year for which comparative data were immediately available and before Venezuela's arms buildup intensified, overall defense spending by Venezuela, including arms contracts, was about $1.3 billion and accounted for about 1.4 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 4 percent in the United States and 3.8 percent in Colombia, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which tracks military spending.
 Doubts persist as to how powerful Venezuela's armed forces have become in a regional context, even as they acquire new weapons. Military experts here say pilots in the air force still need training to start flying their new Russian fighters. And in terms of troop strength, Venezuela's 34,000-soldier active-duty army still lags behind the armies of Argentina and Brazil, with about 41,400 and 200,000 members respectively, according to GlobalSecurity.org, a Web site that compiles data on military topics. 
 Pro-Chavez analysts also say the president is less adventurous in relation to military policy outside Venezuela than predecessors like Luis Herrera Campins, who supported Argentina in the Falklands War in 1982 to detract attention from a decline in oil revenue and climbing inflation. 
 But critics of the arms purchases say they are being made with little participation from or discussion with the National Assembly, which recently allowed Mr. Chavez to govern by decree for 18 months. 
 Ricardo Sucre, a political scientist at the Central University of Venezuela, said that the lack of transparency of the weapons contracts had heightened concern that Mr. Chavez could be arming parts of the army, the new civilian reserve and partisans like the Frente Francisco de Miranda, a pro-Chavez political group, that would be loyal to him in the event of fractures within the armed forces. 
 General Muller Rojas, the president's military adviser, said concern about the arms purchases was overblown, pointing to reports that Venezuela was considering an acquisition of nine diesel-powered submarines from Russia for about $3 billion. 
 He said the navy had ''aspirations'' for more submarines, but that no ''concrete plan'' for such a large contract had been developed. 
 ''We simply have an interest in maintaining peace and stability,'' General Muller Rojas said, describing the Caribbean as a crucial to its military influence. ''We have no intent of using the Venezuelan armed forces to repress human rights.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 9, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article on Feb. 25 about an escalation in Venezuela's arms spending referred incorrectly to a statistic cited by the Defense Intelligence Agency of the United States as evidence of a rapid arms buildup. It was a 12.5 percent increase in Venezuela's 2006 defense budget, not an increase in the value of arms purchased by Venezuela last year.

HEADLINE: Software Tool of Pirates Gets Work in Hollywood

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
Hollywood studios are going into business with one of their biggest tormentors: the peer-to-peer pioneer BitTorrent.
 On Monday, the company, whose technology unleashed a wave of illegal file-sharing on the Internet, plans to unveil the BitTorrent Entertainment Network on its Web site, BitTorrent.com. The digital media store will offer around 3,000 new and classic movies and thousands more television shows, as well as a thousand PC games and music videos each, all legally available for purchase.
The programming comes from studios, including 20th Century Fox, Paramount and Warner Brothers, that previously announced their intention to work with BitTorrent. There is also a new partner: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which will take part by making 100 films available on the site from its 4,000-movie library. 
 ''Somebody once said you have to embrace your enemy,'' said Doug Lee, executive vice president of MGM's new-media division. ''We like the idea that they have millions of users worldwide. That is potentially fertile, legitimate ground for us.'' 
 The BitTorrent store will work slightly differently than rival digital media offerings like the iTunes Store of Apple and the Xbox Live service of Microsoft. BitTorrent will commingle free downloads of users' own video uploads with sales of professional fare. And while it will sell digital copies of shows like ''24'' and ''Bones'' for $1.99 an episode, it will only rent movies. Once the films are on the PC, they expire within 30 days of purchase or 24 hours after the buyer begins to watch them. 
 New releases like ''Superman Returns'' cost $3.99, while older movies like ''Reservoir Dogs'' cost $2.99. The studios' content plays in Microsoft's Windows Media Player 11. It is protected by Microsoft's antipiracy software, which blocks users from watching rented movies on more than one PC or sending them to others over the Internet.
 Ashwin Navin, BitTorrent's co-founder and president, said the company had secured the right to permit users to buy outright digital copies of films, but the studios wanted to charge prices that would be too high for most consumers. ''We don't think the current prices are a smart thing to show any user,'' he said. ''We want to allocate services with very digestible price points.'' 
 BitTorrent, which is based in San Francisco and has 45 employees, will face significant challenges as it tries to carve out some space in the emerging digital downloading landscape. Apple is the largest presence among the legitimate Internet media stores. ITunes, which has sold more than a billion dollars worth of digital music, sells movies from Walt Disney and Paramount and programs from all the major TV networks.
 Other entrants in the nascent field include Walmart.com, MovieLink.com (owned by four of the studios) and Amazon Unbox, which recently announced a way for TiVo users to download movies to their television instead of watching them on smaller PC screens.
 Michael McGuire, a vice president at the research firm Gartner, said BitTorrent and its rivals all face the same challenge: ''They must get consumers to look at this as a better and more reliable way to watch a movie than renting a DVD.''
 There is also the illegal economy in pirated video content, whose size dwarfs that of the legal online media stores. The Motion Picture Association of America has said that a million movies are illegally acquired every day using BitTorrent technology. The software is open source, so versions of it, as well as Web sites offering pirated movies, are maintained by companies not affiliated with BitTorrent.
 Bram Cohen, BitTorrent's co-founder and chief executive and the inventor of the technology, said the new store would offer a compelling alternative to the illegal system. ''I think what consumers want is a good experience,'' he said, ''and the first part of that is making the content they want available legitimately.''
 But he added that the antipiracy software that will protect files in the new store, which the studios insist on including, will make the experience more cumbersome for users. ''We are not happy with the user interface implications'' of digital rights management, or D.R.M., Mr. Cohen said. ''It's an unfortunate thing. We would really like to strip it all away.''
 BitTorrent's store will have some advantages over legal rivals. Its peer-to-peer technology introduced by Mr. Cohen in 2001 works by taking pieces of large files from nearby computer users who have that file, permitting speedy downloads.
 In a test of the new BitTorrent store, downloading the film ''X-Men 3'' took two hours with a broadband Internet connection. Downloading the same movie from Walmart.com took three hours. And BitTorrent downloads should theoretically become faster as more people sign up, since digital copies will originate from nearby computers whose owners have bought the movie, instead of from a central server.
 The company, which has received close to $30 million in venture capital, ultimately wants to use its media store to demonstrate how the underlying technology is effective at moving large files around the Internet. It wants to sell the technology to other media stores and to the studios themselves. 
 The studios hope the new BitTorrent will put a dent in the illegal trading of their content. Thomas Lesinski, president of Paramount Pictures Digital Entertainment, said he hoped the store would win over young people accustomed to free fare. ''We look at this as a first step in the peer-to-peer world, to try to steer people toward legitimate content,'' he said.
 BitTorrent executives say they are not able to prevent illegal downloads in the larger file-sharing world. But they cite internal studies that say 34 percent of BitTorrent users would pay for content if a comprehensive, legal service were available.
 That group clearly does not include Aaron, a 36-year-old programmer in San Francisco who does not want his full name used because he and his wife regularly use BitTorrent to download songs, movies and TV shows illegally. 
 After trying a test version of the legal BitTorrent store, he said it would not persuade him to abandon the limitless selection of content and freedom he enjoys on free BitTorrent sites.
 ''The sad thing is, it's not about the money,'' he said. ''I'm not interested in renting a movie. I want to own it. I want total portability. I want to give a copy to my brother. Digital convergence is supposed to make things like this easier, but D.R.M. is making them harder.''

HEADLINE: Brooklyn's Team-to-Be Hasn't Found Welcome Mat

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 

 BODY:
Three hours before the Nets were scheduled to play the Knicks in New Jersey yesterday, Rev. Clinton Miller sat in his office at the Brown Memorial Baptist Church in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn.
 Miller wanted to talk basketball, not Knicks-Nets basketball, but the business of basketball. Specifically, he wanted to talk about the Nets' move to Brooklyn for the 2009-10 season.
The Nets are coming to Brooklyn as part of the $4.2 billion Atlantic Yards development. The project, by Forest City Ratner, was unveiled in 2003. Forest City Ratner is also the development partner in building the Midtown Manhattan headquarters for The New York Times Company. 
 The revitalized Atlantic Yards would include residential and office towers and a basketball arena for the Nets. A substantial portion of subsidized housing will be for families at different income levels, but only about one-seventh of the project's roughly 6,000 units will be affordable for tenants making less than half the median income for the New York City area.
 This move has been the political and cultural hot-button issue of a sprawling Brooklyn community. There is significant support for the project and significant opposition. There is also determined neutrality, with everyone angling for a slice of a multibillion-dollar pie. 
 Miller said that he had not committed. ''I haven't supported it and I haven't really opposed it,'' he said yesterday afternoon. ''I've criticized the lack of transparency, from the beginning. 
 ''I haven't personalized, I haven't attacked anybody. I've just tried to stay in the middle of the road. I've never been opposed to it, because I've never wanted to take myself away from the opportunity to negotiate.'' 
 Miller's is a moderate voice in a choir of passionate voices who have either screamed ''Yes'' or No'' to the Nets' move. 
 Miller is also part of the basketball fabric of the community. He was raised in Crown Heights. He played basketball at Bishop Loughlin High School and was elected captain in 1985. Then he played at Division II Southern Connecticut State University. After graduating, he taught high school in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, then attended Yale Divinity School. After an apprenticeship at Abyssinian Baptist in Harlem, he became pastor at Brown Memorial six years ago.
 ''I am part of the basketball fabric,'' he said. ''I love the game. I still play. But ultimately, this has less to do with basketball and more to do with real estate.''
 The controversy surrounding the Nets' impending move to Brooklyn confirms my suspicion -- that it will not give the Nets the identity they have lacked virtually from the time they entered the N.B.A. 
 No one seems to be talking about how great it is to have Brooklyn's first real professional team since the Brooklyn Dodgers. The talk centers on who will benefit from the team's economic presence and who will lose. The Nets, as a focal point for a diverse community, have already become a polarizing force rather than the unifying entity that a sports team can be. 
 ''Even when the Knicks are not doing well, it's still a ticket to get,'' Miller said. ''The Nets went to the championship two years in a row and the place wasn't sold out. They're still searching as a franchise for an identity.''
 But who represents the community in this tug of war? And what, precisely, is the community? 
 ''This neighborhood is unlike any neighborhood in America,'' Miller said. ''It's already diverse and I feel that gentrification should happen organically; it shouldn't be expedited by megadevelopment.'' 
 Fort Greene's diversity is a plus as well as part of a broader problem. At least one community organization that supports the project receives funds from the developer as part of a Community Benefits Agreement. Brooklyn United for Innovative Local Development, a job-training group known as Build, receives funds from Forest City Ratner. 
 Miller said he spoke with Ratner about Barclays Bank's plan to donate $2.5 million to refurbish basketball courts in the community, a contribution that Miller and other critics say is not substantial enough. 
 ''Ratner promised to approach representatives of Barclays to meet with five of us,'' Miller said. ''Three elected officials and two preachers.'' 
 Gentrification is hardly a Brooklyn concern alone, but the Nets' move has crystallized the issue. 
 ''If you bring 6,000 units of housing, most of which will be market rate, from the perspective of being a pastor of working-class people, that knocks a lot of our members out of the neighborhood,'' Miller said. 
 Many of his members have moved -- some to Long Island, some to the Poconos.
 ''They just can't afford to live here,'' Miller said. ''Some can afford to because they have brownstones, but they've been made an offer they can't refuse.'' 
 Last night, the Nets defeated the Knicks, 101-92, to win a battle in the standings. The Nets' continuing quest to win people's hearts will require a much greater fight.

HEADLINE: Nation of Islam At a Crossroad As Leader Exits

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
Louis Farrakhan, the departing leader of the Nation of Islam, gave what was billed as his last major public address here on Sunday, with his extended illness throwing into sharp focus the question of whether the group will shift toward more mainstream Islamic teachings to survive once it loses its central charismatic figure.
 Mr. Farrakhan, 73, looking fairly robust for a man who emerged from major surgery six weeks ago, spent most of his two-hour address denouncing the war in Iraq and calling for the impeachment of President Bush.
''If you don't want to impeach him,'' Mr. Farrakhan said, ''censure him, say to the world something went wrong with our leadership and we repent after our wrongdoing.'' 
 He also made an appeal for religious unity in the address before thousands at Ford Field, home to the Detroit Lions football team, capping an annual convention of Nation of Islam members. 
 It was his first major speech since August, when health problems forced him to turn over control of the Nation of Islam to an executive committee. His health problems stemmed from radiation seeds implanted a decade ago to combat prostate cancer, said Ishmael Muhammad, the organization's national assistant minister. The treatment obliterated the cancer but also damaged nearby organs. 
 Given his age and health problems, and the lack of an obvious successor, questions loom large about the future and direction of the Nation of Islam. 
 Nation members dismiss the notion that the organization's viability is linked to one man. But academic experts and Muslim leaders say they believe that without Mr. Farrakhan's leadership, the Nation -- which has been divided over its teachings in the past -- will shrink even more dramatically unless it shifts toward mainstream Islam's beliefs. 
 The 77-year-old Nation of Islam once enjoyed a near monopoly over interpreting Islam for black Americans, using the faith as a vehicle to promote black separatism. 
 But it now competes with sects that branched away, and with groups ascribing to the more traditional and inclusive Islam followed by millions of Muslim immigrants and their offspring. 
 Along with a significant bloc of former Nation members, many of these Muslim branches oppose crucial aspects of the organization's beliefs, which some consider blasphemy.
 Leadership changes have altered the Nation's direction in the past. Elijah Muhammad, the organization's leader for more than 40 years until his death in 1975, was succeeded by one of his sons, Warith Deen, who broke with his father over the issue of Islamic orthodoxy (and changed his last name to Mohammed). Following Warith Deen Mohammed, this branch embraced diversity and traditional Sunni Islam's teachings on unity. 
 Although members of his branch and Mr. Farrakhan's now profess to respect each other and display less public animosity than in the early days of their split, they still spar over their beliefs.
 Imam Muhammad Siddeeq, an Indianapolis cleric and senior aide to Mr. Mohammed, said that for the Nation of Islam to survive, it must turn more toward mainstream Islam. 
 ''In the final analysis they have no option but to move in the direction we are or to just dissipate or disappear,'' Mr. Siddeeq said. ''This community is going to reconcile itself to pure Islam and reconcile itself to being American citizens who are part of a multicultural society.'' 
 He echoes many others in arguing that the Nation should abandon some of its teachings. The Nation holds, among other teachings, that the group's founder, W. Fard Muhammad, was the Mahdi, or savior, sent by God to Detroit around 1930 and that spaceships hovering above the earth will eventually play a major role in smiting sinners and rescuing the righteous. 
 ''Those are ideas for kindergarten, a trip to Oz,'' Mr. Siddeeq said. ''Those are not ideas for people living in the real world.''
 Ishmael Muhammad, 42, the Nation's national assistant minister, who said he was among the youngest of Elijah Muhammad's 21 children, said the Nation's message of social reform still resonated, especially its call for black economic empowerment. 
 ''There are a few black politicians and a few millionaires and a couple billionaires, but the fact is that our people are dying,'' he said in an interview. ''Our struggle to integrate and be accepted has left the masses behind.''
 Ishmael Muhammad has sometimes been named as a possible successor to Mr. Farrakhan, as have a couple of Mr. Farrakhan's sons, but none of them enjoy the same wide following as the departing leader. 
 But Ishmael Muhammad responds that the era of charismatic leaders is over -- that one main goal of the Nation is teaching people to be self-sufficient, particularly in their relationship to God.
 Despite his frail health, Mr. Farrakhan on Sunday demonstrated the same passion that has held followers rapt and angered his detractors. He assailed the Bush administration for the war in Iraq, which he said was built on lies and had caused great suffering and disunity.
 ''Sunni and Shiite lived together, Christian and Jews lived together in Iraq, you didn't hear none of this stuff before America came in,'' Mr. Farrakhan said. ''There was no bombing of Shiite holy places. You don't need to look at Shiite and Sunni, you need to look at those who came in. After they came in all hell broke loose.''
 Mr. Farrakhan also urged young black Americans not to join the military.
 ''I am telling you brother and sister that will be the worst mistake you make to join the military today, because you will leave America in one way and you will come back in another,'' he said.
 Back in the 1950s and '60s, as the battle for civil rights was growing, the separatist message, and storied converts like Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali, won the Nation a broad appeal. But Malcolm X quit the movement and was eventually assassinated by Nation members in a fight provoked partly over Islamic orthodoxy. 
 ''We could not continue on this Black supremacist line and be Muslims, be part of the world community of Islam,'' said Imam Faheem Shuaibe of the Masjidul Waritheen in Oakland, Calif. ''When you say Muhammad is the messenger of God, but you mean Elijah Muhammad, it doesn't work.'' 
 Reliable statistics are very hard to come by for Muslims in the United States, but the middle range puts the population around six million; some 40 percent of them are African-Americans, a majority of whom follow Warith Deen Mohammed, experts said. 
 The Nation of Islam will not specify its membership numbers. But Lawrence A. Mamiya, a professor of religion and African studies at Vassar College, puts the number around 50,000, with an ardent following in prisons, where the emphasis on black identity and the struggle against racism, he said, have a pervasive appeal. There are also small branches scattered around the world, particularly in England and the Caribbean. 
 Breaking away from Warith Deen Mohammed's reforms, Mr. Farrakhan began rebuilding the Nation based upon its original principles in 1978. He introduced stricter Islamic precepts into the Nation, including prayer five times a day. Members hold that they are just as Muslim as any of the faithful, indeed that North American black slaves were a kind of lost tribe of Muslims forgotten by the faith's mainstream. 
 But along with his reforms, Mr. Farrakhan gained notoriety and drew widespread criticism for speeches that were deemed racist against whites, particularly Jews.
 In 1995, he organized the Million Man March on Washington, and although he failed to translate that into a sustainable political movement, he became one ofthe few leaders who appealed to a wide spectrum of black Americans. 
 Academics who study Islam in America suggest that the followers of Mr. Farrakhan and Warith Deen Mohammed will eventually gravitate elsewhere. 
 One possible national leader is Siraj Wahhaj, an imam based in Brooklyn. He quit the Nation years ago but came to the convention here to lead Friday prayers, urging Muslim unity in a sermon liberally sprinkled with quotes from the Koran in fluent Arabic.
 Many immigrant Muslims question whether Nation members should be called Muslims. Even the followers of Warith Deen Mohammed are criticized by some for giving more weight to his pronouncements than to the holy texts.
 ''They still haven't reached the point where there is no color,'' said Yassir Chadly, an imam based in Oakland, who immigrated from Morocco 30 years ago. ''Islam is universal; it can't be cut into little sections.'' 
 Such statements make followers of the Nation bristle.
 ''We are not imitators of Arab culture; that would put us in an inferior position and make them our superiors,'' said Muhammad Muhammad, a 40-year-old adherent from Oklahoma City.
 In the long run, academic experts said, it is the debate over religion that will most likely relegate the organization to a marginal position after Mr. Farrakhan is gone. 
 ''He talked black, but to join his organization you had to commit yourself to his religion, and the religion has a lot of quirks in it,'' said Ihsan Bagby, an associate professor of Arabic and Islamic studies at the University of Kentucky.
 Mr. Bagby said that younger Nation members and potential members might find it hard to accept all of the branch's teachings. ''They are realizing that you can be committed to the black community and have a black agenda and still be a Sunni Muslim.''

HEADLINE: Bruno's Business Touch Wasn't Always Golden

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
It is an oft-told tale that has become part of Albany lore. Long before he became the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno borrowed $5,000 to start a telephone equipment company, built it into a profitable business and sold it for $23 million in 1990. Born into poverty, Mr. Bruno became a millionaire.
 Or did he?
A review of records and interviews with his former partners showed that while Mr. Bruno indeed built his publicly traded firm, Coradian Corporation, from scratch, its sale did not make him a millionaire. In fact, the company had been steadily losing money, and Mr. Bruno made less than $400,000 from the transaction. 
 As a result, Mr. Bruno began to pursue other sources of money, and those pursuits are now the subject of a federal investigation. 
 Some of Mr. Bruno's other business ventures, before and after he sold Coradian, did poorly. In one case, he lost about $150,000 on a real estate project that dragged on for 17 years, a former partner said. And in the past six years, he has lost at least $50,000 on investments in high-tech companies, according to financial disclosure records and interviews with his aides.
 Mr. Bruno's mixed success as a businessman might have important implications for a federal grand jury investigation into his financial dealings. Soon after selling Coradian, Mr. Bruno -- who has for years complained that being in office has hurt his ability to make money -- opened a consulting business out of his home. That business is now the focus of the federal investigation into whether Mr. Bruno provided government favors to his consulting clients, people who have been briefed about the inquiry have said.
 Records show that the consulting business has been a consistently reliable stream of income for Mr. Bruno. Yet the firm does not advertise or have a published telephone number and Mr. Bruno has refused to publicly identify its clients, describing them only as ''substantial and important business people.''
 Mr. Bruno, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has consistently defended his right to remain a businessman while serving in the Legislature, asserting that he has never used his power to enrich himself or his business associates. 
 It is impossible to know the full extent of Mr. Bruno's wealth because he is not required to provide details about his income or assets on disclosure forms made available to the public. There are no indications that he is in financial trouble; he lives on a sprawling farm in Rensselaer County, owns thoroughbred horses and earns $121,000 as majority leader. 
 But interviews and documents suggested that Mr. Bruno, 77, has remained an active consultant and aggressive investor in part because he felt he needed the money. He suggested as much in an interview with The New York Times in December.
 ''Nobody wants to hear it, but my being in office has cost me a fortune -- millions, literally millions,'' he said. ''I'm worth a hell of a lot less today than I was 30 years ago. That's kind of sad. I'm worth a hell of a lot less now than I was 10 years ago.''
 By his own account, Mr. Bruno overcame humble origins in upstate poverty by selling ice and frozen food, obtaining an undergraduate degree in business administration and, in the 1950s, teaming with an older businessman, Stanley B. Ringel, to sell insurance and mutual funds. In the late 1960s, Mr. Ringel and Mr. Bruno began selling office telephone equipment, forming what would become Coradian.
 Mr. Bruno, who associates said was a gifted salesman, handled the marketing side and pursued a second career in politics, while Mr. Ringel, the chief executive, managed the day-to-day operations. By 1981, Coradian had revenues of $35 million and employed about 500 people.
 But a major supplier dropped its contract, profits dried up, workers were let go, and an ailing Mr. Ringel stepped aside as chief executive, allowing Mr. Bruno to take over. 
 In the years after Mr. Bruno was elected to the State Senate in 1976, questions were raised about possible ethical conflicts, since Coradian received $1.5 million in state contracts from 1983 to 1988, according to The Times Union of Albany. The State Commission on Government Integrity investigated Coradian's contracts with state and local government agencies in 1988, but reported no evidence of wrongdoing.
 By 1989, with Coradian hemorrhaging cash and unable to pay its debts, the company was put up for sale. It hired a consultant to interview 24 prospective buyers, but 19 expressed no interest, securities filings showed.
 Mitel, a Canadian firm that was a major equipment supplier to Coradian, eventually agreed to buy it, paying $10 million in cash and assuming $13 million in debt. Numerous newspaper accounts since then, including in The Times, have stated or implied that the $23 million sale price resulted in a windfall for Mr. Bruno worth millions of dollars.
 In reality, Mr. Bruno owned only enough shares to earn at most $383,000 from the sale, according to the securities filings, and he agreed to remain with the newly merged company for a couple of years at his old salary of $110,000.
 George L. Benson, Coradian's president at the time of the sale, recalled recently that ''nobody made a lot of money out of it, I can tell you that. It was a graceful exit. That was all it was.''
 Even before leaving Coradian, Mr. Bruno began pursuing other ways to make money, an effort that intensified after the sale of the company. One of the earliest was a partnership called First Grafton that he created in 1987, along with his brother and some friends, to purchase and develop a large tract of forest into home sites, a project that seemed vexed from the start and would not be completed until just a few years ago.
 After two of his original partners bowed out, Mr. Bruno's solution -- to replace them with two lawyer-lobbyists he knew from his work at Coradian and the state capital -- inflamed old charges of ethical carelessness that had begun to dog his Senate career. The ensuing uproar forced Mr. Bruno to place his interest in First Grafton into a blind trust.
 One of the lobbyists, James D. Featherstonhaugh, has represented dozens of special interest groups, including banks, insurance companies, the horse racing industry and labor unions. In December, the federal grand jury investigating Mr. Bruno sent a subpoena to Mr. Featherstonhaugh for First Grafton's records.
 Mr. Featherstonhaugh said everyone involved in First Grafton had lost money, and he estimated Mr. Bruno's losses totaled about $150,000 over the 17 years that the project dragged on. Despite that, he said Mr. Bruno ''never seemed to be in financial stress.'' The senator, he said, tended to be frugal. 
 ''He has never struck me as either outrageously wealthy or poor,'' Mr. Featherstonhaugh said. ''He just seemed to me to be kind of O.K.''
 Mr. Bruno's willingness to mix public and private interests was apparent in another real estate deal he entered into in 1999, when he and his son Joseph bought a small apartment house in Troy from Russell C. Ball, a state contractor whose wife, Dori Evans, served as finance director for the Senate Republican campaign committee, which Mr. Bruno controls.
 Mr. Ball's Brooklyn-based company, which does underground utility work, has had contracts on several major state projects, and a couple of years ago he created a nonprofit group that purchased full-page newspaper ads saluting Mr. Bruno. An official familiar with the investigation said the F.B.I. has questioned people about Mr. Ball's relationship with Mr. Bruno. Mr. Ball had no comment.
 Not long after buying the building, Mr. Bruno's son decided he wanted out, and Mr. Bruno tapped a friend and neighbor, Joseph L. Magno, to step in and replace his son in the investment and on a $235,000 loan used to buy the property. 
 ''He literally said, 'Will you please help me out,' '' said Mr. Magno, who is now a lobbyist. He said that he lost as much as $30,000 on the investment, and that Mr. Bruno lost money as well. 
 Mr. Magno was not just a friend, but also an investor in high-tech companies. In 2000, Mr. Magno agreed to help Mr. Bruno, the senator secured $150,000 in state money to start a statewide trade association of technology firms headed by Mr. Magno.
 The same year, an Internet company called Go2pay, whose directors included Mr. Magno, received $250,000 in state economic development funds, at a ceremony presided over by Mr. Bruno and Gov. George E. Pataki.
 Mr. Bruno did not lose money on all his ventures. His financial disclosure statements showed that he seemed to have earned money, on a regular basis, from the consulting business he started, Capital Business Consultants L.L.C. 
 In a news conference in December when he revealed the F.B.I. inquiry, Mr. Bruno said he provided advice on marketing and business development to lawyers and businesspeople. He declined to release information about his fees or the names of his clients, though some have been identified as a result of the investigation.
 One of his first clients was McGinn Smith, an Albany investment firm. Mr. Bruno has invested both personal and campaign funds in companies controlled by McGinn Smith's chairman, Timothy M. McGinn. In 1999, Mr. Bruno reported making an undisclosed amount of money on the sale of stock in Pointe Financial, a bank holding company of which Mr. McGinn was chairman. It was one of Mr. Bruno's few profitable stock investments in recent years.
 Another consulting client was Jared Abbruzzese, a businessman and friend who has flown Mr. Bruno around on private jets and who, until recently, was part of a group competing for a statewide horse racing franchise. From 2002 to 2004, Mr. Bruno decided to award $500,000 in discretionary state grants to a company in which Mr. Abbruzzese was a major investor, Evident Technologies. 
 The F.B.I. is now investigating Mr. Bruno's dealings with both McGinn Smith and Mr. Abbruzzese, people who have been briefed about the inquiry said.
 Mr. Bruno has defended his use of state money to support Evident and other businesses, saying his only goal was to create jobs. His aides have also shrugged off questions about his overlapping personal and public interests, saying that Mr. Bruno has been in business and politics so long that interaction with people in both spheres was unavoidable.
 To old friends and supporters, some of whom have benefited from the millions in public money that Mr. Bruno has directed to projects over the years, the senator's current predicament is heartbreaking. Mr. Benson, who was once Mr. Bruno's partner at Coradian, said he recently heard about the F.B.I. investigation while listening to the radio and immediately called Mr. Bruno.
 ''Joe called me back and left a message, saying he was O.K., that he had been re-elected majority leader and that everything was under control,'' Mr. Benson said from his home in Wisconsin. ''But I have to say, he didn't sound all that good.''

HEADLINE: Making the Return Trip: Elderly Head Back North

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
For the first time since the Depression, more Americans ages 75 and older have been leaving the South than moving there, according to a New York Times analysis of Census Bureau data.
 The reversal appears to be driven in part by older people who retired to the South in their 60s, but decided to return home to their children and grandchildren in the Northeast, Midwest and West after losing spouses or becoming less mobile.
 A stream of elderly transplants leaving Florida was detected by sociologists two decades ago, including so-called half-backs, who stopped short of returning to their home states and settled elsewhere in the South. What is new is the growth in the number of people leaving the region entirely and the dimension of the migration. 
 ''As the numbers increase of people in their early to mid-60s that move from the North to the South, we would also expect the numbers of people 75 and older that move from the South to the North to subsequently increase as well,'' said Grant I. Thrall, a geography professor at the University of Florida in Gainesville. 
 While the number of people ages 75 and older who move at all is relatively small, a survey of geographic mobility released last month estimated that about 121,000 of them left the South from 2000 to 2005, and 87,000 arrived. In a comparable survey a decade earlier, 57,000 left the South and 92,000 moved there.
 From 1995 to 2000, another Census Bureau survey of migration patterns found, for the first time slightly more people ages 85 and older left Florida than settled there. 
 The shifting trends in migration to and from the South might be attributable in part to differences in generation size and other variables, including fluctuations year to year. From 2004 to 2005, a separate Census Bureau survey reported a slight gain in migrants 75 and older to the South. 
 Phillip Salopek, a Census Bureau demographer, said that while the census sample was small, he ''wouldn't have any hesitation to use the number'' in analyzing migration trends for the region over a five-year period.
 William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, said, ''The South, and Florida especially, has been a magnet for yuppie elderly: younger seniors with spouse present and in good health. 
 ''These are a catch for communities that receive them, because they have ample disposable incomes and make few demands on public services,'' he continued. ''The older senior population, especially after 80, are more likely to be widowed, less well off and more in need of social and economic support.'' 
 ''Many northern states seem to have better senior services than Florida,'' Dr. Frey added.
 The Census Bureau defines the South as the 16 states that stretch from Texas to Florida, including Maryland, Kentucky and Oklahoma. Census Bureau surveys ask where people were living one year and five years earlier, not whether they have returned to their home state. But the anecdotal evidence seems compelling.
 Virginia Halloran, 83, and her husband, Fred, retired to Florida in 1978 from Cape Cod, Mass. After Mr. Halloran died in 1995, Mrs. Halloran, a former school psychologist, stayed in Atlantis, Fla., just south of Palm Beach. 
 In 2005, after she had both knees replaced and grew anxious over forecasts of more hurricanes, she moved to a one-bedroom apartment in a Westwood, Mass., retirement community, a short drive from her children and grandchildren.
 ''It was just to make life simpler for me,'' she said, ''and, I think, simpler for them.'' 
 Sharon Cofar, who runs a Coral Springs, Fla., company called A Move Made Easy, a relocation service that caters to older movers, said the migration had accelerated since Hurricane Wilma struck in 2005. 
 ''It was very difficult for the adult children to cope with the hurricanes and their inability to help their parents at this difficult time,'' Ms. Cofar said, ''and many do not want the parents to go through it again, nor do they want to care-give long distance any more.''
 Since last year, Ida Kotowitz, 88, has been living in a retirement home in the Bronx, not far from her daughter and grandchildren, where she moved after 22 years in Florida. ''I was failing in health, most of my friends have passed away and I was alone,'' Ms. Kotowitz said. ''Friends are all right when you're well, but when you're not, you need family.'' 
 In 1996, Constance Bialek moved with her husband, Fred, to Florida from California after he received a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. He died four years ago. Last November, Mrs. Bialek, 78, moved to an assisted living center across the street from her daughter's apartment on the West Side of Manhattan. 
 Mrs. Bialek said she did not miss ''all those silly accidents with old ladies who don't know how to drive,'' adding that the diversity of New York City ''makes you feel more alive, it keeps you interested in life.'' 
 Mildred Morrison, administrator for the Area Agency on Aging of Allegheny, Pa., which includes Pittsburgh, described return migration as part of a natural progression. 
 ''They usually leave after retirement to a warmer climate, and return in good physical health, but maybe on the cusp of declining health, 10 years or so later,'' Ms. Morrison said, mostly to ''reconnect with family.''
 Not all transplants go home. Aaron Green, 83, a New York postal worker, retired to East Lake, Fla., just outside St. Petersburg, about 20 years ago, then relocated to a garden apartment in Pittsburgh near his son and daughter last year after his wife died. 
 ''When my wife passed on, my son said, 'I think it's time to come home with us,' '' Mr. Green recalled. ''I said, 'I think so, too.' '' 
 Demographers say that the last time more older people left the South than moved there was during the Depression, when there was a net loss of people older than 65. Among those 75 and older ''the ratio of in-movers to out-movers has been declining steadily over time,'' said Stan Smith, director of the Bureau of Economic and Business Research at the University of Florida in Gainesville.
 Calvin Beale, senior demographer of the Economic Research Service at the federal Department of Agriculture, said: ''After age 75, as health diminishes and/or widowhood occurs, there is some measure of return flow back to areas of origin, or wherever a caretaker-minded son or daughter lives. And this means a net outflow from the South.''
 An analysis by demographers at Queens College of the City University of New York suggests that those 75 and older who left the South were fairly evenly divided between married and widowed. More of the movers were likely to be women and white. 
 After his wife died, Al Petzke, an 82-year-old former steelworker, returned to the Cleveland area from Houston to be closer to his only son. 
 ''It didn't make one bit of sense for my son to be spending all that money every month flying down to see me,'' Mr. Petzke said. His retirement home is in Berea, Ohio, just down the street from the bar at the Eastland Inn, where he used to stop after work. 
 ''I know exactly how I want to die,'' he said. ''I want to go over to the Eastland Inn, have a shot of whiskey and a beer, and then they can take me to the funeral home.''

HEADLINE: 2-Year International Study of Polar Changes Set to Begin

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
Scientists from more than 60 countries are preparing to fan out around the North and South Poles in an ambitious two-year effort to understand the vital, shifting dynamics of ice, oceans and life at the ends of the earth. 
 With a budget of about $350 million spread over more than 120 projects, researchers will camp on drifting Arctic Ocean sea ice and trek to largely uncharted Antarctic mountains. 
They will use gliding underwater robots, giant icebreaking ships, satellites and other technologies to explore polar climate, biology, geology and ocean chemistry, and they will undertake physics and astronomy studies that can be done only at the poles.
 A central goal of the effort -- called the International Polar Year despite its two-year timetable -- is to clarify the role of greenhouse gases and global warming in the rapid changes that are already occurring at both poles. 
 In the Arctic, sea ice in summer has been in an accelerating retreat. In parts of Antarctica that are warming, coastal ice shelves and inland ice sheets have been disintegrating and surging seaward in ways that could hint at a faster rise in global sea levels in coming decades.
 But at both poles, scientists say, questions still outnumber answers. 
 The project will formally begin Thursday. Opening ceremonies will be held today in Washington, London and Strasbourg, France.
 This is just the fourth such integrated Arctic and Antarctic science effort since 1881. The last such project, which included broader studies of the oceans and earth, ended in 1958.
 John H. Marburger III, the science adviser to President Bush, said the United States had a vital interest in studies at both poles. 
 ''The North Pole is in our backyard,'' he said in an e-mail message. ''The U.S. has huge geopolitical interests in the Arctic region, and we need to understand the changes that are taking place there. Many other countries have direct economic interests in the Arctic, and all are served by joining forces in I.P.Y. research. Additionally the rapidly diminishing ice in the Arctic is creating new opportunities for transport and marine resource development.
 ''The South Pole is on a major continent, still poorly understood,'' Dr. Marburger added. ''With the exception of the Arctic Ocean, all the oceans of the Earth communicate in the Antarctic region, which makes it a significant factor in processes of global change, particularly as influenced by ocean currents. It offers remarkable opportunities for astronomy, and is already the site of a sophisticated neutrino detector utilizing the deep and stable ice deposits near the pole. 
 ''Antarctic marine organisms are an integral part of the increasingly vulnerable marine wildlife environment, and play a significant role in the world food chain.''
 Other studies will examine the impact of pollution, retreating sea ice, thawing tundra and other fast-changing conditions on native communities ringing the Arctic Ocean. 
 Some projects are utilitarian, like fresh surveys of ocean-bottom terrain and studies sifting for hints of oil and gas or other natural resources.
 But the most pressing questions being pursued relate to warming caused by the atmospheric buildup of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide. Experts involved with the polar year say the earth's coldest places are likely to be especially affected.
 ''The poles are going to lead the way in climate change,'' said Ted Scambos, a researcher at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo. ''To know what we're in for in the next 10 years, in sea level or in climate, we need to look at the poles now. They are the amplifiers of the small warming that greenhouse gases cause.''
 Particularly urgent, many experts said, is the need to improve understanding of the complicated forces that might cause warming ice sheets in Greenland and parts of Antarctica to flow more quickly into the sea. 
 Greenland's vast ice cap is twice the size of California, and it holds as much water as the Gulf of Mexico. If it all melted, sea levels from Boston to Bangladesh would rise more than 20 feet, experts say.
 The latest report on sea level trends by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said such melting could take a millennium or more. But because of a lack of long-term measurements and poor understanding of the physics of ice, that analysis largely excluded hints of an accelerating flow of ice and meltwater from Greenland into the seas. 
 ''The change of phase from snow and ice to water is the biggest tipping point in the earth's system, and so although the International Polar Year covers a huge range of science, for me the big issue is climate change and the impact that it's having here,'' said Chris Rapley, the director of the British Antarctic Survey, in a message from Antarctica. 
 ''Over the next two years, I'm looking forward to major progress on key issues,'' he said. ''The trillion-dollar question from the point of view of sea-level rise: how much, how quickly?''
 The climatic equations are complicated. Over the two years -- researchers want to study both regions through complete summer and winter cycles -- teams will examine the effects of shifting solar activity, greenhouse gases and the synthetic chemicals that harm the ozone layer, which have an outsize impact at the poles. 
 Other scientists will intensively study the warming of the permafrost and tundra across vast stretches of northern continents for signs that thawing ground, bogs and lakes are giving up emissions of methane and carbon dioxide. 
 Marine scientists will plumb the Arctic Ocean and productive waters around Antarctica to see how shifts in sea ice and ocean currents affect species from clouds of shrimplike krill to whales, penguins and polar bears. 
 Most of these subjects have already been a focus of research. But several veteran earth and polar scientists said periodic intensive efforts like the polar years helped them to generate fresh ideas, collect data that individual countries lack the resources to pursue, and refresh the public's appreciation for the splendor of the world's least-habitable places. 
 Walter Munk, 89, an emeritus professor of geophysics at the University of California, San Diego, who helped run the 1957-58 effort (called the International Geophysical Year), said that what was needed most was long-term studies of earth's poles and oceans. 
 But he added that the polar year would provide a necessary short-term focus. ''Our society is poorly conditioned for sustained efforts,'' he said in an e-mail message. ''I rather think that without the occasional burst there would have been even less of a sustained effort.''

HEADLINE: When Our Freedom Is at Stake

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''American Liberty at the Precipice'' (editorial, Feb. 22) is so upsetting that it almost gives me cause to stop writing letters to the editor!
I could someday be classified as an ''enemy combatant'' for my strident opposition to the Bush administration's horrific war in Iraq. American men and women sign up for the armed forces and the National Guard to defend the very Constitution that President Bush has shown complete contempt for. 
 These soldiers face death, and serious physical and emotional injury. And because of our torture of captured prisoners -- at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo and through the policy of rendition -- our men and women are now subject to the same or worse treatment should they be captured. 
 Where is the public outrage? Why has Congress not had the courage to stop President Bush by using the power of the purse? Our very way of life is at the precipice, and we must stop this administration from breaking the law of the land!Henry A. LowensteinNew York, Feb. 22, 2007To the Editor:
 The laws of the United States used to be both practical and moral: they protected lives and property without infringing upon human rights. All that changed with the Bush administration.
 For the past six years, the president and the Justice Department have taken a series of actions that have promoted expediency at the expense of morality. Pushing through the Military Commissions Act is the most egregious example. 
 While the federal appeals court affirmed that the administration has the legal grounds under the Military Commissions Act to hold people indefinitely without trial, that does not mean it is the moral thing to do.
 The Democratic Congress must act immediately to undo this legislation, which makes the violation of human rights a law of the land.Robert J. Inlow Charlottesville, Va., Feb. 22, 2007To the Editor:
 Arguing that suspending habeas corpus should be limited to ''cases of Rebellion or invasion'' ignores the nature of the current war on terrorism, and is, in my opinion, seriously misguided. 
 In fact, one wonders whether Judge Judith W. Rogers, a dissenting judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, truly understands that we are fighting a nation-less, plainclothed, civilian-targeting, prisoner-beheading enemy. 
 Only the foolhardy ignore the nature of this enemy, much less afford them the right to be treated as American citizens.
 Certainly our forefathers could not have foreseen the type of war that we are currently engaged in. Were they to envision this situation, I believe that they would not have forced us to treat these enemy combatants with the respect and dignity afforded United States citizens. They made the distinction between those who deserved these protections and those who didn't.
 Just ask the American public, which has an uncanny way of understanding when American rights are deserved and when they're being given away indiscriminately.Andrea Economos Scarsdale, N.Y., Feb. 22, 2007To the Editor:
 Re ''Court Endorses Curbs on Appeal by U.S. Detainees'' (front page, Feb. 21):
 In ruling for the White House, the federal court has made a mockery of the tenet that prisoners are innocent until proved guilty. By stripping the right of habeas corpus, and then upholding this decision in the court, our system is becoming a mirror of those governments that President Bush so strongly claims to oppose.
 Supporters of this decision claim that this is the price we pay to win the war on terror. But at what cost? The prisoners of Guantanamo Bay have been languishing for more than five years. They have been stripped of their right to recourse, and treated as the enemy.
 Some say that winning the war on terror is worth any cost. The cost in this case is lost innocence.Sarah PeckSomerville, Mass., Feb. 21, 2007

HEADLINE: Militant Iraqi Shiite Cleric Denounces Security Push

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE and WISAM A. HABEEB; Reporting was contributed by Ali Adeeb, Khalid al-Ansary, Qais Mizher and Diana Oliva Cave.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
Iraq's most powerful Shiite militant cleric publicly repudiated the new Baghdad security plan for the first time on Sunday, according to a statement distributed by his aides that said the push to quell violence was doomed to fail as long as it was directed by the American military.
 The cleric, Moktada al-Sadr, controls the Mahdi Army, the largest Shiite militia in Iraq, and without his support for the stepped-up security effort, the prospects for continued sectarian violence and a direct conflict with American troops could increase.
His precise whereabouts have remained unknown since Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki announced the start of the plan two weeks ago. Until now Mr. Sadr seemed to cooperate, allowing his most unruly commanders to be arrested and ordering his organization to focus on political rather than military resistance. 
 It was unclear why he would turn against the joint American-Iraqi plan, but many of his followers have been losing patience with the failure of the security push to eliminate violence against Shiites. On Sunday, that violence included a suicide bombing by a woman that killed 40 people at an elite Baghdad university attended mainly by Shiite students.
 ''There is no good that comes from a security plan controlled by our enemies, the occupiers,'' the statement said. ''If you stay away from them, God will protect you from horror and harm. Make sure your plans are purely Iraqi and not sectarian.'' 
 The statement attributed to Mr. Sadr was read to a crowd of several hundred supporters in Baghdad's largest Shiite neighborhood by a top aide to his organization. The statement, which did not call on supporters to resist the plan but reiterated his longstanding demands for an immediate American withdrawal, is likely to put more pressure on Prime Minister Maliki, who recently called the security plan a ''dazzling success.'' 
 In fact, since the plan started, violence in the capital has seemed to abate only marginally, with some days of relative calm and others pocked with violence that begins at dawn and continues until dark.
 The Americans have repeatedly asked for patience and have emphasized that the plan's results will only become evident after several months.
 On Sunday, Lt. Col. Scott R. Bleichwehl, an American military spokesman, said the denunciation by Mr. Sadr -- who controls 30 seats in Parliament that the prime minister relies on for power -- would not deter the security push. He said Iraqis supported the effort. 
 ''The coalition is committed to working together with our Iraqi partners to reduce the violence and help protect the population,'' he said. ''All of our operations are being done with the full cooperation with the Baghdad operational command and the duly elected Iraqi government.'' 
 The bombing on Sunday at Mustansiriya University's college of economy and administration wounded at least 55 people, most of them students, many of them women. Most suicide attacks in Iraq have been conducted by men, but since the first woman exploded herself at an army recruiting station near the Syrian border in September 2005, a handful of other women have carried out attacks.
 The suicide bomber at Mustansiriya arrived at the busiest time of day, at about 12:40 p.m., minutes before the start of afternoon exams. Officials said she approached the campus through a middle pathway, between separate canopied entrances for men and women. When guards saw her trying to enter, they questioned her, and she moved quickly toward the building, the officials said. 
 The blast shattered glass all the way through the surrounding academic buildings, from front to back. An hour and a half later, the walkway where the explosion occurred was covered with blood, body parts, skirts, veils, blood-stained textbooks and steel ball bearings. 
 Inside the main room of the security building closest to the blast, where women are checked before being allowed in, a pool of water red with blood rippled at the doorway. 
 After the attack, about 10 American Humvees, along with Iraqi Army vehicles, were deployed at the site. Iraqi police officers patrolled the scene after hearing reports that a second suicide bomber might be on the way.
 In a campus courtyard about 25 yards from where the explosion hit, students and neighbors dug small holes around a flower bed so they could bury some of what was left at the scene.
 Hussain Ali al-Mousawi, a middle-aged blacksmith who said he lived across the street from the university, collected body parts on a notebook, placing severed fingers, pieces of skull and flesh on pages covered with student notes. 
 He said he had been carrying bodies, and the sleeves of his striped cotton shirt were soaked bright red. 
 He walked over to the holes and placed clothing, flesh and debris into the ground. Stunned Iraqi policemen stared. All around him, students crouched or sat on the ground crying. 
 At one point, a group of young men pulled away a wailing first-year accounting student who could not bear to leave. His arms resting on the shoulders of two friends, he shouted through tears; ''I don't want to go home, I don't want to go home. I want to die here! I want to die here where my friends have died! How can I come back tomorrow without them?''
 Mr. Mousawi continued his work. He showed a reporter the remains he sought to bury. ''I don't know what they've done to deserve this,'' he said. ''What have they done wrong?'' 
 Many of the surviving students expressed defiance. Falah Hasan, 35, a third-year management student standing nearby blamed Syria, Saudi Arabia and other countries for sowing destruction in his country. He said that Iraqis would not give up.
 ''We are burying here the minds of our society,'' he said, pointing to the ad hoc graves being filled by Mr. Mousawi, the blacksmith. ''We are planting them anew. How many of our great minds have they killed? They are targeting the students who are carrying pencils -- our dirty neighbors.''
 ''We shall reconstruct the great Iraqi mind from the beginning. This land will produce more minds than ever.''
 The attack Sunday was the second recent assault at a branch of the university. Two car bombs and a suicide bomber killed at least 70 people at a nearby campus on Jan. 16. 
 Other colleges throughout Iraq have been made targets in the past year, reflecting what is widely viewed as an attempt by Sunni extremist groups like Al Qaeda to drive out Iraq's middle class, the secular and the educated.
 Also on Sunday, a car bomb struck near the Iranian Embassy in central Baghdad, killing one person and wounding four. Several mortars landed in Abu Dshir in southern Baghdad, and another car bomb in central Baghdad wounded four.Iraqi President in Jordan for Tests
 AMMAN, Jordan, Feb. 25 (Reuters) -- President Jalal Talabani of Iraq arrived in Jordan for medical tests on Sunday after suffering a drop in blood pressure, Jordanian and Iraqi officials said.
 A close aide to the Iraqi president, who is in his early 70s, denied news media reports that he had suffered a heart attack, saying Mr. Talabani was exhausted from a long week of meetings.
 Mr. Talabani's post is largely ceremonial, but the former Kurdish guerrilla leader is an influential political figure with close links to Washington.

HEADLINE: Substance Over Image

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Six years ago a man unsuited both by intellect and by temperament for high office somehow ended up running the country.
 How did that happen? First, he got the Republican nomination by locking up the big money early.
Then, he got within chad-and-butterfly range of the White House because the public, enthusiastically encouraged by many in the news media, treated the presidential election like a high school popularity contest. The successful candidate received kid-gloves treatment -- and a free pass on the fuzzy math of his policy proposals -- because he seemed like a fun guy to hang out with, while the unsuccessful candidate was subjected to sniggering mockery over his clothing and his mannerisms.
 Today, with thousands of Americans and tens of thousands of Iraqis dead thanks to presidential folly, with Al Qaeda resurgent and Afghanistan on the brink, you'd think we would have learned a lesson. But the early signs aren't encouraging. 
 ''Presidential elections are high school writ large, of course,'' declared Newsweek's Howard Fineman last month. Oh, my goodness. But in fairness to Mr. Fineman, he was talking about the almost content-free rivalry between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama -- a rivalry that, at this point, is mainly a struggle over who's the bigger celebrity and gets to lock up the big donors.
 Enough already. Let's make this election about the issues. Let's demand that presidential candidates explain what they propose doing about the real problems facing the nation, and judge them by how they respond.
 I know the counterargument: you can't tell in advance what challenges a president may face, so you should vote for the person, not the policy details. But how do you judge the person? Public images can be deeply misleading: remember when Dick Cheney had gravitas? The best way to judge politicians is by how they respond to hard policy questions. 
 So here are some questions for the Democratic hopefuls. (I'll talk about the Republicans another time.) 
 First, what do they propose doing about the health care crisis? All the leading Democratic candidates say they're for universal care, but only John Edwards has come out with a specific proposal. The others have offered only vague generalities -- wonderfully uplifting generalities, in Mr. Obama's case -- with no real substance. 
 Second, what do they propose doing about the budget deficit? There's a serious debate within the Democratic Party between deficit hawks, who point out how well the economy did in the Clinton years, and those who, having watched Republicans squander Bill Clinton's hard-won surplus on tax cuts for the wealthy and a feckless war, would give other things -- such as universal health care -- higher priority than deficit reduction. 
 Mr. Edwards has come down on the anti-hawk side. But which side are Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama on? I have no idea.
 Third, what will candidates do about taxes? Many of the Bush tax cuts are scheduled to expire at the end of 2010. Should they be extended, in whole or in part? And what do candidates propose doing about the alternative minimum tax, which will hit tens of millions of middle-class Americans unless something is done?
 Fourth, how do the candidates propose getting America's position in the world out of the hole the Bush administration has dug? All the Democrats seem to be more or less in favor of withdrawing from Iraq. But what do they think we should do about Al Qaeda's sanctuary in Pakistan? And what will they do if the lame-duck administration starts bombing Iran?
 The point of these questions isn't to pose an ideological litmus test. The point is, instead, to gauge candidates' judgment, seriousness and courage. How they answer is as important as what they answer. 
 I should also say that although today's column focuses on the Democrats, Republican candidates shouldn't be let off the hook. In particular, someone needs to make Rudy Giuliani, who seems to have become the Republican front-runner, stop running exclusively on what he did on 9/11. 
 Over the last six years we've witnessed the damage done by a president nominated because he had the big bucks behind him, and elected (sort of) because he came across well on camera. We need to pick the next president on the basis of substance, not image.

HEADLINE: For TXU, One of the Street's Fabled Barbarians Is Back in the Hunt

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
He has been there, done that, and now, close to 20 years after clinching the grandest buyout deal ever, Henry R. Kravis seems to be doing it again.
 As always, the raw numbers loom large: $45 billion for the proposed buyout of the TXU Corporation, compared to $39 billion for the Blackstone Group's recent deal with Equity Office Properties and $25 billion for his RJR Nabisco takeover in 1988.
As this era's generation of hedge fund executives and private equity moguls use their billions to buy art, assume leadership roles in New York's cultural institutions and publicly celebrate their successes, they are working from a two-decade-old playbook of one of Wall Street's oldest masters, Mr. Kravis himself.
 In contrast to the giddy exuberance of this era's newly minted billionaires, however, Mr. Kravis, who is 63, is making his resurgence not only as a cornerstone of New York's social and financial landscape, but also as a seasoned executive whose survival of a series of tough business setbacks and personal tragedies during the 1990s has given him a more measured perspective. 
 ''Look, don't congratulate us when we buy a company, congratulate us when we sell it,'' Mr. Kravis said in an interview he gave to the Academy of Achievement. ''Because any fool can overpay and buy a company, as long as money will last to buy it.''
 It's a telling comment, and according to people who know him it has become a favored maxim for Mr. Kravis, one that he trots out whenever anyone tries to praise him for a large deal. In this heady period, a deal maker's time on the mountaintop can be short indeed. 
 Just last year, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company was involved in a $33 billion takeover for the health care provider HCA Inc., that was the largest ever until the Equity Office deal. Last year, K.K.R. distributed $837 million in fees to investment banks, an amount that surpassed all other buyout firms. 
 Mr. Kravis's wider renown largely came from the RJR deal, memorialized in the best seller ''Barbarians at the Gate.'' But the deal itself, the culmination of a frenzied bidding war that was in some ways reminiscent of the battle for Equity Office Properties, did not come close to producing a satisfactory return.
 K.K.R. reaped extraordinary riches from its early deals -- minting $7.4 billion from an investment in Safeway that prompted a rush of private equity imitators, for example -- but the firm's failures were also monumental and industry-rattling. K.K.R.'s billion-dollar loss in Regal Entertainment -- one that it shared with Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, now called HM Capital Partners -- was one of the biggest ever.
 Born in Tulsa, Okla., the son of a successful oil and gas executive, Mr. Kravis worked as an investment banker at Bear Stearns in the late 1960s. By the early 1970s, leveraged buyouts were the work of a small sideline industry that largely focused on family-owned businesses. Even in 1976, when Mr. Kravis, his first cousin George R. Roberts and Jerome Kohlberg Jr. all left Bear Stearns to found today's firm, the deals were just a couple of hundred million dollars in size. (Mr. Kravis's initial investment in the firm was $10,000; his two colleagues invested $10,000 and $100,000 respectively)
 During the 1980s buyout boom, fueled by the easy availability of high-yield debt, K.K.R.'s returns led the industry. According to Fortune magazine, its first five funds averaged close to 37 percent. Mr. Kravis became a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Mount Sinai Hospital, and the lush dinner parties he put on with his second wife, Carolyne Roehm, came to define the mores of that decade, as captured in Tom Wolfe's ''Bonfire of the Vanities.''
 But in the 1990s, Mr. Kravis's luck changed. Tragically, his 19-year-old son Harrison was killed in a car crash in 1991 in Colorado. A run of less-than-stellar investments led to fund returns that fell considerably short of earlier successes. A clutch of private equity competitors began to assert their presence in the field, and while K.K.R. remained influential, it was by no means dominant.
 Mr. Kravis's public profile also underwent a shift.
 In 1994, he married Marie-Josee Drouin, a Canadian economist, who now sits on the boards of Ford Motor, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the Robin Hood Foundation, and is president of the Museum of Modern Art.
 Short and sleek, with slicked-back graying hair, Mr. Kravis looks more than ever like a central establishment figure as opposed to the bomb thrower he once was (he is a prominent supporter of Senator John McCain; a trustee at the Council on Foreign Relations; and a member of the exclusive club for chief executives, the Business Council).
 But in the industry he had such a hand in creating -- and that is now sending shock waves through the global economy -- Mr. Kravis is again making his presence felt. K.K.R. is near completion of a $16 billion fund, and last year became the first of the giant buyout firms to list shares of a fund to raise money, $5 billion to be specific, from smaller investors.
 ''He is the Roger Clemens of the industry. He was a winner when he was 20 years old, and he is winner in his 60s,'' said James B. Lee Jr., vice chairman of JPMorgan Chase and a banker to Mr. Kravis for close to 30 years. Mr. Lee also disputes the notion that landing the biggest deal is what drives Mr. Kravis. ''Henry does not keep score that way,'' he said. ''What matters to Henry is being an agent of change in the alignment of capital and management.''
 While Mr. Kravis's relentless, hands-on management style has changed little over the last 30 years, the growth of larger and more complex deals has forced K.K.R. to alter its approach in managing the many companies in its portfolio. 
 In the 1980s, as a result of the small amounts of equity invested in deals, turning companies around depended largely on feats of fast financial engineering. With the recent flood of private equity capital, buyout firms are investing higher proportions of equity when they take firms private, which places a larger onus on them to work with management to effect longer-term results.
 When K.K.R. adds a new company to its portfolio now, executives at the firm, in the spirit of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first 100 days in office, outline a 100-day game plan that sets specific targets to be met for each of the 100 days.
 Mr. Kravis, a billionaire several times over, still has the drive to succeed that pushes all business titans. But, in Mr. Kravis's own words, he also is driven by a deeper anxiety. ''It's the fear of failure,'' he said in the Academy of Achievement interview. ''Of not wanting to fail. That makes people as great as they are. I know that's what pushes me, a lot.''

HEADLINE: As Candidate, Obama Carves Antiwar Stance

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Staci Semrad contributed reporting from Austin, Tex.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
Senator Barack Obama is running for president as one of the few candidates who opposed the Iraq war from the beginning, a simple position unburdened by expressions of regret or decisions over whether to apologize for initially supporting the invasion.
 Iraq remains a defining topic in the opening stages of the 2008 presidential race, but it may prove easier for Mr. Obama, Democrat of Illinois, to revisit the past than to distinguish his views in the future. The current Iraq proposals of Mr. Obama; Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York; and former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina share more similarities than differences, including a gradual withdrawal of troops.
Though Mr. Obama is framing his candidacy to appeal to Democrats who have long opposed the war, until recently he was not among his party's most outspoken voices against it. He campaigned strongly against the war in his bid for the Senate in 2004, but when he arrived in Washington he waited 11 months to deliver a major speech on Iraq.
 And only after Mr. Obama opened a presidential exploratory committee did he introduce legislation to withdraw American combat brigades from Iraq by March 31, 2008. 
 In an interview last week, Mr. Obama said he intended to continue using the authorization of the war to distinguish himself from fellow Democratic presidential candidates. In addition to Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Edwards, Senators Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut and Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware voted to authorize the invasion.
 ''The authorization vote is relevant only because it gives an insight into how people think about these problems and suggests the sort of judgment they apply in evaluating a policy decision,'' Mr. Obama said. ''There are people who sincerely believe that this was the best course of action, but in some cases politics entered into the calculation. In retrospect, a lot of people feel like they didn't ask hard enough questions.''
 Mr. Obama was not always so critical of the Congressional vote, taken on Oct. 11, 2002. In several interviews before the Democratic National Convention in 2004, where his national political ascent began, he said he did not place blame on Democrats who had voted to authorize the war, conceding he had not been privy to the same intelligence information. 
 Now, he appears intent on drawing the contrast between his early opposition to the war and the Senate votes to authorize it by Mr. Edwards, who has since repudiated his vote and apologized for it, and Mrs. Clinton, who has not apologized but has said she would not have supported the resolution had she known then what she knows now.
 These days Mr. Obama dismisses the suggestion that it was easier for him to speak against the war because he was not serving in the Senate and therefore not obligated to vote on the matter. He recalled worrying, at the time, that he might lose his Senate primary election because of his decision to oppose the Iraq invasion.
 ''It certainly didn't look like a cost-free decision when Saddam Hussein's statue was being pulled down in Baghdad,'' Mr. Obama said in an interview. ''I was in a hotel room in the middle of my Senate campaign, watching that happen, and President Bush's job approval rating was at 60 percent. Those who voted for the authorization felt pretty good.''
 In a Senate debate on Iraq last June, Mr. Obama voted to oppose an amendment seeking to set a specific timetable for withdrawing American troops. His current position on a withdrawal mirrors the conclusions of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, which recommended a specific time frame for troops to leave.
 Now the politics of the war seem to be working in his favor among Democratic primary voters. 
 As Mr. Obama has introduced himself in the opening weeks of his candidacy, few subjects have garnered more applause than his criticism of the war. He does not refer to the conflict as Mr. Bush's war, which antiwar candidates in the Democratic Party did in the 2004 election, but rather is seeking to expand the circle of responsibility to those who supported the invasion.
 ''We continue to be in a war that should never have been authorized,'' Mr. Obama told an audience in Iowa last week, making a not-so-subtle reference to Mrs. Clinton and other Democratic rivals. Two days later, at a Texas rally, he said, ''I am proud of the fact that way back in 2002, I said that this war was a mistake.''
 As if on cue, the crowds of Democrats cheered with gusto. 
 Nolden Gentry, a lawyer in Des Moines who has been in audiences to see Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama in the past month, said Mr. Obama's position on Iraq was one of many factors setting his candidacy apart in the eyes of Democrats. ''He's more pure on the war,'' Mr. Gentry said, walking from a town meeting where he and 2,200 others had seen Mr. Obama.
 Sterletha Grover, an account representative for a computer company who saw Mr. Obama speak to about 20,000 people on Friday in Austin, Tex., said she liked his view on Iraq. ''We shouldn't have gone there in the beginning,'' she said.
 Mr. Obama highlights his points of distinction on the war in meetings with party officials and influential donors as well. During his trip to Des Moines last week, he met behind closed doors with members of the Iowa House of Representatives and the State Senate. In both sessions, participants said, he raised the issue of Iraq himself.
 Still, his proposals for Iraq do not go as far as those of others in the Democratic field, particularly that of Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, who voted against the Iraq authorization and has recommended cutting military spending to end the war. Mr. Edwards, too, has called on Congress to pass substantive legislation that would, among other measures, block financing for a buildup of troops. Mr. Obama has not suggested such proposals.
 Among the differences in the plans offered by Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton is that she does not propose setting a deadline for American troops to be withdrawn. The titles of their plans, though, are similar. Hers is called the Iraq Troop Reduction and Protection Act of 2007, and his is the Iraq War De-escalation Act of 2007.
 In the interview last week, Mr. Obama said that he had not wavered on Iraq since the onset of the war and that he disagreed with critics who said he had become more vocal since becoming a candidate. He said he did not deliver speeches on the topic when he first arrived in the Senate because he was taking a low-key approach in his first year in office.
 ''As a freshman, our objective was not to try to get in the front all the time,'' Mr. Obama said. ''But the truth is that in that first year, we had just seen an Iraqi election, and my feeling was that while I was not optimistic, it was appropriate to try to give the nascent government a chance.''
 At the time, Mr. Obama was also not planning to run for president. He opened his presidential exploratory committee on Jan. 16. The next day, Mrs. Clinton presented her Iraq plan on Capitol Hill.
 As he stepped into an elevator that day, reporters asked whether he would be presenting a specific Iraq proposal. ''That will be coming soon,'' he replied. Aides went to work, formulating legislation consistent with his views from more than four years earlier. And 13 days later, on Jan. 30, his plan was introduced.

HEADLINE: An Early Environmentalist, Embracing New 'Heresies'

BYLINE: By John Tierney

 BODY:
Stewart Brand has become a heretic to environmentalism, a movement he helped found, but he doesn't plan to be isolated for long. He expects that environmentalists will soon share his affection for nuclear power. They'll lose their fear of population growth and start appreciating sprawling megacities. They'll stop worrying about ''frankenfoods'' and embrace genetic engineering.
 He predicts that all this will happen in the next decade, which sounds rather improbable -- or at least it would if anyone else had made the prediction. But when it comes to anticipating the zeitgeist, never underestimate Stewart Brand.
He divides environmentalists into romantics and scientists, the two cultures he's been straddling and blending since the 1960s. He was with the Merry Pranksters and the Grateful Dead at their famous Trips Festival in San Francisco, directing a multimedia show called ''America Needs Indians.'' That's somewhere in the neighborhood of romantic. 
 But he created the shows drawing on the cybernetic theories of Norbert Wiener, the M.I.T. mathematician who applied principles of machines and electrical networks to social institutions. Mr. Brand imagined replacing the old technocratic hierarchies with horizontal information networks -- a scientific vision that seemed quaintly abstract until the Internet came along. 
 Mr. Brand, who is now 68 and lives on a tugboat in Sausalito, Calif., has stayed ahead of the curve for so long -- as a publisher, writer, techno-guru, enviro-philosopher, supreme networker -- that he's become a cottage industry in academia. 
 Last year, Fred Turner of Stanford published ''From Counterculture to Cyberculture: Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the Rise of Digital Utopianism.'' This fall Andy Kirk of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, is putting out ''Counterculture Green: The Environmentalism of Stewart Brand and the Whole Earth Catalog.'' By next year we should be due for a revisionist historian's discovery of a modern social movement that Mr. Brand did not orchestrate.
 In addition to publishing the Whole Earth Catalog, he organized the first Hackers Conference, in 1984, and helped found The WELL, the early electronic community that was a sort of prototype of the Web. In Professor Turner's history, he was the impresario who knew everyone and brought the counterculture and the cyberculture together, from the Homebrew Computer Club in the 1970s to Wired magazine in the 1990s. 
 He is now promoting environmental heresies, as he called them in Technology Review. He sees genetic engineering as a tool for environmental protection: crops designed to grow on less land with less pesticide; new microbes that protect ecosystems against invasive species, produce new fuels and maybe sequester carbon. 
 He thinks the fears of genetically engineered bugs causing disaster are as overstated as the counterculture's fears of computers turning into Big Brother. ''Starting in the 1960s, hackers turned computers from organizational control machines into individual freedom machines,'' he told Conservation magazine last year. ''Where are the green biotech hackers?''
 He's also looking for green nuclear engineers, and says he feels guilty that he and his fellow environmentalists created so much fear of nuclear power. Alternative energy and conservation are fine steps to reduce carbon emissions, he says, but now nuclear power is a proven technology working on a scale to make a serious difference.
 ''There were legitimate reasons to worry about nuclear power, but now that we know about the threat of climate change, we have to put the risks in perspective,'' he says. ''Sure, nuclear waste is a problem, but the great thing about it is you know where it is and you can guard it. The bad thing about coal waste is that you don't know where it is and you don't know what it's doing. The carbon dioxide is in everybody's atmosphere.''
 Mr. Brand predicts that his heresies will become accepted in the next decade as the scientific minority in the environmental movement persuades the romantic majority. He still considers himself a member of both factions, just as in the days of the Merry Pranksters, but he's been shifting toward the minority.
 ''My trend has been toward more rational and less romantic as the decades go by,'' he says. ''I keep seeing the harm done by religious romanticism, the terrible conservatism of romanticism, the ingrained pessimism of romanticism. It builds in a certain immunity to the scientific frame of mind.''
 Mr. Brand got his first look at the big picture one afternoon in 1966 while sitting on a roof in San Francisco at what he calls an ''altitude of three stories and 100 mikes,'' meaning micrograms of LSD. He contemplated the skyline and decided the buildings weren't parallel because he was seeing the curvature of the Earth. 
 This reminded him of Buckminster Fuller's theory that people abused the environment because they thought of the Earth as flat and infinite, not as a finite globe. The next day the Earth looked flat again, but the 28-year-old Mr. Brand had a new cause. He printed up buttons asking, ''Why haven't we seen a photograph of the whole Earth yet?'' 
 Two years later, when Earth's portrait from space was finally released, he used it on the cover of his new project, the Whole Earth Catalog. The catalog became the bible for the counterculture and the back-to-the-land movement, but Mr. Brand was not into the simple self-sufficient life on the farm. He was into new tools and new ways of sharing information. As he famously explained in the introduction to the catalog: ''We are as gods and might as well get good at it.''
 Along with the potter's wheels and organic-farming tips, the catalog featured a state-of-the-art offering from Hewlett Packard: a desktop calculator that cost $4,900. In 1968, which was 16 years before the Apple Macintosh, Mr. Brand helped arrange the first demonstration of a computer mouse.
 In a 1972 article, he contrasted ''hackers'' (a novel term then) with old-fashioned ''planners,'' hailing the experimental, collaborative culture that was taking shape in cyberspace. At the first Hackers Conference, he uttered another of his enduring aphorisms, ''Information wants to be free.'' 
 Mr. Brand's latest project, undertaken with fellow digerati, is to build the world's slowest computer, a giant clock designed to run for 10,000 years inside a mountain in the Nevada desert, powered by changes in temperature. The clock is an effort to promote long-term thinking -- what Mr. Brand calls the Long Now, a term he borrowed from the musician Brian Eno. 
 Mr. Brand is the first to admit his own futurism isn't always prescient. In 1969, he was so worried by population growth that he organized the Hunger Show, a weeklong fast in a parking lot to dramatize the coming global famine predicted by Paul Ehrlich, one of his mentors at Stanford. 
 The famine never arrived, and Professor Ehrlich's theories of the coming ''age of scarcity'' were subsequently challenged by the economist Julian Sinon, who bet Mr. Ehrlich that the prices of natural resources would fall during the 1980s despite the growth in population. The prices fell, just as predicted by Professor Simon's cornucopian theories. 
 Professor Ehrlich dismissed Professor Simon's victory as a fluke, but Mr. Brand saw something his mentor didn't. He considered the bet a useful lesson about the adaptability of humans -- and the dangers of apocalyptic thinking.
 ''It is one of the great revelatory bets,'' he now says. ''Any time that people are forced to acknowledge publicly that they're wrong, it's really good for the commonweal. I love to be busted for apocalyptic proclamations that turned out to be 180 degrees wrong. In 1973 I thought the energy crisis was so intolerable that we'd have police on the streets by Christmas. The times I've been wrong is when I assume there's a brittleness in a complex system that turns out to be way more resilient than I thought.''
 He now looks at the rapidly growing megacities of the third world not as a crisis but as good news: as villagers move to town, they find new opportunities and leave behind farms that can revert to forests and nature preserves. Instead of worrying about population growth, he's afraid birth rates are declining too quickly, leaving future societies with a shortage of young people.
 Old-fashioned rural simplicity still has great appeal for romantic environmentalists. But when the romantics who disdain frankenfoods choose locally grown heirloom plants and livestock, they're benefiting from technological advances made by past plant and animal breeders. Are the risks of genetically engineered breeds of wheat or cloned animals so great, or do they just ruin the romance?
 Mr. Brand would rather take a few risks. 
 ''I get bored easily -- on purpose,'' he said, recalling advice from the co-discoverer of DNA's double helix. ''Jim Watson said he looks for young scientists with low thresholds of boredom, because otherwise you get researchers who just keep on gilding their own lilies. You have to keep on trying new things.'' 
 That's a good strategy, whether you're trying to build a sustainable career or a sustainable civilization. Ultimately, there's no safety in clinging to a romanticized past or trying to plan a risk-free future. You have to keep looking for better tools and learning from mistakes. You have to keep on hacking.

 CORRECTION:
The Findings column in Science Times yesterday, about the environmentalist Stewart Brand, gave the incorrect surname in some references for an economist who made a bet about the prices of natural resources in the 1980s. He is Julian Simon, not Sinon.

HEADLINE: Bargaining Down That CT Scan Is Suddenly Possible

BYLINE: By MICHAEL MASON

 BODY:
Patrick Fontana twisted his left knee last spring while hitting a drive down the fairway on a golf course in Columbus, Ohio. But what really pained him was the $900 bill for diagnostic imaging ordered by his doctor.
 Mr. Fontana, a 42-year-old salesman, has a high-deductible health plan coupled to a health savings account. Since he was nowhere near meeting his deductible, he was on the hook for the entire bill.
So he did something that insurance companies routinely do: he forwarded the bill to a claims adjuster, in this case My Medical Control, a Web-based company that reviews doctor and hospital bills for consumers. 
 After concluding that Mr. Fontana was not getting the best possible price, the company's representatives called the imaging facility and demanded a lower one, promptly saving him $200 -- minus a 35 percent collection fee. 
 ''I asked before I went in to the clinic how much it would cost, and they just will not tell you,'' he said later. ''I didn't know until I got the bill, and at that point I figured I had nothing to lose.''
 The savings are possible for one reason: medical care is often priced with the same maddening, arbitrary opacity as airline seats and hotel rooms. 
 ''The average provider -- doctors or hospitals -- has between 5 and 100 reimbursement rates for the exact same procedure,'' said Timothy Cahill, president of My Medical Control (mymedicalcontrol.com). ''A hospital chain with multiple locations may have 150 rates for the same procedure. Consumers don't know this.''
 The varying reimbursement schedules, negotiated between the nation's 850,000 providers and more than 6,000 health plans, have been kept all but secret. Consumers almost never get information on prices before treatment. Even insurers do not know what other health plans are paying.
 Despite the complexity, the Internet has begun to open a window on this surreal world, allowing consumers to compare costs and, occasionally, to discover affordable alternatives. 
 And not a moment too soon. 
 Over the next decade, health care spending in the United States will double, to more than $4 trillion a year, a fifth of the gross domestic product, according to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 
 Much of the increase will be paid directly by patients. Driven by skyrocketing hospital fees, overall out-of-pocket expenses for consumers will rise more than 5 percent every year, the federal researchers said. 
 Already, more than 12 percent of working-age adults have out-of-pocket medical costs greater than 5 percent of their annual household income, according to the Center for Studying Health System Change, a research group in Washington. 
 ''Traditionally, when you went to the doctor, price was never mentioned,'' said Paul B. Ginsburg, president of the center. ''That's changing, and I think it's a healthy change.''
 Rudimentary information is increasingly available to consumers. Thirty-two states now require that hospitals provide pricing information to the public. Just this month, the Georgia Hospital Association started a Web site listing fees of common medical procedures at each of the state's 141 acute-care hospitals. 
 Some critics say these moves toward pricing ''transparency'' are largely symbolic, an effort to divert attention from the real causes of health care inflation by placing the onus on the consumer with vague talk of ''empowerment'' and ''choice.''
 ''It's not consumer behavior that is driving rising medical costs in the U.S.,'' said Robert G. Evans, a health care economist at the University of British Columbia. ''It is the folks on the supply side, the doctors and hospitals.''
 Moreover, the available data are not always useful to consumers, because prices disclosed by hospitals are not the steeply discounted rates negotiated by insurers. 
 ''Consumers don't care so much what the hospital charges,'' said Carmela Coyle, senior vice present for policy at the American Hospital Association. ''What they want to know how is much it's going to cost them out of pocket.''
 While only the health plans know the actual numbers, a few Web sites recently have posted some surprising estimates.
 Extrapolating from federal Medicare data, Vimo (vimo.com), a small Web start-up in Mountain View, Calif., tries to estimate the fees negotiated by insurers for a variety of hospital procedures. 
 While the price for a cornea transplant at Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia is an estimated $15,000, for example, the reimbursement rate negotiated by insurers is likely to be closer to $4,700, according to the Web site. 
 The reimbursement rate nationally is still lower: $3,900, by Vimo's calculation. ''We were shocked,'' said Chini Krishnan, chief executive of Vimo. ''We had no idea that the pricing inefficiencies could be so extreme.''
 This kind of comparison shopping can be deceiving, some experts warn, because consumers cannot judge the quality of care from fees alone, and different patients require different treatments. 
 Still, even rough approximations can be useful, particularly for the increasing numbers of patients with high-deductible plans or no insurance at all.
 My Medical Control also provides a first glimpse of what free-flowing price data can do for patients after treatment. From a variety of public and private sources, Mr. Cahill said, the company has put together a database detailing the wholesale reimbursement rates paid by major insurers for thousands of procedures. In essence, My Medical Control claims to know the lowest rate that a hospital or clinic has already accepted for a given service.
 If a client is not being billed at that price, then the company's representatives will call and bargain for it. From a typical claim of $1,100, Mr. Cahill said, the company shaves an average of $232 . ''The higher your deductible, the less the health insurance company is providing oversight on your claim,'' he said. ''It's not their money.''
 The market for services like Mr. Cahill's is likely to grow, and fast. According to the federal researchers, out-of-pocket expenses for hospital patients will rise 9.1 percent this year alone.

HEADLINE: A Bad Report Card

 BODY:
The news from American high schools is not good. The most recent test results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, commonly known as the national report card, finds that American 12th graders are actually performing worse in reading than 12th graders did in 1992, when a comparable exam was given. In addition, 12th-grade performance in reading has been distressingly flat since 2002, even though the states were supposed to be improving the quality of teaching to comply with the No Child Left Behind education act. 
 The new scores, based on tests given in 2005, show that only about 35 percent of 12th graders are proficient in reading. Simply put, this means that a majority of the country's 12th graders have trouble understanding what they read fully enough to make inferences, draw conclusions and see connections between what they read and their own experiences. The math scores were even worse, with only 23 percent of 12th graders performing at or above the proficient level.
Marginal literacy and minimal math skills might have been adequate for the industrial age. But these scores mean that many of today's high school seniors will be locked out of the information economy, where a college degree is the basic price of admission and the ability to read, write and reason is essential for success.
 Congress, which is preparing to reauthorize both the No Child Left Behind Act and the Higher Education Act, needs to take a hard look at these scores and move forcefully to demand far-reaching structural changes. 
 It should start by getting the board that oversees the National Assessment of Educational Progress testing to create rigorous national standards for crucial subjects. It should also require the states to raise the bar for teacher qualifications and end the odious practice of supplying the neediest students with the least qualified teachers. This process would also include requiring teachers' colleges, which get federal aid, to turn out higher-quality graduates and to supply many more teachers in vital areas like math and science. If there's any doubt about why these reforms are needed, all Congress has to do is read the latest national report card.

HEADLINE: A Land of Camel Milk and Honey

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: HARGEISA, Somaliland(?) 

 BODY:
Here's the ethos of Somalia, as a former Mogadishu resident explained it to me: ''If I use a dollar to buy food, then tomorrow I have nothing. If I use a dollar to buy a bullet, then I can eat every day.''
 That enterprising can-do spirit has turned most of Somalia into the poster child of a failed state, where you feel underdressed without an assault rifle. But wait! Here in the north of the carcass of Somalia is the breakaway would-be nation of Somaliland, and it is a remarkable success -- for a country that doesn't exist. 
The U.S. and other governments don't recognize Somaliland, so the people here get next to zero foreign aid. And when the ''country'' was formed in 1991, it had been mostly obliterated in a civil war and was a collection of ruins and land mines.
 Yet the clans and elders here formed their own government, held free elections and even established an international airline. Relying on free markets and a general exhaustion with violence, the people of Somaliland embraced tranquillity and democracy and searched for ways to make a buck.
 Walk down the streets of Hargeisa, the capital of Somaliland, and instead of gunmen you come across the thriving jewelry and financial market: scores of vendors, most of them women, are hawking millions of dollars worth of gold, precious stones and foreign currency out in the open air. (Don't try that at home!) Continue down the street, and you see that Hargeisa has police cars, DHL service, cable television, orthodontists, a multitude of Internet cafes and traffic jams (including the horses and camels). There are public schools and hospitals -- even a public library. 
 This is a conservative Muslim country, yet it is generally pro-American and tolerant. In the last election, more women voted than men. Women's groups are fighting the traditional practice of genital mutilation, administered to 97 percent of girls here.
 The lesson of Somaliland is simple: the most important single determinant of a poor country's success is not how much aid it receives but how well it is run. If a country adheres to free markets and good political and economic governance, it will generate domestic and foreign investments that dwarf any amount of aid.
 As President Dahir Rayale Kahin told me: ''There is a proverb in our country: 'You can wash your body only with your own hand.' Outsiders can help, but the indigenous people must find a solution themselves.''
 One lesson is that Western countries should not only increase their financial aid but also their pressure for better governance. It's great to forgive debts, but not graft or antimarket policies. 
 The U.S. Millennium Challenge aid program, which promotes good governance, is a useful step in that direction. So is Tony Blair's program to battle corruption in Africa. 
 One useful kind of Western aid is simply support for civil-society groups that battle corruption. Here in Somaliland, the press is generally free, but the president recently tossed three journalists in prison for reporting on corruption in his family. If Western countries speak out strongly in their defense, that effort may be worth a few million dollars in aid by reducing corruption in the future.
 More peer pressure from within Africa would also help. Other African countries should stand up to a racist like Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe with the same vigor they once used to stand up to white racist governments.
 Another essential kind of foreign aid is supporting market-friendly economic policies, especially those that would nurture manufacturing industries.
 In Mauritania, whose location in northwestern Africa would be ideal for exporting clothing to Europe and America, it takes 82 days to start a new business, which would then have to make 61 tax payments each year, requiring 696 hours to calculate and pay. And in the end, the tax would amount to 104.3 percent of the profit, according to the World Bank.
 All that explains why you don't have any shirts in your closet labeled ''Made in Mauritania.''
 So let's be more generous with foreign aid, giving more than 22 cents per $100 of national income to development assistance (the average for rich countries is 47 cents). But those of us who call for aid and debt forgiveness also need to push just as hard for recipient nations to improve their governance, for ultimately the best way for poor countries to prosper is to adopt pro-growth policies.
 And in the meantime, it's time to recognize Somaliland as a nation. When a place does this well, we should hail it as a model, not shun it.

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
Pearson, the publisher of The Financial Times and the owner of Penguin books, said that profit fell 29 percent in 2006, partly as a result of a gain in the prior year on the sale of its stake in a Spanish newspaper. Income for the company, which also has a 50 percent stake in The Economist magazine and owns the French newspaper Les Echos, dropped to $:446 million ($875.4 million) from $:624 million. Revenue rose 8 percent, to $:4.4 billion ($8.7 billion) as 8 percent sales growth at the company's schools publishing business in the United States outweighed slower sales at Penguin. Ad revenue was up 9 percent at The Financial Times. Excluding one-time items, profit rose 38 percent, to $:455 million ($893.6 million) in 2006.

HEADLINE: A Wharton Dean Is Named to Lead the Conference Board

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
The Conference Board, a business research and consulting group that publishes some of the nation's leading economic surveys, has selected Jonathan Spector, a vice dean at the Wharton School, as its chief executive. 
 Mr. Spector, 50, will succeed Richard E. Cavanagh, former executive dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, who has led the group since 1995. Mr. Cavanaugh announced last March that he was retiring.
The selection of Mr. Spector, which is to be announced today by the Conference Board's trustees, came after a yearlong search in which some 250 candidates were evaluated.
 The Conference Board, based in New York, releases monthly surveys on consumer confidence and global economic conditions, which analysts use to predict periods of growth and contraction in the economy. It publishes a monthly index of leading economic indicators, which includes a broad range of economic data like statistics on building permits, manufacturing activity, unemployment claims and consumer expectations.
 It also offers consulting services for businesses, a field Mr. Spector entered after graduating from Harvard Business School in 1980. He began his career at McKinsey & Company, the management consultants. There, he helped the company broaden its reach into China and Southeast Asia and started an office on Taiwan.
 In an interview, Mr. Spector said he would try to make similar inroads into Asia for the Conference Board, particularly in China and India, where the board already has operations. ''We need to be thinking, and I know the organization is thinking, about ways we can add to our presence there,'' he said. ''All of these would be extensions, not a change in direction.''
 Mr. Spector said he also planned to focus the Conference Board's efforts on improving the preparedness of people entering the work force. He said this could include broadening the outreach to universities, executives and government to help identify the skills workers most lack when they start a job.
 ''The question is whether people are coming out of their formal education with the skills that are needed to succeed in the 21st-century economy,'' he said.
 Mr. Spector's previous job experience has spanned nonprofit organizations, academia and private business. After leaving McKinsey in 2000, he worked for Darwin Networks, an Internet service provider, and later the Seurat Company, a marketing business.
 He served as chairman of the Massachusetts March of Dimes from 2003 through 2006, and continues to be a director. And he is a member of the national board of advisers to the March of Dimes.
 Mr. Spector will begin at the Conference Board on April 16. Wharton, which is part of the University of Pennsylvania, said it has not yet named his successor as vice dean for executive education.

HEADLINE: Youngest Workers Lose Ground in City's Strong Job Market

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The strongest job market New York City has had in decades has not helped the city's youngest workers find jobs, leaving them at risk of becoming permanently unemployable, according to a report an anti-poverty group released yesterday.
 The report from the group, Community Service Society, an advocacy group for low-income New Yorkers, cited sharp decreases in employment among residents aged 16 to 24 from 2000 to 2006, a period in which employment rose for most other groups. 
Slightly more than one-third of all city residents 16 to 24 held jobs last year, down from 44 percent in 2000, according to the report, which was based on federal census and labor statistics. Among people in that age group who were not attending school, employment also declined to 56 percent last year, from 64 percent in 2000.
 During that same period, employment was rising and unemployment falling among other adults in the city. For all of 2006, the city's unemployment rate was 4.9 percent. It has rarely dropped below 5 percent in the last few decades.
 But for teenagers looking for work in the city, prospects have not improved in recent years. The unemployment rate -- the share of people actively looking for work and unable to find it -- among those aged 16 to 19 was 28.4 percent, up from 18.9 percent in 2000 and little changed since 2003.
 ''We've got a very complex and difficult situation,'' said Mark Levitan, senior policy analyst with Community Service Society and the author of the report. ''The shift is toward jobs that require more education, more literacy, more math, more ability to interact with customers and co-workers.''
 Young people who have dropped out of school ''have a skills issue right there,'' Mr. Levitan said. He also said unemployment rates had remained high for black and Hispanic residents of all ages, especially men.
 Despite the troubled tone of the report, some of the jobs data it cited contained glimmers of hope. While the unemployment rate for black New Yorkers was 7.4 percent last year, according to the report, that was down sharply from 12.9 percent in 2003. It was also lower than last year's unemployment rate for all blacks nationwide of 8 percent, said Michael L. Dolfman, the regional commissioner of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 Unemployment among Hispanics in New York also fell in the last three years, to 6.1 percent from 9.6 percent in 2003, the report showed.
 Among city residents aged 20 to 24, unemployment was still high in 2006, at 10.9 percent, but it had fallen from 13.1 percent in 2003. 
 The rate of joblessness among teenagers in New York was nearly double the national rate of 15.4 percent, Mr. Dolfman said. But he added, ''Historically, we have had high teenage unemployment rates.''
 One reason for that, he said, is the large number of immigrants with work skills but poor English who take low-level jobs to establish themselves in this country. ''We have a large number of teenagers who are not getting the work skills that teenagers in other places are getting by taking entry-level jobs,'' Mr. Dolfman said. 
 David R. Jones, the chief executive of Community Service Society, attributed some of the joblessness among younger residents to a decline in emphasis on vocational training in the public school system. ''There hasn't been much focus in this particular area in the city in a long time,'' Mr. Jones said.
 He added that the government could help give young men leaving prison a second chance at work by changing the rules of parole and lowering some of the barriers that felons face in obtaining licenses to practice certain trades like plumbing. Young men who get locked up for drug offenses ''are basically unemployable'' after they leave prison, Mr. Jones said. 
 Even for those dropouts who stay out of legal trouble, there is an economic isolation, he said. If you live in heavily populated urban neighborhoods, ''you don't find many job networks available to you,'' Mr. Jones said. ''You have no real connection to the world of work.''

HEADLINE: MAIN IRAQI BLOCS REACH AN ACCORD ON OIL REVENUES

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Jad Mouawad contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
The Iraqi cabinet approved a draft of a law on Monday that would set guidelines for nationwide distribution of oil revenues and foreign investment in the immense oil industry. The endorsement reflected a major agreement among the country's ethnic and sectarian political blocs on one of Iraq's most divisive issues.
 The draft law approved by the cabinet allows the central government to distribute oil revenues to the provinces or regions based on population, which could lessen the economic concerns of the rebellious Sunni Arabs, who fear being cut out of Iraq's vast potential oil wealth by the dominant Shiites and Kurds. Most of Iraq's crude oil reserves lie in the Shiite south and Kurdish north.
The law also grants regional oil companies or governments the power to sign contracts with foreign companies for exploration and development of fields, opening the door for investment by foreign companies in a country whose oil reserves rank among the world's three largest. 
 Iraqi officials say dozens of major foreign companies, including ones based in the United States, Russia and China, have expressed strong interest in developing fields or have done some work with the Iraqi industry. The national oil law would allow regions to enter into production-sharing agreements with foreign companies, which some Iraqis say could lead to foreigners reaping too much of the country's oil wealth. 
 Iraqi officials say all such contracts will be subjected to a fair bidding process, but American inspectors have reported that the upper echelons of the government, including the senior ranks of the Oil Ministry, are rife with corruption. There are also fears among non-Americans that American companies could be favored.
 But oil industry analysts in the United States say it is unclear whether companies will rush to sign contracts because the law is vague about what legal protections investors would be given.
 The oil law and several related measures must still be approved by Parliament before they are enacted. Since the American-led invasion in 2003, Iraqi politics have often been split bitterly along ethnic and sectarian lines, and that kind of conflict could stall the law's passage. Drafts were debated for months by a committee before the cabinet finally approved one. 
 ''At the end of the day, we all supported this thing because it's workable for all the parties,'' said Barham Salih, a deputy prime minister and the head of the committee. 
 Distributing revenue by population is not guaranteed to placate the feuding parties because no accurate census exists. There is intense disagreement over demographics in Iraq -- many Sunni Arabs insist they are the majority of Iraqis, even though Sunni Arabs are generally estimated to be 20 percent of the population, Kurds 20 percent and Shiite Arabs 60 percent. 
 If the law is passed, its effect on the oil industry could be enormous, assuming that foreign companies would be willing to work here despite the violence. Iraq has 80 known oil fields, 65 of which will be offered for bids for development contracts, said Hussain al-Shahristani, the oil minister. 
 Iraqi leaders say they want the 275-member Parliament to approve the law before May. The legislature is in recess but is expected to reconvene next month. American and Iraqi leaders had tried to get the law approved last year, but the effort bogged down at the drafting level. Before the cabinet vote on Monday, the main Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish political blocs agreed to work together to ensure that the law passes Parliament in an expeditious manner, Mr. Shahristani said.
 Since last year, senior Bush administration officials and top American commanders here have said a new oil law is crucial to the country's political and economic development, and they have pressured Iraqi leaders relentlessly to make passage of the law a priority.
 In recent weeks, Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, the senior American envoy here, has been in intense talks with Kurdish leaders in the north to overcome their objections to the draft, which centered on the contracting powers given to the central government versus the regions. Iraqi officials say Mr. Khalilzad's negotiations were crucial to winning unanimous cabinet approval on Monday.
 ''This is a significant political achievement because leaders representing all of Iraq's communities have demonstrated that they can pull together to resolve difficult issues of vital national importance,'' Mr. Khalilzad said in a written statement on Monday evening. ''The drafting of this framework law was not easy. It presented special challenges for the Iraqi and Kurdistan regional governments, and the leaders of key political blocs.''
 Several members of the committee overseeing the drafting said in interviews that they were confident that Parliament would ultimately endorse the law, but perhaps only after heated debate. 
 ''It will be tough,'' Mr. Salih said. ''I want to admit it and I want to recognize that. It will be an interesting roller coaster, my friends.''
 The writers of the draft law tried to balance the powers of regional and central governments, an issue that goes directly to the heart of the Iraq war.
 The minority Sunni Arabs, who ruled Iraq for decades before the toppling of Saddam Hussein and are now leading the insurgency, have chafed at rule by the Shiites and Kurds partly because they fear that those two groups might hoard oil wealth for themselves. Sunni Arab leaders have resisted attempts by the Kurds and some Shiite politicians to create laws allowing for greater regional autonomy. 
 The draft law says that all revenues from current and future oil fields will be collected by the central government and redistributed to regional or provincial governments by population, in theory ensuring an equitable distribution of profits. That method could help assuage Sunni Arabs hostile to Kurdish and Shiite autonomy.
 The attitudes of Sunni Arabs could also soften if more oil exploration is done on their land. Iraqi officials recently increased their estimates of the amount of oil and natural gas deposits in Sunni Arab territory after paying tens of millions of dollars to foreign oil companies to re-examine old seismic data across the country and retrain Iraqi petroleum engineers.
 Industry and government analysts in and outside Iraq estimate the proven oil reserves at 115 billion barrels. Oil production peaked at 3.7 million barrels a day in 1979, according to the United States Department of Energy. Production stood at 2.6 million barrels a day before the 2003 invasion, but has dropped since.
 The oil law's drafters reached agreement on the principle of revenue sharing fairly early in the process. Much more contentious was the issue of signing oil contracts. The Kurds, who have enjoyed de facto independence in the mountainous north since the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991, argued strongly for regional governments or companies to have full power in signing contracts with foreign companies to develop oil fields. Sunni Arab leaders insisted on keeping this power in the hands of the Oil Ministry. The Shiites fell somewhere in the middle.
 The draft law has a compromise: regions can enter into contracts, but a powerful new central body, the Federal Oil and Gas Council, would have the power to prevent the contracts from going forward if they do not meet certain prescribed standards, Mr. Salih said. A panel of oil experts from inside and outside Iraq would advise the federal council on the contracts.
 The draft law also re-establishes the state-run Iraq National Oil Company, which was founded in 1964 to oversee oil production but was shut down by Mr. Hussein in 1987. The company would operate separately from the Oil Ministry and use a business model. In addition, any region that can produce at least 150,000 barrels of oil a day can create its own operating company.
 Energy analysts said the new law is unlikely to lead to a stampede by foreign companies anytime soon because it leaves too many unresolved issues, including the lack of a mechanism to settle potential disputes between the federal authority and local governments. 
 ''I think the devil is going to be in the details,'' said Fadel Gheit, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Company in New York. ''Oil companies need governments that will honor the contracts they sign and they need a safe environment to operate,'' he added. 
 While Mr. Gheit said he expected American and British oil companies to receive preferential treatment in the awarding of contracts, other analysts said Iraqis would be suspicious of awarding preferential deals to American companies.
 ''Iraqis are extremely protective of their resources,'' said Rochdi A. Younsi, an analyst at Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm. ''Given the level of anti-American sentiment, any major American oil company perceived to take advantage of their relations in government would be seen as being part of the so-called conspiracy to take over Iraq's natural resources.''

HEADLINE: Demand for English Lessons Outstrips Supply

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

DATELINE: MOUNT VERNON, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Two weeks after she moved here from her native Brazil, Maria de Oliveira signed up for free English classes at a squat storefront in this working-class suburb, figuring that with an associate's degree and three years as an administrative assistant, she could find a good job in America so long as she spoke the language.
 The woman who runs the classes at Mount Vernon's Workforce and Career Preparation Center added Ms. Oliveira's name to her pink binder, at the bottom of a 90-person waiting list that stretched across seven pages. That was in October. Ms. Oliveira, 26, finally got a seat in the class on Jan. 16.
 ''I keep wondering how much more I'd know if I hadn't had to wait so long,'' she said in Portuguese. 
 As immigrants increasingly settle away from large urban centers -- New York's suburbs have had a net gain of 225,000 since 2000, compared with 44,000 in the city -- many are waiting months or even years to get into government-financed English classes, which are often overcrowded and lack textbooks.
 A survey last year by the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials found that in 12 states, 60 percent of the free English programs had waiting lists, ranging from a few months in Colorado and Nevada to as long as two years in New Mexico and Massachusetts, where the statewide list has about 16,000 names.
 The United States Department of Education counted 1.2 million adults enrolled in public English programs in 2005 -- about 1 in 10 of the 10.3 million foreign-born residents 16 and older who speak English ''less than very well,'' or not at all, according to census figures from the same year. Federal money for such classes is matched at varying rates from state to state, leaving an uneven patchwork of programs that advocates say nowhere meets the need.
 ''We have a lot of folks who need these services and who go unserved,'' said Claudia Merkel-Keller of the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, noting that her state has waiting lists in every county, ''from beginner all the way through proficient level.'' New Jersey, like New York and many other states, does not keep statewide figures on how many people are on waiting lists. 
 Luis Sanchez, 47, a Peruvian truck driver for a beer distributor in New Brunswick, has been in this country 10 years -- and on the waiting list for English classes in Perth Amboy five months. ''You live from day to day, waiting to get the call that you can come to class,'' Mr. Sanchez said in Spanish, explaining that he knew a little English but wanted to improve his writing skills so he could apply for better jobs. ''I keep on waiting.''
 Mr. Sanchez is unlikely to get the call soon: Perth Amboy's Adult Education Center recently discovered that it was operating in the red and canceled 9 of its 11 evening classes in English as a second language, including all at beginner and intermediate levels. In Orange County, N.Y., where the immigrant population doubled in the past 16 years, the Board of Cooperative Education Services' adult education program has stopped advertising for fear its already overflowing beginner classes will be overwhelmed. 
 In Framingham, Mass., 20 miles west of Boston, hundreds of people used to spend the night in line to register for English as a second language, so the program now selects students by picking handwritten names from a big plastic box.
 ''With the lottery, everyone has the same chance,'' said Christine Taylor Tibor, director of Framingham's Adult E.S.L. Plus program. ''Unfortunately, you might have to enter the lottery several times before you get in.'' 
 Census figures show that in the United States there were 32.6 million foreign-born residents 18 years or older in 2005, up about 18 percent from the 27.5 million counted in 2000 (and nearly twice the 17.1 million in 1990). Federal spending on adult education, about $580 million last year, has increased 23 percent since 2000 and more than tripled since 1990; some 45 percent of the money is devoted to English. 
 But financing varies widely across the states, which are required to allocate at least one quarter of what was provided by the federal government: Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Texas spent the minimum in 2003, according to the Education Department, while California and Connecticut each spent about seven times that. 
 In New York, the state Education Department added $76 million to the federal government's $43 million for the 2005 fiscal year. That year, according to a recent report by the Center for an Urban Future, a nonprofit research group based in Manhattan, there were about 86,500 people enrolled in government-sponsored adult programs for English as a second language, serving about 5 percent of the state's 1.6 million adults with limited English skills.
 Last fall, Arizona voters approved an initiative banning illegal immigrants from benefiting from all state-financed programs, including English instruction; administrators of English-as-a-second-language classes in several other states said they do not check for documentation when registering students and thus do not know how many of them may be in the country illegally.
 Advocates for more English classes say the state-federal financing split leaves an adult education system whose quality and reach vary widely from place to place -- and is lacking most everywhere. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, where the immigrant population has tripled since 1990, largely because of an influx of Mexicans, sponsored a bill last year that would have given legal immigrants $500 vouchers to pay for English classes since so many of the free ones were full.
 ''Most education policy is the prerogative of state and local governments, but I would argue that the prerogative to help people learn our common language is a federal responsibility,'' said Senator Alexander, a Republican who was education secretary under the first President George Bush. ''If we make it easier for people to learn English, they will learn it. I think that ought to be a priority of our government, and I don't think it has been.''
 The government-financed classes are most often run by school districts or worker training centers and generally require only a registration fee of perhaps $10. Libraries, churches and community centers often also provide free or inexpensive classes, like the English Language Institute at Westchester Community College in Valhalla, N.Y., which offers nine levels of instruction for $76 to $247 per three-month session. Then there are private programs like the one at Pace University in Pleasantville, N.Y., which costs $790 for two classes a week for 14 weeks. 
 With immigrants accounting for half of the growth in the nation's labor force from 1990 and 2000, and expected to make up all of the growth in the two decades to come, ''the issue of English proficiency has become an issue of economic development,'' said Tara Colton, the author of the Center for an Urban Future report. Indeed, some business owners, frustrated at the lack of low-cost classes, have begun teaching immigrants English at work.
 At Skyline Furniture Manufacturing Inc. in Thornton, Ill., a suburb of Chicago, about half of the company's 60 employees have learned English at the factory over the past five years, under a state program in which the government pays to bring teachers to work sites if companies pay workers for the hours in class.
 ''It makes sense to us because our workers can do their jobs better, and it makes sense to them because they can advance in their jobs,'' said Cinthia Nowakowski, the plant's manager, adding that three of the company's eight foremen were promoted after completing the program. ''Besides, it's convenient. The guys don't have to worry about having to arrange transportation to get to school or getting there and finding that there's no room in the class.'' 
 In Newburgh, N.Y., an Orange County town where one in five of the 29,000 residents are immigrants, Blanca Saravia has amassed an impressive portfolio of odd jobs since arriving from Honduras in 2004: gas station attendant, office janitor, cook's helper, and, for the last 14 months, packager at a local nail-polish factory. Speaking in her native Spanish, Ms. Saravia said that she has been able to get by with co-workers' translating, but that ''when the boss gives orders, I don't understand.''
 So earlier this month, Ms. Saravia joined 30 others in a cramped classroom learning to conjugate the verb ''to be'' as part of the adult English program in Orange County, where the immigrant population doubled in the last decade -- and the number of free English classes has jumped to 26 from 2 in 1995.
 ''If I tell her, 'We're full, come back in a couple of months,' chances are she'll get discouraged and never come back,'' said Ramon Santos, who runs the Newburgh program.
 Carl DeJura, director of adult basic education at Brookdale Community College in Long Branch, N.J., said he has lately crammed as many as 40 students into a class -- ''double what it should be.''
 ''If you have to cut back on textbooks, supplies and materials to serve the people who need it,'' he said, ''that's what you do.''
 In Mount Vernon, Haitian, Chinese, Somali, Arab, Mexican and Brazilian students flock to the beginner class each morning at 8:30 before heading out to work or to look for work. Ahmed Al Saidi, 49, who works at a gas station and moved from Yemen in 1994, said in halting English that he wants to learn the language ''for better work and to talk to people when I go to the store.'' 
 Ms. Oliveira, the immigrant from Brazil, said she still knows too little English to venture into the marketplace; her husband, who is American born and supports the couple financially, encouraged her to enroll in the classes, held five mornings a week. 
 ''I hope that when I'm speaking a little better, I'll be able to find a job where I can use the English I learned here and the skills I have from back home,'' she said in Portuguese. ''When I was on the waiting list, there were times I thought this time would never come.''

HEADLINE: Microsoft to Buy Health Information Search Engine

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Microsoft's drive into the health care market is just getting under way, but the company signaled yesterday that one important ingredient in its plan will be a specialized search engine tailored to deliver useful medical information to consumers.
 Microsoft is buying Medstory Inc., a small start-up in Foster City, Calif. Its search software applies artificial intelligence techniques to medical and health information in medical journals, government documents and on the Internet. 
The terms of the Medstory acquisition were not disclosed.
 The Medstory purchase, said Peter Neupert, vice president for health strategy at Microsoft, was a first step in a broader company strategy to assemble technologies that would ''improve the consumer experience in health care.''
 ''Clearly,'' Mr. Neupert said, ''search is a critical part of that better end-to-end experience for consumers.''
 The acquisition follows Microsoft's purchase last year of Azyxxi, a clinical health care software system that retrieves and quickly displays patient information from many sources, including scanned documents, X-rays, M.R.I. scans and ultrasound images.
 The Microsoft move comes at a time of increased investment in online health ventures, rising traffic at consumer health sites on the Web and profits at the most popular sites. Last month, a venture firm headed by Stephen M. Case, the former chief executive of America Online, introduced an ambitious new consumer health site, RevolutionHealth.com. 
 WebMD, the leading health-related site, last week reported strong quarterly profit of $8.9 million on revenue of $80.6 million, surpassing Wall Street's expectations. The stock price of WebMD -- an Internet pioneer in health information that struggled for years -- has surged in the last year.
 In health-related search, Healthline Networks, a start-up in San Francisco, reports rising traffic on its Web site and a growing string of deals to provide the search engine for sites of other companies, including Merck and PacifiCare. At Google, Adam Bosworth, a vice president for engineering, is leading the effort to develop a health-information offering.
 These companies and others are seeking ways to build businesses on the Internet that profit from what is called consumer-driven health care. The notion is that shifts in demographics, economics, technology and policy will inevitably mean that individuals will want to, and be forced to, make more health care decisions themselves.
 Aging baby boomers, accustomed to personal choice and to technology, tend to want a say in their treatment decisions. And the Internet is already an important source of health information. Eight million people in the United States go online for health information every day, according to a study last year by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, a nonprofit group.
 Financially, the pressure by Medicare and private health insurers to hold down costs and shift more of the burden to individuals, analysts say, will force people to make more health care spending choices. 
 In Medstory, Microsoft is acquiring ''some of the best deep technology'' in the emerging field of medical search, said Esther Dyson, an industry analyst who is also an investor in Medstory. That technology, Ms. Dyson said, is ''not so much a search engine, but an ontology engine,'' with a capability to find and identify concepts in health and not just sort through words and Web links.
 The longer-range goal, Mr. Neupert said, is to link personal information like age, sex, drug regimens, family history and even genetic markers to search. The ideal is that search results are tailored individually, identifying treatments, drug interactions and medical journal articles of interest.
 ''Health search could be way more relevant,'' he said. ''You don't need to see thousands of results. What you want to know is, what does this mean to me personally?'' 
 Dr. Alain T. Rappaport, the founder and chief executive of Medstory, said he was impressed by the importance Microsoft placed on ''intelligent search'' in health care and by the promise that Microsoft's global reach and resources could accelerate the spread of the technology his team developed.
 Microsoft had talked to Healthline recently about using its health search service, said West Shell III, the chief executive of Healthline. ''This means Microsoft has decided to go it alone,'' Mr. Shell said.

HEADLINE: Regulatory Clearance Seen as Slow but Sure

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS and MATTHEW R. WALD; Clifford Krauss reported from Houston and Matthew R. Wald from Washington.

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
The sale of the biggest utility in Texas to private investors faces months of state and federal regulatory hurdles, but experts predict that the broad support for the deal from environmentalists and other important interest groups should help it clear them with ease. 
 A bigger question, some experts say, is whether the newly formed company will be able to keep all its constituents -- consumers and shareholders, growth-oriented politicians and environmentalists -- as happy in the years ahead as they appear to be now. 
 In their announcement of the merger agreement on Monday, the TXU Corporation and the lead buyers, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company and the Texas Pacific Group, promised a 10 percent rate decrease for consumers while sustaining service to an increasingly energy-hungry Texas. Along with reducing the planned coal-fired plants to 3 from 11, the new owners also vowed to invest more in renewable energy, including solar and wind power.
 It remains possible, however, that rival suitors could emerge. The Blackstone Group and the Carlyle Group, among others, are considering offers either on their own or with a corporate partner. Other private equity firms have been consulting Wall Street banks.
 Monday's agreement was greeted with satisfaction by everyone from Texas officials to national environmentalists, who viewed it as a model for other states and utilities as well as a call to action for Congress to legislate against the spread of traditional coal power and its role in contributing to global warming.
 Peter Altman, the coal campaign director of the National Environmental Trust, was equally effusive. But ''as welcome as the TXU deal is,'' he warned , ''it is still a wake-up call for Congress that there are more than 100 coal plants on the drawing board.'' 
 The utility's promises of sustained service, more renewable energy and lower prices should go far in satisfying the Public Utility Commission of Texas, the regulatory body with the power to review purchases and mergers of electric utilities to ensure that they are in the public interest.
 ''There is a general expectation,'' said Terry Hadley, a spokesman for the commission in Austin, ''that the new owner would provide at least, if not a better, level of service quality.'' Mr. Hadley said the commission would take ''however long it takes to be comfortable'' with the deal and pointed out that ''we can take measures to require a higher level of service'' if necessary.
 The current management of the company has come under criticism from consumer groups and politicians for being too quick to cut off electricity to late payers and not keeping public lighting in downtown Dallas adequately serviced. 
 In Washington, the challenges are relatively minor because there are few antitrust issues in the company's going private. 
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will have some jurisdiction since TXU runs a nuclear power plant. ''What we tend to look for is if the successor company has the financial reserves and financial and technical knowledge and know-how to operate a nuclear power plant,'' said David McIntyre, an N.R.C. spokesman.
 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has less jurisdiction in Texas than other states, but it will probably review the company's limited operations out of state. 
 Barbara Struck, an analyst with the Energy Intelligence Group, a research firm, predicted that the deal would be approved by regulators ''because of the environmental conditions associated with it'' and the promises to cut consumer rates.
 Peter Hartley, an economist at Rice University, said the utility would have a hard time keeping its promises to everyone. ''How can you make more for all these groups from the same assets and the same management?'' he asked.
 In their statement Monday, the company and equity firms promised the decrease in rates until September 2008. The company did not reply to telephone requests for more information.
 Representatives of environmental groups predicted that the TXU deal would make it harder for other companies to build pulverized coal plants. Eric Cane, an analyst at Innovest Strategic Value Advisors, said the settlement would make companies like Dynegy and Xcel think twice about building more coal plants that do not include a plan to keep carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. 
 What the deal shows, more than anything else, they said, was a growing expectation of carbon taxes in the future. ''The economics might be there right now for a utility to build a pulverized coal facility,'' Mr. Cane said, ''but you have to question that company's decision, if they're looking forward past the near future.''
 That is not the way some big coal producers see it, though. And they say they still have basic economics on their side. Until a significant cost is imposed on each ton of carbon pumped into the atmosphere, coal will stand out as the most cost-efficient way to supply new electricity and most regulators will have a hard time agreeing to impose more expensive alternatives on consumers.
 ''If what has been proposed takes hold and TXU does not advance with the construction of new plants, it will likely enable'' other coal facilities to be built, said Vic Svec, a spokesman for Peabody Energy, a coal mining company that has moved into power generation.
 The power will still be needed and the type of plant TXU has proposed, he said, is the cleanest, least expensive proven technology to get it.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 3, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Tuesday about possible regulatory hurdles for the acquisition of the TXU Corporation by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company and the Texas Pacific Group misspelled the surname of an analyst at Innovest Strategic Value Advisors who discussed the effect of the deal on TXU rivals.

HEADLINE: Presidents Behaving Badly in Age of Unwinnable Wars

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
Commander in ChiefHow Truman, Johnson, and Bush Turned a Presidential Power Into a Threat to America's FutureBy Geoffrey PerretIllustrated. 436 pages. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $27.
 In recent months, President Harry S. Truman has been claimed by both sides of the political aisle as a visionary architect of the grand strategy that won the cold war. In a 2006 book, ''The Good Fight,'' the New Republic editor at large Peter Beinart hailed Truman as a cold war liberal, who cannily built a tough-minded but resilient foreign policy -- with important lessons for today's Democrats -- based on the intertwined principles of containment, overseas economic development, and humility and restraint on the world stage. 
 Conservatives, for their part, have argued, in the words of a Weekly Standard column, that Truman's ''heirs are Republicans now,'' with Ronald Reagan bringing ''the Truman DNA'' into the G.O.P., and George W. Bush taking up the mantle of American global leadership. For that matter, a recent issue of Newsweek reports that President Bush ''has increasingly invoked Truman'' as his own approval ratings have tumbled and the war in Iraq worsens: ''His aides say that Bush wants to be remembered for creating a new and effective framework for fighting the war on terror, just as Truman did for the cold war.'' 
 In his tendentious new book, Geoffrey Perret -- the author of earlier books on Grant, Eisenhower and Lincoln -- also draws parallels between Truman and Mr. Bush, but takes a decidedly unflattering view of both men. As he sees it, Truman's belief in ''sometimes massive American intervention created the intellectual framework for waging unwinnable wars.'' 
 Chief among those unwinnable wars, Mr. Perret contends, are the Korean War, the Vietnam War and the current war in Iraq -- all ''wars of choice,'' all ''launched at moments of national crisis'' (in the wake, respectively, of the Red Scare, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11), all ''struggles to sustain American supremacy'' that, in his words, ultimately brought ''the United States lower.'' 
 Whereas many journalists and historians have drawn comparisons between the wars in Vietnam and Iraq, Mr. Perret broadens the vector of analogy to include Korea, pointing to some interesting parallels among these three conflicts, from botched decision-making in the move toward war, to a failure to anticipate regional consequences correctly, to the difficulty of maintaining a strategic advantage in the face of an indigenous population ill disposed toward foreign intervention.
 In each case, Mr. Perret writes, the United States found itself ''wrestling with an insoluble challenge: a political victory requires a military victory first, because there can be no effective government without security and stability. But a military victory requires a political victory first, in the form of a government strong enough to establish a state monopoly on violence.'' 
 In each case, he adds, China benefited from America's actions: the stalemate in Korea enabled Mao to boast that China had emerged as a great power; the Communist government took Nixon's visit to Beijing, in the waning years of the Vietnam war, as a validation of its global importance; and the current United States difficulties in Iraq have given China a freer hand on the world stage to pursue its economic agenda.
 In the course of this volume, Mr. Perret also finds parallels in the handling of each of these wars by Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson and Mr. Bush. All, he suggests, had a penchant for talking tough. All received poor advice from aides. And all demonstrated an attachment to faulty idees fixes, like the domino theory. He compares the Truman Doctrine -- ''I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressure. I believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their destinies in their own way.'' -- to George W. Bush's efforts to export democracy to Iraq. And he suggests that Truman's thinking about preventive war (''We must act in time -- ahead of time -- to stamp out the smoldering beginnings of any conflict that may threaten to spread'') anticipated the Bush doctrine of pre-emptive war.
 Unfortunately for the reader, Mr. Perret's discussion of broader issues, like presidential wartime powers, is scattered and unpersuasive. Worse, the more illuminating aspects of the book tend to be overshadowed by incessant editorializing and an eagerness on the author's part to focus on only those aspects of these three presidencies that support his thesis. He overstresses the Truman administration's belief in intervention and unilateralism, playing down the importance it also attached to alliances. He wildly oversimplifies the Bush administration's decision to go to war against Iraq by focusing on President Bush's characterization of Saddam Hussein as ''the guy who tried to kill my dad'' and his apparent fixation on that Iraqi dictator. 
 And, finally, he resorts to cheap ad hominem attacks on members of the Bush administration who promoted the war against Iraq: for instance, he describes Paul D. Wolfowitz, the former deputy defense secretary, as ''a graying vulgarian who licked both sides of his comb before applying it to his wayward mop.''
 Such snarky descriptions make this book seem a lot less like a reasoned argument than like a partisan screed. And they're completely unnecessary to underscore the author's point that a multitude of misjudgments and misrepresentations were made in the decision to go to war against Iraq and in the subsequent prosecution of that war. In this case, the plain, unadorned facts are damning enough.

HEADLINE: Billions Over Baghdad

BYLINE: By John B. Taylor. 
John B. Taylor, under secretary of the Treasury from 2001 to 2005, is the author of ''Global Financial Warriors.''

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif. 

 BODY:
EARLIER this month, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a hearing that criticized the decision to ship American currency into Iraq just after Saddam Hussein's government fell. As the committee's chairman, Henry Waxman of California, put it in his opening statement, ''Who in their right mind would send 360 tons of cash into a war zone?'' His criticism attracted wide attention, feeding antiwar sentiment and even providing material for comedians. But a careful investigation of the facts behind the currency shipment paints a far different picture.
 The currency that was shipped into Iraq in the days after the fall of Saddam Hussein's government was part of a successful financial operation that had been carefully planned months before the invasion. Its aims were to prevent a financial collapse in Iraq, put the financial system on a firm footing and pave the way for a new Iraqi currency. Contrary to the criticism that such currency shipments were ill advised or poorly monitored, this financial plan was carried out with precision and was a complete success. 
The plan, which had two stages, was designed to work for Iraq's cash economy, in which checks or electronic funds transfers were virtually unknown and shipments of tons of cash were commonplace. 
 In the first stage, the United States would pay Iraqi government employees and pensioners in American dollars. These were obtained from Saddam Hussein's accounts in American banks, which were frozen after he attacked Kuwait in 1990 and amounted to about $1.7 billion. Since the dollar is a strong and reliable currency, paying in dollars would create financial stability until a new Iraqi governing body was established and could design a new currency. The second stage of the plan was to print a new Iraqi currency for which Iraqis could exchange their old dinars.
 The final details of the plan were reviewed in the White House Situation Room by President Bush and the National Security Council on March 12, 2003. I attended that meeting. Treasury Secretary John Snow opened the presentation with a series of slides. ''As soon as control over the Iraqi government is established,'' the first slide read, we plan to ''use United States dollars to pay civil servants and pensioners. Later, depending on the situation on the ground, we would decide about the new currency.'' Another slide indicated that we could ship $100 million in small denominations to Baghdad on one week's notice. President Bush approved the plan with the understanding that we would review the options for a new Iraqi currency later, when we knew the situation on the ground. 
 To carry out the first stage of the plan, President Bush issued an executive order on March 20, 2003, instructing United States banks to relinquish Mr. Hussein's frozen dollars. From that money, 237.3 tons in $1, $5, $10 and $20 bills were sent to Iraq. During April, United States Treasury officials in Baghdad worked with the military and the Iraqi Finance Ministry officials -- who had painstakingly kept the payroll records despite the looting of the ministry -- to make sure the right people were paid. The Iraqis supplied extensive documentation of each recipient of a pension or paycheck. Treasury officials who watched over the payment process in Baghdad in those first few weeks reported a culture of good record keeping. 
 On April 29, Jay Garner, the retired lieutenant general who headed the reconstruction effort in Iraq at the time, reported to Washington that the payments had lifted the mood of people in Baghdad during those first few confusing days. Even more important, a collapse of the financial system was avoided.
 This success paved the way for the second stage of the plan. In only a few months, 27 planeloads (in 747 jumbo jets) of new Iraqi currency were flown into Iraq from seven printing plants around the world. Armed convoys delivered the currency to 240 sites around the country. From there, it was distributed to 25 million Iraqis in exchange for their old dinars, which were then dyed, collected into trucks, shipped to incinerators and burned or simply buried. 
 The new currency proved to be very popular. It provided a sound underpinning for the financial system and remains strong, appreciating against the dollar even in the past few months. Hence, the second part of the currency plan was also a success. 
 The story of the currency plan is one of several that involved large sums of cash. For example, just before the war, Saddam Hussein stole $1 billion from the Iraqi central bank. American soldiers found that money in his palaces and shipped it to a base in Kuwait, where the United States Army's 336th Finance Command kept it safe. To avoid any appearance of wrongdoing, American soldiers in Kuwait wore pocket-less shorts and T-shirts whenever they counted the money. 
 Later, American forces used the found cash to build schools and hospitals, and to repair roads and bridges. Gen. David Petraeus has described these projects as more successful than the broader reconstruction effort. 
 But that wasn't the only source of dollars. Because the new Iraqi dinar was so popular, the central bank bought billions of United States dollars to keep it from appreciating too much. As a result, billions in cash accumulated in the vaults of the central bank. Later, with American help, the Iraqi central bank deposited these billions at the New York Federal Reserve Bank, where they could earn interest.
 Finally, when Iraq started to earn dollars selling oil, the United States transferred the cash revenue to the Finance Ministry, where it was used to finance government operations, including salaries and reconstruction. Many of these transfers occurred in 2004, long after the financial stabilization operation had concluded. Iraqi Finance Ministry officials had already demonstrated that they were serious about keeping the controls they had in place. The 360 tons mentioned by Henry Waxman includes these transfers as well as the 237.3 tons shipped in 2003 in the stabilization. 
 One of the most successful and carefully planned operations of the war has been held up in this hearing for criticism and even ridicule. As these facts show, praise rather than ridicule is appropriate: praise for the brave experts in the United States Treasury who went to Iraq in April 2003 and established a working Finance Ministry and central bank, praise for the Iraqis in the Finance Ministry who carefully preserved payment records in the face of looting, praise for the American soldiers in the 336th Finance Command who safely kept found money, and yes, even praise for planning and follow-through back in the United States.

HEADLINE: Another Down Day, Despite All the Deals

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street extended its decline yesterday as concerns that the market might be headed for a correction offset investor optimism over continued acquisition activity.
 The $45 billion buyout of the electric utility TXU, by a consortium led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company and Texas Pacific, would go down as the largest leveraged buyout in United States history, if it is completed.
 Other deals include an agreement by Station Casinos to be bought by a private equity firm started by the company's founding family, and a play by Temple-Inland, a conglomerate that offers everything from packaging material to financial services, to split into three public companies. 
 Stocks were unable to sustain gains, however, amid speculation that the market may be in for a correction. Few catalysts are foreseen that could propel stocks forward, and a downward revision of fourth-quarter gross domestic product is expected to be released tomorrow.
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 15.22 points, to 12,632.26. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 1.82 points, to 1,449.37, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 10.58 points, to 2,504.52. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.95 points, to 823.69. 
 Oil prices rose after a winter storm plowed across the United States, spurring expectations of strong demand for heating oil. The April contract for a barrel of crude rose 25 cents, to $61.39, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 Todd Salamone, director of trading at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati, noted that the S.& P. had not had a 2 percent correction in 121 sessions.
 ''The last time we went this number of days without a 2 percent correction was in 1995 -- right ahead of one of the biggest bull markets in history,'' he said.
 TXU rose $7.91, to $67.93. Its directors voted Sunday night to recommend shareholder approval of the sale, which values its stock at a 15 percent premium.
 Dow Chemical spiked $1.54, to $44.99, on speculation that it could be the target of a leveraged buyout. The Sunday Express newspaper in London, quoting anonymous sources, said the chemical company might attract an offer of about $54 billion from buyout funds.
 Station Casinos rose $3.20, to $86.50, after it agreed to go private in a $5.4 billion deal, which represents an 8 percent premium over its closing price on Friday.
 Temple-Inland rose $7.06, to $62.01, after it agreed to spin off its real estate and financial services arms and sell its timberland business. Days earlier, the activist shareholder Carl C. Icahn said he would wage a proxy fight to seize control of the board.
 Arris, a maker of broadband communications equipment, fell $1.38, to $13.91, after its offer to buy Tandberg Television of Norway was bested by a $1.4 billion bid from Ericsson, the maker of wireless network gear.
 Subprime lenders were hurt on speculation customers might default. NovaStar Financial, one of the nation's biggest lenders to the subprime market, fell 52 cents, to $7.96.
 A warning yesterday from Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, about a possibility of a recession by the end of the year helped bonds recover. Treasuries are more in favor during times of recession as interest rates are often cut to stimulate the economy.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 12/32, to 100. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.62 percent, from 4.67 percent. 
 Following are the result of yesterday's Treasury auction of three-month and six-month bills:(000 omitted in dollar figures)Price3-Mo. Bills: 98.7276-Mo. Bills: 97.497High Rate3-Mo. Bills: 5.0356-Mo.

HEADLINE: City Carves New Image, With an Eye On Tourists

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
George A. Fertitta has helped sell a lot of pricey Belgian chocolates and French cognac to New Yorkers. Now he has to sell New York to Belgians, Frenchmen and others who may consider the city too costly, too dangerous or too American to visit. 
 Mr. Fertitta is spearheading Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's campaign to lure 50 million visitors a year to the city by 2015. That would be about six million more out-of-towners than the city, which is riding a long wave of tourism and economic growth, attracted last year.
A Madison Avenue veteran whose ad agency specialized in marketing luxury goods, Mr. Fertitta seems undaunted by the mayor's goal. Indeed, he told a group of tourism industry executives over lunch last week at the ''21'' Club that he believed drawing 50 million visitors a year would be ''kind of a layup'' that could be achieved three years ahead of schedule. 
 There is a simple philosophy behind the tourism drive: If this many people will show up in New York with little prodding, imagine how many would come if the city actively encourages them. 
 To increase the influx, the city is spending more money than ever to promote itself overseas. Fueled by the mayor's commitment of an additional $15 million a year, the city's marketing operation, known as NYC & Company, has begun placing billboards in some European cities declaring that with exchange rates in their favor, New York is a relative bargain.
 Those ads are aimed at knocking down one negative perception about New York: that it is prohibitively expensive. 
 An international ad campaign in the works, a first for the city, will try to dispel two other stereotypes: that New Yorkers are exceptionally rude, and that crime is rife in the city. Mr. Fertitta said he would rather foreigners picture ''Sex and the City'' than ''Law & Order.''
 Under Mr. Fertitta, NYC & Company has hired an advertising agency, Bartle Bogle Hegarty, to create the campaign, which is expected to begin later this year. 
 The marketing operation is also expanding its network of offices in other countries, including Russia and the Netherlands, to tailor its promotions to segments of the local populations, like wealthy older people and adventuresome younger ones.
 ''We will not waste a nickel of this money,'' said Mr. Fertitta, referring to NYC & Company's annual budget of $45 million, half of which is supplied by City Hall. ''That's why we're going to make sure we're fishing where the fish are.''
 Mr. Fertitta, who has been chief executive of the revamped NYC & Company since last summer, also wants to turn the organization's Web site into a local version of Expedia -- one where tourists could electronically purchase their transportation, hotel rooms and show tickets.
 That idea, however, may be a tougher sell with some directors of NYC & Company, which has 1,900 dues-paying members, mostly travel and tourism companies. 
 The executives of those companies, led by Jonathan M. Tisch, the chief executive of Loews Hotels, have historically directed the city's promotional efforts, but their collective clout has now been diluted by the Bloomberg administration's largess. 
 The members' annual dues of about $4.5 million now account for just 10 percent of the operation's overall budget, shifting power toward the city. 
 ''Given the amount that the city is now contributing, a tilting toward more of a public-private partnership is warranted,'' said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development. ''But certainly it is not just reporting to me or to City Hall.''
 Still, it is under Mr. Doctoroff's direction that the city's marketing operation has been reorganized. 
 Two other agencies have also been put under Mr. Fertitta's charge: NYC Big Events, responsible for attracting awards shows and other high-profile events, and NYC Marketing Development Corporation, which licenses the city's trademarks and sells citywide sponsorships. 
 And recruiting Mr. Fertitta was Mr. Doctoroff's doing. He said he had asked several prominent advertising executives, including Keith Reinhard, the chairman emeritus of DDB Worldwide, for recommendations, and Mr. Fertitta's name kept coming up.
 ''George is a passionate New Yorker,'' Mr. Reinhard said in an interview last week. ''He is a consummate marketing guy. He understands brands. He also knows how to build teams.''
 Mr. Fertitta made a name for himself on Madison Avenue in the early 1970s when he teamed up with John Margeotes to found an agency that created enticing magazine ads for luxuries like Godiva chocolates, Remy Martin cognac and Cunard cruises. 
 Mr. Margeotes was the creative director, and Mr. Fertitta, always the first one in the door, ran the business.
 ''When I got to the office, he'd already done a half-day's work,'' recalled Mr. Margeotes, now an artist living in Massachusetts. ''He got out that yellow pad and went down a to-do list and followed it religiously all day long.''
 Mr. Fertitta, who still keeps his legal pads and manila folders arranged in a particular order along the edges of his desk, sold the last of his interest in the agency, Margeotes Fertitta Powell, in 2005 and started considering his next move. 
 He said he had not considered getting involved with city government before he met with Mr. Doctoroff.
 The deputy mayor sold him on the need for well-honed, professional marketing skills to continue the tourism surge. 
 ''What we're really focused on now is taking a strategic look at how we can bring as many people to New York as possible and do it in the most efficient ways possible,'' Mr. Doctoroff said.
 For his part, Mr. Fertitta, who has lived nearly all his 60 years in Manhattan, sounds like the city's chief cheerleader.
 ''New York is at its all-time high in all the positive things and at an all-time low in all the negative things,'' Mr. Fertitta said, leaning back in a black chair in his sparse office in a Midtown high-rise. 
 But he acknowledged that many people in other places did not share that perception. The general reputation of the United States has suffered during the course of the war in Iraq, he said. 
 ''The image of the U.S. is much lower than it was three years ago or five years ago,'' Mr. Fertitta said. ''The reservoir of goodwill after 9/11 has dissipated.''
 Leaving politics aside, he said that of the primary objections that people have to visiting New York, the one most based in reality is the cost. 
 To change people's negative views of New York's grime, crime and prices, he said, the city can piggyback on the invaluable boost it gets from pop-culture cynosures like Carrie Bradshaw, the lead character in ''Sex and the City,'' the internationally popular TV show.
 ''To some people, New York City is 'Sex and the City' and the best shoes in the world,'' Mr. Fertitta said. ''They want to see where Carrie Bradshaw sat on the stoop.'' 
 For others, a trip to the city means plush hotels, world-class restaurants and museums, he said. 
 ''Our job,'' Mr. Fertitta said, ''is to identify a market and say, 'This is the part of New York that you're going to love and you'll want more of.' ''

HEADLINE: Mississippi Expects to Be Site Of a Toyota Assembly Plant

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
The governor of Mississippi is expected to announce this morning that his state will be the site of Toyota's eighth assembly plant in North America.
 A Mississippi official along with Japanese and local media reports said Toyota had selected a site outside Tupelo, Miss., for an $830 million assembly plant. 
Initially, the factory will build 150,000 vehicles a year, most likely the Highlander, a crossover vehicle whose sister car is the Lexus RX 350, according to the reports. The plant is to open in 2009.
 A spokesman for Toyota declined comment last night. A spokesman for Mississippi's governor, Haley Barbour, declined to confirm if the scheduled announcement was linked to Toyota.
 But the location in northeastern Mississippi would be logical for Toyota, which has an engine factory in Huntsville, Ala., about 125 miles away. 
 Mississippi would be one more state where Toyota has built a factory. The plants generate hundreds of millions of dollars in investments and create hundreds of jobs at suppliers and support businesses
 An announcement would come at a critical time for Toyota. It is on the verge of becoming the world's biggest auto company, displacing General Motors, an event that could occur as soon as this year. 
 In 2006, Toyota unseated DaimlerChrysler to become the third-biggest automaker in the United States. This year, it could move up to second biggest in American sales, displacing Ford Motor.
 Toyota already has plants in Ontario in Canada, Indiana and Kentucky; it recently opened one in San Antonio.
 In 2006, Toyota built more than 1.55 million vehicles and 1.4 million engines at its 14 plants in North America. In addition to these factories, it is building an assembly plant in Woodstock, Ontario, and it will begin building Camrys at a plant owned by Subaru in Indiana this year.
 In January, G.M.'s vice chairman, Robert A. Lutz, said Toyota had more influence in Washington than G.M. because of the number of states where it had plants.
 Mississippi was not on the original list of states considered by Toyota, which had said the factory would probably be in the South. Initially, the company considered locations in Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas and North Carolina. 
 But when it became known that Toyota was considering another factory, more states entered the running, including Mississippi, where three counties banded together to promote a site.
 The Toyota plant would be the second big auto factory in Mississippi and would be an economic boost after the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Nissan Motor Company opened an assembly plant in Canton, outside Jackson, in 2003.
 Toyota also had considered expanding its plant in San Antonio, which builds a new version of its Tundra pickup. Its 2,000-acre plant site there is believed to be among the biggest in the world, and it is common for Toyota to expand factories after it begins production.
 Toyota executives see the newest Tundra, which competes with Detroit's big pickups, as the most important vehicle the company has ever introduced in the United States.

HEADLINE: Lower Manhattan: A Relative Bargain but Filling Up Fast

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
It was not long ago that prospects for Lower Manhattan seemed so dire that many people predicted it would not survive as a financial center. Within days -- even hours -- of the destruction of the World Trade Center, a number of companies with offices in Lower Manhattan were searching for space in Midtown or outside the city. 
 Today, however, space is so tight in Lower Manhattan that the vacancy rate for prime buildings is only 5.1 percent, lower than in any other market but the Seattle suburb of Bellevue, said Steven E. Coutts, a senior vice president at Studley, a company that specializes in tenant representation.
Of course, the 89.5-million-square-foot office market below Chambers Street is 20.3 million square feet smaller than it was before the terrorist attacks -- both because of the destruction of the World Trade Center and the conversion of 59 older office buildings into condominiums since 2002. 
 But the conversion trend appears to have run its course, one of many signs that the downtown office market has bounced back. A total of 5.6 million square feet were leased last year, a 64 percent increase from 2005, according to Cushman & Wakefield. The decline in the overall vacancy rate -- from 10.6 percent to 8.4 percent -- was more pronounced than it was in Midtown, where the vacancy rate fell to 6.4 percent from 7.8 percent during the period. 
 Yesterday, another new lease was signed downtown, as Legg Mason, a financial company, agreed to occupy 97,000 square feet at 55 Water St., according to a spokesman for CB Richard Ellis, which represented the building and the tenant.
 In the largest lease signed during the last year, Moody's Investors Service took 589,000 square feet at 7 World Trade Center, the first new office tower in Lower Manhattan in 20 years. The company is about to take two more floors, said John M. Cefaly, the Cushman vice chairman who represents Moody's. ''Their business has grown,'' he said. ''They went back and reassessed their head counts.'' 
 JPMorgan Chase is negotiating with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to build a 1.6-million-square-foot tower on the site on Liberty Street where the long-awaited demolition of the heavily damaged Deutsche Bank is finally under way. The site had been intended for a residential building.
 Average annual rents in Lower Manhattan have been climbing steadily but are still cheaper than in 2000 -- $41.36 a square foot compared with $43.24, Mr. Coutts said. At 7 World Trade Center, Larry A. Silverstein, the developer, is asking $70 a square foot for the top floors. 
 Mr. Silverstein had leased those floors to Beijing Vantone, a Chinese real estate company, but the agreement collapsed after the tenant could not produce a letter of credit. 
 Last month, Beijing Vantone agreed to lease the top three floors of 195 Broadway, a 28-story landmark in Lower Manhattan that once served as the headquarters of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. But again, the deal fell apart over a missing letter of credit.
 ''Although we're disappointed, we're not concerned because the market is very robust, as robust as I've seen in 25 years,'' said David W. Levinson, the chief executive of L&L Holding Company, the owner of 195 Broadway.
 Several factors have combined to enhance downtown's appeal. Office rents are a bargain compared with the red-hot Midtown market, where the average annual rent is about $57 a square foot. The political wrangling over the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site is over, and work on the site is under way. The World Trade Center transit hub and the new Fulton Street Transit Center are closer to completion. The residential population has grown by 16,000 since the terrorist attacks, to 39,000, according to the Downtown Alliance, a business group, making the neighborhood more inviting after dark.
 ''A lot of critical factors have fallen into place,'' said Sheldon L. Cohen, a senior managing director of CB Richard Ellis. ''The political will has coalesced.'' Though some companies like Lehman Brothers and Bank of America that lost or gave up space downtown because of the attacks have found permanent homes in Midtown, many tenants have returned. Aon, for example, was able to sublease the space it took at 55 East 52nd Street at a profit, and it signed a new lease for more than 221,000 square feet at 199 Water St.
 But most of the downtown space is being leased to companies like Moody's that never left the neighborhood, with only about 15 percent going to tenants that are moving from Midtown, Mr. Coutts said.
 Among those is ABN Amro, a Dutch financial services company, which was able to find another tenant for its costly offices at Park Avenue Plaza on East 52nd Street. The company took nearly 139,000 square feet at 7 World Trade Center for about $59 a square foot.
 At the World Financial Center, where occupancy fell to 65 percent after the attacks, the four buildings are almost fully leased, said Richard B. Clark, chief executive of Brookfield Properties, which owns the eight-million-square-foot complex.
 That could change if Merrill Lynch relocates when its lease expires in 2013. The company has been looking at other sites, including the complex Brookfield is building on Ninth Avenue between 31st and 33rd Streets and the buildings being developed by Mr. Silverstein on the World Trade Center site. The company wants to create trading floors and is angling for subsidies. A rival, Goldman Sachs, got $1.65 billion in tax-free bonds and more than $115 million in other incentives for the new tower it is building on West Street. 
 ''Merrill will take into account all economic factors in making a decision,'' said the company's broker, Peter Riguardi, president of the New York region for Jones Lang LaSalle. ''If benefits are available, that would be part of their decision-making process.'' He said a decision was likely this summer. 
 Lower Manhattan has a more diverse roster of tenants than it used to, including architects, engineering firms and law firms, said Eric Deutsch, president of the Downtown Alliance. Still, ''whatever the city and state can do to keep anchor tenants downtown would be enormously helpful,'' he said. ''Companies like Merrill Lynch represent a huge part of the fabric of downtown.''
 But city and state officials say that the Goldman Sachs deal would not serve as a model for other corporate tenants. ''This is not the time to ask for huge subsidies,'' said Avi Schick, the president of the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's development arm. 
 Then, too, there is the question of what will happen to the market when Mr. Silverstein's new buildings are completed in 2011 and 2012, adding 6.2 million square feet. 
 ''If we continue at the pace we're going, the market will absolutely need it,'' said Mr. Clark of Brookfield. 
 At the same time, many real estate specialists say the 2.6-million-square-foot Freedom Tower, also on the World Trade Center site is a mistake, though most are not willing to say so publicly. Among the few willing to speak out are the developers Douglas Durst and Anthony E. Malkin. They recently ran ads in New York newspapers calling the tower ''the legacy of poor planning and decision-making by the Pataki administration'' with a design that is ''too expensive to build and cumbersome for tenants.''
 ''We respectfully propose rethinking these plans,'' they said.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Slips Quietly Into Recession

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
The nation's manufacturing sector managed to slip into a recession with almost nobody seeming to notice. Well, until yesterday.
 Wall Street was caught off guard when the Commerce Department reported yesterday morning that orders for durable goods -- big items like home computers and factory machines -- plunged almost 8 percent last month. That's a big number, but it really shouldn't have come as too much of a surprise. In two of the last three months, the manufacturing sector has shrunk, according to surveys by the Institute for Supply Management that have been out for weeks.
 But the new report seemed to focus investors' attention on the problems in manufacturing and became one more reason for people to sell stocks. By the time the market opened in New York, stocks in almost every industrialized country had already fallen sharply. 
 The trouble began in Asia, where the Chinese stock market plummeted, before spreading to Europe and finally this country. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended up with a loss of 3.4 percent, its fifth straight daily decline and its worst since 2003.
 All of which raises a question that would have sounded strange even a month ago. Is the entire United States economy in danger of going the way of the manufacturing sector? Is it possible that we're headed for a real recession? 
 For months now, the economy seemed to shrug off the forces weighing on it and just kept on growing. But those forces never went away. If anything, a number of them have gotten stronger. And that's the most worrisome part of the bad news from the nation's factories: it fits into a larger story.
 As stocks were dropping yesterday morning, an economist named Ian Shepherdson wrote one of his regular e-mail messages to clients: ''Manuf is in recession; Fed please take note.'' Mr. Shepherdson, it's important to mention, is not one of Wall Street's perma-bears. When manufacturing last shrank, back in 2003, he correctly insisted that it was a false harbinger. 
 But this time, the manufacturing downturn stems from a couple of larger economic problems. One, of course, is the housing slump, which has caused a big drop in new construction and much less demand for doors, windows, countertops and a lot of other things that kept factories busy in recent years. 
 In recent weeks, the troubles in housing have spilled into the financial sector. Big lenders like NovaStar Financial are paying the price for extending credit to people who couldn't actually afford the homes they bought during the real estate boom. With many of those homeowners falling behind on their mortgage payments, lenders are making it tougher to get loans. 
 That's a sensible, and overdue, move. But it will hurt economic growth in the months ahead. The second big problem for manufacturers is the series of interest rate increases that the Federal Reserve has imposed since 2004. 
 They may seem like old news, because the last of them came eight months ago, but it typically takes a year to a year and a half for a rate increase to have its full impact. A lot of the big decisions affected by interest rates, like whether to buy a new car or a new piece of factory equipment, aren't everyday decisions. Only now are some families and businesses starting to react to the higher rates. 
 The economic news certainly isn't all bad. The housing problems still haven't turned into a crisis, thanks in part to interest rates that are still not high by historical standards. So the most likely situation is not a full-blown recession (often defined as two consecutive quarters of a shrinking economy).
 The forecasters at the Economic Cycle Research Institute in New York, who have accurately predicted each of the last three recessions, argue that the current slowdown won't amount to much more than a lull. By the middle of the year, they say, low interest rates and healthy corporate spending will have the economy growing nicely once again. 
 Lakshman Achuthan, the institute's managing director, told me yesterday that he thought the odds of a recession over the next year were less than 20 percent. Mr. Shepherdson -- the chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, who's more bearish than most forecasters right now -- still puts the odds at only 30 percent.
 But for all the attention that formal recessions get on Wall Street, they are not really the benchmark that matters to most people. A significant slowdown that falls short of a recession can do a lot of damage to stock prices, profits and wages.
 Only in the last few months, for example, has the current expansion grown strong enough to give most American workers pay increases that outpace inflation. Those raises would be endangered if the economy were to slow from last year's growth rate of 3.4 percent to even 2 percent. 
 ''This is going to get worse before it gets better,'' Mr. Shepherdson argues. ''We're in danger of slipping into something very like a recession, if not necessarily hitting the technical definition. It would be big enough to hurt, that's for sure.''
 The main message of yesterday's worldwide stock sell-off -- as well as the stealth manufacturing downturn -- is that the economy is facing bigger risks than we imagined just a few weeks ago.
 In mid-February, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, told members of Congress that he was worried about inflation taking off. The clear implication was that the Fed's next move might be to raise rates yet again to keep the economy from overheating.
 Until yesterday, that seemed plausible. It doesn't this morning. Like stocks, the price of a futures contract tied to Fed policy shifted sharply yesterday.
 Before the day began, investors expected the Fed to hold its benchmark rate steady through the end of the summer. Now they are betting that the rate will be cut once before July and again by the end of the year. If that's all that is necessary to keep the economy healthy, it will be a relief.

HEADLINE: Orders for Durable Goods Dropped 7.8% Last Month

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
American manufacturers reported a sharp drop in demand last month for expensive heavy-duty items, renewing concerns about softness in the economy.
 The Commerce Department reported yesterday that orders for durable goods -- which include equipment like household appliances, jet engines and computer parts -- fell 7.8 percent in January after increasing in November and December.
The decline, announced before stock markets opened in the United States, helped drive the sell-off on Wall Street. Investors were already wary after a plunge in Chinese stock markets overnight that spread across Asia to Europe. By the end of the day, stock prices in the United States had made their steepest plunge since 2003. 
 Wall Street was expecting a drop in durable-goods orders, but the January data was far weaker than economists had forecast. In addition to the 7.8 percent drop over all, the government's measure of core durable goods, a less volatile figure because it excludes civilian aircraft and military spending, declined 3.4 percent.
 ''This raises broader questions about prospects for growth going forward,'' said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist with Morgan Stanley. ''The markets in a broad sense have been expecting that this year would be another year just like the last four, which have been really outstanding globally and in the U.S. I think that view is now getting drawn into question.''
 But what troubled some economists most about the durable goods data was a slide in a closely watched measure of business spending. Orders for nonmilitary capital goods, excluding aircraft, fell 6 percent, the third drop in four months. Because economists see that figure as a reliable snapshot of businesses' expectations for future growth, any signs of a pullback are cause for concern.
 ''I think you have to believe there's a little bit of a shock to business confidence going on,'' said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist for Lehman Brothers. ''It's a little hard to understand why capital goods orders are so low because you have easy borrowing conditions. Corporations are loaded with cash and profits.''
 A slight rebound in sales of previously owned homes did little to lift the dour mood on Wall Street yesterday. A new report from the National Association of Realtors said that sales of existing homes, which account for about 85 percent of all home sales in the United States, rose 3 percent in January. But the association noted that unusually warm weather probably helped inflate the numbers.
 In a further sign that the housing market remains in a slump, the median price of a previously owned home declined in January to $210,600, down 3 percent from January 2006. That also probably helped raise sales this January, economists said.
 Still, inventories of unsold homes remain elevated. In January, it would have taken 6.6 months to sell all previously owned homes on the market, the same amount of time it would have taken in December. 
 While other housing market indicators like a recent increase in mortgage applications have led some economists to speculate that the worst of the housing slump may have passed, many experts said any hints of a recovery are still too tentative.Industrial Production Slips in Japan
 TOKYO, Wednesday, Feb. 28 (Reuters) -- Japanese industrial production logged its biggest month-on-month decline in three years in January, casting doubt on the strength of the nation's corporate sector and reinforcing views that the Bank of Japan will go slow on any future rate increases.
 Output fell 1.5 percent in January from the previous month, government data showed on Wednesday. 
 Japan's retail sales rose in January as shoppers flocked to new year's sales, suggesting consumer spending may be recovering in the world's second-largest economy.

HEADLINE: Kitchen Chemistry Is Chic, but Is It a Woman's Place?

BYLINE: By LAURA SHAPIRO

 BODY:
HERE'S how Loretta Keller, the chef at Coco500 in San Francisco, makes chocolate cake, one of her trademark desserts: She melts butter and chocolate together, stirs in egg yolks, sugar and flour, and adds beaten egg whites. She bakes and cools the cake, refrigerates it for two hours to give it the texture she likes, and brings it to room temperature before serving with whipped cream.
 And here's how Will Goldfarb, the chef at Room 4 Dessert in NoLIta, makes one of his specialties, as outlined on his Web site, willpowder.net: ''Bring 100 ml milk to a boil with sugar,'' it begins. Infuse roasted cocoa seeds and coffee beans, it adds, going on:
''Strain, and puree 100 ml infusion with methylcellulose following instructions for hydration. Bring to 80-90C then rapidly chill to 4C. Warm remaining 300 ml milk to dissolve gelatin: reserve at 35C. Begin whipping methylcellulose base in mixer, slowly adding gelatin base and making a stable mousse. Freeze in molds, unmold, and warm to order in the salamander.'' 
 Gender differences in professional cooking probably go back to the hunters and gatherers -- more precisely, to the day it first occurred to the hunters to award four stars to themselves and none to the gatherers. But rarely have the differences seemed as stark as they do now, when the chefs winning some of the most bedazzled press coverage in memory belong to a breed of culinary artists who are overwhelmingly male. 
 These chefs are devotees of Ferran Adria, whose El Bulli restaurant, on the Costa Brava of Spain a couple of hours from Barcelona, produces lengthy meals made up of dozens of little chemistry experiments -- food that has been wreaked into powders, foams, extrusions and gels designed to deliver head-spinning doses of flavor, texture and aroma. It's a rarefied cuisine, to say the least, calling for kitchens outfitted like laboratories and grocery lists headed by liquid nitrogen. 
 Yet it has changed the definition of greatness in restaurant cooking. Today a chef needs the most advanced technology, not just the ripest peaches, to qualify for stardom. Last fall Gourmet magazine named Alinea -- the Chicago restaurant known as the leading exemplar of Adria-inspired cooking in America -- best in country. 
 But where are the women? They've long been underrepresented in the upper echelons of restaurant cooking. But the imbalance is even more stark in the realm of laser-incinerated cornstarch. Round up all the women entranced by high-tech cuisine in America, and they could easily fit into a Jacuzzi. Some of the most experienced female chefs are persuaded that the new cuisine will never attract many women. It's just too male. 
 ''It's not very nourishing emotionally,'' said Ann Cooper, author of '' 'A Woman's Place Is in the Kitchen,' '' a history of female chefs in America. ''This is a huge generalization, but women's cooking has always been based on nurturing. Tall food was a male invention; women weren't doing much of it. Basically, women feed people.''
 Yet the few women who do work in the new culinary laboratories tell a different story. They don't feel like interlopers or male impersonators. They're simply becoming chefs -- and they're doing it in an entirely different way from the women who preceded them.
 Traditionally, the only way for an ambitious woman to get experience in the world of professional cooking was to plunge into the chaos of a typical testosterone-driven restaurant kitchen. That's if she was lucky enough to get in the door in the first place. (California has long been an exception: female-friendly kitchens have been standard there ever since Alice Waters opened Chez Panisse in 1971.) But when it comes to the new cuisine, the old rules don't seem to apply.
 Pamela Yung, for instance, didn't have to steel herself to face a hostile French kitchen, nor did she train in California. She didn't train anywhere. After majoring in computer science and design at the University of Michigan, she was working in a Detroit design firm when she saw a notice on eGullet, the food-maven Web site. Mr. Goldfarb was about to open Room 4 Dessert and needed a stagiaire, or trainee, who would work long hours for low pay. ''On a whim, I e-mailed him,'' said Ms. Yung, 24. 
 She started work the day the before the restaurant opened. ''I was completely overwhelmed,'' she said. ''I just did whatever I was told.'' But she wasn't intimidated by the machinery, and today she's a believer, perfectly comfortable turning out white beer sorbets, Earl Grey tea panna cottas and apricot flake salt. 
 ''The machines just give you more options,'' she said. ''They're not traditional cooking utensils, but they're cooking utensils, and they're going to become the norm.'' 
 Her best friend in the food world is Rosio Sanchez, also 24, who studied pastry in the Cordon Bleu program in Chicago and worked briefly at Park Avenue Cafe before being hired by Alex Stupak, the pastry chef at WD-50 on the Lower East Side. ''I was very nervous,'' Ms. Sanchez said. ''So many chemicals -- gums, methylcellulose, maltodextrin.'' 
 But she credited Mr. Stupak and Wylie Dufresne, the founder of WD-50, with running a nonhierarchical kitchen where beginners, including women, can thrive. ''It's a great place to get trained,'' she said. ''We've got total access to all the ingredients, and anyone with free time will grab stuff and try things. If you mess up, nobody yells at you, because we're all trying to learn.'' 
 Then there's Danielle Soranno, 23, a station chef at Alinea who had a few years of professional cooking when she started there four months ago. Although she is the only woman among 30 cooks, she said she has nothing but admiration for how the place runs. ''This is the smoothest, cleanest, best-organized kitchen I've ever seen,'' she said.
 What's more, women working in the new mode say they don't feel they are missing out on the elemental satisfactions of traditional cooking. Elena Arzak, the much-praised Spanish chef at her family's century-old Restaurante Arzak in San Sebastian, was profoundly influenced by El Bulli and is developing her own take on Mr. Adria's innovations. But she insisted that a chemistry-based cuisine can be as warm and personal as any other. ''The science just helps me cook,'' she said.
 Ms. Soranno pointed out that the cooks at Alinea have to know all the classics -- stocks, reductions, even cakes -- as well as be able to experiment. (She admitted that she likes to make soup and bake bread on her days off.) Ms. Yung is just happy to be in the business of feeding people. ''It's so natural and fundamental,'' she said. ''That's why I wanted to cook. So I'm giving someone foam, instead of a piece of cake. What's the difference?''
 The women who work in these new-style kitchens say ideas and open-mindedness are the currency, not vitriol and bravado, and that the heavy lifting is not physical but intellectual. David Arnold, director of culinary technology at the French Culinary Institute in New York, said that women are just as intrigued as men when he gives demonstrations of the new ingredients and techniques. ''I don't think this mode of cooking is skewed by gender,'' he said. 
 Maybe all the machines and chemicals are contributing to a revolution other than the one about frozen air and warm gelatin. ''Restaurant kitchens were organized like military brigades, because that was the only way to turn out such a volume of work and make all the fast decisions that were necessary,'' said Mr. Goldfarb of Room 4 Dessert. ''Now it's more like the modern military, using technology as opposed to brute strength.''
 But many women dreaming of a restaurant career still may not see the appeal of a laboratory kitchen. Ms. Yung and Ms. Sanchez have been struck by how few women are in high-end restaurant kitchens of any sort. ''We're always wondering where the girls are,'' Ms. Yung said. 
 Maybe settling on an official name for the movement would help. The chief contenders -- ''space age,'' ''hypermodern'' or ''extreme'' cuisine -- come straight from boys' comic books. But in America, at least, the movement has a history its partisans never talk about -- a history that happens to be packed with women. 
 It was the home economists of the late 19th century who first had the idea of transforming the old-fashioned kitchen into a sleek, modern chemistry lab, so that cooking would no longer be seen as traditional women's drudgery but would rise to the status of a science worthy of the finest male mind. Why not acknowledge these roots and call it ''Celebrity Home Ec''? 
 If women do start showing up in the new technocooking in significant numbers, Gabrielle Hamilton, who provides unpretentious but flavor-packed food at her restaurant, Prune, in the East Village, will be watching with interest. 
 ''Historically, when women move into men's work it loses value,'' she said. ''Maybe we'll see the pay drop, and the science suddenly getting called 'soft.' I'll say this: If you see me doing foams at Prune, you'll know the whole thing has gone down the tube.''

HEADLINE: Family Second

BYLINE: By Michele Wucker. 
Michele Wucker is the author of ''Lockout: Why America Keeps Getting Immigration Wrong When Our Prosperity Depends on Getting It Right.''

 BODY:
THE Senate's expected introduction this week of a revamped education bill will draw needed attention to the question of who may live and work in the United States. Making sure that the workers we need can come here legally should be a priority -- but it's not. Of the permanent-resident visas (green cards) awarded in 2005, 58 percent went to foreign-born relatives of United States citizens; only 22 percent were connected to employment. 
 Family ties are profound, and we should continue to admit spouses, minor children and parents of naturalized and native-born American citizens without quotas. But it makes no sense that roughly as many green cards are available to adult siblings and adult children of citizens -- with no regard for their job abilities -- as for skilled workers.
There are shortages of both temporary and permanent visas for scientists, engineers, mathematicians, doctors and nurses. I've interviewed dozens of talented people who gave up waiting and took their skills elsewhere. Meanwhile, family chain migration is common: an immigrant becomes a citizen, then invites his brother, who brings in his children and his wife, who eventually can sponsor her parents and her sister, who can bring her children and husband and his parents. As a result, the foreign-born population in the United States has increased to record numbers since the current system was created in 1965.
 Our economy depends heavily on skilled immigration. Half of research and development workers, one-quarter of doctors and nurses, and a quarter of all doctoral degree holders were born in other countries. Government and trade groups estimate that we need some 20,000 more doctors and 300,000 more nurses. Yet because only 140,000 employment-based visas are available each year, skilled workers can wait five years or more for a green card. Annual per-country visa caps make the wait even longer for high-migration countries like India and China, which send us many engineers and scientists, or the Philippines, which sends many nurses.
 Skilled workers with professional careers are less likely than unskilled, low-wage workers to risk working under the table. A few lucky ones obtain visas when they marry American citizens. Even those who get green cards can find their spouses and children entangled in the system; there's a six-year wait to reunite the nuclear family of a Mexican green card holder.
 Phasing out family-based preferences for adult siblings and adult children would free up 138,066 green cards a year, nearly doubling the size of the job-based category and making space for green card holders to bring wives and younger children. Adult siblings and adult children could still immigrate under more readily available job-based visas. 
 As adult-relative visas are phased out, we must address the plight of roughly a million extended adult relatives waiting for visas because of country or category caps. Still, eliminating the system's false promise would be fairer for all concerned.
 New laws could make it easier for the workers we need to come in the front door instead of sneaking through the back door -- or going elsewhere. Even those who so far have opposed increasing work visas ought to see the value of doing so in return for a solution that eases chain-migration pressures and reflects demographic and economic reality.

An Op-Ed article yesterday, about expanding visas for skilled workers, at one point misidentified the relevant legislation that the Senate is taking up this week. It is a revamped immigration bill, not an education bill.

HEADLINE: Low Pay and Broken Promises Greet Guest Workers in U.S.

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
To a rice farmer from Thailand making $500 a year, the recruiter's pitch was hard to resist -- three years of farm work in North Carolina that would pay more than 30 times as much as he earned at home.
 The pitch was so persuasive that the farmer, Worawut Khansamrit, put his farm up as collateral to pay the recruiter $11,000 to become a guest worker. ''The amount of money they promised was very attractive,'' said Mr. Khansamrit, a slight, soft-spoken 40-year-old with a 15-year-old daughter he wants to send to college.
But after he arrived in North Carolina with 30 other Thai workers, he found there was only about a month's work. He was then taken to New Orleans to remove debris from a hotel damaged by Hurricane Katrina -- work he says he was never paid for. This month, he and other Thai workers filed a federal lawsuit asserting that they were victims of illegal trafficking.
 Mr. Khansamrit's tale highlights the abuses that many guest workers face at a time when President Bush and many in Congress are pushing to expand the guest worker program as part of an overhaul of the nation's immigration laws. 
 Each year 120,000 foreign workers receive visas to do farm work or other low-skilled labor, usually for three to nine months. These programs grew out of the World War II bracero program, in which hundreds of thousands of Mexicans worked on farms and railroads, often in deplorable conditions. 
 Labor experts say employers abuse guest workers far more than other workers because employers know they can ship them home the moment they complain. They also know these workers cannot seek other jobs if they are unhappy. 
 ''I'd say a substantial majority of U.S. guest workers experience some abuses with their paycheck,'' said David Griffith, a professor in the anthropology department at East Carolina University and author of the new book ''American Guestworkers: Jamaicans and Mexicans in the U.S. Labor Market.'' ''It's the recruitment process especially where they get cheated.''
 The abuses take many forms. Guest workers often pay exorbitant fees and are frequently given fewer weeks of work and lower wages than promised. Many employers fail to make good on their commitment to pay transportation costs. The Thai workers, who were supposed to be paid $16,000 a year for three years, ended up earning a total of just $1,400 to $2,400. Most of the Thai workers had their passports taken away after they arrived, leaving them trapped. 
 ''The program has been rife with abuses, even during the best of times,'' said Cindy Hahamovitch, a history professor at the College of William and Mary, who is writing a book about guest workers. ''There will never be enough inspectors to check every labor camp, contract and field.''
 For decades, farmers, tree-planting companies, and hotel and restaurant owners have argued that they need guest workers, citing a shortage of Americans willing to fill jobs in their industries. In Washington, many supporters of an expanded guest worker program say they want to strengthen protections to curb abusive treatment.
 ''The business community supports the idea that these temporary workers should have the exact same employment protections as American workers,'' said Randel Johnson, co-chairman of the Essential Worker Immigration Coalition, a business group lobbying to expand the guest worker program. ''When an employer can't find an American worker to fill a job, the economy is helped if the employer can find someone else.''
 Critics, including many labor unions and immigrant groups, say employers exaggerate the labor shortage because they are eager for cheap, docile, temporary labor from abroad. The critics say there would not be such a shortage of American workers if employers offered a living wage for these jobs. 
 In Congress, proposals to expand protections for guest workers include a provision to bar employers from retaliating when these workers protest and one that would let them sue in federal court over contract violations.
 Earlier this month, Mr. Khansamrit and 21 other guest workers sued several labor contractors and farmers in federal court in North Carolina, accusing them of fraud, breach of contract, minimum wage violations and illegal trafficking. 
 The lawsuit, brought by Legal Aid of North Carolina, asserts that the contractors received recruitment fees that are illegal under Thai law, provided far less work than promised, and violated federal law by not paying transportation costs from abroad and not paying three-fourths of the wages promised.
 ''None of them gave us what they promised,'' said Pradit Wiangkham, 42, a Thai electrician turned guest worker. Mr. Wiangkham also worked unpaid in New Orleans, where he said the contractor ordered the workers to sleep in a foul-smelling hotel that had no electricity, lights, hot water or potable water. In North Carolina, the living arrangements were not much better; at times 33 Thai workers slept in a storage shed behind the labor contractor's house, the workers said. 
 The workers' lawyers say federal officials should have detected that something was awry because the contractors were applying to bring in so many Asian workers to work just three months. 
 ''Why would someone want to bring workers from Asia all the way to the East Coast for such a short-term, low-wage job?'' said Lori Elmer, a lawyer for the workers. ''They couldn't break even unless there was fraud.''
 Seo Homsombath, the president of Million Express Manpower, a small labor contracting company that works closely with recruiters overseas, did not respond to faxes and a letter to his home in North Carolina. Roy Raynor, another principal, declined comment. 
 But in a separate lawsuit, Mr. Raynor testified that Mr. Homsombath and he were supposed to receive payments from the recruiters in Thailand. He said he was to receive $1,200 for each worker, ostensibly for training them to pick cucumbers. 
 David James, a Labor Department spokesman, said the department was investigating whether the contractor failed to provide adequate wages and housing and failed to pay for transportation. He said the department had no rules regarding the payment of recruitment fees overseas.
 Advocates say the Labor Department should require employers to repay recruitment fees and transportation costs from abroad when such costs effectively bring the workers' wages below the minimum wage.
 The Thai guest workers are not alone in their complaints. Legal Aid of North Carolina has also sued on behalf of three Indonesians. 
 Several of the Indonesians and Thais have applied for special visas available to workers who have been trafficked illegally. With such visas, they hope to work in the United States to repay their debts. 
 ''I felt completely defrauded,'' said Indra Budiawan, who had been a waiter in Indonesia. ''They never gave me any work after I arrived.''
 Mr. Budiawan, 28, paid $6,000 -- 10 times his annual pay -- putting up his in-laws' ancestral land as collateral after a recruiter showed him a brochure about farm work in North Carolina and about the good housing and food that guest workers receive. ''When I was at the airport in Jakarta, I felt very happy,'' he said. ''I felt extremely proud about the job I would have in America, given that there is so much poverty and unemployment in Indonesia.''
 But when he arrived, the head of the GTN Employment Agency, Leeta Kang, told him there were no farm jobs. He was taken to a sign-making store that was the contractor's main business. There, Mr. Budiawan slept on the storage room floor, waiting for work that never materialized.
 Mr. Budiawan told Ms. Kang that he wanted to leave. But he said she demanded $2,000 for a return ticket and for the passport she had taken from him. After two weeks without work, Mr. Budiawan fled. He is now living in Miami with two other Indonesian guest workers.
 Mr. Budiawan called his father-in-law, whose land was used as collateral, to explain his predicament. ''I felt very ashamed,'' he said. ''Everyone was depending on me. And now the bank has taken steps to repossess our ancestral land.''
 Ms. Kang insisted that it was not her fault there was no work for Mr. Budiawan. ''He showed up way behind schedule,'' she said. ''By the time he arrived, the farm owner had already canceled everything.''
 Ms. Kang said a squash farmer had completed his harvest and no longer needed Mr. Budiawan. She said she had tried in vain to contact the recruiters in Indonesia to alert them that she no longer needed Mr. Budiawan and several others.
 ''The agents in Indonesia were obviously just trying to get money out of them,'' Ms. Kang said. ''Whatever these people paid, none of it went to us.'' 
 Mike Moore, the squash farmer, said Ms. Kang had asked him to apply for far more guest workers than he needed. ''She told me to take 50,'' he said. ''I told her, 'I might need five. I might need 25.' She said, 'That's no problem. Even if you don't need them, we have plenty of work for them in other places.' '' 
 Some experts say abuses are more likely when contractors, rather than farmers, bring in guest workers.
 ''The guest worker program is not for contractors who feel they might be able to find work for other people,'' said Mary Bauer, director of the Immigrant Justice Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center. ''It's for people who have a compelling need to bring in workers from abroad. There's an enormous incentive for contractors to bring in as many people as possible, even when there isn't enough work, because they often make money from recruitment fees.''
 Experts say that in some states, contractors bring in less than 10 percent of the guest workers, while in other states, they bring in half.
 Like the other Thai guest workers, Chinnawat Kompeemay, who ran a grocery store near Bangkok, is in limbo, living in temporary housing in Virginia.
 ''All I wanted was to provide my children with a better education and living standards,'' he said. ''If my children get the education I want them to have, they won't be tricked the same way. They won't be taken advantage of like their father.''

HEADLINE: Voices From the Gritty Side of Film and TV Argue for a Union

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Two days after the Academy Awards, as many boldface names still basked in glory, some of their way-behind-the-scenes colleagues testified at a forum in Midtown Manhattan about life in the real world of film and television.
 ''We get cursed on in every language in New York City,'' said Matthew Ancrum, 49, a production assistant who lives in Bedford Park in the Bronx. 
Rafael Diaz, 43, also from the Bronx, recalled a day last year when a woman in Washington Heights was so angry that his television crew was restricting parking in the neighborhood that she ''spat in my face.'' 
 In New York City, most workers on film and television crews belong to a union. But the people who testified yesterday at the forum, organized by the City University of New York, are non-unionized workers known as parking production assistants.
 Their duties include putting up fliers the day before a film crew comes to a neighborhood, dropping orange parking cones on the street, safeguarding a site before filming begins and shooing drivers away from parking spaces at all hours.
 The assistants sometimes work on low-budget shoots, but more often on potential Hollywood blockbusters like ''I Am Legend,'' a vampire thriller starring Will Smith that is now in production.
 It is a hard job, with long hours, sometimes two 12-hour shifts in a row; low pay, typically under $10 an hour; no bathroom breaks; and no health insurance or other benefits, production assistants said during the forum, held at CUNY's Joseph S. Murphy Institute for Worker Education and Labor Studies.
 During the two-hour hearing, a half-dozen workers -- most of them men -- and other supporters were among those who spoke. The testimony was intended to underscore their campaign for a union. They said they liked their jobs and, for the most part, liked their bosses. But they contended that their working conditions would improve substantially with a union. 
 Last year, according to the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting, more than 250 films and 100 television programs were shot in the five boroughs. The productions contributed at least $5 billion to the city's economy, and parking production assistants played a small but essential role in that effort.
 And ''for the record,'' said Julianne Cho, assistant commissioner of the city's film office, ''we don't close down streets. A production may or may not hire parking production assistants to reserve the permitted spaces.''
 How do the assistants reserve the spaces? ''Well,'' she said, ''that's a question for the production assistants.''
 For Mr. Ancrum, who has been a production assistant for 15 years and now works on ''Law & Order: Criminal Intent,'' it sometimes takes street diplomacy, with a dash of blarney.
 ''I've been cursed in Dominican, Colombian, Italian, people from Paris, Irish, Jewish, black, Cuban -- and all because I tell them they can't park their car here,'' he said.
 The toughest are the drug dealers.
 ''I know you're looking at me all crazy,'' said Mr. Ancrum, re-enacting the parking pitch he uses on drug dealers. ''But, listen, I'm working production here. They're going to have police officers here and police tow trucks for the cars that are still here. If you want to argue, that's fine, but the police commander is going to shut you down, and you ain't making no money.''
 Ted Feng, an organizer with the United Auto Workers who is helping the production assistants in their unionization effort, said about two-thirds of the city's 300 parking production assistants wanted a union.
 But the U.A.W. wants management to recognize the workers as a union through majority signup rather than have them go through the prolonged election process supervised by the National Labor Relations Board. That process can involve many appeals, Mr. Feng said, and ''favors management.'' 
 But which management? Film and television production is often decentralized and does not resemble the steel and auto industries. 
 The ''Law & Order'' television franchise, for example, involves three shows: the original and two spinoffs, ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit'' and ''Law & Order: Criminal Intent.'' 
 Each has its own production company overseen by Dick Wolf, the franchise creator, and are broadcast by NBC, which is a unit of the conglomerate NBC Universal. A spokesman for NBC Universal declined comment.

HEADLINE: Battle in Maine Pits Lobstermen Against Fishermen

BYLINE: By ARIEL SABAR

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Me., Feb. 27 

 BODY:
For decades, two groups of Maine fishermen, its trawler captains and its lobstermen, harvested the ocean floor in relative harmony. The trawlers netted cod, haddock and other so-called groundfish. Lobster boats trapped Maine's best-known delicacy.
 But the days of friendly fishing may be over. Trawler captains and lobstermen are preparing for a battle next week before the Maine Legislature, which is set to take up a bill to let the beleaguered groundfishermen sell some of the lobsters accidentally caught in their nets. 
Maine is the only state where it is illegal to land lobster not caught in traps. And the powerful lobster industry here is adamant that no one encroach on its turf.
 ''They ruined their fishery totally,'' David Cousens, president of the Maine Lobstermen's Association, said of the groundfishermen. ''Now they're looking to us to bail them out, and it's just not going to happen. No way. There are 6,400 lobstermen that will go nuts if they even consider it.''
 Officials in the groundfish industry say they are asking for a small share, no more than 6 percent, of the state's lobster bounty. Unless Maine aligns its statute with laws in other states, they say, the industry will not be here in a decade.
 ''Bug pickers,'' Lendall Alexander, 47, a third-generation fisherman from Harpswell, Me., said of the lobstermen. ''They've got all that lobster to themselves.''
 The battle follows a free fall in Maine's fishing economy.
 The state's fleet of deep-sea trawlers has shrunk to about 100 boats, from more than 300 in the early 1980s, because of sharp federal limits intended to restore imperiled stocks of groundfish, so named because they are bottom dwellers. 
 Dozens of fish plants and boat shops have folded. And from 1999 to 2004, the last years for which figures are available, Maine lost more seafood wholesaling and processing jobs than all the rest of New England. 
 Hank Soule, the executive director of the Portland Fish Exchange, an auction house where 90 percent of Maine's groundfish are sold, said the plight of fishermen and shoreline businesses was so dire that other rescue efforts, like a proposal to end the tax on boat fuel, were not enough. 
 ''The groundfishermen have traditionally grit their teeth and said, 'We'll deal with it,' '' Mr. Soule said. ''They can't anymore.'' 
 Under current law, ''bycatch'' lobsters, those that wind up in the large nets dragged by trawlers, have to be tossed back. 
 The proposed bill would allow fishermen 100 bycatch lobsters a day, the limit under federal law, and restrict the activity to offshore waters, where few Maine lobstermen trap.
 In an era of looser regulations, fishermen weathered lean years by moonlighting as trap lobstermen. But getting a state lobster license can now take up to a decade, and few can afford the wait. The chance to sell a few hundred lobsters per trip would increase incomes by a sorely needed 15 percent to 20 percent, and keep the struggling fish exchange, a nonprofit, in business, Mr. Soule said. 
 But the lobstermen's association says that trawl nets damage lobster shells and would taint the image of ''the world-class product Maine is famous for.'' Mr. Cousens, the group's president, said: ''A drag is like harvesting your potato field with a bulldozer. You can get some potatoes, but you sure as heck would wreck most of them.''
 Maine's trawler captains disagree. They say they have sold plenty of bycatch lobsters in Massachusetts, where the lobsters are legal and a growing number of local vessels now unload to sidestep Maine's law.
 Gov. John Baldacci has taken the fishermen's woes seriously, convening a task force that warned in 2004 that the state's ''fishing communities are facing one of the greatest threats in their 300-year history.'' About 16 million pounds of groundfish were landed in Maine in 2005, down from nearly 78 million in 1982. 
 But the state is siding with the lobstermen on the bill. Though lobsters are flourishing, state officials say, a report last year by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission expressed ''concern if not alarm'' over signs of a possible collapse.
 David Etnier, deputy commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources, said the state's trap-only law had helped sustain record-setting lobster harvests in recent years. Any rollback, Mr. Etnier said, would undercut Maine's history of lobster conservation.
 Opposition to the bill from the lobster industry has been so fierce that a legislative hearing on March 5 has been moved from the State House to the Augusta Civic Center in anticipation of large crowds. 
 In the meantime, Maine trawlers are increasingly bypassing local piers for Massachusetts. The number of trips to out-of-state ports more than tripled from 2000 to 2005, to 160 a year, depriving Maine dealers of $9.6 million in seafood, according to a federal analysis.
 As his crew hoisted buckets of gray sole and monkfish onto the docks at the Portland Fish Exchange on a recent morning, Mr. Alexander, the groundfisherman, said he never thought he would sell his catch outside the state where his father and grandfather had fished. But next month, he will join the fishermen unloading in Massachusetts.
 ''I do want to do business in Maine and land my fish in Maine because these are my friends, my neighbors and in some cases my family,'' he said in his trawler's wheelhouse after two frigid days at sea. ''But I've also got to pay the bills on this thing.''

HEADLINE: Scientists Urge Global Action On Clean Energy

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
A scientific panel convened at the request of the United Nations called Tuesday for drastic reductions in fossil-fuel emissions around the world and rapid increases in spending on clean-energy research to head off the worst effects of global warming. 
 In a 166-page report, two years in the making, 18 scientists from 11 nations forecast a turbulent century of rising seas, spreading drought and disease, weather extremes and damage to farming, forests, fisheries and other economic areas.
 It said the United Nations must better prepare to help tens of millions of ''environmental refugees,'' and it urged all governments to discourage new building on land less than one meter -- about 39 inches -- above sea level.
 The report was sponsored by the private United Nations Foundation and Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Society.
 The recommendations come three weeks after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations network of 2,000 scientists, made its latest assessment.
 That group concluded for the first time that global warming was ''unequivocal'' and that it had been caused largely by the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, mostly from burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels. If nothing is done, it said, global temperatures could rise 11 degrees by 2100. But it avoided recommending courses of action.
 In contrast, the scientists who produced the new report said global carbon dioxide emissions should be made to level off in the years 2015 to 2020, and then be cut back to less than one-third of that level by 2100. This would happen, they said, through a vast transformation toward greater efficiency, away from fossil fuels and toward biofuels and solar and wind technology. 
 The scientists urged governments to immediately ban the construction of coal-fired power plants, except for those designed to capture carbon dioxide and store it underground or under water.
 The Bush administration says it is spending almost $3 billion a year on energy technology research as its major contribution to combating climate change. But the expert panel said such research was badly underfinanced, and required a tripling or quadrupling of worldwide spending, to $45 billion or $60 billion a year, from $15 billion now.

HEADLINE: European Stocks Extend Slump

BYLINE: By AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb 28, 2007 

 BODY:
Heavy gloom on world stock markets deepened in morning trading in Europe on Wednesday with sharp falls in London, Frankfurt and Paris on signs of economic slowdown in the United States and an end to a speculative bubble in China.
 London's FTSE 100 index and the CAC 40 in Paris are now trading at levels below those seen at the end of 2006, after Europe's main stock markets hit six-year peaks during the first two months of 2007. 
Many market watchers took the view that the falls were a necessary correction in an upward market trend.
 In early European trading, London's FTSE 100 index of leading shares dropped 1.40 percent to 6,198.40 points, while the CAC 40 was showing a fall of 1.04 percent to 5,530.54 points.
 Frankfurt's DAX 30 index slid 1.42 percent to 6,722.39 points.
 Europe's main indices had already plummeted between 2.0 and 3.0 percent on Tuesday -- this ahead of declines of more than 3.0 percent for Wall Street.
 In Shanghai, share prices actually closed up 3.94 percent Wednesday, one day after slumping 8.8 percent -- which was their biggest single day loss in 10 years.
 The rebound helped Tokyo to pare its losses, with the benchmark Nikkei-225 index ending down 2.85 percent by the close.
 Commenting on the falls in Europe, Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin Securities in London, said: "I think giving up a few percentage points isn't a big deal, in the context of things, when we've had four great years of rising stock markets.
 "People tend to focus on the billions (of dollars) that have been lost yesterday (Tuesday) and possibly today but look at the trillions that were actually made over the past four year. I think one has to put it into perspective.
 "I am not particularly worried about the end to the Chinese speculative boom," Lenhoff added.
 "I don't think there's an end to the Chinese economic boom. I think that's going to continue and I don't think anybody is suggesting that it isn't going to continue. What's going on in the (Chinese) economy is for real and that will continue. What's going on in the stock market has been a lot of punting."
 The chief economist for Asia at Societe Generale, Glenn Maguire, said: "What we are seeing is the echo of the fall in the Chinese market (on Tuesday) and more importantly the fall that we saw in the US equity market overnight.
 "I don't think these moves significantly change the macroeconomic outlook for China which remains relatively firm at this stage. I think the markets should stabilise across the rest of the (Asian) region," he added.
 Market players were meanwhile nervously awaiting the start of trade on Wall Street later in the day after the Dow Jones (NYSE:DJ) Industrial Average ended down 3.29 percent on Tuesday -- the worst day on Wall Street since 2001.
 Comments from former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and rising tension about Iran's nuclear programme added to undermine investor jitters.
 Greenspan had warned on Monday that the US economy had been expanding since 2001 and that there were signs that the current economic cycle was coming to an end.
 "I feel relatively confident that we're still going to see a decent year out of the US and with that in mind it's just a matter of time before the correction produces a buying opportunity," Lenhoff said.
 "I don't feel this is the start of something really serious that is going to take us all the way back to where we started four years ago."
 On the foreign exchange market, the dollar rebounded but dealers predicted the recovery could be short-lived amid fresh volatility on stock markets and concerns about tensions in Iran and Afghanistan.
 Oil prices were meanwhile down about 50 cents in London and New York.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Expands in China As Its Growth Slows in U.S.

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
With growth slowing at its outlets in the United States and its stock price slumping, Wal-Mart Stores is aiming to gain greater access to the world's most rapidly growing major economy by buying into one of China's biggest retailers. 
 Wal-Mart said Tuesday that its purchase of a 35 percent stake in the Bounteous Company, a Taiwan-owned group that operates more than 100 retail outlets in China, is part of a strategy to expand in large emerging markets like Brazil and India, as well as China. 
Wal-Mart declined to say how much it paid to buy its stake in Bounteous, but people close to the deal said Wal-Mart had agreed to pay close to $1 billion to assume control of the Chinese retailer.
 China has a fast-growing middle class that may now number close to 50 million. But China's market is fragmented, and so far it has no dominant national retail chain like Wal-Mart. Bounteous, which operates in 34 cities in China under the name Trust-Mart, will continue to operate independently for now. 
 But eventually, Wal-Mart is expected to take control of Trust-Mart. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, currently operates 73 stores in China, and the company has more than 37,000 employees here. Trust-Mart has more than 31,000 employees in China working in hypermarket stores that sell everything from groceries and clothing to home appliances. 
 If Wal-Mart takes control of Bounteous, it would move into position to become China's dominant foreign retailer. But it faces stiff competition from other large Chinese retailers, as well as European retail rivals like Carrefour of France, Metro of Germany and Tesco of Britain.
 ''This is an important step in bringing additional scale to our China retail business,'' Michael T. Duke, the vice chairman of Wal-Mart, said in a statement.
 By acquiring a stake in the Trust-Mart parent Bounteous, which is privately held, Wal-Mart could surpass Carrefour, which has about 90 superstores operating here and had $2.3 billion in sales in 2005.
 But Wal-Mart's profits in China are unlikely to contribute significantly to its earnings over the next few years.
 Before the deal, Wal-Mart's China operations accounted for only a tiny fraction of its global sales, which were more than $344 billion last year. 
 In 2005, the most recent year with figures available, Wal-Mart had sales of about $1.3 billion in China, trailing Trust-Mart, which had sales of $1.7 billion, according to the China Chain Store and Franchise Association.
 Wal-Mart officials declined to confirm that figure, saying that the company does not break out Chinese sales numbers.
 In order to manage integration of the two operations, Wal-Mart said that it would appoint one of its executives as chief operating officer of Trust-Mart stores.
 ''The two teams from each company will work together starting today to find ways to cooperate,'' said Jonathan Dong, a spokesman for Wal-Mart in Shenzhen, China.
 Other major competitors here include the large Chinese retail groups, like China Resources, the Shanghai Brilliance Group and Lianhua supermarkets. 
 The Chinese government also recently made it easier for foreign retailers to set up operations here. Home Depot and Best Buy are opening branches in China, and dozens of other American and European retailers are also planning to move in. 
 Analysts say that Wal-Mart, which first entered the Chinese market in 1996, is trying to create a broader presence in China, which could mean many more acquisitions.
 ''From Wal-Mart's perspective, it's a foot in the door,'' said George Svinos, the chief of Asia Pacific retail for the accounting firm KPMG in Australia. ''You can clearly see why Wal-Mart is looking to invest in a country that by 2015 could have the largest economy in the world.''
 With the deal, Wal-Mart is also trying to get back on track after the company stumbled in South Korea and Germany. It sold its operations in those countries last year.
 The market in China is tough as well. Prices are extremely low, and infrastructure problems continue outside of the biggest cities. The marketplace is evolving quickly and is sometimes unpredictable. 
 For instance, Wal-Mart now has to cope with China's state-controlled unions, which are pushing their way into foreign-owned companies and retail operations.
 Last year, Wal-Mart agreed to allow unions to be set up in nearly all of its stores in China. 
 While unions in China are controlled by the state-run union federation and often lack bite, some analysts say they could be gaining influence here, and may begin bargaining for higher wages and better compensation packages.
 For Wal-Mart, however, China is not just a retail market; it is also the retailer's huge procurement center. Last year, more than $9 billion worth of goods from China went to Wal-Mart stores operating elsewhere.
 ''This is just 1 percent of what they need to do,'' Mr. Svinos said of Wal-Mart's stake in Trust-Mart stores. ''They need to create a critical mass and build a credible presence in the Chinese market. China has a lot of regions, and no one here really dominates.''

HEADLINE: Freddie Mac Tightens Standards

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ; Eric Dash contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The easy money is making a quick exit out of risky mortgages.
 During the housing boom that ended in 2005, money was poured with abandon into exotic home loans that let people buy homes with little down or without verifying their incomes. Now, lenders, financiers and buyers of mortgages are pulling back.
In a sign of that wariness, Freddie Mac, one of the largest buyers of mortgages, said yesterday that it would tighten lending standards and stop buying certain kinds of risky home loans made to borrowers with weak, or subprime, credit records.
 The move comes as default rates are rising, smaller lenders are starting to fail and investors are shunning bonds backed by mortgages. 
 The pullback will be most severely felt by minority and poor home buyers and owners, who will face trouble in refinancing adjustable rate loans that they can no longer afford. Those looking to buy homes with a small down payment or none could also be forced to pay higher interest rates and may not be able simply to declare their income without providing documentation like tax returns and paycheck stubs.
 ''Lenders and originators are being significantly penalized for the loose standards that we saw last year,'' said Brian J. Carlin, head of fixed-income trading at JPMorgan Private Bank. ''And they are going to take that out on current borrowers.''
 Financiers and buyers of mortgages are more concerned about the risks of their own investments. Though some skeptics and critics had been concerned about subprime mortgages for several years, the mortgages only recently began falling out of favor on Wall Street.
 The tipping points have been weakness in home prices and rising default rates among mortgages written as recently as the first half of 2006. In certain kinds of loans, the default rates six months after mortgages were issued are two or three times higher than defaults at the same stage among loans written in 2005.
 Indeed, concerns about the deterioration of the subprime market have weighed on financial stocks. Those concerns persisted yesterday amid a sharp sell-off in stock markets around the world.
 Although large forces in the mortgage market, Freddie Mac and its larger sister, Fannie Mae -- both created by Congress -- have played a small and diminishing role in the subprime business as large Wall Street institutions and hedge funds have become more active.
 The mortgage agencies do not buy such loans directly from the companies that write them, as they do with prime loans. Instead, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy bonds backed by subprime loans.
 Even as the market was growing in recent years, the agencies were pulling back; they bought $119.8 billion of subprime bonds in 2006, down from $169.4 billion in 2005 and $175.6 billion in 2004, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication.
 But Freddie's announcement is confirmation to other investors in mortgages that a segment of the market that was once Wall Street's darling finds itself in the doghouse. 
 ''Freddie is giving its stamp of approval to what the market has already done,'' said Dwight Jaffee, a real estate finance professor at the University of California, Berkeley. ''Already consumers were going to be finding these loans harder to get.'' 
 In another sign of problems in the sector, the Fremont General Corporation, a large provider of subprime mortgages through brokers and lenders, postponed filing earnings for the fourth quarter and for 2006. 
 Yesterday's move by Freddie Mac comes at a time when the Democratic-controlled Congress is taking up bills to restrict what critics call ''predatory lending'' and measures intended to limit Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which have been under scrutiny in recent years because of accounting problems. The agencies were created to make it cheaper for Americans to buy homes, by buying mortgages and packaging them into tradable bonds; together, they buy one in five home mortgages issued nationally.
 Freddie's move was praised by Democratic leaders in Congress and housing advocacy groups. The groups have criticized lenders, saying they take advantage of unsophisticated home buyers by giving them loans that are more costly and onerous than they could qualify for. But the Mortgage Bankers Association of America questioned the decision, saying it would hurt minority and other underserved home buyers.
 In a statement released yesterday, Fannie Mae said subprime loans represented just 2.2 percent of its business and it would not change its approach to the market until its regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, hands down guidance on mortgages.
 Richard F. Syron, Freddie's chairman and chief executive, noted that the agencies played a small part in the subprime market, with his agency holding about $184 billion of subprime securities in its portfolio. 
 Still, he added, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae would be called upon to play a bigger role as more lenders and investors pull out of the market in the coming months. He also rebutted the idea that the agency's move would hurt borrowers.
 ''You have to come back to the question: Do you want someone that is in a difficult situation now to get themselves into an even more difficult situation later on because they have postponed a day of reckoning?'' Mr. Syron said in a telephone interview yesterday.
 Freddie will put its new, stricter standards into effect for loans written on Sept. 1 and after. The impact will be greatest on adjustable rate mortgages that have a low fixed rate for the first two or three years but that adjust to higher rates after that. Under the new guidelines, borrowers will have to qualify as if the higher rates were already in effect. 
 It will also ''strongly recommend'' that lenders collect borrowers' taxes and insurance payments and put them in escrow for borrowers, a common practice in prime lending but one that is not uniformly followed in the subprime world.
 But the Mortgage Bankers Association criticized the move, specifically Freddie's decision not to buy bonds backed by adjustable rate mortgages if borrowers do not make enough money to make payments at the highest possible rate under the loans. Lenders will often make such loans based on borrowers' ability to pay the low initial payments.
 Kurt P. Pfotenhauer, a senior vice president with the mortgage bankers' group, said most borrowers refinance their loans before they adjust to higher, variable rates. He also noted that though defaults were rising, only 13.5 percent of subprime borrowers were either behind on payments or in foreclosure.
 ''Put another way, 86.5 percent of people who have subprime ARMs are paying on time,'' he said.
 The Federal Reserve reported yesterday that 2.11 percent of residential loans held by banks were delinquent at the end of 2006, the highest that figure has been since 2002.
 Still, other industry officials say the debate over Freddie's new, tighter standards will most likely be moot by the time they take effect, because bankers and brokers are already well on their way to tightening the money flowing into the housing market.
 First Franklin, one of the nation's largest subprime lenders and a subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Company, recently told mortgage brokers it does business with that it was raising the minimum credit scores for borrowers who wanted to finance 100 percent of a home's purchase price.
 All first-time home buyers will be required to put down at least 5 percent of the purchase price, or verify their income with tax documents.
 Community HousingWorks, a counseling service in San Diego, has seen an influx of borrowers who are in default on adjustable rate loans that had a fixed interest rate for the first two years of the loan's life.
 Gabriel del Rio, homeownership director at the counseling service, said many of the people are stuck in a tough place because weak credit scores make it hard for them to get another loan and the falling value of homes in the area has made it harder to sell properties bought in recent years. The price of single-family homes fell 4.5 percent in San Diego in the fourth quarter, according to the National Association of Realtors.
 ''We are getting about one call a day, and that started in the last quarter of last year,'' Mr. del Rio said. ''Before then it was literally nothing. We got one or two calls a year.''
 Robert Moulton, who owns a mortgage brokerage firm on Long Island, said the industry's greatest failing was not fully anticipating or preparing for the troubles of the housing market, especially the drop in home prices in some areas. Too many people believed that home prices would not or could not fall. 
 Adjustable rate loans made sense as long as home prices were rising; borrowers could sell their properties for more than they bought them or refinance using their rising equity.
 ''When these subprime loans were written, I honestly don't think anyone from the borrowers to the bank anticipated a collapse in real estate values,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Four Visionaries With Cloudy Visions

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

 BODY:
Nixon and MaoThe Week That Changed the WorldBy Margaret MacMillan404 pages. Illustrated. Random House. $27.95.
 The story of how Nixon came to meet Mao in 1972 has been told by journalists, historians and many of the principals themselves. It has been memorialized in film and mythologized as opera. ''Nixon to China'' must be one of the most widely understood terms of art in politics and diplomacy.
In that sense, the rapprochement between the United States and China makes a compelling topic for Margaret MacMillan, a Canadian historian now widely noted for writing seamless, big-picture historical narratives. In her previous work, ''Paris 1919: Six Months That Changed the World,'' she examined the negotiations that followed World War I, showing how a varied cast of outsize egos literally redrew the map of the world. 
 In ''Nixon and Mao: The Week that Changed the World,'' Ms. MacMillan seeks to present the frigid week in February 1972 that Richard M. Nixon spent in China in much the same way. She retells the tale engagingly, from Mao Zedong's enigmatic outbursts, to Zhou Enlai's seductive diplomacy, to Henry A. Kissinger's obsessive distrust of the State Department.
 Yet the momentous event that changed the world is a common conceit for popular works of history, and it is an unsatisfying premise for examining the opening salvo of the complex and unsettled relationship between the United States and China. 
 The re-establishment of relations was, of course, a milestone, but it was also an artifact of the cold war. It did not alter history the way any of Ms. MacMillan's four protagonists, Nixon, Mr. Kissinger, Mao and Zhou, thought it would. Ms. MacMillan acknowledges as much, but she has the delicate task of treating her main actors as visionaries when none of them foresaw the outcome.
 The United States has yet to abandon Taiwan and force it to return to mainland Chinese rule, perhaps China's most important goal in opening its door to Nixon. China did not pressure North Vietnam to make major concessions to end the Vietnam War on terms favorable to the United States, one of Nixon and Mr. Kissinger's dominant concerns. Their common rival, the Soviet Union, took two decades to collapse. 
 One event that arguably did more to change the world came a few years later, after Mao and Zhou had died, Nixon had resigned in disgrace, and Mr. Kissinger no longer had a patron in the White House. That was when Deng Xiaoping abandoned Maoist policies in both domestic and foreign relations and overhauled China's economy. Today China and America are no longer cards for each other to play. They have become giants warily circling each other in what could be the decisive contest of the 21st century.
 In describing Mr. Kissinger's intensive negotiations over the wording of the Shanghai Communique during Nixon's visit, Ms. MacMillan reports that he urged his Chinese hosts not to waste time discussing trade. ''The maximum amount of bilateral trade possible between us, even if we make great efforts, is infinitesimal in terms of our total economy,'' Mr. Kissinger said. Ms. MacMillan, with characteristic understatement, calls these ''interesting predictions.'' In 2006 China's trade surplus with the United States exceeded $230 billion.
 Yet it is clear that Ms. MacMillan did not write the book for the weighty reasons she claims. She wrote it because it is a gripping, old-fashioned drama from the ''great men'' school of history. It has larger-than-life characters whose motivations ranged from the sordid to the profound. They staked their reputations on bridging the chasm between the world's richest country and its most populous one at a time when far more modest strategic realignments seemed likely to upset the cold war balance of power.
 Ms. MacMillan explores the tectonic shift in the thinking of both top leaders that made the overture possible, then follows the intrigue of their tentative probes, through Poland, France and Pakistan, to open negotiations.
 Mao, at the time still championing the Cultural Revolution that was tearing his country apart, determined that he liked dealing with ''rightists'' like Nixon. Nixon, whose red-baiting anti-Communism carried him to the highest office in the land, fawned before Mao when invited to meet the chairman in his study.
 Both men, perhaps especially Nixon, were self-conscious about making a grand historical gesture. But they acted out of weakness. Nixon could find no face-saving solution to the Vietnam War. Mao's boundless paranoia had focused on his chosen successor, Lin Biao, even as his own health deteriorated sharply. Both sides worried deeply about the Soviet Union.
 Ms. MacMillan makes skillful use of the trove of archival information that has recently become public, mining it for detail that gives her narrative fullness and subtlety. 
 Nixon's presidential advance team left behind a Xerox machine when the Americans realized that the Chinese had to copy every diplomatic document manually. The Chinese insisted on having their own pilots fly Air Force One over Chinese territory, but they did not know how to use the advanced navigation system on the Boeing 707.
 The theme that comes through most clearly is the mendacity and pettiness of the Nixon White House. Nixon and Mr. Kissinger schemed to exclude their own State Department from any significant role and competed with each other to get credit with the news media.
 Mr. Kissinger, in a gesture that now seems recklessly generous, passed along to the Chinese reams of top-secret intelligence on the Soviet Union and India. That, and the fact that Nixon went to China without any assurance that Mao would meet him, signaled clearly that the Americans came as supplicants.
 Ms. MacMillan presents much of this information unvarnished and remains aloof from the raging debate over the conspiratorial style of Nixon and Mr. Kissinger. ''About Face,'' by Jim Mann, and ''A Great Wall,'' by Patrick Tyler, a former Beijing bureau chief of The New York Times, offered more polemical versions of the same events. William Burr also analyzed much of the material in ''The Kissinger Transcripts.''
 Ms. MacMillan's dispassionate approach does not challenge the historical record. She also does not fulfill her own promise of showing how the world was forever altered. But Nixon's meeting with Mao was undeniably a shock, and Ms. MacMillan has written an electrifying account.

HEADLINE: Films With Black Stars Seek to Break International Barriers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
When Jennifer Hudson, Beyonce Knowles, Anika Noni Rose and company blasted their way through three ''Dreamgirls'' songs on Sunday's Academy Awards broadcast, they also had a message for the millions watching around the world: 
 It wouldn't hurt to buy a movie ticket.
''Dreamgirls'' is a solid hit in the United States, with more than $100 million in domestic box office sales, and its backers at DreamWorks and Paramount Pictures have been tiptoeing into the international marketplace. They hope that a couple of Oscars and a globe-spanning broadcast of the trio's performance will help overcome any foreign resistance to the musical genre and -- more ticklishly -- to a nearly all-black cast.
 Only recently have movies begun to crack one of Hollywood's most troubling and least openly discussed problems: an international ''color line'' behind which films relying on black stars often do not perform well. The box office prowess of ''Dreamgirls'' overseas will help signal whether this newfound success is fleeting or more lasting. 
 ''I always call international the new South, '' said Reginald Hudlin, the director of ''House Party'' and ''The Ladies Man'' and now the entertainment president of BET Networks, where he oversees television and feature film operations. ''In the old days, they told you black films don't travel down South. Now they say it's not going to travel overseas.''
 Most Hollywood executives, producers and analysts interviewed for this article delicately maintained that the resistance to black performers abroad had had less to do with bigotry than with the international audience's lack of experience with the humor or urban situations that figure in many of their films. Some in the industry, though, were more blunt.
 ''The international marketplace is still fairly racist,'' said James Ulmer, proprietor of the Ulmer Scale, which compiles input from about 100 international film professionals in a periodic rating of stars' ''bankability.'' In Mr. Ulmer's rating, Will Smith, the highest-ranked black star, placed No. 12 over all last year, behind Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, Jim Carrey and others, notwithstanding industry chatter that has often tagged Mr. Smith as the biggest star today.
 This state of affairs may be changing. According to figures compiled by the box office reporting service Boxofficemojo.com, a series of 2005 films that staked their success squarely on black leads showed a strength in foreign theaters that has been seen rarely since Eddie Murphy had a period of global appeal after ''Beverly Hills Cop'' (1984).
 ''Inside Man'' and ''Deja Vu,'' both starring Denzel Washington, had more than half of their ticket sales abroad, while ''Big Momma's House 2,'' starring Martin Lawrence, approached that level despite conventional industry wisdom that says comedies with actors of color don't travel well. 
 Films with these actors have usually been soft at the international box office, though Mr. Washington did well when paired with Mr. Hanks in ''Philadelphia,'' as did Mr. Lawrence when acting with Mr. Smith in the ''Bad Boys'' films. Mr. Smith's ''Hitch,'' released in 2005, did well overseas, collecting more than half of its $368 million in ticket sales abroad and capping his reputation as a star whose appeal transcends race in some of the most difficult markets. In fact, Mr. Smith's earlier success had pointed the way for contemporary black stars when ''Bad Boys'' unexpectedly became an international hit. 
 ''The studio was deathly afraid that an action movie with two African-American movie stars would never travel the world,'' said Teddy Zee, who was an executive at Sony's Columbia unit when it made ''Bad Boys'' and was later among the producers of Mr. Smith's ''Hitch'' and ''The Pursuit of Happyness.'' ''Efforts to sell it off failed. Columbia was stuck with international. But it did so well.''
 Today Hollywood no longer considers international marketing an afterthought. Executives who deal with international markets said that major studios had quietly fostered an openness in Europe and Asia by investing heavily in the promotion of a small number of black stars, particularly Mr. Smith and Mr. Washington, who often play roles that might easily have been cast with a Brad Pitt or a Russell Crowe.
 Mr. Washington and his ''Deja Vu'' co-star Paula Patton, for instance, traveled abroad and did extensive promotional work by satellite and with visiting reporters as part of a Walt Disney Company-sponsored push that appears likely to yield as much as $115 million in international ticket sales, or around 64 percent of the film's expected worldwide total, said Mark Zoradi, president of the Walt Disney motion pictures group.
 The shifting economics of the movie business are the main reason for this change. International sources now account for more than half of studios' revenue. According to figures compiled by Kagan Research, American companies last year got 52 percent of about $48.2 billion in revenue from foreign sources, a share that has been expanding in recent years after hovering in the 40 percent range. 
 After five weeks in several international markets, ''Dreamgirls'' has taken in only about $28 million abroad, or roughly 22 percent of its total ticket sales, according to reported figures. But the film recently opened at No. 1 in a key market, Japan, displacing Mr. Smith's ''Pursuit of Happyness'' (from Sony Pictures Entertainment) and putting two films with black stars atop the box office in a largely monoracial country that had has not always been easy for African-American performers.
 According to Rob Moore, Paramount's president for worldwide marketing, distribution and home entertainment, ''Dreamgirls'' appears likely to wind up with about $60 million in foreign ticket sales, or roughly 38 percent of its expected total, compared with about 44 percent for ''Chicago,'' a similarly high-profile musical released four years ago with a mostly white cast.
 Historically, Mr. Moore said, an African-American cast has tended ''to accentuate whatever weaknesses'' a picture had in a foreign market. Thus a territory that was tough for comedy was even tougher for a comedy with black stars. To promote ''Dreamgirls,'' he said, the studio had its principals travel to countries where musicals do well, including Japan.
 According to Don T. Nakanishi, director of the Asian American Studies Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, Mr. Smith's persistent presence abroad, combined with the prominence of Condoleezza Rice, Colin L. Powell and a handful of other prominent black Americans, has worked genuine change in Japan. 
 ''They're developing a more nuanced view of America and an appreciation of multiracial societies,'' Professor Nakanishi said.
 Still, many black stars have continued to see their work slighted abroad, and that inability to conquer such markets can be the difference between landing a coveted role or not. In the past two years, according to the Boxofficemojo figures, ''Hustle & Flow,'' starring Terrence Howard, did only about 6 percent of its box-office business abroad; ''Are We There Yet?,'' with Ice Cube, did about 16 percent; and ''Last Holiday,'' with Queen Latifah, did 11 percent, despite its setting in a European mountain resort. 
 ''For an international audience, when it looks like an urban movie with an African-American star in the lead, they just turn it off, and I find that incredibly discouraging,'' said Chris McGurk, the chief executive of Overture Films. Mr. McGurk was vice chairman of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Company when it released the two ''Barbershop'' films, starring Ice Cube, to big business with both black and white audiences at home. They earned virtually nothing abroad.
 In Mr. Hudlin's view, the international record of films with black leads would be better if companies extended more backing to stars beyond the top two or three. ''Look at the success of Jimi Hendrix, Bob Marley, all those black artists,'' he said. ''They do great globally. But when it comes to film and TV, there's this huge barrier. I don't believe it. It doesn't make any sense.''

HEADLINE: WALL ST. TUMBLE ADDS TO WORRIES ABOUT ECONOMIES

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS and JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Stock markets around the world plummeted yesterday in a wave of selling set off by a plunge in China that was reinforced by worries of weakening economies. The falling prices continued in early Asian trading today, but by midday the Chinese market seemed to be stabilizing.
 While China was the first market to tumble, it was not clear what set off the selling. But once it began, it spread first to other Asian countries, then to Europe and the United States.
 ''It was sort of one of those days where somebody snaps their fingers, and the market's hypnotic trance is over,'' said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist of PNC Financial.
 In China, where the stock market had been soaring, the government had warned banks about improper loans to finance stock speculation. 
 In America, the selling seemed to add to worries that a decline in the housing market, and problems in particular with loans to risky borrowers, could spill over. And a report yesterday indicating that orders for durable goods -- items like washing machines and computers -- were surprisingly weak in January revived doubts about the strength of the American economy. 
 Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, in a speech transmitted to a business conference in Hong Kong on Monday, said that he could not rule out a recession in the United States later this year. In so doing, he seemed to distance himself from Ben S. Bernanke, the current Fed chairman, who has been much more upbeat.
 Noting that global markets have been strong for years, Mr. Hoffman said: ''We've had this 'What me worry?' mentality. And this is a little bit of a wake-up call.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 546 points yesterday afternoon, before closing down 416.02 points, or 3.29 percent. In percentage terms, it was the worst day for the market since March 2003. In terms of points, it was the steepest slide since the first day the market resumed trading after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the benchmark index for many investors, slid 3.47 percent, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 3.86 percent. All three major indexes erased their gains for the year.
 The sell-off left almost every major stock lower, including all 30 stocks in the Dow industrials and all but two in the S.& P. 500 and one in the Nasdaq 100. As the 4 p.m. closing bell finally rang at the New York Stock Exchange, traders on the floor erupted with hearty boos.
 At the close, said Howard Silverblatt, an index analyst with Standard & Poor's, the S.& P. 500 had lost $452 billion in market value, and other American stocks had shed an additional $180 billion.
 After steady declines in all markets, panic seemed to hit the American market just before 3 p.m., perhaps caused by sell programs that went off at 2:52 p.m., when the S.& P. 500 fell to the point where it was down 3 percent for the day. Within 10 minutes, it had fallen to its low for the day, down 4.3 percent. It ended with a loss of 3.5 percent.
 Investors once took such big falls in stride, but in recent years no such thing has happened as volatility has largely evaporated from the market.
 There were some technological problems yesterday. Dow Jones, which calculates the Dow industrials, said its system fell behind shortly before 3 p.m., and that a big fall was shown when the backup system came on. But Standard & Poor's, which calculates the S.& P. 500, said it knew of no similar problems with its calculations.
 Despite the tumble, the Dow is down only 4.4 percent from its record high reached last week. And the sell-off was not severe enough to set off any of the circuit breakers the New York Stock Exchange has put in place to help minimize big losses.
 One sign of the nature of the sell-off was what went up. United States Treasury prices soared, and yields fell, as some investors sought safety. 
 ''Treasuries rally, the stock market sells,'' said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist for Lehman Brothers. ''It's kind of a classic risk-aversion reaction.''
 If the rout in the markets is sustained, it will be the first major test for Mr. Bernanke. Two weeks ago, he said the Fed saw inflation as a greater threat than economic weakness.
 ''You've got a certain cavalierness about market-driven economic signals from the new academic-driven Fed,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG, an advisory firm.
 Mr. Barbera said that Mr. Greenspan gave more attention to market indicators than Mr. Bernanke has.
 The selling yesterday began in Shanghai, which had hit a record on Monday. But in tumultuous trading yesterday, the Shanghai composite index plunged nearly 9 percent. 
 Stephen Green, a senior economist and stock market analyst working in Shanghai for Standard Chartered Bank, said the market fundamentals had not changed drastically in recent weeks, adding that the stock markets in China tended to be volatile, particularly after reaching record highs. 
 ''People are just on edge,'' he said. ''It's very possible in two weeks we'll be right back up there.''
 The sell-off in China started a few hours before an explosion was reported at an American base in Afghanistan. It killed several people but did not injure Vice President Dick Cheney, who was inside the base at the time.
 Chinese markets stabilized in Wednesday morning trading, with the main Shanghai market index up a quarter of a percent and the main Shenzhen market index up 4 hundredths of a percent. 
 Other Asian markets -- Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines and Indonesia -- which had all shrugged off Tuesday's decline in Shanghai, dropped sharply on Wednesday morning in response to the heavy selling in Europe and New York. 
 The Topix index in Tokyo fell 3.45 percent on Wednesday morning while the Hang Seng Index fell 3.37 percent in Hong Kong. 
 Of Tuesday's trading, Mr. Barbera of ITG said, ''People are unwinding the carry trade.'' In that trade, which has been very popular with hedge funds, traders borrowed yen, at very low interest rates, and then invested the money in assets in other countries. 
 ''Now you try to get closer to shore,'' said Mr. Barbera, saying that traders had sold investments and used the proceeds to repay their yen borrowings.

HEADLINE: Deal in Albany Overhauls Pay For Worker Aid

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE and N. R. KLEINFIELD; Danny Hakim contributed reporting.

 BODY:
After years of stalemates and false starts, New York leaders yesterday announced a far-reaching deal to overhaul the state's much-criticized workers' compensation system by significantly increasing the weekly benefits that go to injured workers while cracking down on employers who cheat the system. 
 Gov. Eliot Spitzer hailed the deal, reached with legislative, business and labor leaders, as an important improvement to the business climate in the state. Many companies have complained that the cost of workers' compensation insurance has grown too high, and some manufacturers said they were paying more than $2 per hour per worker in premiums.
 Lawmakers have long described the workers' compensation system in New York as an unfathomable mess, with insurance premiums that are among the nation's highest even while worker benefits are very low. The maximum weekly benefit an injured worker can receive is $400, an amount that has not been increased for 15 years even as injured workers complained that it relegated them to a life of poverty. Under the deal, the maximum benefit will rise to $650 by 2010. 
 The announcement represented a significant achievement for the new governor whose predecessor, George E. Pataki, repeatedly failed to revamp a system that some companies said had been an impetus for leaving the state. For Mr. Spitzer, the deal was particularly sweet, coming after a stormy first two months in office during which he has often battled with the Legislature. [News analysis, Page B6.]
 Mr. Spitzer was willing to bring more parties into the negotiations than Mr. Pataki had, and made some concessions that his predecessor had balked at.
 ''This is a remarkable win-win situation for both workers and employers,'' Mr. Spitzer said at an Albany news conference. ''The whole system has become ossified and unresponsive and despite the dissatisfaction with which it is viewed by all sides, gridlock has prevailed until today.'' 
 Workers' compensation experts said it remained unclear how many of the system's numerous failings the deal would solve. Among the concerns are the delays that workers encounter before receiving benefits in bitterly contested cases, and the tendency of some doctors to tilt their diagnoses in workers' cases to please those who hire them.
 The deal, which would affect the state's 8.6 million workers, aims to cut costs by limiting the number of years that some injured workers receive weekly benefits and by creating a fee schedule for drugs, lab tests and prosthetic devices used in workers' compensation cases. Mr. Spitzer's aides said the deal would save more than $500 million a year, yielding a cut of 10 percent to 15 percent in workers' compensation premiums. 
 The agreement came after six days of intense talks with representatives of the governor, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno, the state A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the Business Council of New York. Given the support from both legislative leaders and the governor, the agreed-upon reforms are almost certain to become law.
 Kenneth Adams, the Business Council's president, called the deal ''a big win for improving our economic climate, especially upstate.'' 
 But some workers' compensation experts voiced skepticism that the savings would be as great as advertised and others voiced concern that some seriously disabled workers would suffer.
 Each year about 150,000 workers in New York file claims for workers' compensation, a system that provides medical benefits and replacement wages for those who are injured or become ill while on the job. The system was set up in 1914 as a no-fault insurance system, intended to protect workers while shielding employers from the consequences of potentially crippling lawsuits. Nonetheless it has evolved into a highly litigious arena as insurance carriers often challenge workers' claims.
 The maximum weekly benefit of $400 is less than 40 percent of the average weekly earnings in the state. The traditional goal of the workers' compensation system is to replace two-thirds of a worker's pre-injury earnings.
 Under the deal, maximum weekly benefits would increase to $500 next year, $600 in 2009, $650 in 2010 and the following year to two-thirds of the average weekly earnings. 
 New York officials say the average weekly pay in the state is just more than $1,000, while the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics says it is around $1,200.
 After 2012, the maximum weekly benefit would increase each year, indexed to two-thirds of the average weekly wage. Under the deal, the minimum weekly benefit, currently $40, would jump to $100. ''It's a great deal,'' said Denis M. Hughes, president of the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''It makes some historical changes that we've tried to do for a long time. It gives us the benefit increases that we've been seeking.''
 To reduce fraud, the deal calls for prohibiting employers that cheat the system -- by, for example, underreporting the size of their work force to reduce their insurance premiums -- from receiving state and municipal contracts for five years. The deal would also authorize state officials to stop construction projects or other operations that do not have coverage for all employees. It makes it a felony to intentionally misclassify employees as independent contractors.
 The antifraud squad within the Workers' Compensation Board, the state panel that administers the system, would also double in size.
 In recent years, business groups have pressed to revamp one provision in particular, which allows some workers with partial disabilities, like a back injury, to receive weekly benefits until retirement age. Insisting that these ''permanent'' benefits inflate costs and insurance premiums, the groups urged Mr. Pataki and then Mr. Spitzer to copy other states that have capped the number of years that workers can receive such benefits.
 In yesterday's proposed overhaul, such caps would be installed. Workers classified as permanent partially disabled would be limited to 225 weeks to 525 weeks of weekly benefits depending on the severity of their injuries. The Business Council estimated that the average permanent, partial claimant would receive 344 weeks of benefits. They would continue to receive lifelong medical benefits, however.
 Business lobbyists say capping the duration of benefits will give injured workers greater incentive to pursue rehabilitation and retraining and to return to work. But some experts on workers' compensation fear that many badly injured workers would not be able to find a job once their benefits end, and would grow desperate, perhaps turning to welfare.
 ''The part that concerns me is that the people who have very long duration disabilities are the ones who really need workers' compensation the most,'' said Les Boden, an economist at Boston University School of Public Health who has studied workers' compensation benefits.
 At the behest of the A.F.L.-C.I.O, the deal aims to protect permanent, partial claimants through several measures. These claimants, for example, would be allowed to apply for extra weeks of benefits if they could not find a job and faced economic distress. Furthermore, the deal proposes to make it easier for permanent, partially disabled workers to be classified as totally disabled. 
 Peter Pope, the governor's director of policy, estimated that the proposed limits on the duration of benefits would yield savings of $500 million a year, even with the higher maximums. 
 He estimated that antifraud measures would save $60 million to $114 million a year -- since employers that cheat the systems by not paying their proper share of premiums force other employers to pay more. Mr. Pope said state analysts project the fee schedule for pharmaceuticals, tests and equipment would save another $120 million a year.
 As an additional step in the process, the Spitzer administration will work with insurance carriers to ensure the savings result in lower premiums for businesses, Mr. Pope said.
 Under the agreement, employers would receive a discount on their workers' compensation premiums if they adopt special safety training programs or other offerings that help rehabilitate employees.
 With many claimants complaining about lengthy delays in receiving benefits, the deal calls for a ''rocket docket'' to ensure many important decisions within 90 days. Insurance carriers also would be prohibited from challenging doctors' recommendations for medical tests and radiology that cost less than $1000 or that comply with a list of accepted, best medical practices. The previous threshold was $500. 
 ''Governor Spitzer deserves a lot of credit for bringing together disparate groups and leaders to agree on a truly significant workers' compensation reform package, said James N. Tedisco, the Republican leader in the Assembly. ''The outdated system had long been an impediment to job creation and economic growth.''

HEADLINE: Daley Easily Wins Re-election, Nearing a Record in Chicago

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
Mayor Richard M. Daley won a landslide victory over two relatively obscure challengers here Tuesday, putting him in a position to become the city's longest serving mayor.
 With 87 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr. Daley had captured 72 percent of the vote, well over the 50 percent needed to avoid a runoff.
''Thank you, Chicago, thank you again,'' Mr. Daley told a boisterous crowd in a Hilton Hotel ballroom. 
 He added, ''We must continue to work together and put aside any personal or political differences to keep Chicago moving forward on behalf of all the people of our great city.''
 Mr. Daley's victory came despite a short and lackluster campaign, the loss of traditional support from organized labor and his place at the center of a ballooning federal inquiry into the administration's hiring practices. Mr. Daley, a Democrat, has not been accused of any crime, but some of his top aides have been indicted.
 Despite those challenges -- any of which might have meant defeat for a less powerful incumbent -- if Mr. Daley, 64, serves a full term, he will surpass by a year the 21 years his father, Richard J. Daley, had in office.
 Some political observers expect this to be Mr. Daley's last term. But they do not expect to see a lame duck. As his lack of strong competition showed, Mr. Daley's power remains largely unquestioned.
 ''The day after the election is going to be the same as the day before the election,'' said Don Rose, a political consultant here. ''There's no pressure in any direction. He really doesn't have any significant opposition on the City Council or from the media, so he can go on doing what he's doing.''
 Mr. Daley's critics in organized labor and among more independent-minded Democrats thought they had an opportunity this election to chip away at some of his power, given the hiring scandals and his decision last year to veto an ordinance that would have imposed minimum wage regulations on stores like Wal-Mart.
 They made some progress. For instance, in the Seventh Ward, a battleground area of the South Side, Sandi S. Jackson defeated the incumbent, Darcel A. Beavers, the daughter of the former alderman, and longtime Daley ally.
 Ms. Jackson is married to Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr., a son of the Rev. Jesse Jackson and a longtime Daley foe. As recently as November, Mr. Jackson was considered a serious potential challenger to Mr. Daley. But after the Democrats won control of Congress, he decided against a run for mayor.
 Unlike Chicago, many other big cities have mayoral term limits, preventing the sort of political domination that Mr. Daley has accomplished over his 18 years in office. 
 The father-son Daley dynasty has done more to shape the modern political history and physical landscape of Chicago, the nation's third-largest city, with its diversified economy and glittering downtown, than perhaps any other force. 
 While Mr. Daley brags about Chicago as though it is his personal possession, he has played down that legacy. Even Tuesday, he refused to make comparisons with his father.
 ''I'll compare my city to any city in America right now,'' Mr. Daley said, citing safe neighborhoods and new libraries and parks.
 ''You don't run for office just to be there and say, 'I beat a record,' '' he added, seeming a little testy. ''You really want to accomplish things.''
 Minutes earlier, when Mr. Daley arrived at Old St. Mary's Catholic Church on the South Side to cast his vote, he seemed relaxed and unconcerned about the election. 
 There was no last-minute rallying of the troops. No visible excitement or nervousness. And no entourage. 
 During the campaign, Mr. Daley hardly acknowledged his opponents, Dorothy Brown, the clerk of the Cook County Circuit Court, and William Walls, a former aide to Harold Washington, the city's first elected black mayor. There were no debates. 
 After Mr. Daley voted, a reporter asked what grade he would give himself as mayor so far.
 ''You don't give grades,'' he said. ''Grades are only given on Election Day.''

HEADLINE: Qaeda Rebuilding in Pakistan, Intelligence Chief Tells Panel

BYLINE: By MARK MAZZETTI

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
The new director of national intelligence told members of Congress on Tuesday that senior leaders of Al Qaeda were steadily rebuilding the network's bases inside Pakistan and that future attacks against the United States could be planned from Pakistan's remote western mountains.
 In his first testimony since taking office last month, Mike McConnell said Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, were supervising the establishment of Qaeda camps in Pakistan similar to those that existed in Afghanistan before the Sept. 11 attacks, although he said the camps were not as fully developed as the former Afghan bases. 
Mr. McConnell's appearance before the Senate Armed Services Committee followed a succession of meetings between top American officials and Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who officials in Washington have said was not doing enough to root out Islamist militants in Pakistan's tribal areas.
 ''It's something we're very worried about and very concerned about,'' Mr. McConnell said. 
 Intelligence and counterterrorism officials, speaking anonymously, have spoken in the past several weeks about the new camps in Pakistan and the gradual rebuilding of Al Qaeda's command and control apparatus, but Mr. McConnell is the most senior official in Washington to describe in public what he called a growing problem. 
 A day earlier, the White House spokesman, Tony Snow, sidestepped questions about whether the White House was unhappy with General Musharraf's government and reaffirmed President Bush's confidence in the Pakistani president.
 The top intelligence officials assembled before the Senate panel on Tuesday issued a blunter assessment.
 ''We believe they could do more,'' said Mr. McConnell, who suggested that General Musharraf could have had his eye on elections later this year when he pledged to keep Pakistani troops from carrying out military operations in the tribal areas.
 Sitting beside Mr. McConnell, Lt. Gen. Michael D. Maples, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, described the border region as a ''haven for Al Qaeda's leadership.'' It is from that area, Mr. McConnell said, that any future attacks against the United States by Al Qaeda would most likely be planned. 
 General Musharraf has said repeatedly that he has done everything in his power to root out Taliban and Qaeda militants, but lawmakers were skeptical. 
 ''Long-term prospects for eliminating the Taliban threat appear dim so long as the sanctuary remains in Pakistan, and there are no encouraging signs that Pakistan is eliminating it,'' said the committee's chairman, Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan. 
 The rebuilding of the Qaeda infrastructure in Pakistan has forced a debate within the Bush administration about how hard to press General Musharraf, and some officials have even advocated direct American airstrikes against the camps.
 Administration officials said that for now the White House had ruled out any unilateral American military actions in Pakistan. Vice President Dick Cheney was said to have warned the Pakistani president during their meeting on Monday in Islamabad that Democratic members of Congress could move to cut military aid to Pakistan unless its government took stronger action against Islamist militants in the tribal areas. 
 The testimony before the Senate panel was intended to give lawmakers American intelligence officials' assessment of global threats. Speaking about Iraq, the officials were cautiously optimistic that the current plan to crack down on militants in Baghdad could succeed, but added that much of the plan's success would depend on the performance of the Iraqi troops. 
 General Maples said that two of the three Iraqi brigades designated to support the security plan had moved into Baghdad, but he said that estimates he had seen indicated that the brigades were at only 43 percent to 82 percent of their intended troop strength. 
 Discussing the state of Iran's nuclear program, Mr. McConnell reaffirmed the assessment of American intelligence agencies that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon by the beginning of the next decade, but that the country more likely would not have such a weapon until 2015. 
 But Mr. McConnell said tough economic sanctions against Tehran could have a ''dramatic'' impact in getting Iran to abandon its nuclear program.
